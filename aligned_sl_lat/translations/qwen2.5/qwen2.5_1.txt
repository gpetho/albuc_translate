After I completed for you, my Sons, this book, which is the last in science within medicine with its complement, and reached the end thereof from his explanations and his own declarations, it seemed fitting to me to complete it for you together with this Treatise which is a part of operation, that is, surgery by hand.
Since the operation with an extended hand lies in our region and time, and was completely private until perhaps the science of it perished and its trace was cut off: and there remained from it nothing but precise descriptions in ancient books, which were altered by hands: and they fell into error and hesitation until their intentions were closed and his power stretched out: It seemed fitting to me to vivify it with the arrangement of this Treatise within it according to the way of position and declaration and abbreviation: and to provide forgiveness with the forms of the cautery tools and other instruments of the operation: which is done by addition of its declaration and hastening what is necessary.
The reason why a good artisan with his hand is not found in our time is: because the art of medicine is long, and it is necessary for its author to exercise himself in the science of anatomy before that which Galen narrated, until he knows the nourishment of the members, their forms, their conjunctions, and separations, and has knowledge of bones, nerves, sinews, their numbers, their exit, and veins, their pulsatile and quiet states, and the places of their exits.
And for that reason, Hippocrates said, that the name with a title is much, and with an act is little, and especially in the art of the hand.
We have indeed already spoken of that in the introduction to this book.
Since he who is not knowledgeable of what we have said about anatomy will not be profited, but will rather fall into error, as men are killed thereby: as I have seen many among those who are trained in this science and boast of it without knowledge and without experience.
Because I have seen a stupid physician cut into a scrofulous boil on a woman's neck, and he severed certain arteries in the neck: wherefore the woman's blood flowed until she died in his hands.
And I have seen another physician who attempted to extract a stone from a man who had it at an advanced age, and the stone was large.
Therefore he reached for it and extracted it along with a fragment of the bladder.
Wherefore the man died on the third day.
And I myself had indeed been called to extract it: and I saw from the size of the stone and the condition of the patient that he would die.
And I have seen another physician who received payment from a Duke of our land for his medical services: and it happened that a black eunuch, who was with him, sustained a fracture in his thigh near the heel: and the physician, out of his ignorance, hastened and bound the fracture over the wound with bandages and strong ligatures, and did not release the wound from its constriction.
Then he discharged him according to his desires.
Then he discharged him after a few days, and commanded him not to release the bandages: and he remained thus until the boil on his thigh and foot developed, and he came to his demise.
I was therefore called to him, and hastened to release the ligament; and there ensued tranquility, and he escaped from his pains.
Verily the corruption was already confirmed in the member: and I could not restrain it.
Therefore the corruption ceased to wander through the member, until it perished.
And I saw another physician who pierced the cancerous abscess: and it became ulcerated after a few days, until the evil increased with its lord.
For when the cancer is pure from the black bile, then it is not proper to reach it with iron at all, unless it be in a member that can tolerate its being cut away entirely.
And for this reason, my Son, you must know that the operation with the hand is divided into two parts: namely, the operation which is associated with safety; and the operation from which danger arises in many dispositions. And I have already excited in every place of this book where the operation comes which is accompanied by terror and fear.
Therefore you must beware of it and dismiss it, so that the foolish may not find a way to speak about it and dishonour it.
Therefore receive the measure with solicitude and protection, and your infirm ones with facility and firmness, and use the better way conducted by the grace of God for salvation and a worthy succession: and dismiss terrifying illnesses difficult to cure: and lift your souls from that which makes you fear, that hesitation may not enter upon you in your faith and welfare. For it is more conducive to your glory, and higher in this world, and finally to your quantities.
Galenus has already said this in some of his admonitions. Do not treat evil diseases: lest you be called evil physicians.

Part I.
On the Advantage and Harm of the Cautery: for which temperaments it is suitable, and at what time: whether to be performed with iron or gold.
Head I.
But Firstly Before I remind you of the operation with him, I must say what his horses are like, and what injuries he causes: and in which temperament he is exhibited.
I say that the discourse concerning the quality of Cauterius' horses and his injuries is a lengthy and subtle science, a secret and hidden matter.
And many wise men spoke on this matter, and disagreed. And I find their words insufficient for me, fearing the lengthening of the discourse.
I say that Cauterius acts universally on all temperaments, whether they are with matter or without matter: excepting two temperaments, which are the hot temperament without matter, and the dry temperament without matter.
In the hot and dry temperament with matter, they disagreed.
For some said that Cauterius is beneficial in the hot and dry temperament with matter.
And others said the contrary, namely that Cauterius is not suitable in illness arising from heat and dryness: for the nature of fire is heat: and it is不适宜的，用干热和干热来治愈由干热引起的疾病。
And he who says the contrary said that by means of Cauterius, benefit is derived in every hot and dry illness that occurs in human bodies: for when you compare the human body and its humours to the temperament of fire, you find the human body to be cold.
And I indeed say by his word: because from experience he has shown me that this is so oftentimes.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitioultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in seipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.
From the other complexions there is no fear for you: and especially in cold and moist diseases. For all physicians have agreed upon them: and they did not dissent from the use of cauterization in these diseases.
And you know, my sons, that from the secret of cure through cauterization with fire, and the excellence of cauterization with burning medicine, it is clear: for fire is simple, its action reaching only to the part cauterized, and it does not harm another connected part unless to a very small degree.
And the action of burning medicine reaches that which is detached from the limbs: and perhaps it causes disease in another limb that is difficult to cure, and perhaps it kills.
But fire, because of its subtlety and the goodness of its substance, does not cause it unless there is excess.
And we have come to know this through experience, because of the length of service and study with the art, and the position above the truth of things: and for this reason we are brief in our discourse.
And know, my children, that they differ in the time at which it is proper to make a cautery, and prefer the true time.
And I say that a cautery is proper at all times: for harm occurring due to timing is overcome by the benefit drawn with the cautery.
And especially if the cautery is due to pains from necessary, strong, and rapid pains that do not tolerate delay: for fear is had that some greater harm may occur, which would be more detrimental than the minor harm caused by waiting.
And let it not enter your minds, my children, that which they do not consider, except the common and stupid doctors, namely, that the disease cured by cautery is not always subject to recurrence: and they put forth this consequence, and things are not as they imagine: for cautery is used only in place of medicine which alters the complexion and dries up the humors which are the causes of pain.
Yet the cautery surpasses medicine through its speed of action and the strength of its operation and the vehemence of its dominion: and it is possible that the disease returns at some hour of time according to the condition of the patient, the state of his illness, and its strength: and what is prepared in his body from the aggregation of excesses within him: and what reaches him in acquiring it from food and similar causes, unless the disease arises in which cautery is administered. A disease subtle in member of few superfluities and humours, like the cautery of a tooth, on account of pain, and similar to that, it is possible for that pain not to return therein.
But this happens in few.
But the speech of the common people again is that the cautery is the last medicine: this is a correct speech: not what they intend in it: for they believe that it is not a cure which can compare with medicine nor with other things after the occasion of the cautery.
But the truth is contrary to that and their intent, for the cautery is the last remedy in medicine, not unless when we administer means of cure in some disease and they do not effect those remedies: then at the end we administer the cautery and it does effect: thus falls the conclusion that the cautery is the last remedy in medicine, not according to the intent which the common people and many quacks understand.
Ancient authors said that the cautery with gold is better than the cautery with iron: and they did not say this except for the equality of gold and the sublimity of its substance: and they said that the place does not become pus from the cautery. Indeed, this is not absolutely true: for I have already tested it and found that it does not do this in some bodies without others.
And the cautery with gold is good and better than with iron, as they said.
Indeed, when you apply the cautery with fire to gold, you do not see clearly when it is ignited according to the quantity you want, because of the rust of the gold: and when it approaches the cold, and if you add ignition to it again, it melts in the fire and turns into sheets.
Wherefore the artisan falls into occupation: and for that reason a cautery with iron is made for us more swiftly and nearer at hand, from the straightness for the operation.
And I have indeed arranged this Chapter on the Cautery according to chapters: and I have ordered them from head to foot: so that he who seeks may obtain what he wishes from it. ¶ Concerning the Method of Cauterizing the Coronary Commisurosis.
Chapter II.
This cautery treatment concerns the dominance of humidity and cold over the brain: these two causes produce excessive fluid in the eyes and ears, excessive sleep, tooth pain, throat pain, and generally all illnesses caused by cold, such as paralysis, soreness, epilepsy, apoplexy, and similar conditions.
The method of cauterization is to apply it to the sick: let the head be cleansed first with a purgative medicine for three nights, or four, according to the strength of the patient, and their age, and their habits.
Then order him to shave his head with a razor.
Then make him sit between your hands in a square posture, so that his hands are placed on his chest.
Then place the root of your palm on the root of his nose between his eyes. Whereupon therefore your middle finger shall mark that place with the cautery. Then the Olive Cautery with Fire: of which this is the form. Then place it over the marked spot with the ignited instrument, using the descent by which your hand is gradually guided, and you rotate it.
Then lift your hand quickly, and examine the spot.
If you see that the quantity of the head of alkali or the quantity of zyvherb has already been detected from the bone, then lift your hand.
And if not, repeat the action with the instrument itself, or with another one if the first has cooled down: until the bones, which I have told you about, are seen.
Then take something from the salt, dissolve it in water, and soak the cloth in it. Place it over the spot, and leave it there for three days.
Then place the wet cloth over butter, and leave it over the spot until the burn eschar is destroyed. Then treat it with tetrapharmacum ointment until it heals.
They have said that the more an injury remains open, the more pus it emits; therefore, it is better and more beneficial.
And some of them said that the skin should be cauterized down to the bone: and the cauterizing instrument should be held until something of thickness of bone is burned through.
Then the burned tissue from the bone is removed, and it is treated thereafter.
And others say that with the cautery one should arrive at the ultimate point until it impresses in the mouth a form like that of a kirate: or an instrument which women place infused with small alphabet: and they believe that vapors from the head are exhaled from this place, and the open wound may be closed over a long period.
Then it should be treated until it is consolidated.
But to me these two species of cautery do not appear entirely so except in some persons according to the way of fear.
And to remove it, it is better for me with the health of the person.
For the head is weakened by the disruption of its natural continuity: as we have testified in other limbs. And particularly when the head is naturally weak and infirm. Indeed, the first species of cautery is more safe and better for me, and I use it. Therefore, to operate with it is for the health.
¶ Concerning the manner of cauterizing the head when there is pain throughout the head.
Head III.
When chronic pain occurs throughout the head and persists in the patient, he uses mercury, cochineal, purgatives of the head, oils, and plasters.
And especially if it has already been cauterized with the cautery we have described, and none of those things are applied to it, then consider.
For if the head of the patient is strong by nature and not weak, and he finds intense cold: then cauterize with another cautery beneath it lightly.
Then cauterize it over every horn of the head with a cauterization, and let not the skin pass through, and let the quantity covered from the bone be as we have narrated.
And cauterize it with one cauterization at the back of its head, at a place called vas: and this is the place where the suction cup is put: raise its mature part in this, and do not uncover the bone.
For the sick one finds pain due to this, a severe pain different from the pain of other cauterizations of the heads of all.
And I will say this cauterization in its place: and it must be a cauterization with which the horns of the head are cauterized, and the back of its head should be cauterized more finely with a finer cauterization, with which the middle of the head is cauterized.
And this is its form.
¶ Concerning the manner of cauterizing in hemicrania, both with burned medicine and with iron.
Chapter IV.
When pain and soda occur in part of the head, or the pain extends to the eye, and the head is evacuated with cleansing medicines, and the remaining treatment is administered as I said in the divisions of diseases, and it does not produce all that result: then cauterization should be performed in two modes: either with burning sharp medicine: or with iron. The cauterization with sharp burning medicine is as follows: take one tooth of garlic, peel it, and cut its ends from both sides.
Then cut the place of pain at the time of a broad bloodletting, until a spot beneath the skin is made from which the tooth is taken.
Therefore, introduce it beneath the skin until it is hidden: then tie it with a suitable ligature above it, and release it after fifteen hours, then remove the onion, and let the pulvilus be for two days or three: afterwards place upon it a cloth submerged in butter until the spot produces pus: then treat it with ointment until it heals.
And if you wish to do this with certain burning medicines, which I wrote about in the twelfth treatise, On Burning Medicines.
Cauterization of it with iron is to be done in this manner.
Cauterization with Fire, whose form is this.
And it is called Clavilis: for the shape of its head is like that of a nail, with a round bulge at the top and a small prominence in the middle.
Then place it over the spot and hold your hand there: and turn the iron slowly with velocity, and let the amount that is burned be according to the thickness of the skin, as its half.
And lift your hand so that the artery below is not burned, and no loss of blood occurs.
Then immerse the cloth in salt water, and place it over the spot, and leave it for three days. Then place the cloth in butter, and treat with ointment until it heals. And if you wish, cauterize this headache with the extremity of the second surgical implement of the Cauterizer.
And beware of incising the artery in this headache, not an old one properly.
¶ Concerning the manner of cauterizing in an old headache.
V.
When you cure a headache, follow what we have said from the previous cure and what we have said in the divisions of diseases. And if the treatment is not effective: and you see from the disease that what we said with the first cauterization and medicine, or with the cauterization with fire, is not sufficient for him, then you must cauterize with the surgical implement until it whitens after you mark the place of pain with a line whose length is the middle of a finger, or as much as that. And withdraw your hand once, and press it until you incise the artery, and reach up to the mouth. However, you must beware of the continuity of the jaw, which moves during chewing, so that the side or the nerve that moves it is not burned, lest a spasm occur.
And be mindful of the care and precaution regarding the flow of blood in the artery that has been cut.
For there is fear in its cutting, and especially for one who does not know what he is doing and is neither diligent nor experienced: and he should abandon the operation at first.
And I will excuse myself with the reminder of the regimen for managing the flow of blood that occurs from the artery according to its proper mode and in its place in this book.
If you see from the illness that it does not suffice him this cautery, and you see the body of the sick person bearing the cautery in the middle of the head, as we have narrated, care for the wound until it is healed.
And if you wish, administer the cautery which we have mentioned in the chapter of extracting the artery with a cautery having two knives.
For this cautery is better and more effective. ¶ Concerning the manner of cauterizing for pain in the ear.
Chapter VI. When pain occurs in the ear from cold, and it is treated with solutiles and the other treatment as we have said in the division, and the pain does not cease, then use cautery with fire: and this is called Punctum, whose form is as follows.
Then prick the area with it after its cautery around the entire circumference of the ear, as it is revolved: or around both sides if the pain is in both ears.
And move the cautery from the root of the ear slightly after marking the places with encaustic: and let the quantity of the cautery be ten pricks in each ear, and as that.
Then care for the places until they are healed.
¶ Concerning the manner of cauterizing for Tortura.
Chapter VII.
Tortura which is treated with cauteration is not anything other than species that occur from phlegm, as we have said in the divisions of diseases. And the application of cauterization for a species that occurs from drying out and nerve spasm.
When you treat this species of torture with fumes from hyssop, and head purges, and gargles, and if the cure does not result from your treatment, then it is necessary to cauterize the patient with three cautery irons: one at the root of the ear, and the second a little below in its proper place, and the third at the conjunction of the two lips.
And place your cautery on the opposite side of the sick part.
For softening does not occur except in the part which appears healthy.
And the form of cauterization is to apply the cautery to the upper ear extremity beneath the horn of the head slightly: and at another time; whose length shall be according to the length of the thumb.
And remove your hand with the cautery until the thickness of half the skin is burned.
And this is the form of the cautery, and it is a species from the surgical one, the form of which was previously given: yet it should not be slightly more slender than you see: and the knife should be somewhat thicker than necessary. Then treat the place with what preceded until it is healed.
On the manner of cauterizing in Ancient Apoplexy.
Chapter VIII.
When ancient apoplexy has prevailed, and you treat it with what we have said, and if your treatment does not result, and the patient does not have a fever, then cauterize him with four cautery irons over each horn of his head, and one in the middle of his head, as previously stated, and one at the back of his head, according to what has been mentioned: and the manner of cauterization shall be according to what has been stated.
And likewise it is cauterized with a Cautery over the mouth of the stomach: and it is more ultimate.
Then it is to be cured with what has preceded.
¶ Concerning the manner of cauterizing in Oblivion.
Head IX.
It is necessary to give first great hyssop in drink, and brain purifying pills.
Then shave the whole head of the sick person, and apply the plaster described in the treatise on plasters to the back of his head: and apply it several times. This is indeed the measure of the Cautery: and do that likewise according to the order I said before. If therefore it is cured by that, it is good.
If not: then cauterize three times the back part of his head, which shall descend from the upper part of the head to the lower part of the eye: and apply between all cauterizations the thickness of a finger.
Then cauterize with what has preceded.
If, however, you wish an addition and the sick person can tolerate that: then cauterize him in the middle.
If you wish an addition, then cauterize it over the two horns.
Then cure it until it is cured: and let the cauterization be oiled according to the form which was given before.
On the manner of cauterizing in paralysis and softening.
Head X.
It is necessary to proceed with the purification of the head using hyssop, and with what we have said before.
Then scrape the patient's head: thereafter cauterize it with a cauterization in the middle of the head, and with a cauterization over all the horns of the head, and three times over the vertebrae of the neck.
If, however, you need to treat the disease of bodily softening in many places, and the patient is weak but the condition is strong: then cauterize it four times over the vertebrae of the back, and the last one thoroughly until the skin burns as much as possible, and raise your hand.
Then care for it until it is healed: and thus the olive cauterization is performed.
On the manner of cauterizing in epilepsy.
Head XI.
The epileptic is not cauterized, except for those whose epilepsy is caused by phlegm. It is therefore necessary to purify his brain first using hyssop, and with the other treatment we have said in the division: when the patient is severe or tolerates the administration of medicines well.
If, however, it is a child who does not tolerate medicines, then a gargle and chewable brain-purifying substances are administered, along with the improvement of his diet over many days.
Then shave his head, thereafter cauterize it with one cautery in the middle of the head, according to what has preceded concerning the manner: and with another cautery at the back of him, and over all the horns of his head cauterize.
If the patient is strong and can tolerate it, then cauterize him with the cauteries I said for one with paralysis, and soften the body over the spinal columns of the neck and back. And let the cautery be oily according to the manner that has preceded. If, however, the patient is a child, then place a fine cautery according to this manner.
On the manner of cauterizing for melancholia.
Chapter 12.
When the cause of melancholia is corrupted humors and thick phlegm, then cauterize it with the cauteries we have said for one with paralysis.
And if the cause of melancholia is excess decliviens into melancholia, and the body of the patient is wet, then give him to drink what will purify his brain, according to what has preceded in the division. Then shave the patient's head, and make thereafter a tortellam properly made from linen, like a circle.
Then place it in the middle of the head, and let the patient sit with his head held square from all sides.
Then present the ointment. And it is better with old sheep butter.
And heat it over fire with a moderate warming that a digit can tolerate when introduced into it.
Then evacuate it in the middle of his head in a circle, and let it remain until it cools.
Make him take this remedy once every week until he is cured, with the remainder of his regimen remaining good.
Or if you wish, cauterize it by making small punctures in it, and keep your hand with the cautery close at hand; preferably let it smell.
For this type of cauterization moistens the brain with its quality.
Then place above it a cloth soaked in butter or chicken fat.
¶ On the method of cauterizing when water is descending to the eye.
XIII. Caput
When the beginning of the water in the eye is revealed to you through the signs I mentioned in the division, then begin and let him take this remedy, which will cleanse his head.
And keep him from all humidity, and make him sit in a bath for several days of fasting.
Then instruct him to shave his head and cauterize it in the middle of his head. Then cauterize it twice on each temple with two cauterizations, if the beginning of water descending is in both eyes at the same time: or from one side, if the beginning of water is in one eye. And cut all veins and arteries beneath the skin with the cauterization: and let the cauterizations be long in width across the temples: and beware of the flow of blood.
If you see anything from it, then cut it off immediately with whatever medicine is possible: and I pardon with wisdom, which is in the extraction of arteries, and cutting them, and caution against the flow of blood.
And sometimes it is cauterized in the neck, beneath two bones, with two cauteries brought to a conclusion.
¶ Concerning the manner of cauterizing in ancient lacrimal issues.
Chapter XIV.
When the tears of the eyes are ancient and frequent, and are above the veins and arteries which are evident on the exterior of the head, it is verified that this is from excesses of cold and phlegmatic humors: then cauterize with a cautery as I have described at the beginning of the descent of water, in the middle of the head, and with two cauteries over the temples, and with two cauteries in the neck beneath two bones.
And if you find it necessary to add, then cauterize the same on the entire side of the eye, above the extremity of the eyebrow with a small cautery.
¶ Concerning the manner of cauterizing in nasal fetor.
Chapter XV.
When you treat this, along with what we have said in division and not by a complete regimen: then hasten, and give him infirmocochias in the drink for three nights. Then shave his head, and cauterize it with a middle cautery, using an olive oil cautery.
Then cauterize it with a cautery called clavilus, using two cauteries above the eyebrows near the hair.
And guard against the artery, lest you cut it.
And this is the form of the cautery Clauilis.
¶ On the manner of cauterizing in the case of mollification of the eyelid.
Head XVI.
When the eyelid of the eye becomes softened by illness or humidity: then cauterize the eyelid with one cautery, using this lunar cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize it above two eyebrows with a little bit using two cauteries in every part: and let them be spaced from two temporal regions: and the length of all the cautery should be according to the lengths of the eyebrows: and do not end your hand with the cautery at the very ends, but rather according to the amount that is burned on the third eyelid.
And this is the form of the cautery according to this manner of lunar cautery.
¶ On the manner of cauterizing the eyelid when hair grows inward and irritates the eye. Head XVII.
The cautery in this case is according to two modes: either with fire: or with a burning medicine.
In the cautery with fire, first instruct the patient to remove his own hairs, if they are of those that naturally clean themselves, until they grow out and become equal. If they irritate him at their point of growth, then bind his eyes with swabs so that they do not move until they grow out.
When therefore they are born and equated, then place the head of the sick man in your bosom: then mark over the eyelids of his eyes with a cauterizing agent, the mark that is according to the figure of the leaf of myrtle: and let the beginning of the mark be near the hairs.
Then place a soaked cloth in albumen of egg: or in psyllium mucilage over the eye.
Then cauterize with a burner, whose form is this.
Then cauterize according to the figure you marked gradually in succession many times, until the skin surface is burned, which is like the figure of a myrtle leaf, completely visible.
And the sign of health of your work is: that if you see the eyelid of the eye now contract, and hairs rise near the puncture of the eye.
Lift then your hand: and release it for three days.
Then place over it a cloth with butter until the scab is eradicated.
Then attend to it with ointment until it heals.
If any of the hairs return within an hour and the eyelid softens: then iterate the cauterization over that place, as you did at first.
If the hairs are on the lower lid: then cauterize it until they rise to their natural place, and equalize so that the hairs do not irritate the eye.
¶ Method of cauterizing with burning medicine in the same case.
Chapter XVIII.
It is that you instruct the sick person to let his hair grow until it is prolonged and equalled.
Make from paper the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Then take from known soap and unabsorbed ash of each one a weight of an ounce or nearly that: then rub these together well and make them quickly, so that they do not cool.
Then spread it out on the paper you made as the shape of a myrtle leaf, and place it over the eyelid(s) of one or both eyes.
And place under the eye a cloth soaked in white of egg: and the sick person's head be near your body.
And place your index finger on the medicine, and press it slightly.
And you move it whenever the sick person feels the bite of the medicine: for he finds its bite like fire.
While therefore the sick person continues to feel the bite of the medicine, then remove the medicine, and move it with your finger.
When therefore the bite has ceased, then remove the medicine, and wash the eye with water.
And consider then, if you see the eyelid lift, as it does with contraction from fire or incision, it is well: and if not, then apply the medicine again to the same place, where the medicine does not mark or damage, until your operation equals and constricts the eye.
Then apply over it a mixture of cotum and butter until the burned skin is eradicated.
Then treat it with diaphinicon ointment or another, until it is cured.
And you must beware during the operation to use the final safeguard, so that nothing from the medicine falls into the eye.
If the eyelid softens after a few days and something from the hair fights against it in the eye, then apply the medicine to that place which softens from the eyelid properly, just as you did at first.
Then treat it until it is cured.
And this is the form of the myrtle leaf.
And know that human eyes vary in size and shape.
Therefore, according to this, consider it: and the way of righteousness is not hidden from him who has a study in this art.
¶ Concerning the method of cauterizing in lacrimal fistula.
Head XXI.
When you treat a fistula, as we have said in the divisions of diseases, and your treatment is not effective: then, you must cauterize it according to this method.
Instruct the patient to place his head in your lap, and hold his head with a servant between your hands in such a way that it is not moved nor shaken with his body.
Then apply infused cotum in a milky solution or in a psyllium mucilage to his eye: then use a cauterization instrument, the form of which is as follows.
Let it be a concave, as the form of an eagle's feather from one end, with which the cautery is made: and if you wish it to penetrate to the other end, and if you wish it to go up thus try.
Verumtamen hoc concauum est melius ad opus tuum.
Deinde pone tunc super eam Cauterium, quod fit ignitum valde.
Et tene cum eo manum tuam parumper apud Cauterium ab oculo, ad partem nasi, ut non erret manus tua, aut inquietetur infirmus: et ponas Cauterium in adipe oculi, et corrumpas ipsum.
Si ergo peruenis in principium Cauterii tuus usque ad os, erit bene.
Et si non: tunc itera Cauterium semel, aut bis, si indiges illi: et dimitte illud tribus diebus.
Deinde pone cotum cum butyro, et cura ipsum cum unguento exiccativo, donec sanetur. Quod si praeterierint ei quadraginta dies, et non sanatur: tunc pone super ipsum medicinam acutam corrosivam, donec detegatur os: et rade ipsum secundum quod venit in capitulo suo.
And there is another mode of cautery fistula, which some of the first mentioned.
Intend to the place of the fistula, and cut it: then place in the same fissure caumhan subtle, that is, a fine cannula, whose form is this.
And pour into it a quantity of a drachm from melted lead, and hold your hand with a good Cannula for retention, and let the patient not move at all, so that the melted lead does not run or reach his eye.
And you should place on the patient's eye a cloth soaked in white wine, or in water.
For the lead burns the place of the fistula and heals it with a marvelous healing.
For if the fistula is healed, together with what we have said from the cautery and its treatment, it is good.
And if not, then it is necessary to administer a nostril opening, and reduce the fistula to the course of the nose, according to what it will come to its proper place.
¶ Concerning the mode of cautery in fissures of the Lips.
Head XX.
Fissures of the lip, which they call pili, often occur and are especially prevalent in children's lips.
When therefore you treat these fissures, as we have said in the division of ailments, and if the treatment is not sufficient, then prepare a small cautery with fire, according to this form.
And its concavity according to the subtlety of the knife.
Then treat it with a cerate until it heals.
¶ Concerning the method of cautery in oral fistulas.
Head XXI.
When an apostema occurs at the root of the tooth, in the palate, or at the roots of the teeth: it then produces pus and breaks open. Afterwards, it heals over, but the pus reappears and a fistula forms. Then treat the fistula itself, and if no cure is见效，我需要进一步调整方案。请稍等，我将重新评估并提供一个更有效的解决方案。
Then insert the ignited instrument into the opening of the fistula, and hold your hand there until the heated iron reaches the depth and deepest part of it. Do this once or twice.
Then treat it afterwards, using the method we have described until it is cured.
If therefore the pus is removed and it heals, that will be good.
And if not, then it is necessary to discover the location and remove the source of corruption according to what appears at its head.
¶ Concerning the method of cautery for softened gums and teeth.
Head XXII.
When the gums become softened due to humidity, and the teeth are moved, and you treat it with medicines without cautery: then place the sick person's head in your lap.
Then the fire brand, whose form will come after this, so that you place the Cannula over the tooth: and thrust in the ignited Cauterium quickly: and hold your hand somewhat, until the patient feels the heat of the fire has reached the root of the tooth.
And raise your hand: then iterate the Cauterium several times, according to your desire.
Then let the patient fill his mouth with salt water, and hold it for a while: then spit it out.
For the tooth is moved and made firm, the gums softened and tightened, and the corrupted moisture dried up.
Head XXIII.
When the tooth pain is due to cold, either the cold itself is present, or a worm, and no remedy with medicines is effective: then the Cauterium on the tooth is according to two modes: either the Cauterium with butter: or the Cauterium with fire.
The Cauterium with butter is as follows: take fresh butter and boil it in a iron dish or a vessel.
Then take cotton and wrap it around the end of the probe.
Then immerse it in the boiled butter: and place it quickly over the painful tooth, and hold it until it cools down: then iterate it several times, until the power of the fire reaches the root of the tooth.
And if you wish, immerse cotton or wool in cold butter, and place it over the painful tooth: then place a heated iron on top of it until the heat reaches the deep cavity of the tooth.
Cauterization of it with fire is done, so that you may direct yourself to the air tube, or the iron tube. And there be something of thickness in its body, so that the sharpness of the fire may not reach the sick person's mouth.
Then apply the cautery heated by fire: place it over the tooth: and hold your hand there until the cautery cools.
Do this several times, for the pain will be relieved either on the same day or on another day.
And the patient should fill his mouth with good yarn and hold it for one hour; then spit out.
And this is the form of the cautery.
Cauterize with any extremity as is possible: and this is the form of the cannula.
¶ On the method of cauterizing in Strophuli.
Head XXIV.
When Strophuli are caused by phlegm and cold humors, and are not responsive to medical treatments for digestion, and you wish to quickly promote digestion, then apply a concave cautery heated by fire, whose form is as follows.
Having two open extremities, so that smoke escapes from the other end of the cautery: and place the heated one over the abscess once, and a second time if necessary, until it reaches the depth of the abscess.
If the abscess is small: then apply a cautery according to the size of the abscess.
Then let it alone for three days, and apply a wet dressing infused in butter until what the fire burned is removed.
Then treat it with tooth ointment until the form of the tube is healed.
¶ Regarding the method of cauterizing in hoarseness and constriction of breathing.
Head XXV.
When the humours overcome the pulmonary tube, and especially when this is accompanied by a cold constitutional condition, then it is necessary to evacuate the patient with purgative medicines at first.
Then cauterize it on the nocard at the root of the throat at the depressed spot. And beware, do not apply the cautery to the throat or the skin unless there is something to indicate it.
Then cauterize it with another cautery at the join of the neck at the last vertebra, extending it: and let the cautery be pointed iron according to the size previously mentioned.
Then treat it with what has been mentioned before until it is healed.
¶ Regarding the method of cauterizing in diseases of the lung and cough.
Head XXVI.
When cough and lung disease are caused by cold humours, and the patient does not have fever, nor consumption, nor an old illness: then cauterize it with two cautery applications above the furcula at the depressed, gentle, and hollow spots.
And cauterize another with a probe in the middle of the chest between the two nipples: and let the shape of the probe precede as described before.
And if you wish your cauterization to be performed by pricking with a probe called Punctum, whose shape preceded in the pricking of ear pain: and let the points be thirty, diminishing as described.
Then care for it with what preceded, until it is healed. And let the probe have three branches: according to this form.
Therefore, let the cauterization be milder when you do it with one of the three probes.
¶ Concerning the manner of cauterizing in the Titillicus, in shoulder dislocation.
Chapter XXVII.
When the head of the helper bone is dislocated due to moisture and does not return within an hour of its dislocation until it becomes customary for its return, then if it is dislocated again by a slight movement, as we have already testified to this, then you should reduce the dislocation first.
Then the patient is turned supine on his back or on the side of the healthy limb.
Then lift the skin which is on the inner side of the titillicus near the upper part with your left hand. And if the joint is dislocated to the inner side.
Then cauterize with a probe that has two prongs. Whose shape is as follows.
Then cauterize the skin until it penetrates to the opposite side, and let the figure of the cauterization be with four cauterizations.
And sometimes a cauterization is done with a cauterium having three true points, whence the figure of the cauterization then becomes that of six cauterial points: and they are true according to the subtlety of the probe.
And this is the form of the cauterium having three true points.
And sometimes one is added to this number, whence there are eight cauterizations.
Then place on the cauterium pounded strips of cloth with salt.
Then cause the patient to rest in a tranquil manner, so that the limb is not moved for some time until it is strengthened.
And if the dislocation is higher up, and this happens rarely, then cauterize it above the shoulder with a clamp cauterium, or with many puncturing cauterizations.
For the joint is strengthened, and the moisture is removed: and the patient is cured.
¶ On the Method of Cauterizing the Stomach.
Head XXVIII.
When cold and many humors arise in the Stomach, until they are extracted from his complexion, and catarrhs multiply to him, and frequent modes of cure are not effective: then it is necessary that the patient be laid on his back, and extend his legs, and his hands.
Then cauterize with three cauterizations: one cauterium of the size of a finger's breadth below the subscapular region of the chest with a clamp cauterium, and two cauterizations below from both sides by one cauterization, until the figure of the triangular cauterizations comes.
And lengthen between both so that they do not join when they putrefy. And the depth of the cautery should be the thickness of two thirds of the skin.
And the shape of the cautery should be according to this form without addition: and if you wish to use a larger cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form: and let the cautery that makes this cautery be one according to the figure of a circle according to this form.
And the stomach is cauterized by puncturing it with a needle that is used for this cautery: and you should mark a point on the stomach according to the quantity you wish with encaustic wax: then cauterize it with the puncture cautery: then care for it with the cure that preceded until it is healed.
¶ The manner of cauterizing Epar frigidum.
Chapter XXIX.
When it happens that there is pain in the Epar frigidum due to cold and moisture, or because of a large windy condition, until it exits through its natural discharge, and the sick person does not improve according to what we said: then the sick person should be laid with his neck, and mark three cauteries with encaustic wax according to this form and quantity below the Epar frigidum, where the cubit of a man reaches. And let the space between every cautery be according to the thickness of a finger. And let the cautery be according to the length of the body, straight: and do not press your hand with the cautery too much.
And let the quantity be such that it is burned according to the thickness of the skin, half its size without addition: and let the sick person stand on his feet.
If he is not standing, then let him lie down, who has already stretched out his legs and raised his arms. This is the form of cauterization.
And it is possible for you to perform this cauterization with a surgical cautery when you have subtlety and prudence in your art.
And watch yourself so that you do not proceed last in cauterization, and the thickness of the skin is burned throughout, which is why the body is burned entirely and it may reach the intestines: for the skin is thin there. Therefore, know this.
On the manner of cauterizing epistemic apostemas.
Chapter XXX.
When suppuration occurs, and you wish to know whether that apostema is in the epigastric flesh or in its covering: then if it is in the epigastric flesh, it causes a dull pain and heaviness without sharpness. And if it is in the covering of the epigastric area, with the pain there is a severe sharpness. You now see that his treatment has fatigued the physicians.
Therefore, the patient should lie supine on his back.
Then figure the place of the apostema with the encaustic: then ignite the cautery which is similar to a ray.
And this is its form.
And cauterize with that cautery until the entire skin is burned and it reaches the base, until all the pus emerges: then treat it with the treatment for suppurating wounds until it heals.
And it ought not to use this cautery method, except for one whose study in the art of medicine is prolonged, and whose hands often concur with experience: then only may he dare to perform such an operation.
But if you wish to let it alone, it is better for me.
¶ On the Method of Cauterizing in Pleurisy.
Head XXIX.
The ancients said that the cautery combined with roots of Aristolochia should be used for cold pleurisy in this manner.
And take from the dried roots of Aristolochia one long root, which is found there, and let its thickness be like that of a finger.
Then immerse it in oil, and ignite it in fire.
Then cauterize with one cautery in the area between the fork and the neck, and with two small cauteries slightly inclined downward towards the area below the chin.
And use two cauteries also in the area between the fifth and sixth ribs, slightly inclined towards the back: and with another cautery in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach.
And use three cauteries from behind: one in the area between two spatulas, and two from both sides of the chest, with the lower cautery between the two spatulas.
And it ought not to compress your hand with the cautery; rather, let it be evident by the smell on the skin. And some of the ancients have said that there are men who use a cautery of iron similar to a bow: they ignite it and insert it within what is between the ribs until they reach the abscess, and the pus comes out: as we said in the case of the epatis abscess.
But in this perforation with the cautery it is out of fear that either the sick person dies immediately, or a fistula occurs at the place, which has no cure.
¶ On the Method of Cauterizing the Spleen Chapter XXXII.
When you treat the illness of the spleen, following the method we have mentioned in the cure for the division of illnesses, and your treatment is not effective, then cautery on that area is to be performed according to three methods, all of which are correct.
One of these methods is to make three or four cauterizations, marking them along the length of the spleen according to the shape of the cauterization used for the epatis, whose figure has already been given.
And the size of each cauterization should be that of a finger's width, or a bit more or less.
And the method of cautery should be as we have said for the cautery of the epatis equally.
And do not press your hand with the cautery: and let the sick person lie supine on his back.
And another method of cautery is this: ignite the cautery with two wicks, as we have said in the chapter on dislocation of the humerus. Raise the skin which is directly over the spleen, where the elbow of the left side of the sick person reaches. Let your elevation be such that it raises the skin according to the width of the body, so that the cauterizations fall along the length of the body.
Then insert two hot irons strongly, until you penetrate the skin from the other side: then withdraw the cautery. Thus four cauterizations are made. And if you wish to cauterize using a cautery with three irons.
Then care for the cautery after you have let it emit pus for many days, for it is more effective than all that preceded it in the cure.
¶ On the Method of Cauterizing in Hydrocele.
Head III.
Cautery does not apply to hydrocele, unless it is scrotal.
When you cure hydrocele with the methods of treatment as we have said in the division, and if the treatment is not effective, then it is necessary to cauterize it with four cauterizations around the umbilicus, and one cauterization over the stomach, and another over the hip, and one over the spleen, and two cauterizations along the back between the vertebrae, and one directly over the chest, and another directly over the stomach: and the depth of the cauterization should be close to the thickness of the skin.
Then let the cautery be open to discharge pus over a long period.
And do not discharge the weak patient from treatment after the cauterization: for it is necessary to have two intentions. And healing will hasten with the help of God.
The form of the cauterization used for the abdomen should be claw-like, as its form has previously been described: and that used for the back should be olive-shaped, as its form has also been described.
On the manner of cauterizing Feet and Thighs. Head XXXIV.
When apostemas are formed in hydroptic conditions and are filled with yellowish water: you must cauterize over the dorsum of the foot at nocratis, which is between the tarsal and annular regions. Then raise your hand with the cautery and do not twist it: then raise your hand: and do not repeat this entirely.
For the yellowish water will exude, and the cautery should be according to this form.
Then make two cauterizations on each thigh, and let the cautery be with the point of the surgical instrument: and let the cautery be according to the length of the thigh, one below the knee, and the other below it, about midway through the thigh: and make two cauterizations over the entire thigh bone: and leave the wound open without treatment for a long time: so that some water exudes from it: then treat it with the rest as we have said.
On the manner of cauterizing in the solution of the Belly. Head XXXV.
When the solution of the belly is from cold and humidity, until it weakens the retaining and digesting virtues, which are in the stomach and intestines: and it is treated with methods of treatment, and not cured: and you see a sick person tolerating the cautery of exuberant virtue, then cauterize that place with a great cautery over his stomach, according to what preceded in the cauterization of the stomach with the ring-shaped cautery, and four subtle cauterizations around the umbilicus, with a thin nail cautery: and with a great cautery above the alcatin over the other parts, or with two cauterizations.
And if you see excess humors, and the sick person tolerating it, then cauterize it with a cauterization over a comb, and cauterize all of it: and perhaps you will add two small cauterizations over the stomach near the large one.
For the cure is effective whose help does not err.
¶ Concerning the Method of Cauterizing Hemorrhoids.
Chapter XXXVI.
When in the anus are old hemorrhoids many or one, and they are from thick, cold humors, or corrupted humors, and if they are not cured with what we said in the division, then cauterize three times over the lower spine near the iliac bone in a triangular manner, and once below the navel about two digits apart.
And if you think that his stomach is cooled down and his food is not digested, and you see his face ulcerating, then cauterize him over the stomach with a large cauterization, according to what preceded: and cauterize over his Epar, and another over his Spleen with a clavate cauterization: and let the open cauterization remain for some time: then cure him until he is healed.
¶ Concerning the Method of Cauterizing the Althel After Its Removal.
Chapter XXXVII.
When you remove the althel, then ignite the cauterization that is similar to a rod.
Then insert the ignited cauterization into the cut althel: and with your last hand, do this once or twice until the cauterization reaches the vein from which the blood flows. If therefore there are many wounds, then cauterize each one with a cauterization according to what we have narrated.
Then care for it, together with what is applied to them from ointments, until they are healed.
And if you cauterize it with a great cauterization over alcatin, it is more effective in healing.
¶ Concerning the manner of cauterizing an Anal Fistula.
Head 38.
When the patient does not respond to the section and operation as described in its place, and is terrified by it, perhaps he is cured with cauterization.
When therefore a Fistula occurs and becomes old, pus flows from it, and corrupt humors appear.
Therefore, it is more important that you probe it carefully with a fine instrument.
Then determine the depth of it by probing.
Then use the cauterization resembling a rod.
Then insert the ignited instrument into the Fistula and note the depth at which it has entered. And repeat the cauterization over it until all those corrupted bodies are burned, once, or twice, or thrice, according to the measure of your necessity.
And guard yourself from scorching the nerves if there are any, or large veins: or if the Fistula extends to the bladder or to the intestinal wall, then guard yourself from these areas in particular.
And do not do that unless when the fistula is in a fleshy place: and you think, because it is not penetrating.
Then care for the place until it is wholly healed.
If the place is sealed, and materials are removed from it, and remains thus for a long time: then know that it is now wholly healed.
And if materials are not removed from it, then know that it is penetrating, or that the opening is deep and corrupted, or something like that: whose mention will come to its place.
¶ Concerning the Method of Cauterizing the Kidneys.
Head XXXIX.
When pain occurs in the kidneys from cold or from windy abundance, and is alleviated due to the patient's heat, then it must be that you cauterize it over alum on the kidneys, using a cauterization with a clove stick, whose mention has preceded.
And perhaps we cauterize it a second time with the same alum.
Three lines will come forth.
Therefore, they will be more effective in healing.
¶ Concerning the Method of Cauterizing the Bladder.
Head XL. When debility and softening occur in the bladder due to cold and humidity, until the patient no longer retains urine, then cauterize it in the lower part of the flanks over the bladder, where the hair begins to resemble a comb, using a cauterization from the right flank, and another from the left side. Let the length of this cauterization be according to the width of the thumb. Cauterize it with a cauterization on the lower back, or with two cauterizations if you need them: and let it be according to what preceded the clove stick cauterization.
On the Method of Cauterizing the Womb. Head XLIII.
When cold and humidity occur in the Womb and are prevented from impregnation, and menstruation is corrupted, and their discharge is delayed, and pain occurs to her at their approach, then it must be cauterized with three cauteries around the circumference of the navel, as we said in the cauterization of the bladder, and one cauterization above the alcatim on the lower back, or with two cauteries: let the cauterium be clavile.
On the Method of Cauterizing the Ankh in Dislocation.
Head XLII.
When mucous humidities effuse to the scapula of the Ankh and become a cause of its exit from its place: and the sign of this is that the thigh extends beyond the other when compared face to face: and the location of the dislocation is found to be empty.
Therefore, you must cauterize the patient over the scapula of the Ankh with a cauterization in a similar circle: after you mark it with encaustic around the scapula, as it is revolved, and let the scapula fall into the center of the circle.
And let the cauterium be of the form that preceded in the cauterization of the stomach.
And if this cauterium is not present for you, then cauterize it with three cauteries, using a large olive oil cauterization: and let the depth of the cauterization be according to the thickness of the skin in total.
Then care for it until it is healed.
¶ Concerning the Method of Cauterizing in Sciatica. Head XLIII.
When pain occurs in the buttock, and the cause is cold and humidities: and the patient is treated as we said in division, and no new treatment is applied, and that old condition worsens, then it is necessary to purge the patient of thick humors with foul pills or with artificial pills and similar treatments.
Then cauterize it.
And the method of cauterization in this case is according to two methods: either cauterization with burning medicines, or cauterization with fire.
Cauterization with fire is according to many methods.
One of which is to cauterize over the buttock of the affected side three triangular cauterizations according to this form.
And make them with good or bad depth.
And let the space between each cauterization be of the thickness of a finger's breadth: and let the cauterization be oiled.
Sometimes a cauterization is done in the middle over the buttock of the affected side.
Therefore, there are four cauterizations.
And if you wish to cauterize with a circle, as the form for cauterization of dislocation of the buttock preceded, do it with one cauterization: let the circle contain the entire area.
And burn to thicken the thickness of the skin altogether.
This is the method of cautery in sciatica, when the pain adheres to the spine itself and does not extend to the thigh and leg.
If, however, it extends to the thigh and leg, then cauterize that place with two cauteries above the hip, on the spot where the patient indicates pain is located, and with your cautery four fingers' width above the hip towards the outer side: let the cautery be made with a knife. And let the depth of the cautery correspond to the thickness of the skin.
And if the patient indicates that the pain extends nearly to the toes, then cauterize that place where he indicates with a cautery of three, or four, or more if he needs it.
And if he indicates that the pain is below the knee towards the leg, then cauterize that place with a knife cautery.
And be careful in every cautery that you do not conclude with the cautery such that you burn the nerve or the large artery, and thereby cause harm or contraction to the patient.
And I have indeed seen one and another case among those who cauterized above the hip and concluded with the cautery, where the leg swelled until a tumor followed, and the entire foot was perforated and腐化了：随后发生了肠穿孔，最终导致死亡。
And if the pain is in two parts at the same time, cauterize both according to this method.
And some wise men said concerning the cautery of the anchor, this is the measure of that cautery.
Make a similar cautery of iron whose diameter is the half of the palm: and let its aperture be according to the thickness of the nucleus of the finger, or somewhat less: and within that cautery be a third cautery.
And let the space between every cautery be of the quantity of a node of the thumb: and let the cauteries have openings from two parts: and let their height be as one node, or two nodes: and make for them a handle of iron fittingly adapted in the cauteries.
And this is its form.
Then let it be burned in fire until it becomes red and sheds sparks: then let it be placed on the surface of the anchor wound while the patient lies on his healthy side.
Therefore cauterize him with three round cauteries in one stroke.
Then let it rest for three days.
Afterwards plaster it with butter: and let the wound remain open for many days.
Then care for it with ointment until it is healed.
Albucasis says, "Of this kind of cautery, my son, we have not used it much, because of the fear caused by its appearance: and therefore, because we find few who await its application.
Yet it is one of the good cauteries for those who endure it, and one finds its place suitable.
Cauterium autem cum medicinis adurentibus est, ut tu facias duo samia habentia perforatam armillam, in quam descendit cardo portae eius ex aere, aut ferro, longitudo parietis: quorum in altitudinem eorum sint duo nodi, aut quasi ipsi.
And let the space between each quantity be that of a digit's thickness, and may they be open at the bottom and top: and let them fit together side by side, according to this form.
Then place it on the scale of the fish, laying the sick side on the healthy side.
And press your hand on the scale of the fish firmly.
Then pour hot water between the two circles, which has been heated slightly with fire, and hold it for the quantity of an hour: and the sick person should tolerate its bite and its burning, for he found the bite to be like fire until the biting ceases.
Then lift your hand with the instrument, and wipe the hot water from the fish entirely with sweet water: then let it rest for three days.
And place butter over it until the blackness from the burning is removed. Then let it rest for a few days, and drain the pus from it.
For this is the last in the healing process.
Then treat it with ointments until it heals.
If the pain extends to the thigh or leg, make for him a scale containing water, as you did for the fish equally.
And this is the measure of warm water: and I have already written about it in the treatise on the rectification of medicines.
Take alkali and calcitrite of both unextinguished parts, one part of each: rub them well, and put them in a new pot whose lower part is perforated with one small hole according to the quantity that the radius will enter: and put another untreated pot under the bottom of the first pot: and throw over the alkali and calcitrite from sweet water, which shall submerge both by a finger's breadth: after which you compress them with your hand using good compression: and release the pot until the sharp water descends to the lower part of the glass pot.
Then aggregate that entire water and throw it over the other calcitrite: and stir until it is renewed.
For then it will be very sharp and strong in its acuity, which is administered in many medical operations and in cauterizing other parts of the body.
For it produces the action of fire itself.
And from the medicines, they are mixed with those used for cauterizing, such as terebinthine, and honey of acorns, and lime with soap, so that both be permixed.
And Galen, in narrating, reported the cure of a certain man from the ancients, by which he was cured of pain in the thigh and sciatica, and extolled it as very remarkable.
And he said that he did not require any other treatment, and that he was cured from a single application, until he reported that perhaps he himself entered the bath being sick, and emerged from it already cured. And it is to be taken from the green species of segar: and if the green is not found, take the dry, recent: and rub much with a little fat, and place over the ancham, where there is pain, or thigh, or in the hip: and bind, and let be for a quantity of three hours, or by the quantity that the sick man feels a cooling from the burn.
Then insert it into the bath.
When therefore the body becomes moist, insert it into the bath.
For pain recedes, and healing occurs.
And know that it is not appropriate for anyone to use cautery with these medicines unless after the evacuation of the body.
And Dioscorides, who said that goat manure, when cauterized with it on the sciatic vein, brings this benefit: and the cautery is performed in this manner.
Take wool and imbibe it with old oil, and place it over a deep spot, which is between the big toe and the second toe, and is closer to the second toe.
Then take dry goat manure and ignite it in fire until it becomes charcoal.
Then place the charcoal on the wool and leave it there until it extinguishes.
Then repeat this.
Therefore do not cease to perform this until sensation returns beyond the midpoint and pain subsides.
And this method of cautery is called the vaccinium cautery.
Of the Cauterization of Back Pain.
Chapter 44.
Sometimes back pain occurs from multiple causes, such as a fall, a blow, or excessive evacuation, and similar conditions, due to the infusion of cold and wet material: indeed, cauterization does not apply except in this single case, which is caused by the infusion of cold and wet material.
Therefore, after the patient has evacuated with foul pills and similar substances, three lines should be marked on the back where the pain is, according to the width of the patient's own skin. After marking these lines with encaustic wax and making five cauterizations or more along each line according to the strength of the patient's endurance: the cauterization should be performed using a cauteriopunctus.
And if you wish, perform the cauterization with three or four cauterizations, including a central clavicular cauterization, in this manner.
Of the Method of Cauterizing for Begins Gibbosity.
Chapter 45.
This illness often occurs in small children.
And the sign of its onset in children is: a constriction occurs during their breathing and movement, and you find at the last vertebra of the back and its knots that they have begun to protrude above the other vertebrae.
When you see this and wish to treat it, then cauterize it with a circular cauterization in the following manner.
And let the cautery be applied equally to all parts of the spine: and if you wish to cauterize around the spine with the cautery making two or three lines, let the points be close to each other.
Then take care of the place until it is healed with what we have said.
And beware, do not apply the cautery to the hernia, which occurs during nerve spasm.
¶ Concerning the manner of cauterizing for Gout and pains in the joints. Chapter XLVI.
When pains in the joints are caused by cold humidities that flow to any part of the body, and when such pains occur in the feet, according to custom, it is called Gout.
When therefore Gout of a cold cause is treated with the methods of treatment and the pains are not relieved, then the cautery will relieve them.
And you should cauterize it after evacuation around the joint of the foot with many cauteries: let the cautery be Olive.
This is its form.
And if you need to prick the face of the foot, then do so with the cautery.
And if the pains ascend to the knees or other joints, and this happens frequently, then cauterize it over each knee with three or four cauteries from all sides, using the Cauterium Clavilii. If you need to apply this cautery further, then cauterize it. And do not immerse your hand with the cautery, but let it be about the thickness of the skin only.
If, however, the pains ascend to the knees and back: then administer what we have said about the cautery in its chapter.
If the pains are only in the hands, then make punctures around the fingers, as two lines are run.
If pain remains in the fingers, then puncture them, over every knot, and over the palm of the hand.
If, however, the pains ascend after days to the elbows or to the shoulders, then cauterize both from every part.
And do not discharge the sick from good regimen or medication.
For if a good regimen is established and the phlegm is discharged, he will be healed with the help of God and this cautery.
¶ Concerning the Method of Cauterizing in Ruptures.
Head XLVII.
When a rupture occurs in the groin and the intestine descends down to the scrotum, and it is beginning to be close: then it is necessary that you order the sick person to give up food for one day.
And let him use laxatives so that the feces may descend from his abdomen.
Then let him sit between your hands on his back: and order him to hold his breath until he passes urine or the scrotum becomes apparent or the intestine.
Then reduce it with your fingers, and mark with the cauterized substance under the rupture over the mouth of the pincet, with a mark whose extremity will be similar to the half of a circle above the body.
Then apply the cautery with this form until it turns white, and discard the bistoury.
Then reduce the intestine, or around its concavity.
Then place your hand on the location so that the intestine does not protrude: and you have now incised between the legs of the patient, and placed a cloth underneath, and another servant stands over his legs and another over his chest who holds the hand.
Then place the cautery over the mark with your hand holding it straight.
And hold it there until you reach the opening with it: or repeat with it on the other side if you have not reached the opening with the first attempt.
And carefully observe from the exit of the intestine during your cauterization, so as not to burn it, and may it not result in the patient's death or great harm.
And know that when you do not reach the opening with the cautery, your operation is incomplete.
And the cautery for children must be fine, according to their size.
Then care for it with the other ointments until it is healed.
And let the patient lie on his back for forty days until the wound heals.
And it must be that you provide nourishment of a length proportional to the time of its cure, which will soothe its stomach: so that the intestine does not exit during exertion and evacuation.
Then when he wishes to rise after forty days, then administer a well-made ligament, and let him hold it for forty days more.
For when he follows this regimen, he is cured completely.
When Ruptures occur elsewhere in the abdomen and are beginning to develop, and the force is such that it should not be increased, then cauterize the rupture with a round cautery according to its size: and let that which is burned out from that point on be as the third part of it.
Then cure it, using what we have said: and let no more be added.
And some of the first ones have said that the rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery, in this form.
After it is marked with cauterization, place a line which runs across the width at the upper side of the rupture, and another line downward. And place your hand in the middle with the cautery closed.
But the cautery should first be easy and better to use. ¶ Concerning the method of cauterizing for pain due to fall or percussion.
Chapter XLVIII.
When pain occurs in certain members by chance, or through a blow, and that pain persists for a long time and does not respond to treatment with medicines, then it must be cauterized with the Puncti cautery.
And the cautery for any member should be according to its size, and its thinness, and its weakness, and its strength, and its twisting, and the pain from it.
If therefore it is cured by the cautery at first, it is well.
If not: then repeat the cautery over the same area.
Since it is customary for such pains to be transferred from one member to that which is near it.
Therefore, you should apply the cautery to them until the sick person is cured.
§ On the Method of Cauterizing in Leprosy.
Chapter XLIX.
Lepers are sometimes cured by the greatest benefit of cautery.
And particularly in the species of leprosy that results from the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy: therefore, when you wish to cauterize it, consider carefully.
If therefore the leprosy is incipient, and you have treated it with what we said in division, and it does not subside or remain stationary: then fear that corruption may spread over his entire complexion. Therefore, cauterize him with five cautery applications: one in the middle of the head, a second below it toward the forehead at the end of the hairline, two on either side of the horns, and one behind on the spinal vertebrae.
And lastly, let your hand with the cautery press gently upon it until a small impression is made in the mouth, and the bark shall be dislocated from it: that the expiration of gross vapors from it may be alleviated, and even the spleen shall be cauterized with the cautery, according to what has preceded.
And if the leprosy has already spread over the patient and is clearly evident, then you must cauterize with those cauterizations which we have said in the chapter, and a cautery on the tip of the nose, and two cauterizations on both jaws, and two cauterizations on the vertebrae of the neck, and six on the vertebrae of the back, and one large one over the hypogastrium near the root of the penis and one above it, in the midst of the abdomen: and two on the hips: that is to say, on each hip with one, and two on both knees: one on every knee, and two on the shoulders, and two on the elbows, and two on the axillae: and cauterize it over all joints, from the joints of his hands and feet: and cauterize over all heels of his feet, and the palms of his hands.
And beware lest you burn the nerves that are above the last heel. And sometimes the ospectins are cauterized with one cautery, and another on the osstomachoi, and a third on the epar.
And know that the more cautery you apply, the greater the benefit, and the more it contributes.
And know that the patient does not find pain from the cautery as those who are healthy do: for his body is already numbed.
And it must be that the cautery is of a size and thickness according to the members and joints: as has been preceded according to the species of surgical instruments.
Head L.
When some member is stuped, and is treated with medicines, oils, and plasters, and still does not heal, then cauterize the stuped member with cauterizations according to the size or thickness of the member.
And let your cauterization penetrate slightly into the thickness of the skin.
Then care for it with ointment until it is healed.
And sometimes the cauterization is applied to a certain stupor that occurs in the hand and foot at the vertebrae of the back near the exit of the nerves that move that member: and the stupor is removed.
Indeed, it should not be applied beyond that, except by one who is skilled in the anatomy of the members and the exit of the nerves that move the body.
¶ Concerning the manner of cauterizing in Albaras.
Head LI.
When Albaras becomes old and nothing is brought about in it by medical means: then cauterize over it with a deep cauterization slightly, according to the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness is removed and the color is changed.
Then care itself with herb powder, and lentils with rose oil, and arnoglossa leaves, and pigeon blood, and hernia blood: of each one part; let all these be mixed, and spread upon a cloth, and adhere in place until it is healed.
¶ Concerning the Method of Cauterizing in Cancer.
Head II.
When Cancer is beginning, and force is to be exerted: then cauterize it with a cauterizing instrument circling around its circumference, as it revolves.
Wise men have said that it should be cauterized with the last cauterizing instrument in the center.
But I do not find that to be appropriate, for I fear it might ulcerate, and I have seen it happen many times. And it is more correct to cauterize around its circumference with a circle, as we have said, or with many cauterizing instruments. ¶ Concerning the Method of Cauterizing in Adubelati.
Head III.
When someone has Adubelati and its maturation is delayed, either due to excess causing it, or because the patient is weak and old with little blood, or due to time and the desire to hasten its maturation, then cauterize around its circumference with many small cauterizing instruments by making multiple punctures.
Then let it be.
For it will hasten its maturation.
If you wish to make a perforation with a cautery, then use a cautery, whose form is as follows.
And place it in the midst of the Adubelated area until it penetrates the skin: and let the cautery be from that which follows the sick person, so that the course may be eased.
Then care for it until it is cured.
¶ Concerning the manner of cauterizing in a decayed condition. Head 44.
A decayed condition is nothing but corruption in a moving member, and it eats away at the flesh: just as fire consumes dry wood.
If therefore you see a decayed condition in a place that can tolerate a cautery with fire, then use many cauteries with small and large clavilla points, according to what is suitable for the place where the decayed condition is.
Then cauterize it from all sides until you eradicate the entire corruption, and nothing remains of it at all. Then let it alone for three days, and place on the cauterized areas powdered sulfur with oil until all the eschars and every corruption are eradicated.
Then care for it with ointments that promote flesh growth.
If therefore you see that healthy flesh is growing after three days, in which there is no corruption, it is good.
And if not: then repeat the cauterization on what remains from the corrupted areas.
And corrosive medicine is sometimes used with a sharp one.
It rises to take the place of cauterization.
Truly, however, cauterization with fire is more rapid for healing: and I have indeed already said that cauterization should be used with sharp medicine in division. Therefore, take it there when you need it.
¶ On the Method of Cauterizing the Fingers and Knuckles. Head 55.
This illness often occurs in the lower parts of the feet and is a thick, filtered substance that injures the foot. And cauterization for these conditions is done in two ways: cauterization with fire, and cauterization with hot water.
When it is done with fire, you should use a cauterizing cone similar to an eagle's feather: this should be made of iron, according to the size that contains the claw from all sides, and have thin edges.
Then place the ignited one over the claw. Then rotate your hand with the cauterizing cone around the claw until the cauterization reaches the depth of the claw. Leave it for three days until pus begins to discharge. Then apply a plaster with bad tree leaves, crushed with salt, and leave the plaster on it overnight. It will be eradicated from its roots.
Then care for the place with a生成用的膏药，直到痊愈。 (Note: The last part "donec sanetur" is in Latin and does not have a direct one-to-one translation in Chinese. A possible translation could be "until it heals".)
And if they are not converted, and frequently occur on the surface of the body, chiefly in the hands and feet: then apply to them cauterization with hot water: and you shall take a管子，用铜、铁或秃鹰的羽毛制成：然后将其放在钉子上或火炬上。 (Note: The last part "et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul" is in Latin and does not have a direct one-to-one translation in Chinese. A possible translation could be "and place it on a nail or torch".)
Then throw a small quantity of hot water into the tube: hold your hand and gently rotate it with some pressure so that the edge of the tube印记在钉子的根部，并使热水能够找到通向深处，到达钉子的根部：病人应在被热水灼烧后稍微等待一小时。 (Note: The last part "et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una" is in Latin and does not have a direct one-to-one translation in Chinese. A possible translation could be "and the patient should slightly wait for one hour after the application of the hot water.")
Then remove it, for the nail is removed along with its roots.
Do this one after another until you have treated all that are on the body.
Then care for them after they are removed with a flesh-generating ointment.
¶ Concerning the manner of cauterizing in Tremor.
Head 56.
When a Tremor occurs to someone from cold in the nerve, or from quartan fever, or from another cause: then it must be that you cauterize it with four or five cauterizations over the vertebrae of the back, and between every vertebra with one cauterization, and in his chest with one cauterization, and over his stomach with one cauterization.
Tremor ceases with olive cautery, and health hastens in cold illness. ¶ Concerning the Method of Cauterizing Albathir.
Head LVII.
Sometimes Albathir, which is a term for foul pustules formed from corrupted fatty materials, are expelled from the body.
Therefore, when they appear, it is necessary to cauterize over all the pustules with a fine cautery tipped with myrtle wood, whose end has been ignited with fire.
Or with the root of long aristolochia.
Or with a lentil-shaped cautery. And sometimes they are cauterized admenul at the beginning of their expulsion according to this method: and they do not increase; and the excess is broken, making them disappear, and they are cured by this.
Indeed, it must be done after evacuation with bloodletting.
¶ Concerning the Method of Cauterizing During Blood Flow from an Artery to the Wound.
Head LVIII. Often, there occurs a flow of blood from an artery that has been cut near the wound, whether externally or at the incision of an abscess, or on a cautery of the member, and similar cases: and it becomes difficult to stop it.
Therefore, when this occurs to someone, hasten with your hand to the opening of the artery, and place your index finger over it: and press it greatly until the blood is obstructed beneath your finger and nothing escapes from it. Then place some small olive oil cautery sticks into fire and many more: and blow upon them until they are ignited greatly.
Then take one of them, whether small or large, according to the wound and place where the artery is disrupted, and place the cautery upon the vein itself, after which you remove your finger quickly: and hold the cautery until the blood is shed.
And if the blood is expelled when you lift your finger from the aperture of the artery and you extinguish the cautery, then take another cautery quickly, from those that are prepared in the fire. Therefore, do not cease to do this with one after another until the blood is shed.
And beware that you do not burn the nerve there, and let no other evil happen to the weak patient. And know that when blood flows from the artery, it is not possible to cauterize it: especially when the artery is large, unless with one of four methods.
Or with a cautery, as we have said.
Or with extraction, when it has not yet been extracted. For when it is extracted, the extremities thereof are drawn together, and the blood is shed.
For when it is extracted, the extremities thereof are drawn together, and the blood is shed. Or it may be tied off with a strong ligature.
Or medicines with properties to stop the bleeding may be applied upon it, and it should be compressed with a suitable ligature.
Whoever performs amputation with a ligature, and stricture with cloth, or the placement of combustion or similar items, does not altogether deprive him, unless rarely.
If, however, such a thing happens to someone, and there is no physician nor medicine at hand: then begin with the placement of the index finger over the orifice of the vein itself, as we have narrated, and by strongly constriction thereof until the blood is obsessed from the upper part of the wound and over the artery.
And the finger not be removed, with cold water of vehement frost always applied from above until the blood congeals and thickens and is cut off. And meanwhile, consider what he needs from cauterization or from medicine.
¶ End of the First Part.
Libre Chirurgici Albucasis Pars II. ¶ Concerning Incision, Puncture, and Phlebotomy in Wounds, and Similar Conditions.
We Have Already Spoken in Chapter One of Every Illness in Which Cauterization and Combustible Medicine Are Appropriate, and the Opportunities for Their Use, as Well as the Causes and Instruments and Forms of Such Cauterizations. And I placed there the chapters from the head to the foot.
And I will proceed in this chapter along the same path: that the sought remedy be made clear to those who seek it. And before I begin, my son, you must learn what is here from the fear that is in Chapter One concerning cauterization.
And for this reason, there should be a greater caution in it, because in the operation which is in this chapter, evacuation with blood happens multitudes of times, with which life stands at the opening of the vein, or incision over an apostema, or opening of the exit, or cure of the wound, or extraction of the arrow, or incision over a stone, and such like: from all of these there arises trembling, and fear, and death falls upon many of them.
And I advise you that hesitation may fall upon you, for sometimes such men with their conditions fall into this art.
For from these are those who become angry with their illness, and death is easy for them: because of the vehemence with which they find themselves in their illness and the length of their wickedness.
And when the illness is from fear, which signifies death.
And from these are those who give you their blessing and enrich you with it, hoping for your health, and their illness is harmful. Therefore, it is not fitting to agree with him who comes to you from such a condition.
And let your caution be greater than your cupidity and greed.
And do not presume on anything from that, unless after certain knowledge, which is verified among you by the successful succession to what follows.
And use in the cure of all your sick, the prognosis and indication for what is conducive to their health.
In that there is aid for you in acquiring fame and glory, and memory and praise.
Let God inspire you, my children, your understanding, and may He not take away from you direction and inspiration: for that is in His hand.
And I have indeed arranged this Chapter by distinguishing it into sections, according to how it proceeded in the Chapter on Cauterization, from the neck down to the feet: so that you may easily find what you wish from it and where you need it.
¶ Concerning the Treatment of Water That Aggregates in Children's Heads.
Chapter I.
Know that this illness often occurs in children after birth: or when the midwife presses the child's head without delicacy.
And it also occurs sometimes from a hidden cause which is not known.
And I have indeed not seen this illness in anyone other than children: and death came to every one of them whom I saw. Therefore, it seemed to me advisable to omit surgery in such cases.
And I have indeed seen among them a child whose head was filled with water, and the head enlarged every day until it could no longer sit upright due to the size of its head. And the moisture increased until the child died.
And this moisture aggregates either between the skin and the skull or under the bone at the base of the skull.
And the operation, if the moisture is between the skin and the skull and the abscess is small, then you should make a single fissure in the middle of the head. The length of the fissure should be about two nodes until the moisture runs out.
And this is the form of the spatula.
If therefore the humidity is more increased, and the abscess is larger, then make these two fissures, according to this form.
And if the humidity is beneath the bone, and its sign is that you see the openings of the roots of the teeth widely from every part: and water is depressed when you compress it with your hand towards the interior, and you do not conceal it from yourself: then you must make three fissures in the middle of the jaw according to this manner.
And after the incision, extract all the humidity.
Then dress it with a mixture of wine and oil for five days.
Then release the bandage, and care for the wound with dressings and ointments.
And do not cease to bind the head with equal tightness.
And give the patient food that is dry and of little moisture until the limb is strengthened and healed.
And the method of the incision is different, so consider where the size of the abscess and the collection of water are apparent.
For sometimes there is more at the back of the head, or at the front, or on the right side, or on the left side.
Therefore ascend with the incision where you see the abscess and collection of water, and cut into it according to what is possible for you.
And observe, lest you pierce an artery, and a flow of blood occur, and the sick person die from that flow with evacuation of moisture.
¶ On Incising Arteries Located After the Ears.
Chapter II.
When catarrhs affect one's eyes or chest, and the condition worsens despite no improvement with medical treatment: then more effective treatment is to incise these two arteries.
Therefore, when you wish to incise them, the patient should shave his head.
Then rub the area with a rough cloth to make the arteries visible.
Then the patient should tie his neck with any cloth.
Then observe where the vein pulses.
And the locations of both are areas depressed below the ears: and it is rarely concealed, except in some individuals.
Then mark the areas with cauterization on both sides: and incise both with a sharp blade on each side, extending the incision to the base of the skull: and let this be done across the width of the head.
And if you wish, insert the sharp blade under the artery, and incise it upwards with the incision.
And let the length of the incision be about two joined fingers.
For when the vein is incised, blood issues forth with the pulsatile flow, rising to the interior by a frequent leap.
If the artery does not appear by touch, then it is necessary to measure from the ear a distance of three fingers.
Then mark with cauterization, and cut until the mouth.
And that which should be drawn from the blood is six ounces, and perhaps you will draw more or less. Do this according to the quantity which appears to you from the condition of the patient and the fullness of his artery.
Then consider [the wound].
Then if something remains to the mouth, then cut it out, so that a hot abscess does not occur: then suture the wound with needles made of linen thread.
Then attend to it with ointment until it is healed.
¶ Concerning the extraction of arteries, which are in tumors.
Chapter III.
When a person suffers from old headache, or acute catarrh due to acrid humidities, and the heat of the season in the limbs, or old soda, violent and similar to these: and is treated with methods of medical cure, but does not benefit from it; then we have found that the extraction of arteries from the tumors, or cauterization of them, as we have described, is effective.
And the method of operation in extracting them is that the patient shaves the hair that is on the tumor, and directs attention to the artery appearing on the tumor.
That artery is shown to you by the patient's pulse, and rarely does it become hidden unless in a few individuals or due to cold fainting.
If this is concealed from you, then the sick person should wrap his head with any of his own cloth; then rub the place with a rough cloth.
Or let vapors arise from water hot, until it is apparent to you clearly. Then take the spatumile, which I formed a moment ago. Then scrape the skin with it easily until you reach the artery.
Then投射一个钩子进去，向外拉到上方，直到你将其从皮肤中拉出，并使其从其下方的包层中完全出来。
If the artery is fine, then envelop it with the hook's tip.
Then cut from that part according to the quantity by which its extremities are drawn out and contracted, so that no blood flow occurs.
For if it is not cut and not severed, the blood will not rise completely. Then evacuate six inches of blood, until three inches remain.
If the artery is large, then you must tie it in two places with a double, strong silk thread or with cords of alhohod, so that decay does not reach it before the wound heals, and no blood flow occurs.
Then cut the excess tissue between the two ties.
Do that at that hour, or after another hour. And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery until the extremities thereof, using a surgical cautery: until its edges are burned, and it will hold its place in the work.
And it is better to do the work, unless the patient has a fever or a heated complexion.
Since the cautery is from those things that heal to end humidities.
Therefore it is better to use healing.
And it is necessary after the extraction of the arteries to fill the place with old cloth: and let them be placed upon it finely made pledgets.
And after the wound is cleansed with dry medicines that cause flesh to grow, and with dressings, until it heals.
And if meanwhile, while operating, a blood flow from the artery occurs, then hurry to cut it off with a cautery, or to fill the place with ghee and bind tightly until the blood is stopped.
And if nothing of those is present with you, then place your finger on the spot until the blood congeals.
And apply a compress to the place with water of violent coldness until the sharpness subsides, and bind it as necessary.
And because it is lighter and easier in the extraction of the artery, you should cauterize the vein with this cautery having two knives: and let the sharpness of the two knives be like alum.
Yet they have much less sharpness than two knives.
Since they are acute, like two knives, he applies cold to both: and do not pierce the flesh with velocity.
When therefore there is a certain thickness in them, heat of fire is applied to them, and the flesh is cut quickly: since this must be done better for every work, more moderately, and more easily.
And let the space between the two knives be the thickness of a finger, after you mark two places with cauterization: and extinguish both fires greatly, until they reach the surface, and incise the vein in two places: so that what is between its extremities may elongate.
For they are not completely consolidated with this cauterization.
And this is the form of the cauterization.
¶ On the care of acute and frequent flow of tears from the eyes.
Head IV.
When the tears are frequent, and the flow is from veins on the exterior of the skull above the head: and medicine with medicines does not bring relief to them, you will see the face of the sick person already reddening, and they feel a crawling sensation on their forehead, as if from ants: and their eyes are weakened, moist, so that even the hairs on them are corroded by moisture: and his eyelids are heated due to the acuteness of the tears: then the ancients required this operation for their treatment, and named it the cure with the Knife.
And you should instruct the sick person to shave the hair on their forehead.
Then make three cuts in the forehead at equal distances according to the length of the forehead: and let the length of the cut be about two fingers, and one cut shall be equidistant from the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second slightly according to the length of the lower arm, and the third on the other side: and beware of cutting the arteries which are on both sides: and stretch your hand from the continuity of the two jaws, and let the space of all the cuts be that of three fingers joined together: and prepare for you a fragment of sponge or many dried cloths with which to dry the blood.
Then insert the blades of two pointed forceps, whose subsequent form is described next.
From the incision which is on the side of the temple, to the second incision: and strip off with it the entire skin which is between the two incisions, together with the scab, which is over the mouth. Then do the same from the middle incision to the second incision.
Then extract these forceps, and insert into the first incision again another instrument, which is called the sharp scalpel, gently from one side, not sharply from the other.
And this is its form.
And place its sharp side towards the flesh attached with skin, and its gentle side towards the mouth. Push it until it reaches the middle cut: and cut with it all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes, except where the incision is continued down to what appears from the skin.
Then do the same from the middle cut to the other cut.
And after the quantity of blood has run out, express the places from the clots of coagulated blood. Then place lime from old plaster in every fissure, and place above them wicks soaked in wine, oil, or vinegar.
And see that no hot abscess occurs.
And on the third day, release the ligature, and administer a strong infusion with warm water.
Then treat it with basilicon ointment and other ointments used for wounds until it is cured.
¶ Concerning the treatment of acute tears and catarrhs affecting the eyes from internal head conditions.
Chapter V.
When acute, severe, and frequent catarrhs occur to someone, you will see their eyes weakened, small, and already their appearance is weakened. The eyelids are ulcerated, and hair falls from them. There is a sharp pain in the depths of the head, painful and accompanied by sneezing. Then take from these conditions what those materials and catarrhs do not come from many veins.
And the better treatment for this is as follows.
And you should order the patient to shave their forehead.
Then make one incision in the middle of the forehead, or slightly wide on the other side, and begin with the incision from the left temple to the right temple. The cut should go down to the mouth. Extend your hand from the temporal bones, which move during chewing, until the mouth is exposed. Then dry all the blood with a sponge.
Then separate between the two labia of the fissure with old cotta, or with linen strips.
Then suture from above with pulvillae: and soak the pulvillae in wine and oil, so that no hot abscess occur.
And when you solve this, and see that the hot abscess is diminishing: then it is necessary to foment the wound until flesh begins to grow there.
Then care for it with an excisive regimen that promotes the growth of flesh: as if you take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony, and prepare a paste from them, and this should be applied to the growth of flesh in such wounds.
¶ Concerning the care of what falls into the Ear. Head VI. All that falls into the ear is of one of four species: either a mineral stone, or similar to a stone, as iron and glass: or it is from a plant, as chickpea and bean: or it is a fluid substance, as water and vinegar and the like: or some animal.
When therefore a stone or genus of stone that does not added to or grow in the ear falls into the ear, expose the ear to heat: if therefore you see the stone, then drop something from violet oil or camphor into the ear.
Then administer the extraction of it, and make the patient sneeze when you insert it, and plug the nostrils at the approach of sneezing. After you place fragments of cloth or wool around the ear, and extend the ear upwards.
For he often emerges with this care.
If he does not emerge, then administer his extraction with Gosti's fine forceps: the form of which is as follows.
If he emerges with the forceps, it is good.
And if not, then administer his extraction with a blind hook of fine single folding. And if he does not emerge through that, then make a tube of bronze, and introduce the end of the tube into the ear opening much, and powder which is in the circumference of the tube with softened caera and oil, so that there be no passage except through the tube: then extract it with your strong suction. For he often emerges with what we have described.
If he does not emerge this way, then take from the helical part, or from the worm, that is, prepared gluten with which birds are caught, a small amount: and place it at the end of the radius after you wrap something over it properly positioned. Then introduce it into the ear opening with ease, after you have dried the ear from moisture.
If he does not emerge with all that we have described, then hasten to cut before a hot abscess or spasm occurs.
And the measure of the incision is to use phlebotomy on the weak first in the cephalic vein: and extract from him blood according to the measure of its strength.
Then seat the patient between your hands, and turn his ear upwards, and make a small incision at the root of the ear near its fat in a depressed spot: let the incision be lunar-shaped until you reach the stone; then extract it along with what is possible for you with the instruments.
Then use the wound from your time with speed, and care it until it is healed.
If it is a falling object into the ear from one grain, which grows and swells: then administer its extraction.
If it does not yield to you for extraction, then take a thin spatula fine, according to this form.
And administer with it the excision of that species from the grains which fall into the ear, and do not perform this when you think that grain is already moistened by the vapor of the ear until you place many fragments thereof: then extract them with forceps, or with a fine probe, or with suction, as we have said, for the extraction of it should be made easier.
In water which enters the ear, the patient should use a sneeze when first placed there: and now his ear is filled with some amount of old fluid: and he lies on the side of the ear where the water is.
If it therefore exits through that, it is good.
And if not: then take many stones, according to the length of a finger, thin and soft, and heat them slightly with fire, and the patient should insert one from them into the opening of his ear: and let one fall from that side, and strike it with another stone on the stone which is in the ear.
Therefore, let him continue doing this with the stone and stone until all the water exits.
And now the water exits such that you may take one feather or one reed, and insert one end of it into the ear: and ignite the other end with fire until most of it burns.
Then iterate with another ligature, and do this many times until all the water has emerged: and extract it with the cannula as previously stated on the stone.
In the extraction of an animal entering it, if it is of a small body, such as a louse, and similar, take care to extract it as I said in the division.
But if it is of a large body, which is apparent by sense: then administer its extraction with forceps and hooks: and this is easier than all that is held in the ear.
In the extraction of a worm generated in the ear, when you treat it with what we said in the division and in the discussion of distillations, and your treatment does not confer relief: then you should examine the ear in the sun.
If therefore something from the worms is apparent there, then extract it with forceps or with fine hooks.
If however nothing is apparent there, then take a cannula, the form of which is narrow at the bottom and broad at the top: and introduce the fine end into the ear according to the quantity that the sick person can tolerate: then suck with that strong suction.
Do this many times until all the worms have emerged.
If however they do not obey you and exit, then surround the cannula with a probe, as I said on the stone.
If they do not emerge with what we have said: then administer the distillations which the ancients used for the destruction of worms, and you will find this in the discussion of distillations.
And let your effusion which you pour forth of oil and medicines into the ear with this instrument, whose form is depicted here.
As you see, make it from silver or copper, drawn out at the bottom, with a small hole at the bottom and a larger one at the top.
Let it be such that what is in the concavity of the cannula is made of air unevenly.
And if you wish, take a ray, and wrap its extremity with cotton in a suitable winding: then project oil, or juice, or what you wish from these medicines into the cannula: and let it be in the ear: then insert the ray with cotton above, and express it with your hand applying moderate compression until the oil is pushed into the concavity of the ear, and the patient feels it internally: and that which is poured into the ear may now be warmed slightly with fire: and beware lest what distills into it be very cold: for medicines do not tolerate that.
¶ Concerning the care of the accident of opillation of the Ear.
Head VII.
Sometimes infants emerge from their mothers' wombs unperforated.
And it has also happened to some people that opillation occurs in the meatus of the ear due to a wound or flesh arising from there.
And this opillation sometimes occurs in the deep meatus of the ear, which does not result from usage: and it also happens to the outer part of the meatus to a slight degree, and is caused by such usage.
That which happens deep within the Ear, and which is not grasped by sight, is in many dispositions difficult of cure.
And in that which follows concerning the use of the Ear, you should place the affected Ear in the sun and look into it. Then, if you see an appearance of cleaning, open it with a slender spatule, the form of which is as follows: its end has a certain small breadth, and a part of it is sharp, and the rest of the spatule has two gentle sides: so that it does not damage the Ear.
If therefore the cleaning is born of flesh in the meatus of the Ear, then hold it with a slender hook, and cut it with vehement facility until all the flesh is removed.
If the cleaning is deep within the Ear: then take a slender, gentle spatule, and warm it slightly with fire. Then put it into the meatus of the Ear.
If therefore you perceive cleaning with that which the patient experiences with great heaviness of hearing, attempt to open it with facility: and beware, lest you injure the nerves of the Ear.
Then place a wick in the Ear according to the width of the opening, which you have wrapped in Egyptian ointment. Do this for a few days until you are secure about the healing of the wound.
Or take a wick, and steep it in rosewater, and powder it with ground zegi, and use it.
If you see the Ear already suppurating: then you should extract the wick, and let it come into contact with another wick wrapped in cerate made with rose oil, until the hot suppuration is settled. Then care for it until it is completely cured.
If however there occurs a flow of blood: then immerse the sponge or cloth in cold water, and place it upon it the ear: and continue with the rest of the treatment which cuts off the flow of blood as described in the treatise on distillations.
Of the care of Altheli palpebras.
Chapter VIII. These Altheli that affect the eyelids sometimes are wet, and sometimes dry.
Therefore, you must hold them with forceps: or with a clamp, and cut them away from their roots with forceps.
Then place powdered zinc above the affected areas.
If however blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a thin lens-shaped cautery.
And cauterizing them is better after incision.
For they often return when something remains from their roots.
And when cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
Of the care of Granuloma of the eyelids.
Chapter IX.
Often something occurs on the eyelids that is similar to Granuloma in its strength and hardness, and for this reason it is called Granuloma: and it is an aggregation of coarse moisture on the upper eyelid and lower eyelid.
Therefore, the operation on them is that you should consider then if there is a growing swelling appearing from the eyelid, and move about to every part, and its nature is easy.
Find therefore above it a fissure through the width.
Then scrape it from every part with facility until it exits.
Then suspend it with a hook, and cut it out.
If, however, the excision thereof is not prepared for you, so that you must penetrate the eyelid with a slight incision, then it harms the patient in some way.
If the fissure is large, then unite it with a suture and care for it until it heals.
And if it is small, no harm will come to you from it.
For ointment restores it and causes it to heal.
And if the swelling has declined toward the inner ear surface, then invert the eyelid and suspend the swelling with a hook. Additionally, you will need to make an incision and press it from every part.
If the eyelid is extended by an incision, it does no harm to anything.
Then wash the eye after the incision with the swelling, using brine water, and care for the area with what causes healing until the patient is cured.
¶ On the care of Axirnath eyelids.
Chapter X.
Axirnath is the fat that generates in the tunics of the upper eyelids: and it indeed happens frequently to children. And this burdens their eyes, and causes them morning catarrhs, and they cannot look at the sun's light because the tears hurry to them. Therefore, you will see them always lying on their faces, and sleeping upon them, and their eyelids beneath the eyebrows are moist, which have now been covered by inflammation: and the prominence of Axirnath is visible to the eye, and when you press the place with your fingers, you feel Axirnath between them.
And the method of its operation is, that the patient places his head in your lap.
Then take a linen cloth, and prepare a lint on it, and make from that lint a circle according to the quantity that contains the Axirnath from all sides.
Then place it over the affected area, and press it with your fingers from all sides, so that the Axirnath collects in the center of the circle.
Then make incisions in the middle of that humidity with a spatula gently, and let the incisions be narrow, not as wide as those made in phlebotomy deep within.
Or you must incise the skin completely until you reach the Axirnath, for in many dispositions, the Axirnath proceeds from the incision according to the shape of a white fat fruit.
Therefore, extract it with the linen you saturated between your fingers: and you turn your hand to the right and left until it is dispersed. Be careful not to add to the incision so that you do not reach the eye with the spatula and injure it.
If, however, Axirnath does not appear to you at the beginning of the fissure, you shall add a little force to the fissure with facility until Axirnath proceeds.
Then extract it, as we have said.
Then immerse cloths in vinegar and water, and place them over the area, and bind it with wicks.
And there are some who grind salt and put it into the cavity of the fissure, so that what remained from that humidity may liquefy.
Then care for it until it is healed.
If, however, a hot abscess occurs in the area, then care for it with soothing plasters until it is healed.
¶ Concerning the method of Ataxmir for the eye, that is, when the eyelid becomes softened, from which it happens that it wrinkles as it should not.
Chapter XI.
When additional hairs appear on the eyelids beyond their natural course and thicken, then these are harmful to the eye and cause ailments such as frequent tears, softening of the eyelids, and conjunctivitis, until they lead to the destruction of the eye.
And Ataxmir for the eye is treated according to four methods. Or by cauterization with fire.
Or with sharp medicine, as prescribed in the chapter on cauterization.
Ataxmir is treated by incision and suturing.
Or by catheterization, as I shall say.
You must place the head of the sick person in your lap.
Then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand.
If therefore it turns, it is good.
And if it does not turn: insert a needle into that part where the thread is from the lower part of the eyelid, and make the needle with the thread penetrate upwards, and let it be close to the hairs, that is, close to the edge of the eyelid, where the hairs grow: and pull the thread up with the eyelid, and turn it with a pin.
Then incise in the inner part of the eyelid under the hairs with a spatillum (spoon-shaped instrument) extending from the larger lacrimal gland to the smaller lacrimal gland.
Then extract the thread, and place a small woolen plug under the eyelid, made from cotton or cloth. Then mark the eyelid with encaustic wax, which should be in the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Nevertheless, it is necessary that the figure be made according to the size and elevation of the eyelid, since this varies among people.
For some need for a considerable amount to be incised from the eyelid, according to the quantity that is softened by the eyelid. Then, using a spatillum, incise over the two lines you marked, starting from the larger lacrimal gland to the smaller lacrimal gland, and let the incision be one continuous slit near the natural hairs, as wide as the thickness of a radius.
Then insert the hook into one of the two angular skins. Then scrape away the entire layer. Then缝合两唇，用细羊肠线和针：并擦去血液，并使多余的线从双眼上方的部分黏合，如有必要可加入其他一些东西；如果不需要，也不必在意。
Then remove the stitches and thread for three days or four: afterwards care for it. And if you wish, leave the wound without stitches and care for it along with what dries and tightens it.
For the eyelid will rise above the sealing of the wound and its缝合：但以后会更好。
This method of caring for the wound was taught by the ancients to Ataxmir.
Yet there is vigilance for the sick person, and it is from good practice, and there is no fear in it.
And another method is used by Ataxmir as well: and it is to make a mark on the eyelid in the shape of a myrtle leaf, as we have described.
Then lift the eyelid with three separate or joined hooks, according to the following shape, then cut away what is多余的，按照这个形状，切口要均匀。
If, however, it is not possible for you to hold the hook and make it equal: then take a needle with thread and insert it into the middle of the shape. Insert another thread near the larger lacrimal, and another thread near the smaller lacrimal: and gather the threads between your fingers with equality.
Then elevate your hand with equal elevation: and elevate the skin over which a mark is made cut, as we have narrated.
Then join the two lips of the wound with a suture: and care for it until it heals.
If however an apostema occurs at your incision or fissure: apply that apostema with a cautery, and with similar things, from soothing ointments.
And sometimes it happens that the eyelids even turn such that their hairs invert.
¶ Concerning the care of Ataxmir with reeds.
And when you have turned the eyelid and split the fissure within, as we have narrated.
Then make two reeds or two thin pieces of wood, whose length be according to the length of the eyelid, and their width be narrower than that of a spatula: and you have now incised at the extremities on both sides from each side where you hold the threads.
Then join both with a细线超出了眼睛睑的部分，並從兩個方向緊繃兩根葦杆，用力結紮，然後幾天後解除。 For the skin tightened will die, blacken, and putrefy, until it falls off by itself.
If therefore it is delayed, then cut it off with forceps.
Then care for her until she is healed.
When therefore it has consolidated, elevate the eyelid: and the hairs do not pierce.
And this is the form of two canulas, which you should make according to this figure and quantity in length and width.
For the removal of piercing hairs from the eye using a needle.
Chapter Twelve.
The operation is as follows: take a fine needle, and insert a thread of fine silk into it. Then tie its ends together, and make knots with fine knots on both sides: let the length of the threads be one hand's breadth.
Then place another fine thread beneath it briefly, and make knots at its ends if you wish.
Then the patient should place his head in your lap, and it should be near the sun to demonstrate the operation: for it is a delicate or small operation.
Then insert the needle with the thread into the root of the eyelid, and make it quickly penetrate the eyelid, until you pull out the natural hair from above.
Then pull the hair until it is above the thread: and insert that hair into the thread: if there is one, or two, or three hairs, not more.
Then pull your hand with it until the hair comes out with the thread from the eyelid along with the natural hair.
If however the axinotati is pulled and a hair does not come out with it: pull the axinotati downward, using the thread which you have prepared in it, until the axinotati comes out of the upper opening, and you see it with your eyes: then you pull the axinotati and the thread: and withdraw both, and close the eye: and let it remain closed for two or three days, until the hair adheres to its place, and flesh grows over it.
If the hair is short, then either associate it with a longer hair from natural hairs and lift it with it, or let it alone until it lengthens after some time, and then lift it.
Of the care of Alxatrati which occurs in the upper eyelid.
Chapter XIII.
When this Alxatratis occurs in the eye, it is named Leporina.
And this Alxatrati is either natural or accidental.
Therefore, it is accidental from the consolidation of a wound, or a section, or a cauterization, and similar conditions.
And the method of treatment is to find that consolidation, to separate its edges, and to place something moderate between them from linen, and to bind it until it heals.
And it is not appropriate to use things that dry and constrict in its treatment. For if you do this, the Alxatrati will return worse than before: rather, use things that soften, such as hay, wormwood, a compress in water in which althea has been boiled, flax seed, and dyactive ointment melted with some oil: wrap something moderate around it and treat it accordingly.
And thy treasury of care is that thou strive with every ingenuity lest it consolidate according to the form which was first.
And this operation which we have said is nothing but a correction of Alxatrati, lest the form return to that which it was entirely. ¶ Of the care of Alxatrati which is done in the lower eyelid, and it is a wrinkling or contracting upwards to the right and left.
Chapter XIV.
This operation which is done below is truly called Alxatrati.
And it is natural, and it is accidental.
And it is accidental, arising from a wound, or crack, or cauterization, and similar conditions.
And the way of the operation is this: take a needle with a double thread, and insert it into the flesh, and make it penetrate from the left lacrimal gland to the right lacrimal gland until the thread reaches the two extremities of the flesh.
Then extend the flesh upwards with the needle, and cut it with a broad spatula.
If therefore the shape of the eyelid returns as it should, it is good.
And if it does not return, take a needle, and place it in the crack, and turn with it the eyelid. And make two cracks on the inner side of the eyelid, and let the ends of the two cracks be from the two corners of the incision until they meet and form an angle: when they are aggregated, this is their shape, and it is the letter lambda in Greek.
Then remove that flesh in the quantity which is the acute side below, from what follows the eyelid.
Then join the separated parts: sew them with a wool thread.
Then care for them with what we have said about softening medicines and their appropriateness until they are cured.
And if Alxatrati occurs from a crack, and suture, or cauterization: then you must find the flat crack beneath the eyelashes, even according to what has preceded.
Then separate between the two lips with appropriate material, as we have said.
And the summary of treating Alxatrati when it is above or below is that the operation should be performed according to how it is prepared from the form of Alxatrati.
That itself is of many varied forms: and the skilled artisan prepares the incision with whatever means are possible until it returns to or approaches the natural form, and the patient himself, according to what is suitable for him from the operation and instruments in various disposals.
¶ Concerning the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or cornea.
Head XI.
Sometimes this consolidation occurs in many people, such that the upper eyelid fuses with the white of the eye and prevents it from performing its natural functions.
Therefore, you must insert the tip of a probe under the eyelid and lift it upwards: or extend it with a forceps. Then incise the adhesion with a sharp spatula, which should not be as锐利 as the edge of a spatula, but slightly obtuse: so that the patient is not disturbed during the operation, and the spatula can be removed without injuring the eye with its sharpness: and your incision should almost tear away the adhesion with ease until when the eyelid returns to its natural form and the entire adhesion is cured.
Then pour salt water into the eye, wash it out with water: or distill into it through a sieve made from zinc dissolved in water.
Then separate the eyelid from the eye with a linen wick: and place over the eye wool soaked in white vitreous matter: and on the third day use the sieve, and with solids, until it is cured.
¶ Incision of the nail and protrusion of the tear gland flesh.
Head XVI.
Know that the nail is according to two modes. Or it is nerveous: and it is similar to a hard, fine sieve.
Or it is not nerveous, similar to white moisture frozen: which when it touches iron, or you try to grasp it with a hook, it breaks off and the hook does not stick in it.
And both kinds do not begin until the tear duct becomes inflamed, gradually until it covers the visible surface and obstructs vision and eye movement.
And the method of operation in incising it is: that the patient place his head in your lap.
Then open his eyes and lift the eyelid with your hand.
Then collect the nail using a hook of few doublings and extend it upwards.
Then take a needle and insert a strand of hair from horse, cow, or goat hair into it. Let the thread be strong, and slightly double the end of the needle, and fix it in the middle of the nail: and penetrate it with the needle, and tie the nail with the thread, and extend it upwards: and peel off with the hair on the side of the nail that follows the pupil, as if you weave it with the hair until its very tip.
Then cut the remainder at the root of the lacrimal gland with a thin spatula or with small forceps: and remove the natural lacrimal flesh, so that there does not occur an incessant flow of tears from this incision.
And at times the horn is extended with a single hook: or with a thread, as we have said.
Then it is scraped with a gentle spatula, the form of which is as follows.
And beware that the horn does not touch with the spatula, and there occurs a rupture in it, and the pupil is perforated.
Then after the incision, sprinkle something of crushed salt or sifted zinc into the eye, and leave it until another day.
Then care for it with what is necessary until it is healed. If the horn is not nerveous, and you cannot introduce a needle into it, nor can a hook be fixed in it, then this species of horn is treated multiple times with medicines, and is healed as I have described in the division.
If you wish to incise it, then open the eye of the sick person, and take a gentle, thin spatula with a weak edge, as follows in form.
And scrape the horn from above with subtlety and precision.
If you see that it is rarified and broken, and requires further treatment, then instill into the eye from your hour, sifted zinc or red sieved powder, or crushed salt: and continue treating the eye until another day.
Then repeat the operation over itself until everything is removed.
Unless there be contrary in the eye, the boil then let alone and care for the boil until it is healed. Then repeat the operation over itself with reason until it is healed.
The prominence of the tear gland, if it harms the eye with great injury, hang it with a hook, and cut from that part: and not the final incision, to avoid the flow of tears.
Then drop in the tear duct a red solution or made from alum until it is healed. ¶ Incision of Alguardenic, and flesh grown in the eye.
Head XVII.
It arises when red flesh is formed or superimposed in some eyes, until it covers the pupil, or approaches, or tightens over the eyelids, and perhaps turns the eyelids outward: and it resembles a rose blossom.
And the operation in such cases is such that the sick person places his head in your lap.
Then open his eyes, and collect that flesh entirely with hooks suitable for it: and hold it with one forceps or钳子，这里使用forceps更为准确）。
Then cut the flesh first until all of it is removed with forceps.
And be careful not to harm the eye during the operation: and let your cut be such as you cut the flesh itself, or with a spatula, as we described in the incision of the nail: or with small forceps, with which the asebel is collected, according to the form it will take after this chapter.
When therefore the incision is completed and all alguardenici is removed, then fill the eye with powdered salt: or distill into it red powder, and similar things from medicinal corrosives: and place over the eye a compress with alum: that it may be secured from hot apostema.
If, however, some of the alguardenici remains and hot blood dominates you, and you fear a hot apostema, then let the eye rest, and treat it with whatever calms the apostema.
Then repeat the treatment with the operation until it is cured.
And similarly treat the flesh that is added and occurs in the eye of this kind.
Yet it is necessary to keep the cure of any weak eye by natural means or by accidental means through the use of iron: and do not insert your hand into any of these operations until you see that that member is tolerating that operation.
¶ On the Collection of Seb from the Eye.
Head XVIII. Sebels are red veins that are woven over the eye and prevent vision from performing its function: and they weaken the eye over a period of days.
It is necessary for you first to consider whether the eye in which there is a sebil is strong, and no other illness is present besides the sebil: then collect the sebil.
And you must order the patient to place his head in your lap.
Then suspend those veins with one clamp or two according to your discretion: and let the clamp be thin of double curvature, according to this form, or let there be two clamps gradually in one body, according to this form.
Then collect those veins with fine forceps with subtlety, and cleanse the blood hour by hour until you see those veins removed from the eye and resolved: and beware that you do not injure the eye with the sharp ends.
And let your operation be at midday in the sun, and be very firm in your operation: so that you do not incise except those veins.
And when you have completed, then drop green or red dye into the eye: so that it may corrode with its acuteness what remains from the sebil.
If, however, it is not possible for you to collect all of that in that hour, then apply a plaster to the eye with what soothes the eye's pain, and let it remain for some days until the pain settles: and it be secured from a hot aposteme. Then iterate over it according to the same method until it is cured.
And this is the form of the forceps.
¶ For reducing a dislocation from the iris to the nose.
Chapter XIX.
Doctors call this condition an iris fistula, which they treat with a cautery or with burning sharp medicine, according to what preceded its description.
And if it is not cured, then there is no remedy for it: except that you find and drain the entire humidity and pus in it until the aperture is revealed.
When therefore the mouth is discovered and you see therein corruption or blackness, then shave it with an instrument whose form is this.
And it is named Asperi capitis.
Let it be made of iron, and let its head be round like a zir, which should have perforations made with a file, or very fine perforations made with aliskilferi: and place it over the corrupted bone. Then turn it between your fingers, and press your hand slightly until you know that the corruption has been removed: and do this several times.
Then turn it between your fingers, and press your hand slightly until you know that the corruption has been removed: and do this several times. Then restore the place with medicinal astringents.
If therefore the place consolidates, and flesh grows therein, and the course of health is cut off, and remains for forty days without renewing, without suppuration, and without any accident: then you know that it is now healed.
And if not, then there is no natural healing power, except to reduce the fistula to the nostril opening, according to this form.
And do this by discovering the bone with iron or with a sharp medicine: and when the mouth is discovered, then take a drill according to this form; its iron tip should be triangular, and its wooden part a pyramid thinned out to the tip, as you see.
Then place it over the mouth: and let it be near the lacrimal bone: and keep your hand slightly away from the eye.
Then turn your hand with the drill until the mouth penetrates, and let the patient feel it: by which he will know that air is escaping from it when he holds his hand over his nose.
Therefore then restore the place with medicinal astringents drying, as I have taught you.
Therefore when flesh is generated and the place hardens, the material which was flowing to the exterior returns to the nose; hence it is lighter for the patient.
¶ On the Reduction of Prominence of the Eye. Head XX.
When the Eye is prominent with its entirety, and no harm or diminution occurs in use, then it is necessary to apply a poultice to the patient. Next, phlebotomize him: thereafter, place cups on the neck without incision but with suction.
Then apply to the Eye a liniment made from acacia, and aloes, and frankincense, and gum resin.
Then bind the Eye from above with a poultice covered with many small pellets.
And the method of the pellets is this: take soft cloths, many in number, and each cloth should be folded four times. Make many from them, then place them one upon another according to the quantity needed by the Eye: then bind them with a strong bandage over them using a hard cloth.
And repeat the application of cups with suction without incision.
Then remove the cups, and loosen the bound Eye day and night.
If the ligament softens again, then it is necessary to bind it tightly. Then remove the ligament after a day and night, as we have said.
If therefore you see the eye already returned to the fibrous membrane, it is good; and if not, then repeat the plaster, and pellets, and stricture, and suction cups until it is cured.
¶ Of Incising the Fibrous Membrane of the Eye.
Head XXI.
When a disruption occurs in the fibrous membrane of the eye, then it protrudes and proceeds outside the eyelids like a grain of sand, and disfigures the form of a man on account of that. Then an operation is to be performed upon it, according to what I narrate: and it is, that you introduce a needle into the root of the fibrous membrane from the lower part to the upper part.
Then introduce another needle with a double thread from the lacrimal part, and make it penetrate: and release the first needle according to its position.
Then incise the place of the double thread, and ligate with it a part of the fibrous membrane around the needle: and tighten it much.
Then withdraw the needle, and place over the eye wool soaked in a preparation for the eye: and leave it until the thread falls with the fibrous membrane.
Then care for the eye with that, which strengthens it, until the wound is cured.
And when the fibrous membrane is tightened from all sides with a circle of cloth until the eye protrudes greatly.
Then perforate with a slender probe, which reaches the depth of the eye, and let the watery discharge flow, and the eye descend, and immediately enter it: then tighten it until it is cured.
On the cure of Alcomnati.
Head XXII.
This illness called Alcomnati is not anything other than pus that aggregates in the eye, similar to water dripping down, and it is not itself.
And the method is, that you cause the sick person to sit on a prepared seat, or upright.
Then take his head with your hands from two sides, and move it until you see the pus reach below in your eyes.
Then hold it so that it does not descend, and the light is released: and the sick person shall see as he saw before: and if it does not descend below, know that it is water.
If the descent of the pus does not occur as we have said, then cause the sick person to sit between your hands. Then take a fine spatula and scrape above the corneal membrane slightly at the site of the conjunctival attachment to the cornea, until the pus comes out.
When the pus comes out, then let warm water mixed with honey or water in which fennel and honey have already been boiled drop into the eye. Then proceed with the remaining treatment until it is cured.
On the cure of water that descends into the eye, or cataract.
Head XXIII.
We have already spoken of the species of water in division and what is suitable for puncturing by explaining it in words. Then take that same thing according to health.
Then thou shalt cause the sick person to sit between thy hands square, opposite the light, near the sun: and bind his sound eye, and bind him tightly: then take the eyelid of his eye with thy right hand, if the eye in which is water be the left eye: or with thy left hand, if the eye be right.
Then take with thy right hand the algamda, if the eye be left: or with thy left hand, if the eye be right.
Then put the end of the algamda near the crown through the thickness of the radius in the white part of the eye apparent near the smaller lacrimal gland: then drive in the algamda with force: and thou revolve with it thy hand until it penetrates into the white of the eye: and feel that the algamda has now reached the empty place.
And the measure of the algamda's journey to the depth should be the distance from the pupil to the end of the blackness: and this is the crown of the eye.
For thou wilt see them in the pupil of the eye by reason of the clarity of the cornea.
Then put the algamda until it reaches the place where the water is.
Then press it below with force one after another.
If therefore the water descends at once, then the sick person will see it above what he opens his vision to immediately, and the algamda in his eye.
Then rest for a moment.
If therefore the water descends, then remove it again, provided that the algamda has not exited.
When therefore it is inserted and does not rise: then extract the probe with facility: and thou turnest thy hand gradually. Then dissolve something from the clear gemstone salt in water: and wash the eye internally with it.
Then place outside the eye all of the stoppum or soaked wool in rose oil and alum: and ligate the healthy eye with it.
We and those who are of our time place upon it comfrey ground with alum.
And if the probe does not obey you in entering the eye because of its hardness, since it is from a person whose eye is exceedingly hard: then you must take a spatillum named Alberid, which has this form.
Therefore pass it with it the conjunctiva only, and do not insert your hand into the opening: and there is nothing but to make a fine way for the probe.
Then insert the probe as we have said.
And when you have completed your work, prepare for the patient a sleeping place properly made, on which he may lie on his back in a dark room: and prevent all movements, and coughing: and give him food that soothes his nature: and do not move his head to the right or to the left at all.
And let the bandage be kept in place according to its position until the third day. Then remove it in that dark room, and examine his vision: and make him see objects.
Then reduce the ligament until the seventh day.
And it should not be done at the hour of treatment or immediately after incision: rather, you should delay this, because water rises quickly through a violent appearance.
If a hot abscess occurs, then you should wash the eye before the seventh day: and correct it together with whatever quiets the abscess until it is quieted. Then discharge its use, and place over its face a mouthpiece by which his vision may be guided for a few days, the patient himself being in that dark room.
Then he should gradually leave the house and turn to his usual activities.
And know that in saline solutions, a student is not excused from vision oftentimes: for then he may dare to look upon the operation.
And indeed one has reached us from those who are from Alairach, who said that a well was dug in Alairach through which water is drawn.
Therefore, I have not seen anyone in your land do this, nor have I read of it in any of the ancient books: and it is possible that it is new.
And these are the forms of species from the well, as they should stand before those who do not know them.
Let them be made of proper brass: and let the extremities be triangular in the same fine manner, and let the end be sharp.
Forms of the well.
On the care of flesh grown in the nose.
Chapter XXIV.
Sometimes fleshgrowths of various kinds arise in the nose, from which there is something that resembles a scorpion with many feet: and from this is cancerous flesh, stony, of dark color: and from this is what is soft flesh, not of dark color.
In that which is of the aforementioned flesh, soft and not fraudulent nor cancerous, you should place the patient in a position opposite the sun, and open his nostrils, and cast a hook into those fleshgrowths; then draw them outward, and cut what you have grasped with a sharp, thin spatula from one side until you know that all the flesh has been completely removed.
If anything remained from that which cannot be removed, then shave it off with one of the thin instruments gently until nothing remains.
If, however, blood dominates you, or a hot abscess occurs: then apply it with what is necessary. If it is from malicious abscesses, then proceed to cauterize it until the blood is cut off and all flesh is removed.
Then pour vinegar, or water, or wine into the nose after the incision.
If the nose is opened and moisture proceeds from it to the palate, then know that he is now cured.
If, however, the moisture does not proceed as it should, then know that within is flesh grown in the upper nasal bones, to which the instrument did not reach with the incision.
Then thou must introduce a thread of linen having some thickness and many knots: and place between every knot the quantity of a finger, or less. And let the sick man send one extremity of the thread into the nose with the probe, or with whatever is possible for him after he has made it similar to zizyphus: and draw his odor out until it reaches the cavity, and go forth above his throat.
And indeed they do this often as the boy Attomus does in schools: and it is an easy thing for him who wishes to do so.
Then place two extremities of the thread, one which goes out above the nose, and the other which remains in the nose.
Then apply the scalpel to the flesh with the knots that are on the thread. Do this until you know that the flesh is touched by the knots of the thread.
Then withdraw the thread: and put into the nose after the blood has been removed a mild substance that you have soaked in Egyptian ointment: do this for three days, or more, until the ointment dissolves all that remains of the flesh.
Then put into the nose a管窥一斑，您需要我为您翻译或解释哪一部分内容呢？我已经将您提供的拉丁文片段翻译成了英文。如果您有更多文本需要翻译或是有任何问题，请告诉我！
If it needs treatment that dries it out, use that.
For the preparation for nasal drops, which are distilled with olive oil and other medicines, make it of silver or bronze: let it be similar to a small lamp, open like a shell: and its aperture should be similarly shaped.
And if you wish to make a closed cannula, like a cane.
And for the conchula instrument for use in head purgation, make it full and hollow: it should have a handle at its end, with which you hold it when you heat oil or what you wish from juices and fluid substances.
And this is the form of the instrument. ¶ Concerning the care of the thoul of the nose.
Chapter XXV.
Many times a thoul arises at the extremity of the nose, and enlarges and grows with days until an unsightly appearance is formed.
And because of this, it is necessary to treat it with caustics at the beginning of its appearance and remove the entire lesion.
Then place on the area either a cautery or a burning medicine that takes the place of it.
If therefore the incision is delayed until it enlarges, then consider if it is hard, dark in color, and has few sensations: then do not touch it with iron, for it is a cancerous abscess.
Many times I have seen an abscess occur in a person, and great harm came to the one who had it.
And if the abscess is soft to the touch, not dark in color, and you see that an incision is possible throughout it, then evacuate the diseased part, and cut into it without fear or cowardice: and care for the area with something that dries and constricts until it is healed.
On缝合鼻子、嘴唇和耳朵。
Chapter XXVI.
Know that when there is a separation of continuity in one of these cartilages, the operation brings about little benefit, unless in certain individuals.
Therefore, when something of that kind happens to someone, you should consider whether it is a recent wound with its own blood: and then join the edges of the wound with sutures, and then care for it until it heals.
And if the continuity of the lips is already separated and each part is healthy, then it is necessary to excise all parts appearing from the skin, until they bleed.
Then join the two lips with sutures and tighten them. Dust the wound with dragon's blood and ground frankincense. Place above this powder a piece of diafinicon plaster and another of consolidated plaster. Leave it bound for two days or three.
Then remove the bindings and change the medicine. Leave it until the sutures dissolve on their own. Then care for it with ointment until it heals.
The method of suturing is to join the separated continuity either with needles, as we described in suturing the abdomen: or join the separation with a thread, as I have made you know.
On the Extraction of Nodes from the Lips.
Chapter XXVII. Many indeed persons are afflicted with hardnesses in their inner lips similar to grains of herb, and some are smaller, and some are larger.
Therefore, it must be that you convert the lip, and find over every knot of it, and suspend it with a hook, and cut it from every part.
Then fill the place after the incision with something to stop the blood until it is completely stopped.
Then wash it with vinegar, and treat the area with it where there is stypticism until the wounds heal.
¶ Of the incision of flesh arising above the gums.
Head XXVIII. Flesh often arises above the gums, which the ancients call abuluss.
Therefore, it must be that you suspend it with a hook: or hold it with forceps, and cut it at its root, and allow the pus to flow, or the blood.
Then place on the area something pounded, or other styptic powders, drying agents.
If that flesh returns after treatment, for it often returns, then cut it a second time and cauterize it: for it indeed does not return after cauterization.
¶ Of the Reason of Teeth with Iron.
Head XXIX.
Sometimes aggregations occur on the surfaces of the teeth from the inner and outer part, and between the gums, of rough, nasty cortex. Sometimes they are stained yellow, green, until the corruption reaches the gums, and the teeth become foul due to this.
Therefore thou shalt cause the sick to sit between thy hands, and his head in thy bosom, and shave the kernel and tooth, wherein the bark doth appear unto thee, and what is like sand: until there remaineth thereof nothing. Likewise make of blackness, and greenness, and yellowity, and other things, until they be cleansed.
If therefore what is at the beginning of reason in them is good, it is well; and if not, then iterate over them reason on another, second, and third day until the ultimate study arrive at what you wish.
And know that the tooth requires shavers of various forms and many figures: according to how it is prepared for your operation. Therefore, the shaver used to shave the tooth from the inferior part is different from the shaver used between the teeth, according to other forms.
And these forms of shavers be prepared for thee, which thou wilt see.
¶ Of the Extraction of Tooth Pain.
Head XXX.
Thou shalt cure the Tooth from its pain with every skill and delay its removal as long as possible.
For it is not replaced by anything when it is removed, since it is a noble substance. Until there is no excuse for its removal, then when the sick man is compelled to remove it to firm up and to ensure that thou hast a tooth in pain.
For oftentimes pain deceives the sick, making them believe there is a spot in the tooth and causing them to remove it; then the pain does not cease until the diseased tooth is extracted.
We have now seen that from the operation of phlebotomy.
When therefore the painful tooth is certified to you itself, then it must be incised around the tooth with a spatula, in which there is some virtue, until the gum is loosened from all sides: then move it with your fingers, or with fine forceps at first gradually, until you shake it.
Then place large forceps in those locations with good placement, and hold the patient's head between your knees: which you have now firmly held so that it does not move, then pull the tooth straight, so as not to break it.
If therefore it does not come out, then take one of those instruments, and insert it under it from all sides with ease, and try its movement, as you did at first.
If the tooth is perforated or corroded, then you must fill that hole with a piece of cloth, and grip it with the end of a fine radius so that it does not break when you constrict it with forceps.
And you must carefully perform the incision around the gum from all sides extensively.
And keep your strength so that you do not break it, and let a part of it remain, and the illness may return to the patient with greater harm than the initial pain.
And beware, lest you do what inexperienced phlebotomists do in their haste and through the audacity of their actions beyond what we have narrated.
For many times they cause greater illnesses in men, of which the more difficult are broken but all their roots remain, or some of them: or they extract it along with certain bones of the jaw: as we have often testified. Then it should be washed after the removal of it with wine, or with vinegar and salt. If there should be a flow of blood from the places (this often happens), then take something from zegi and put it in that place: and if you do not have zegi, cauterize it.
The forms of fine forceps with which the tooth is moved first, let them have long extremities, short handles, thick, so that they do not fold when pressed against a tooth: let them be as you see thick handles, until when you grasp them, they do not bite themselves nor fold: let the extremities be short, and let them be made of iron wire, or of steel, straight extremities: and in their extremities let there be teeth, some of which shall enter into certain others and bite with a suitable, strong constriction.
And sometimes the extremities are made like the form of a bird's mouth which is called stork, and they are strong in constriction.
On the Removal of Teeth, and the Extraction of Fractured Mandible Bones.
Chapter XXXI.
When something remains after the removal of a broken tooth, then it is necessary to place butter over the affected area for one or two days until the area becomes softened. Then insert algates or forceps, whose extremities are similar to the mouth of a bird called stork.
This form is that of forceps.
Let their extremities be made like a file inside out: or like aliskilfegi.
If therefore it does not yield to you for exit with these forceps, then you must beware above the root, and discover all the flesh, and introduce an instrument which is called the small Palanca, whose form is this.
Let it be brief at the extremity, somewhat thick: and let it not be saturated, that it may not break.
If therefore the root emerges through that, it is good: and if not, it must be aided with these other instruments whose forms are these.
The form of the first triangular extremity, in which there is certain thickness.
The form of the thin triangular extremity.
And it must also be aided with this instrument having two branches, whose form is this. And with the other instruments and tools that preceded in proportion to the teeth.
And it must also be aided with this instrument that is likened to a large hook, whose form is that of a twisted triangular extremity, in which there is certain thickness, that it may not break: and let it not be saturated.
And know that the instruments for the teeth are many: and similarly other instruments are not counted, and the skillful craftsman, subtle in his art, finds an instrument by himself, according to what the operation and diseases themselves signify.
For from the diseases to which the ancients did not refer an instrument, because of the diversity of their species.
If the mouth is broken from the mandible, or from other bones of the face, or putrefies: then examine it in its place with what is suitable for it from the instruments and forceps that I have said in the extraction of roots, and aid it with this gesture, whose form is this.
Let it be of a certain thickness gradually, so that it may be tightened or held with it the mouth, and not escape and go away until the mouth comes out: and restore the place with medicines suitable for this.
If there is only a small corruption in the bone, then scrape it from its corruption, and treat it until it is cured.
On the Extraction of Prominent Teeth Over Others.
Chapter XXXII.
When teeth are prominent and do not follow their natural alignment, it becomes ugly due to this form: and especially when this happens in women and girls, namely those who sell themselves.
For if a tooth is born after another tooth and is not placed in its proper position, and neither its extraction nor filing is possible: then eradicate it. And if it is attached to another tooth, then cut it off with this instrument, the form of which is as follows.
It is similar to a small beak, and it is made of iron, with its extremity greatly sharpened.
And let your cut be such that you cut it over many days, and because of the hardness of the tooth, so that no other tooth is shaken.
If it is prominent and exposed to filing: then file it with a file made of iron, the form of which is as follows.
Let it be entirely of iron, and its handle made of small closely set points, as with a file used for making needles: with this it can be filed gradually over many days with ease, so that the tooth is not shaken and does not fall out; then finish it by scraping it with some rasps.
If there is a tooth, from which a part breaks and injures the tongue, then it must be trimmed until the roughness of that break is removed and made even. It should also be smoothed so as not to injure the tongue or corrupt speech.
On the Treatment of Teeth with Gold Strings.
Chapter XXXIII.
When the front teeth are shaken and agitated from a blow or accident, and the patient cannot hold food in place so that it does not fall out: and you have treated them with styptic medicines but the treatment was not effective, then the ingenuity is to bind them with a gold string, for silver turns green and decays after a few days, but gold never changes.
And let the string be of moderate thickness and size to fit between the teeth.
And the form of the treatment is, you take a string and introduce double its length between two healthy teeth. Then weave it with both ends of the string among the moved teeth, whether one tooth or several, until you reach the thread to the other side's healthy tooth.
Then repeat the weaving back to the part where you started. And use your hand with subtlety and wisdom so that the string does not come loose at all. The binding should be tight at the roots of the teeth, so that it does not escape.
Then cut off the excess ends of the string with tweezers and secure both ends, turning them over in your hand. Conceal these ends between the healthy and moved teeth so as not to injure the tongue. Then let it be tightly bound until it remains in place.
If it is cut or punctured, tie them with another thread and let it stand thus for the whole time.
And this is the form of the Teeth, and the figure of the retention of two healthy teeth, and two movable teeth, as you see.
And sometimes it happens that a tooth or two returns to its proper place after falling out and is retained as we have described, and remains there: and this is done only by a skilled and experienced craftsman.
And sometimes a piece from the jawbone is fitted: and it is made from this to resemble a tooth, and placed in the position from which the tooth was reinforced and tied, as we have said: and it remains and serves with it for a long time.
¶ Concerning the incision of the ligament that occurs under the tongue and prevents speech.
Head XXXIV.
And if there is something hard and knotted in it, and that is from the healing of a wound, then thrust with a hooked instrument into it, and cut it from side to side until you sever the ligament and the knot releases.
If, however, there is a flow of blood, then place on the zegi spot powdered. If the blood overcomes you, then cauterize the spot with a lentiginous cautery, which is suitable for this: then care for it with the remaining treatment until it is cured. ¶ Concerning the extraction of a ranula that occurs under the tongue.
Head XXXV.
Sometimes an abscess occurs under the tongue that resembles a toad's tongue, hindering the tongue from its natural function: and perhaps it grows so large as to fill the mouth.
If, therefore, you see it of a dark color, or black, hard, and the patient does not feel it: then do not touch it, for it is cancer.
And if it inclines toward a whitish color, in which there is moisture, then apply a hooked instrument to it, and cut it with a sharp and slender spatula, and free it from all sides.
And if blood overcomes you during your operation, then place on it powdered zegi, until the blood is止于此。请继续您的指令，如果需要翻译或进一步处理其他内容，请告诉我。
Then let it be washed with vinegar and salt, and care for it using other suitable treatment until it is cured.
On the cure of an apostema of the two tonsils.
Chapter XXXVI.
And then you will either pierce it: or it will break open on its own.
And if it is of a white color, round, and its root is fine: then you must cut it out.
And the operation is as follows: you should consider before performing it whether the apostema of that kind has been completely healed by rest, or has decreased by some reduction. Then place the patient in the sun, and have his head in your bosom. Open his mouth, and let a servant hold it with his hands, and press his tongue downward with an instrument, the form of which is as follows. Let it be made of silver or brass, and let it be thin like a small knife.
When therefore you press with the tongue and a boil is shown to you and your weight falls upon it: then take the hook and fix it into the tonsil and pull it out as far as you can, besides which draw something from the lining.
Then cut it with an instrument, the form of which is as follows.
It is similar to tweezers; however, its ends should be curved, so that the opening of each is acutely in line with the other. Hence, take care that it is made of iron tempered or soaked in alum.
If, however, this instrument is not present, then cut it with a spoon-shaped instrument, the form of which is as follows.
Let it be pointed on one side, not on the other.
And after you have cut the tonsil on one side, cut the other according to the same pattern of incision.
Then after the incision, the patient should gargle with cold water, or with vinegar and water.
If, however, there be a bleeding, gargle with water in which pomegranate peels have boiled, or myrtle leaves, and similar astringents, until the bleeding stops. Then take care of it until it is cured.
And sometimes boils appear in the throat other than on the two tonsils.
Cut these accordingly as I said for the incision of the two tonsils equally.
And I myself have healed a woman from an apostematium which was born between her throat, drawing to scurvy, with few senses, which almost closed her throat: and the woman breathed through a narrow passage, and had already forbidden her eating and drinking: and she had already come to death if she had remained alive for one day or two days.
And the apostematium had only ascended so far as to emit two branches, until they emerged over two nostrils.
I therefore hastened and fixed one of them with a clamp.
Then I drew it out, and from it came a large portion.
Then I cut it off where I grasped it from the nostril.
Then I treated her with what had proceeded from the other nostril.
Then I opened her mouth and pressed her tongue: thereafter I fixed a clamp on the apostematium. Then I cut off a part of it, and nothing flowed from it except a little blood: thus her throat was cleared, and she began to drink water immediately, then she received nourishment from food.
Therefore I continued to cut from that apostematium many times over a long period: and the apostematium kept recurring in place of what I was cutting until it grew too large and affected her.
I therefore devised a plan and cauterized the apostematium between the throat.
It therefore stopped growing: then I walked away, and did not know what God had done for her after me.
Of the Incision of an Abscess of the Uvula.
Chapter Thirty-Seven.
When the catarrh descends to the uvula and forms an abscess and is long, then it is called a perpendicular abscess: and if it is in the lower part thick and round, then it is called a uvula.
When it is treated as we said in the division, and the treatment does not improve the condition: and you see that the warm abscess has subsided from there and become thin, then you must incise it.
And that which is aggregated round from it, and does not have length, and is bloody or of a dark color or black, and has no sensation: then you must make an incision for it.
For there is danger to the patient in it.
Therefore, when you see it according to the mode as I said from albedo and its length, you should make the patient sit before the sun: and press its tongue with the instrument, of which the narration has preceded: then fix a hook in the uvula, and draw it downward: and incise it with one or two instruments as I said in the incision of two tonsils.
And you must not incise it from there, unless what is added exceeds the natural limit without addition.
For if you incise beyond that, you will injure the voice and speech.
Then after the incision, use what we have narrated in the incision of two tonsils: and care for it until it is healed.
If the patient is terrified by the incision: then you must use your skill in cauterizing him without fear and poverty.
And the measure of cauterization in this is not without the use of sharp water: and you must place the patient's head in your lap.
Then press his tongue with the instrument we have mentioned.
Then take from the water that I told you about in the chapter on cauterizing, and make a hot ashes bed with it, neither too thick nor too thin, and fill the concavity of this instrument with it, which has this form.
Place it at the extremity of his part where the medicine concavity is applied, just as the concavity of a cochlear's radius.
And place the instrument with the medicine over the ulcer itself: and let the patient lie on his side so that the saliva flows from his mouth due to the internal medicine, and does not descend from there to his throat and harm him.
Then hold your hand with the medicine.
And you apply that quantity to the ulcer for half an hour, until you see it blackened and the biting pain subdued by the medicine.
And if you wish to take coturnix and wrap it around the end of the radius, and pour coturnix with the medicine into the tube from above, until the coturnix adheres to the ulcer. Do this many times until you achieve what you want from the cauterization of the ulcer.
Then release it: for it heals of itself and falls off in three days, or four.
If you need to apply the medicine again, apply it: and after cauterization, wash around the wound with wet wool soaked in butter, and cleanse the area around it with medicine, and let it be washed with cold water.
And let it be treated externally with embrocations, and internally with gargles until it is cured.
Therefore, this method of cure is more healthful than incision and farther removed from fear.
And sometimes the wound is treated even with something finer than cauterization and incision: it is treated with fumigation, according to this manner.
Take a reed, and hyssop, and origanum, and rue, and saffron, and chamomile, and abrotanum, and similar herbs: and gather all these together, or some of them in a pot, and submerge them with vinegar, and boil: let the pot be lined with clay properly: and there be a hole in the middle of the pot, over which an inclined instrument be placed according to this manner.
Let it be made of silver or copper: and insert the end, which has a ball, into the patient's mouth until the vapor rises to the wound above the tube, until the wound is sufficiently numbed.
Then apply it repeatedly to the same area until it heals.
And be careful not to perform this cure at the beginning of the onset of the abscess.
For he usually adds in a gangrene: and you should not do this except at the declination of its heat.
If however this instrument is not at hand for you, then take a reed, and wrap its end in the bark of willow: so that the mouth of the sick does not get burned: for the bark of willow prevents the vapor from burning the mouth: and this is for good care with health.
On the Extraction of Thorns and Bones from the Throat.
Chapter XXXVIII.
Many times a mouth, or a fish spine, or something else adheres in the throat.
Therefore, you must extract what is apparent above what it has fallen upon, after you press the tongue with an instrument at the solar plexus, and it becomes clear to you what is in the throat.
And what does not appear to you and is hidden in the throat, you must make the sick person vomit before the food is digested in the stomach.
For indeed, the attached matter may emerge through vomiting.
Or the sick person should swallow a fragment of a date, or a lettuce root, or a piece of dry bread: or he should take a fragment of a soft sea sponge, and tie it on a thread, then swallow it.
When therefore it reaches the place where the thorns or mouth pieces are, and they are extracted, then they emerge. If therefore it does not emerge with what we have said, then use the instrument made of lead in this form.
Let it be thicker than the radius slightly, and let there be a curvature at its end, which it should introduce into its throat with ease: and he himself should have his head raised upwards.
And beware of the touch of its epiglottis, lest he cough, and push with it the mouth, or a needle, or introduce it himself with his hand.
What the patient introduces is better: for he knows the place of the afflication due to his own experience; and he should push downward or draw his hand with the instrument upward, doing all this according to the quantity prepared for him until he withdraws.
Of the Extraction of the Sucker.
Chapter XXXIX.
When the treatment with the sucker is combined with what I said in the division of treatment with medicines, and it does not effect relief, then consider in the throat of the patient when exposed to the sun, or near the sun after you have pressed his tongue with the instrument I have described to you.
If therefore your patient falls on the sucker, remove it with a small hook, or with fine forceps.
If it is not possible with them, then take a concave cannula and introduce it into the patient's throat nearly to the throat. Then introduce into the concavity of the cannula a heated iron rod with fire.
Do this repeatedly: and let the patient abstain from water for the entire day.
Then let him take the treated water that is full of cold water, and open his mouth in it: and wet his mouth with it, and do not swallow anything from it: and move the water one hour after another with his hand.
For as soon as the leech perceives water, it falls.
If it does not come out as we have narrated, then fumigate the patient with bedbugs, or with an ear with the instrument we have narrated in fumigating the wound.
Do this many times, for it will fall on its own.
And the method of operation in fumigating is, take a pot in which there are live prunes with fire: and the pot be covered with a cover, in the middle of which is a hole: and the end of the instrument be arranged at that hole.
Then project the fumigation, and place the patient's mouth at the end of the tube, and close his mouth so that the fumigation does not come out, until you know that the fumigation has reached the leech.
For the leech will fall immediately.
If it does not fall, then repeat the fumigation many times.
And let the patient endure thirst, and eat salted food, garlic, and do not drink water. It is therefore necessary that it come out with this regimen.
And this is the form of the instrument with which the leech is extracted from the throat when it falls upon itself.
It is similar to forceps, as you can see; except for this curvature that enters the throat.
And its end is similar to the beak of a stork bird, where there is the roughness of a file: when it grasps something, it does not release it entirely.
On the Incision of Abscesses, and Their Section and Treatment in General.
Chapter XL.
Species apostematum multae sunt, variae modorum, secundum quod rememoratio eorum venit, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et diversae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.
Which is one, from the species of abscess within itself, and because it includes moisture.
And the second method is due to the locations where it occurs in the body.
For an abscess occurring in the head is different from one occurring in the anus: and an abscess occurring in a fleshy place is different from one occurring at joints: and each has its own judgment according to its nature.
And from abscesses there are some which should not be incised unless after the maturation of pus in them and its completion: and among these are those which should be incised while they are raw and do not mature according to their completion.
Such as abscesses that are near joints.
For an abscess that occurs near a joint and persists for a long time, causing putrefaction of what is around it, perhaps the ligaments or nerves of that joint are damaged: which is why it is a cause of greater contraction of that limb.
Or it is an abscess near the principal limb: for if you delay the incision of it until it matures, it will harm either that limb or through that limb to other limbs.
It is near the anus, therefore perforate it, being immature: and you should not perforate a raw abscess, not one of complete digestion, except what is near the anus, lest it putrefy deeply, and extend to the interior of the anus, and may become a fistula, or may remain unhealed at its terminus. You should know the time of perforating the abscess that is matured to completion: and it is when there is a relief from pain, a recession of fever, and a diminution of redness, swelling, and sharpness in the head of the abscess: and other signs. And you should make the same perforation in the lower part of the abscess and in the more prominent elevation: and let the perforation be longitudinal if the abscesses are in parts of the hands and feet, and places of the limbs, tendons, nerves, and arteries, and finally in all equal places where there is no reflection.
In those that reflect, go with the perforation according to that membrane.
When the abscess is in fatty areas: then it is better to delay the perforation until its digestion is confirmed, as we have said according to completion.
For if you perforate it before that, the course of the virus will be prolonged from there, and there will be much foulness and corruption, and perhaps its lips will become hardened and deep.
And some abscesses are perforated according to the width of the body out of necessity: or according to that which the limb needs.
And you should administer a small perforation in small abscesses, and a large perforation in large abscesses: or multiple sections similar in size to the abscess.
And they are from abscesses, in which it is necessary to cauterize the skin: and cut when already formed like a membrane, and made at an end, which is now dead: as that which happens in many, let it be suspected, and in buboes.
And among them are those that are cut with a section having three angles.
And among them is that from which cutting is done like the figure of a myrtle leaf.
Like an abscess in the groin.
And among them are those in which a circular cut and a lunar cut are administered: and similar to these from cuts.
That, however, which does not have a head, as are gentle superficial abscesses, should be pierced with a superficial puncture, or merely with a flat instrument.
And it is necessary when the abscess is large and has already collected much pus to pierce it so as not to rush and extract all the pus at that hour: rather, extract from that part itself.
Then lance the abscess until another day.
Then extract some more from the pus again.
Perform this many times according to the severity until it comes out: especially if the patient is weak in constitution, or a pregnant woman, or a young child, or an old decrepit man: for the animal spirit is often released from the body with the expulsion of the pus: and perhaps the weak patient dies, and you do not notice.
Therefore, be wary of this chapter; it is a great caution.
And after your perforation, by which you perforate abscesses, you must clean the wound: and consider.
If therefore the wound of the abscess is small, or the incision flat, then administer linseed, or old wool.
And if the abscess is large, and there are many perforations in the fissures, then you must introduce linseed into every perforation until they reach the bottom.
And if in the abscess you have cut a part of the skin, or concave it in the surrounding area: then you must fill it with old wool, or as when a cloth is woven, or combed without moisture with linen down: and bind it until the third day.
Then discard it, and care for that with what is necessary from ointment until it heals.
And if blood flows during your operation, then administer cold water and vinegar. After they are imbued with these, place them over the place where the blood is flowing many times.
And if the bleeding persists, then you must administer treatment and care, and powders as I have narrated in many places of this our book, and by division.
And if it is in the time of winter, and the location of the abscess is many nerves: then you must pour in small amounts of warm wine and oil, and place them over the areas.
And if it is in the summer, and the areas are fleshy: then you must place small amounts imbued in water and oil, or both in wine and oil, and let all of that be cool.
When the third day comes, as we have said, then you should drain the abscess, and cleanse it, and administer to its care what he needs until it is healed.
This is therefore what is necessary to be known for the universal cure of abscesses.
According to the division however, I have already spoken of every abscess, how the way to its cure is considered individually.
§ On the incision of abscesses that occur on the skin of the head.
Chapter XLII.
Small abscesses occur on the skin of the head, and they are of the kind known as Nodora, which contain sac-like structures within their tunics: almost as if they were infected chicken eggs.
And there are many species of these.
From these, some are fatty: and some contain a moisture similar to mud: and some contain a moisture similar to wet straw and porridge: and those of similar nature, and some are stony and hard.
And in the incision of all of them, and their extraction, there is no fear, as long as the incision does not affect the arteries.
And the operation in incising them is to try it with the instrument whose form will come after these, which is called Intromissum, until you know what it contains.
For if it contains moisture, then dry it by incising it along its length with a superficial cut: according to this form.
And begin with the section from line b to line g. For when the humidity is evacuated, then scrape away the excrescence that contains that humidity, and do not leave anything entirely from it.
For it will return if anything remains from it. Then immerse it in Egyptian ointment if it is present: and if not, in water and salt. Fill the wound with it and leave it until another day.
For it will corrode what remains from the excrescence. Then apply the Egyptian ointment a second time and a third time, and if needed, continue until you are certain that nothing remains from the excrescence. Then care for the wound with ointment until it heals.
And if the abscess contains a fatty nodule: then dry it according to this form, with a section having the shape of a cross: and insert hooks between the limbs of the section, and scrape away the abscess from all parts: and try your skill in extracting the membrane that contains it.
And if the artery opposes you, then do what I will tell you about afterward.
And similarly do this in the abscess if it is stony, following the same section and care as we have said. And the section for the stony abscess is easier: for it contains little blood and humidity.
And sometimes there are certain abscesses of this kind in the head where there is no humidity at all.
Or place the perforation always from the lower part of them, so that the course of the healing fluid may reach the lower parts.
Then care for it with what is appropriate for them according to the treatment.
¶ Incision of Stropharia on the neck.
Caput XLII.
Such boils often occur on the neck, and under the坐席 (assells), and in the groin: and sometimes they occur in other parts of the body.
And over those which occur from them on the neck, there is one, and many: they generate from each other: and every Stropharia from them is within its own proper sheath, as is the case with nodes and boils of the head, as we have described.
And there are many species of these Stropharia.
And from them come the stone-like ones: and from them come those that contain moisture: and from them come the malignant ones, which do not respond to treatment.
For the one that you see has a good disposition upon touch, whose color is close to that of the skin, and moves to every part, and is not attached with the nerves of the neck, nor with the glands, nor with the artery, nor is deep: it must be incised superficially from the upper part to the lower part of the body along the line, b. to the line, g., and scrape it from all parts: and spread two flaps of skin with a hook, or with many hooks if needed, as we have said in the boils of the head, and extract it gradually.
And it is for caution, so that a vein or nerve may not be injured.
And let the spatium be not very acute: that it does not add to your hand when incising, or trouble the patient, and cut what is not necessary.
If, however, you cut a vein or an artery, or if it prevents you from operating, then apply to the wound dust of zegi, ground, or certain powders that stop the bleeding and constrict the wound, and leave it until the sharpness of the abscess subsides and the wound becomes softened: or begins and wants to putrefy.
For the blood is stopped and therefore return to your operation until you complete it.
Then care for it.
If the entire Strophula is cut, then you must bring together the two lips of the wound and apply firm stitches immediately, after you see that there is no longer any excess bleeding.
If, however, you see that there is still excess bleeding due to the size of the Strophula, then you must proceed to cut its root and remove it: and administer the stitch as we have said.
And whatever contains humors from Strophuli, make a superficial perforation in it: so that the place of its maturity may appear to you: and place the perforation below what follows the body, as we have said.
Then administer after the perforation with a linen cloth and similar things, so that it may consume what remains from the corruption, until when you see the wound already cleansed: then care for it with flesh-generating ointment until it heals.
¶ Section of the Epiglottis from an Abscess Occurring in the Throat.
Head XLIII.
The ancients performed this section of the epiglottis, and I have not seen anyone in our land who has done so: and this is the text of their words.
In those who have synanchia, it is necessary to avoid the section of the epiglottis: for no benefit is achieved through it, since all the veins and lung are weak.
In those who have a hot abscess in the mouth, or throat, or in both tonsils, when there is no illness in the canal, it is necessary to use the section of the epiglottis, to prevent the danger that results from prolapse. Therefore, when we wish to cut the epiglottis under three rings of the epiglottis, or four, with a small section in breadth, at the place between two rings in quantity, let the section be made as if on a sibax (a type of tissue), not on the cartilage: and this very location is suitable for the cut, because it is devoid of flesh, and the blood vessels are distant from it.
If the physician is timid, then it is necessary that he extend the throat skin with a forceps.
Then find the skin until it reaches the canal: let the blood vessel be distinct if he sees anything.
Then cut as we have described: and it is indicated above the incision of the canal from the phlegm that emerges from it, together with what is torn apart, and the cutting of the voice.
And leave the wound open for some time.
When therefore the wound is removed after the hour when combustion is feared, join the two lips of the skin wound, and it alone without the cartilage.
Then administer medicines that cause flesh to grow until it is healed.
Albucasis says.
In summary, the passage described is an exposition, not until they see that some of these abscesses have already inflamed the patient's throat. The patient has risen above death and there is a desire to cut his breathing to see if the patient will breathe again through another wound and thus be saved from death: for this reason, they ordered leaving the wound open until the malice of the illness is consumed, and the malice lasts three days or so. Therefore, they then closed the wound and treated it until it healed.
And that which I saw with my own eyes is that a servant girl took a knife and inserted it into her throat, and it hit the part of the canal of the lung.
And I was summoned to cure him, and I found her making a moan, like the moan of the dead.
Therefore, I examined the wound, and found blood that had emerged from the wound.
Therefore, I concluded that she had neither severed the vein nor the vein-glands: and air was escaping through the wound.
I treated her wound and cured it until it was healed: and nothing happened to the maid except a hoarseness in her voice: and she returned after days to a better condition.
Therefore, I say: there is no cause for fear in the section of the Epiglottis.
¶ Concerning the Section on Hernia of the Gullet.
Chapter XLIV.
This is named an Hernia of the Gullet, and it is a large abscess according to the color of the body: and it occurs very frequently in women.
And it is according to two modes: either it is natural, or it is accidental. In the natural case, indeed, there is no skill required.
Accidental, however, is according to two modes: of which one is similar to fatty knots.
And the other mode is similar to an abscess that forms from the knotting of an artery.
And there is fear in it, and it is not appropriate to apply the steel to it unless it is small: and you should probe it and investigate it with an introducer.
If therefore you find it similar to a fatty knot, and is not suspended with any vein: then cut it, as knots are cut: and extract it together with whatever it contains from the cyst, if it is in the cyst: and if not, then examine its whole extent.
Then care for the place with what is needed from the cure until it is healed.
¶ On the Section Regarding Kinds of Knots.
Head XLV. Many are the kinds of knots, and I have already described all their kinds in classification. It is necessary to explain here the difference between a Knot and an Exitura: which causes doubt. I say that when an Exitura is associated with heat, fever, and intense pain, until the effusion's agitation is subdued and putrefaction is complete, then fever and heat will cease.
When a Knot, however, does not have heat, nor fever, nor pain, and it contains them within cysts sifachin, which is their own sack, and is according to the color of the body: and their beginning is like chickpeas, and it becomes like a batter, and larger or smaller.
And they are of two kinds: either fatty, or contain moisture.
And the colors of moisture are many, as I have said in classification. Therefore, when you arrive at the cure of a Knot, you must examine it, and inquire about it first with an instrument called Intromissum, according to the form it takes as described in the chapter that follows.
And the method of inquiry for abscesses and all nodules is this: you shall take this instrument and introduce it into the more humid place which you find in the abscess: and you shall revolve your fingers with it gradually until you know that the instrument has now penetrated the skin.
Then place your hand last according to the measurement of the size of the abscess.
Then withdraw the introduced instrument and consider what emerges in its trail.
If therefore the moisture flows out, of whatever color it may be: then dry it with a superficial incision, as I said for other abscesses.
And if no moisture flows out in the trail of the introduced instrument, then know that it is a fatty abscess: therefore dry it with a superficial incision having the form of a cross, as I have shown you: and suspend it with hooks, and peel the skin from all parts with ease: and keep a cloth over it if possible, so that you may withdraw both the healthy tissue along with the nodule.
If the cyst is ruptured during the operation and it is not possible to withdraw the healthy tissue, since this often happens, then withdraw it piece by piece until nothing remains of it.
For if anything remains, whether little or much, the nodule will return according to the greatest extent.
And if it conquers you and something remains little: then fill the wound at the end of your operation with some corrosive sharp powders. Bind the wound tightly and place something hot that sits over the abscess above it, and care for it along with the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
If therefore there is a large Knot, then treat its two lips, and care for what it incorporates. If however you find contrary veins, whether pulsatile or not pulsatile: then hasten, and fill the place with sifted salt, and let it be bound for two days, or three, until the wound putrefies and the boiling of blood subsides: then return to incising what remains from the Knot.
¶ Concerning instruments from outside for cutting and perforating.
Head XLVI.
These are the forms of Intromissorum, and there are three species of them.
From these, there is the large one, and from them is the medium one, and from them is the small one.
Let them be made of iron with square ends centered, so that they can quickly enter the aposteme.
And these are the forms of Perforantia, that is, perforating: and one of them is called beris, that is, perforating: and there are three species of them.
From these, there is the large one, and the medium one, and the small one.
They convene to investigate the apostema, the abscesses, and the fistulas, and the buboes from what is between them in the bones.
And others are made round, smooth, and slender, like large needles with which saddles are sewn, made of yellow stuff, or of copper, or iron, or silver. And better are those things which are made from yellow.
And experience is also made with black lead, which convenes for the purpose of experimenting on tubes, whose concavity causes reflections, so that they are reflected with their gentle reflections.
And there are again three species. Since there are long ones from these, medium ones, and short ones, according to the width and constriction of the tube. The Form of Fishing Instruments, and there are many species. Since there are simple ones, namely those with a single curvature, and they are of three species as you can see: Large, Medium, and Small.
And there are Blind Fishing Instruments, and they are of three species.
And there are fishing instruments with two curvatures, and they are of three species: and there are fishing instruments with three curvatures, and they are of three species: and all these are necessary in their place.
And these are the forms of Knives, with which tumors and abscesses are cut and incised: and they are of three species: since there is the large, the medium, and the small.
Their extremities with which the section is made are acute, while other extremities are not acute: and they are not placed thus, unless to provide assistance in incising tumors out of fear of cutting a vein or nerve: and so that the sick may be cured through them and find a little tranquility from the burning sensation he finds during the incision of an abscess.
These are Magda, and they are of three species.
They are made of copper, and they are similar to Radius, with which alcohol is made. At the wide end, there are points of Spatiumilis hidden: and it flows to the interiors and to the exteriors when you wish, as you see.
The form of Spatiumilium which are hidden between the fingers at the aperture for abscesses: and the sick do not feel them: and they are of three species, large, medium, and small.
The form of Ventosaria with which the blood flow is cut off: and they are of three species, large, medium, and small.
Let them be made of copper or yellow metal, round, somewhat lengthwise as you see: and let them be very thin.
And these species of Ventosaria should be large and small with you: so that you can cut off the blood quickly when necessary, and then when medical assistance is not present.
However, you should not use them for the cutting off of blood in every part of the body, but only in fleshly parts: such as the legs, thighs, arms, breasts, abdomen, groin, and similar places, which are from fleshly, moist parts.
And sometimes they are made of small instruments similar to boxwood splints, according to their shape: with which the blood is cut off when it flows from the place of phlebotomy, or at the incision of a vein or artery: and sometimes they are made round according to this form.
Of the care of males' mammary glands which resemble those of women.
Chapter XLVII.
Sometimes the mammary glands of certain males swell during the completion of sleep (that is, when they begin to have nocturnal emissions) until they resemble those of women: and remain foul ulcers.
Therefore, he who wishes to avoid this should cut with a lunar blade on the mammary glands in this form from line b to line g. Then scrape off all the fatty substance.
Then fill the wound with incarnate medicine.
Then stitch the two edges of the wound together, and care for it until it heals.
If the nipple inclines downward and softens due to its size, as happens in women, then it must be incised on its upper sides with two similar lunar-shaped incisions, each of which is contiguous at the edges with the other, until a larger line contains a smaller one, in this form from line b to line g. Then scrape off the skin between the two edges and remove the fatty substance, and apply what was said regarding suturing and powders necessary for the care until it heals.
If, however, you fail to complete the incision because of the patient's restlessness or due to bleeding: then fill the wound with a strongly penetrating ointment and leave it until it dissolves what remains from the fatty substance.
Then care for it until it heals.
On the Perforation of an Abscess, which Occurs beneath the Titulus.
Chapter XLVIII. These abscesses which occur beneath the titulus are of the species of Stropharia hard ones, which contain cysts, and there are others that contain humors.
Those which contain humors should be treated with a lunar section, according to this form: from line b to line g. When all the pus in the abscess is evacuated through the wound, then fill it with the old dressing and leave it until another day.
Then remove the dressing, and treat with an appropriate ointment until it is healed.
If the abscess is of the species of nodules of Stropharia, then incise above it, as we have said in the section on equally divided Stropharia.
If the wound extends and discharges pus, then apply a cauterization to it, as we have said in what was previously stated.
On the Incision of an Abscess Occurring due to Artery and Vein.
Chapter XLIX.
When the artery is ruptured and the skin above it becomes consolidated, abscesses often occur from this: similarly, this also happens with veins, leading to abscesses and inflammation.
And the signs by which it is known that the abscess and inflammation are due to the artery and vein are as follows: for when an abscess is due to the artery, it is long and located deeply in the body. And when you press on the abscess with your fingers, you feel a kind of stridor as if there were a rush within it.
And that which is for the sake of the Vein, is round manifestly in the body.
And the section on this abscess is an error, and especially that which is under the armpits, and in the groin, and at the neck, and in many places of the body: and it is very great.
Therefore, its cure with iron must be avoided, and what is also there at the extremities, or at the head, must be avoided.
Therefore, for that which is due to the dilation of the arterial orifice, make a cut in the skin incision lengthwise.
Then open the incision with forceps, then the artery: and free it from the tunics until it is exposed.
Then insert a needle beneath it and make it penetrate until the other side, and tie the artery with a double thread at two places, as I have taught you in the extraction of the two arteries that are in the temples.
Then puncture the place which is between the two ligaments with a spatula, until all the blood therein flows out, and the abscess is dissolved.
Then administer the cure that produces pus until the ligaments fall off: thereafter, treat it with ointments suitable for it until it is healed.
If it is an abscess due to the cutting of the vein, then you must hold with your hand what is possible for you from the abscess along with the skin.
Then insert the needle beneath the place you held with your hand, and make it penetrate: and put a double thread there, until you extract it from the other side.
Then bind the boil with a good ligature as I said to you in the ligature of the vein, from two parts with two extremities of thread. If you fear that the thread will be pulled out, then introduce another needle with another thread under the boil at the site of the incision. Press and tighten your thread in four places.
Then dry the boil in its middle until what is within it comes to an end: then incise the excess skin, and release what has been tied from there.
Then place on it the poultice which has been soaked in wine and oil.
Then administer the treatment which is performed with medicines and ointments until it is cured.
¶ Of the boil that occurs from the twisting of Nerves.
Head L.
As a boil occurs in Arteria and Vena, similarly a boil occurs in Nerves: what happens to them is a blow, or it occurs from excessive labor and similar conditions: and they are most affected at helper muscles, or the calcaneus, and in every place where joints move: and it is a serious boil. Its color resembles that of the rest of the body, and it is often found in various positions without pain: and when tightened with congestion, the sick person feels it similar to a state of stupor.
And it is not a deep aggregated boil in the body, but it is under the skin, and it moves to every part, and does not go forward or anteriorly, nor backward or posteriorly.
Therefore, what pertains to joints should not be invaded with iron.
Perhaps there will be contraction.
In that which pertains to the head or the forehead, cut the skin with forceps.
If therefore it is an abscess small, then hold it with forceps and cut it from the root.
And if it is large, then hang it with a clamp, and flake off the skin: then remove it, and suture the wound: and care for it until it is healed.
¶ Concerning the incision of an abscess that occurs in the abdomen.
Chapter LI. Sometimes in the bellies and in other parts of their bodies, certain people are afflicted with growths called fungalia, resembling fungi.
Of which the root is thin, and their head is large, with the lips reversed.
And it is small in them: and there is also something in them that grows greatly.
And I myself have indeed seen a man, and in his belly were two fungalia, which were more similar to fungi than other things: there was no difference between them, white, with minute roots, and their lips were reversed. They were found, and a constant moisture flowed from them.
I cut into them, and found in one as much as about 18 ounces and in the other about 6 ounces. The operation in cutting them is this: then consider, if the patient is moist, and the color of the fungalia is white, moist, with thin roots: then cut it with a broad forceps, and have cauterization by fire present.
For oftentimes much blood is expelled during its section: therefore if the blood overcomes you, then cauterize it.
If you see a weak and timid one from incision with iron, then take a thread made decently of lead, and bind it with it athelul: the measure of which is what we have said, and let it be removed on two days.
Then add to the binding of lead.
Therefore do not cease to bind the lead whenever it presses on the wound until it is cut off and falls away by itself without effort.
If the wound is large, there is something of fear and weakness in its incision: it is particularly so in the abdomen.
Yet it is possible to incise the middle of it.
Then cauterize it, so that it does not return.
Then care for it until the wound is healed.
And beware lest you suppose that a wound of a dark color, with few sensations, and a foul appearance, is such: for it is a malignant cancerous sore, and I forgive myself for mentioning Cancer in this context.
On the care of the prominence of the navel.
Head 52.
The prominence of the navel is caused by many factors.
Or from fissures near the abdomen, and what exits from it is athluv or intestine, according to what happens in other ruptures.
Either from the blood that flows from the Vein, or from the Artery, as has been stated.
Or from the constriction of the windway.
If, however, it is because of a crack and the exit of pus: then its color is similar to the color of the body, and it is soft, without pain, and appears to have a different location.
And if it is because of intestinal discharge, then its location is more distinct from what we have described.
When therefore you press it with your fingers, it disappears; then it returns, and perhaps there is a sound with it: it is greatly magnified at the entrance of the bath, and the pain is severe.
If, however, it is because of moisture, it is soft; then it does not disappear when you press it with your hand, nor is there any constriction or addition.
If it is because of blood, then it appears as an abscess turning to blackness from the clot.
If, however, it is because of flesh that has grown: then the abscess is heavy, large, hard, and is fixed according to the size of one unit.
If, however, it is because of windiness, then its touch is soft. And the operation on it is such that you should consider whether the prominence of the navel is due to blood from the Artery, or the Vein, or windiness: then you must refrain from treating it.
For there is fear and caution in this, as I taught you in the chapter where I said that abscesses are due to the Artery or the Vein.
If the umbilical protuberance is due to the intestine or bladder: then you should order the patient to hold his breath and stand stretched out.
Then mark the circumference of the entire umbilicus with wax.
Then order him to be laid on his back with his body under your hands.
Then spread the spatula widely over the circumference of the umbilicus on the place you marked with wax.
Then extend the middle incision upwards, using a large hook.
Then tie it tightly around the circumference with a strong thread or with a silk ligature: and make the knot of the ligature alexithymatic.
Then open the extended middle incision above the ligament.
If you can now grasp it with the ligature, then remove the alexithymatic and insert your index finger, and push the intestine into the abdomen: and if you find the bladder, then take it with a hook and cut its excess.
If, however, it is an artery or vein, then mark it around it extensively.
Then return to your operation.
And take two needles and insert two strong threads into them: and insert two needles around the circumference you made around the incision in the shape of a cross, making them penetrate.
Then stitch the incision in four places over the needles: and if you wish, remove the needles and leave the area until the flesh decays: and it will fall off by itself: or cut it out when it is reduced and decayed.
Then care for it using what is necessary from ointments until it is healed.
If the prominence of the navel is from flesh growing into it, or from moisture: then it should be made concave by suppuration, as we have said.
And extract the blood or moisture that you find in it.
Then care for it using what will solidify the area.
¶ Of the care for CANCER. Head 53.
For I have not been able to cure anyone from it: nor have I seen anyone before me who survived it.
And the operation for it, when located as we have said, is to precede and relieve the sick person of black bile several times.
Then perform phlebotomy if you find it with a clear indication of congestion.
Then prepare the patient with a preparation in which he will be placed during the operation.
Then project into the Cancer those hooks which fit him.
Then concave it from every part with the skin, according to examination, until nothing remains from the roots thereof: and permit the blood to flow, and do not cut it quickly, but express the places, and wipe away all gross blood with your hand, or with what is possible there with instruments.
If, however, the blood flow is excessive from the incision of an artery or vein, then cauterize the vein until the blood stops.
Then care for it with the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
¶ Concerning the Care of Hydrophobia.
Head IV.
We have already described the divisions of Hydrophobia and how the aggregation of water occurs in each species. We have also mentioned the signs of each species and its treatment with medicines.
And that which is treated with iron is none other than the species of asclitis alone: and iron should not be applied to the species of tympanites or hypoaortic, for these are mortal conditions.
When you have treated this species of Hydrophobia (tympanites) with medicines and the treatment has not been effective, then consider.
For if the patient has already experienced weakness, or there is another illness besides Hydrophobia, such as a cough or bowel discharge and similar conditions, then beware not to treat him with iron, for it is feared that this will be harmful.
If thou seest a sick person abounding in strength, and there is no ill with him save hydropisis alone: and he is neither a child nor an old man: then the measure of operation in such a case is, that thou lift the sick person standing between thy hands, and let the attendant follow behind him and press his belly by thrusting water to the lower part with a comb.
Then take the thorn spoon according to this form.
It is a thorn spoon of two sharp parts, long, with acute extremities like a spoon.
Yet in it there should be some shortness gradually, so that you do not pass with it during the operation to the intestines and injure them.
Then consider.
For if the generation of hydropisis is from the part of the intestines, then thou must lengthen with the incision from the navel by the quantity of three fingers, downward directly above the comb.
If, however, the generation of hydropisis is due to the illness of the liver: then let thy incision be on the left side from the navel by three fingers.
And if its generation is due to the spleen, then let the incision be on the right side: and it is not fitting also that the incision be on the side behind which the sick person wishes to lie, so that the excesses do not flow to that weak place.
Then puncture the entire skin with the instrument.
Then introduce into that incision, and lift thy hand with the thorn spoon between the skin, and scrape as if thou wast scraping it off. And let the quantity scraped be the quantity of a nail, or about that.
Then perforate the sinew until Spatumile reaches the vacuum place: and it is the place of water.
Then extract it, and introduce into the opening an instrument, whose form is described here.
And it is similar to a cannula: made of silver, or brass, or gold, soft and polished; at its lower part there is a small opening, and on its sides are three openings, two from one side, and one from the other side: and its end is cut according to the manner of a reed's cut end, as you see: at its upper end there is a ring.
For when the instrument reaches the water, then it immediately descends above the instrument, so evacuating from the water a medium quantity in an hour.
For if you evacuate from it more than is required, the sick person might die in an hour through the resolution of his own vital spirits: or it happens to him a fainting that approaches death.
But evacuate from it according to the quantity of its virtue, and according to how the disposition of the sick person is indicated to you by the strength and goodness of his pulse.
Then extract the instrument, and retain the water.
Because it is retained immediately due to the skin which retains the opening above the sinew: about which I have spoken, so that you perforate it according to this manner.
Then repeat the procedure with the instrument on the following day, if you see the sick person tolerate that: and extract from the water a small quantity. Perform this for a few days without fear, and guard yourself against error: until there remains in the water only a little.
If, however, you fear for the sick person and let much matter remain in the water: then take care of it with burial in hot sand, and with much sweat in a bath and sun, and let it expect dehydration from thirst: and take care of it with drying medicines until it is cured: and cauterize over the stomach, spleen, and kidney after the extraction of the water: according to what I have narrated in what preceded.
On the care of infants born in places where their urinary passages have not been perforated.
Head LV. When one of the infants emerges from his mother's womb, and the urethral opening of its sex is not perforated, or the aperture is narrow, or in an improper place.
Therefore, it is necessary to provide assistance with the immediate perforation of its urethral opening as soon as it is born using a very fine Spatuli blade, according to this form.
Then place a fine pin made of lead in the aperture and ligate it: and hold it for three days, or four.
When therefore the infant wishes to pass urine, remove it and mix it.
Then replace it.
And if you do not place lead, it is possible that the urine, which flows over the place, will prevent it from being closed.
For the one whose aperture is narrow, it is treated with lead, as we have said, over many days until it is enlarged.
Those, however, in which there is a hole in an improper place, are injured.
Because of this, in those who are born with it, the hole is at the end of the spinal column: hence it cannot intake anteriorly, until he elevates the rod by his hand to the higher parts. Neither is there generation for this reason, namely, because the sperm cannot reach the matrix in a straight course: and it is a foul disease to a great extent.
And the method of operation in this case is to have the patient lie face downward on his back.
Then extend the head of the spinal column with your left hand by a strong extension, and cut the head of the spinal column from the place of the penis with a sharp needle or a sharp spoon-like instrument: just as you would cut a reed, or as you might scrape something, so that its middle becomes similar to the head of the spinal column: and let the hole fall in the middle as it should.
And beware to you during the operation from the flow of blood.
For this has happened many times.
Therefore, oppose it with what cuts the blood, and take care of the wound until it is healed.
¶ Concerning abscesses in the prepuce and head of the penis, and corruption, blackening, and adherences.
Chapter LVII.
These abscesses often occur in the spinal column, and there is an突出的污秽肉块。
And from it there is a malignant one, and another that is not malignant.
Therefore, the non-malignant one should be suspended with a fine hook and cut it until you cleanse it entirely.
Then place it under the wound submerged in Egyptian ointment. Then treat it after that with dyafinicon ointment until it heals.
If it is malignant, of a foul color, then you should apply cauterization after incising it and give its reason.
If, however, the malignant tissue is within the foreskin of an uncircumcised man, and part of it is inside, and part outside, then you should remove the malignant tissue that is inside first, until it heals. Then treat the outside part: for when you treat it together, the foreskin may adhere improperly.
And even in the testicles, and the foreskin may become blackened and corrupted.
Therefore, you should cauterize the entire area that is already blackened, or about to become corrupted, or that is already corrupted.
Then apply a layer over it after that with honey that has been dissolved in flour of grain kernels and sifted herbs.
Then treat it with the remaining treatment until it heals.
If, however, there is bleeding, then apply cauterization with the lunar caustic in this manner.
Cauterium enim est iuuativum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.
In adhaerentia vero praeputii cum capite virgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter vulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput virgae ab omnibus parte.
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite virgae, et ex praeputio.
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam velociter.
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput virgae cum panno linii subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.
Deinde curetur cum vino stiptico, donec consolidetur. ¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.
Caput LVII.
Circumcision is not a solution of continuity, as are other wounds; yet since it is an operation of ours, by our will, and its use is proper for boys, it is necessary that we mark in it an operation better and a way leading more gently to health.
I say that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books: for they do not use it in their laws, and it is only what we have acquired through experience.
Because I found a greater part of surgeons and bloodletters use the purification, cutting with a knife, and with forceps: they also use cauterization, and ligature with thread, and incision with a blade.
And I have indeed tested all these methods and did not find any better method of purification using forceps and ligature with thread.
For in purification using a knife, the skin often gets damaged.
For the skin of the prepuce has two layers: therefore, perhaps the upper layer is damaged, while the lower layer remains intact. This necessitates an incision to reach and damage the other layer, causing future pain.
And with the purification done by cauterization, which surgeons perform using their fingers, the incision at the tip of the male member is not secured: for it might enter the opening there.
In purification using a blade, the iron might escape, and ruin your operation. Moreover, the skin of boys is naturally short, and often they are born in such a manner that they do not require purification, and I have seen this.
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum. Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est utellus oxygincinatus in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo rosae recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem. Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.
For it will not harm him.
Therefore treat it with what we have described in the chapter on powders to consolidate wounds. And if it flows from the skin beyond measure and escapes to the upper parts, it will not harm him even.
Therefore treat it with what we have said until it is cured.
¶ Concerning the Extraction of Retained Vesica Virginae.
Head 58.
Retention of urine in the bladder occurs from the use of powder made from stone, or frozen blood, or pus, or flesh grown from it, and similar substances as described in our discussion on methods of cure.
And if the urine is not relieved, and you see that the retention is due to a stone already in the neck of the bladder: then the patient should be treated by being placed with his knees on a bed.
Then his feet should be placed on his back, and he should stretch his abdomen from the upper part of his back, and the patient should strain and breathe hard as much as possible.
Therefore it is pressed against the neck of the bladder to expel the stone towards the rear, which is why the urine is relieved.
And if it is not relieved even with what we have said, and the patient is violently distressed: then you should administer its extraction using an instrument called a siringa, which has this form: It should be made of silver, and be thin, soft, and concave like the radius of a bird's feather in fineness. Its length should resemble that of the middle and index fingers of a hand: it should have a fine tube at its head.
And the method of退出静脉是，你应取一根双股线，并在其末端系上羊毛或棉线，好的缝合：然后将线的末端插入导管的下部：如有多余羊毛可以用钳子剪去，但要迅速将线连同羊毛一起送入管内，如同提起。
Then anoint the导管 with oil or butter and unguent: and make the patient sit on a chair, and dress the blister with the stick, using oily substances and olive oil, and warm water.
Then insert the导管 into the stick with facility until it reaches the root of the vaginal opening.
Then double it up from the part above the navel. Then push the导管 into it until it reaches the bladder, and the patient should feel that it has reached the empty place. And this does not happen in this order unless the passage through which it goes is tortuous.
Then gradually extend the thread with wool.
For the vein follows the wool.
Then withdraw it and make the vein flow through the urinary passage. Repeat the procedure and do not cease until the bladder is emptied and the patient finds relief. ¶ On the quality of bladder clistherization with Clepsydra.
Head LXIX.
For it is deaf, that is, closed.
And therein are three foramina, two on one side, and one on the other side, as you see.
And the concave place, in which that which is pressed upon is situated, should be such that when it is smelled without addition, a certain quantity is emitted. And when drawn with it, something is drawn by humidity: and when pressed, it expels with it to a distance: according to what is done by the clepsydra, by which naphtha, that is, Greek fire, is projected in battles of Mars.
When therefore you wish to project the humors into the bladder, insert the end of the clepsydra into the humor, and draw with it what is pressed upon toward the upper part, for the humor is drawn into the concavity of the clepsydra. Then insert the end of it into the rod, as we have described for the syringe.
Then press the humor with what is pressed upon it, for the humor then reaches the bladder immediately, so that the patient feels it. The form of the clyster is thin, through which the clyster is introduced into the bladder.
Then insert the thread forcefully through those openings, as they are turned. Then aggregate the circle, as an alsofract is aggregated: after you place on it what you wish from the humors, and oils, and waters.
Then ligate it on the instrument: and do so with it as you did with the bladder from manual expression, until the humidity reaches the bladder.
¶ For the Extraction of Stones.
Head LX. We have already spoken of the division of stone species and their cure with medicines: and I described the difference between a stone generated in the kidneys and the bladder, and its signs in their entirety: and I spoke of the stone for which operation is performed by hand and cutting: and there is the stone generated properly in the bladder: and that which is fixed on a stick: and I am narrating this with a clear and abbreviated exposition.
I say, therefore, that the stone generated in the bladder happens most frequently to children.
And from its signs, the urine that comes out of the bladder is similar to water in its fineness: and there appears in it white sand, and the patient rubs his stick and labors with it, and often hangs down. Then it is raised up, and they exit with it through their anus in many of them.
And the cure is easy for children as long as they are following it up to fourteen years of age.
And it is difficult in old people.
In youths, however, it is intermediate, depending on whether the Stone is larger or smaller. For the case of a smaller Stone, the cure is more difficult.
When we come to the cure, it is necessary first to cleanse the sick person with a clyster that will expel all the feces from their intestines: for sometimes this prevents the discovery of the Stone during examination. Then the sick person should be held by their feet and shaken, and moved downward: so that the Stone may descend to the depth of the bladder, or may leap from a high place several times.
Then make the sick person sit between your prepared hands, and their legs should be positioned under their own hips, so that the bladder may become completely inclined downward.
Then examine him, and touch him externally.
If therefore you feel the Stone in the space, then hasten immediately with the knife above it.
If it does not fall under your touch at all, then you must wipe your left hand with oil and place the index finger if the patient is a child, or the middle finger if the patient is an adult, into their anus, and examine for the Stone until it is beneath your finger: and turn it gradually towards the neck of the bladder.
Then press upon it with your finger and push it toward the exterior against the place whose section you wish to make: and command your assistant to press the bladder with his hand, and command another assistant to extend the testicles with his right hand upward: and with his other hand, remove the skin which is beneath the testicles in the part from the place where the section is.
Then insert the Spatium incids, whose form is this.
And cut into that which is between the anus and the testicles, and not in the middle, to the left side of the birth canal: and let the section be above the stone, and your finger be in the anus: and let the section be transverse, so that the external part be broad, and the internal part narrow, according to the quantity that it is possible for the exit of the Stone from there to be not greater.
For perhaps the finger which is in the anus compresses the stone at the section, and it exits without difficulty.
And know that for the stone which has angles and margins, the exit is difficult because of this.
And from this it is soft, like a gland, and round: and its exit becomes easy.
Therefore, for the one that has angles and margins, add in the fissure.
And if it does not exit thus, then you must probe above it: or bind above it with a bandage decently placed, whose end is like the Moon, binding over the stone and not allowing it to come out of it: or you must insert under it a thin instrument with a curved end.
If you cannot pass through it, then enlarge the opening slightly.
If something overcomes you from the blood, cut it away with forceps.
If there is more than one stone, then push the largest one first into the neck of the bladder.
Then cut above it.
Then push the smaller one after that: and similarly do if there are more than two.
If it is very large, then cut above it with a large incision.
Since one of the two things happens to the sick person, either they die, or there occurs in them a constant leakage of urine: therefore, because the place does not harden completely.
Truly, administer the expulsion of it until it comes out: or use ingenuity in breaking it with forceps until you extract it piece by piece.
When you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with balsam, and myrrh, and dragon's blood: and bind it up, and place over it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or rose oil and cold water: that a hot abscess may be settled.
Then raise the sick person's head over its neck, and do not loosen the bandage until the third day.
When you have loosed it, embrocate the place with water and much oil.
Then care for it with Dyafinicon ointment and Basilicon ointment until it is healed.
If a hot abscess forms in the wound and is corroded, and similar things occur: as if the blood coagulates in the bladder and prevents urine from being excreted, and it is known from the passage of blood with urine.
Therefore insert your finger into the wound and抽出来那血液。 (注：此处翻译为“抽出来那血液”以保持原文意思，但通常医学描述会使用更合适的词汇如“抽出”。)
For if it remains, it provokes the corruption of the bladder and its putrefaction.
Then wash the wound with vinegar and water, and salt: and apply whatever is appropriate for its cure until it is healed.
And it is necessary for the duration of the cure to bind two thighs and apply, caused by the medicines placed over the area.
If the stone is small and is in the meatus urethrae, and is embedded therein, and prevents the exit of urine: then treat it along with what I mention before you reach the operation.
For you will be excused many times from the operation through this treatment, for I have already proven it. And take the Perforator made of steel, whose form is a triangle with an acute, fixed point on wood.
Then take a thread and tie it with a rod so that it does not return to the bladder.
Then insert the perforating iron into the rod with facility until the Perforator reaches the stone: and turn the Perforator gradually with your hand on the stone: and ensure the perforation, until you make it penetrate from the other side.
Therefore, urine is immediately discharged.
Then press your hand over what remains from the stone on the external part of the vagina.
For it breaks itself and is discharged with the urine, and the sick person is cured.
If, however, this cure is not prepared for you, because of something that prohibits it from there: then tie a thread under the stone, and another above the stone. Then dry above the stone on the same vagina between the two ties.
Then extract it.
Then undo the ligature and cleanse the frozen blood, which forms in the wound.
And a ligature of thread under the stone is not necessary except to prevent it from returning to the bladder: and another ligature above, unless when the thread is untied after the stone has been expelled, the skin returns to its place and covers the wound: and for this reason you must tie the upper thread when you bind it, so that you lift the skin upwards, so that it returns in its proper place and covers the wound, as we have said.
**On the Extraction of Stones from Women.**
**Head 61.**
Stones are not commonly formed in women.
If, however, a stone does occur in one of them, then the cure is difficult and is hindered because of many reasons.
Their vagina is: that the woman perhaps is a virgin. And secondly, because you will not find a woman who exposes herself to a physician when she is chaste, or from married men.
Thirdly, because you will not find a woman who knows this art well, especially the manipulation with the hand.
And fourthly, because of the distance from the stone: hence deep incision is needed, and there is fear.
And if necessity prompts you to do this, then you must take a woman physician who knows well: and such are not easily found.
If, however, you abstain from that, then seek a chaste physician, subtle, and present a woman midwife well versed in women's affairs, or a woman who professes to have skill in this art: make her present, and especially command her to do all that you instruct her about the stone. Firstly, that she should examine whether the woman is a virgin: then it must be that she inserts her finger into her anus and seeks the stone.
If therefore she finds it, she should constrict it with her finger, and then command the midwife to insert her finger into the infirm woman's vagina and inquire about the stone, after placing her left hand on the bladder and compressing it with a good compression. If therefore she finds the stone, then it must be that she gradually moves it from the opening of the bladder downward with all her strength until she reaches the base of the thigh.
Then cut above it opposite the middle of the vagina at the base of the thigh, from whichever side she prepares herself and feels the stone: and her finger should not be removed from the stone, constricting it below: and let the incision be small first.
Then insert the ray above that section.
If therefore it feels the stone, then add to that section according to a proportional quantity what the stone exits from it.
And know that the species of stones are many. From these, it is small and large, soft and rough, long, and round with branches.
Therefore know its species, so that it is indicated to you through this concerning what you wish.
If therefore the blood overcomes you, then add in the place where it was spoken of, ground, and hold it for one hour until the blood is discharged.
If the flow of blood overcomes you, and you know that the expulsion of blood is from the artery that was incised, then place powder on that spot and compress it with a suitable ligature. Do not remove that: and let the stone pass naturally without forcibly extracting it.
For the weak woman may die.
Then care for the wound.
When therefore the sharpness of the blood is subdued after a few days, and the area putrifies, then return to your operation until the stone exits.
¶ Of the incision for watery hernia.
Chapter LXII.
Watery discharge is not, unless it is an aggregation of humidity in the white flatus, which is beneath the skin containing the testicles with sperm: and it is called flatus. And sometimes it is within a natural fold of its own skin, which nature prepared for it until the sperm is emitted: this is another sperm, and it is the skin of the testicle between the white flatus, which we have said, and it does not occur except rarely.
And the generation of this condition in the testicles is due to a weakness that occurs in them: hence this material is discharged to them.
And sometimes it happens as a result of striking the testicles.
And this humidity has many colors. For its color is either inclining to yellow, or bloody red, or foul, black, or watery white, and this latter is the more prevalent.
For if it is in the white flatus as we have said, then the abscess is round about as long as the figure of the sperm: and the testicle does not appear, because the humidity contains it from every side.
And if the humidity is within its own fold of skin, then the abscess is round with a part resembling the sperm, and for this reason the man suspects that it is another sperm.
And if the humidity is between the skin of the testicles and the white flatus, then it becomes perceptible.
When therefore you wish to know the color of humidity, then experience the color of humidity in an abscess with the Inserted Square, whose form has preceded.
According to that which emerges in the trace of the Inserted Square, judge concerning that which is between it.
When therefore we come to treatment with a iron, then it must be prescribed to the patient that he be phlebotomized if possible for him, and you shall see his body full.
Then it is turned upside down on its back on a high stand, and place many cloths beneath it.
Then sit you on its left side, and command your servant to sit on its right side, who shall extend his rod to one of the two sides of the skin of the testicles and to the part of the flank.
Then take a broad spoon and dry the skin of the testicles from the middle along their length until near the septum. Make the incision straight according to the distance of the line which divides the testicle skin, until it reaches the white fat: and scrape it out and observe, or be careful to cut it: and let your scraping be such that it comes from the part that hangs more with the egg: and carefully examine with the scraping according to the amount that is possible for you.
Then puncture the white fat completely with a large hole, and extract all the water. Then separate the section between the two labia with forceps, and extend it to the superior part, and do not touch the skin enclosing the testicle: and cut it however possible for you, either totally or piece by piece, especially the finer side.
For if you do not thoroughly examine, in his incision there will not be security lest water return.
If the egg proceeds outward from its skin during your operating hour: then when you complete the incision so far, reduce it.
Then join the two skin flaps of the testicle with a suture.
Then care for it as for other wounds until it heals.
If you find an egg corrupted by black mold, then you must tie the suspensory vessels, fearing a flow of blood.
Then cut the testicle with its suspensory ligament, and extract the egg: thereafter care for it as we have said.
If indeed water is aggregated in two parts, then know that there are two branches: dry the other part equally as you did the other.
And if it is equal to you, so that the operation is one, then do it: thereafter wipe away the blood.
And insert into the incisions a woolen cloth submerged in oil, or in rose oil: and place outside another woolen cloth which was immersed in wine and oil, and spread it over both testicles and the flanks: and place above two folded cloths, and these are poultices: and tie them above with a ligature that has the form of six strands.
Then take two cloths, anoint them, and fill them with salve, according to this likeness: and make ends by which they are pressed from below, or wet wool: and join them to the stricture in the lumbar region: and one end may take over the anus up to the back, and the second may extend to the rib area: and two ends above the two lower thighs, and the other two ends above the two inguinal regions, and the whole be joined in the lumbar region.
And, sometimes artificially treated is this branch with cautery in place of sectioning with iron: and it is such that you should take the cauterizing surgical knife and cut the skin of the testicles with it: and it is heated, as we have narrated: until when the white thing containing water is revealed: then take the cauterizing instrument according to this form.
The Greek letter is assimilated.
Then pierce with it that white thing, and it is heated until all the moisture emerges.
Then extend the white thing with forceps, and strip it with a fine heated cautery, and cut it as much as possible for you, until you eradicate all of it.
And beware of the egg, lest the fire touch it.
And know that this operation is safer, and farther from hemorrhage, and better than the operation with sectioning.
If indeed it produces a contrary effect in the hour of sectioning, or in the hour of cautery, such as a hot abscess, or hemorrhage, or something else: then you must treat what it produces contrary to you with the cure that is appropriate for it, according to what has been stated.
If the patient is timid and does not expect this operation due to its horror: then administer the puncture as I describe it, and that is it.
When it is confirmed to you through what we have said about the signs that the branch is watery: then it must be that you make the patient sit on an elevated seat.
Then perforate the abscess at the lower part of it with a spatula-like implement: and place the perforation according to the length of the body, and let the opening be wide until all the water runs out.
Then place something over the wound, and ligate it, and let it be until the remaining water runs out: then care for it until the wound is healed.
If, however, contrariety is to the egress of water at the hour when you perforate it: and this is so only because the white flap causes contrariety at the wound's opening, and prevents the exit of water: then you must introduce a feather into the wound, or an instrument with which the water of dropsy is drawn out, whose form preceded in the operation: or add somewhat to the operation.
And know that the water returns and accumulates again after six months, or about that time.
When therefore it accumulates, then it should be treated in the same manner, and the sick will pass his days.
On the care of ramicis carnosa.
Chapter LXIII.
Know that in the section on this ramicis, it is due to fear causing loss leading to harm in many dispositions.
Therefore, I believe its removal to be beneficial from fear.
And I recall the operation on it and the type of abscess.
I say that many abscesses occur in the bodies from which the testicles are composed, and this happens for many reasons, namely. From acute excess or intense fluid that flows to the testicles.
From a blow.
And it is the color of an abscess according to the color of the body, and no pain is found in it: and it is a heavy abscess.
And perhaps it is a stone abscess, whose color is dark, and no sensation is found in it.
And sometimes it occurs from the nodulation of arteries and their inflation: as its previous mention has already indicated; or from the inflation of veins.
That which is from them, due to the inflation of arteries, is recognized by the arrangement of the abscess when you compress it with your fingers.
And you should not touch it entirely.
That which occurs from the inflation of veins, does not scatter anything when compressed with fingers. And it is now possible that a incision be made for this type of abscess and for the remaining tissues: and you should cut the skin of the testicles.
Then extend the knife upwards, and extract it with a white forceps: and free the suspensory ligament from the tissue, and tie the vessels: and cut the suspensory ligament after you have freed it from all parts of the tissue.
If therefore the knife is stuck with those native tissues, then you must pull the knife out, and cut it. And if there is adhesion between something from the siphakēt, or in what is between the vessels: then you must free the entire adhesive area and cut it with a round incision.
If there is a birth of flesh at a site of adhesion which is behind, then you must cut entirely through it, and extract the egg, as we have said. When therefore your operation is completed, fill the wound with wool infused in rose oil and wine: then care for it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Of the care of Ramicis, which is with Vite.
Chapter LXIV.
Itis is an abscess wrapped in a wrapping similar to that of the testicles: and it makes movement and exercise difficult for the sick person, and walking.
And in the care of this illness there is from fear, because of what preceded its recall.
Truly we must say that the operation on it should be done according to what the first ones did. I say that you must cause the sick person to sit on an elevated seat.
Then cut with a broad sharp spatula transversely over the vessels until the vessels are exposed.
Then scrape from all sides, as we have told you in the extraction of arteries in the thighs.
Then cut it straight in the middle section according to the length of the body, and extract what is aggregated from the decayed feculent humors.
Then care for the wound as you would with other wounds in which you see saniem begin to form, so that the vessels which nourish one of the testicles fall.
For it is not evil through that.
If the veins occur in all the vessels, then it is necessary to extract the testicles with the vessels because the womb might not be nourished due to the incision, and it might waste away or burn, and thus there would be no use for them.
On the care of the Ramus Intestinalis. Head LXV.
Therefore, the intestines descend from that rupture to one of the testicles.
And this rupture is either from the saphenous vein or from its extension.
And these two species occur from many causes: either from a blow, or from jumping, or from shouting, or from lifting a heavy object, and similar situations.
And the sign, when it is from the extension of the saphenous vein.
It is something that happens gradually over a long time and does not occur suddenly: and it is an apostema equal in width to its depth: therefore, because the swelling compresses the intestine.
And its sign is when it arises from the incision of the swelling, because it causes a sudden severe pain at the onset: and it is an apostema different, appearing near the skin: and that is due to the intestine's discharge and the course of its passage through the swelling.
And sometimes it emerges with the intestine around it: and this is called the Intestinal Ramus, and zirbia: and sometimes it occurs with wind.
And sometimes it causes feces to flow into the intestine and is retained there: and this is harmful to the patient, for it causes severe pain, especially when compressed.
And in the treatment of cases of this illness with iron, there is fear; therefore, it is necessary to beware of the risks involved.
And the method of operation is to instruct the patient to reduce the intestine with his hand back into the cavity if it yields to the internal pressure.
Then it is turned upside down over its neck between your hands: and raise its legs.
Then extend the skin that follows the upper skin, and cut the entire length of the scrotal skin.
Then fix hooks in the two lips of the incision, according to what you need to open the incision with them: and the incision should be made as much as possible so that the egg can emerge.
Then excise the sponge tooth, and what is under the skin of the testicles, until when the white sponge is revealed, hard from all parts: then insert your index finger into that which follows the testicle, that which is between the white sponge, which is under the skin of the eye, and between the second sponge, and completely separate the adhesion which is in the posterior part of the eye.
Then probe with your right hand into the skin of the testicles: and with this, elevate the white sponge upwards with your left hand: and lift the eye along with the sponge towards the section: and command your attendant, to elevate the eye upwards: and you release the adhesion, which is behind the completion of the section.
And examine with your fingers that there is nothing therein of the folded intestine in the hard white sponge.
If you find anything thereof: then push it downward towards the abdomen.
Then take a needle with a thick thread, made of ten strands: and insert it at the last sponge, that is, the tunica, which is under the skin of the testicles following the section: then cut the ends that project from the thread until there are four strands.
Then compose some over others with a figure which is in the form of a cross: and ligature it with what we said, that is, the sifach, because it is under the skin of the testicles with a strong ligature, until no part from the vessels, which nourish them, can send anything to them: so that no hot abscess may occur.
And place the ligature again outside the first ligature, distant from it by less than two digits.
And after these two ligaments are released from the skin beneath the testes, leaving the size of a digit: and cut the rest according to its roundness, and take out the contents.
Then dry the lower part of the skin incision of the testes from which the blood and pus flow, as we have described earlier.
Then apply wool soaked in oil, and place it on the wound: and apply the ligament as we have described.
And when the white skin which we have mentioned is cauterized after the incision, beware of the flow of blood.
For this often happens.
And release the ligament until it falls by itself.
If the case is delayed, then soak it in warm water, and place it back on top of what we have said until it falls.
Then care for the wound with the remaining treatment of wounds until it is cured.
¶ Of Ramie Ventosa.
Head LXVI.
In This Ramie Ventosa, I have not seen anyone who dared to use iron in its treatment.
And first they said that it occurs as we have described in Ramie which is associated with Vine.
That is, bind the vessels after the incision from above with ease: then dry in the middle, and care for it lastly according to what opens it until the vessels fall: and care for the wound as we have said until it is healed.
Of the rupture that occurs in the groin.
Head LXVII.
When a rupture occurs in the groin, as we have said, and the site protrudes, but nothing from the intestines descends to the testicles: and if it does descend, it is only a little, and returns in all positions. But if this condition persists over time, the fissure in the sac increases until the intestines descend into the sac.
And this occurs from the extension of the sac, which is in the groin, as we have said.
Because the sac extends, then becomes softened, and the site swells and protrudes.
And its care is with cautery, as the preceding narration indicated.
And sometimes it is treated with iron, according to this method: and the patient should lie on his back between your hands.
Then dry the site of the rupture, which is swollen and protruding, by cutting laterally, according to the width of three fingers.
Then tie the sac and what is beneath the skin until the white sac, which is underneath the skin that follows it, is revealed.
Then take a rod and place it over the protruding site from the sac, and press it deeply into the abdomen.
Then grasp the two protruding sites at the end of the rod from the sac, and join one of them to the other with a suture: then withdraw the end of the rod.
And do not pierce altogether, nor stretch the vein, nor anything else, as I have made you know in the cure of intestinal branches. Then care for that with the cure of wounds.
When therefore you pierce the wound, cleanse it, and restore the wound until it is consolidated.
The muscle is drawn together, and not augmented in prominence of the rupture.
And cauterization is better in this place: for it is nearer to health.
¶ Concerning the softening of the skin of the testicles.
Head LXVIII.
The skin of the testicles is often softened in some people, which causes the flesh between them to soften as well, and spoils the appearance.
Therefore, for those who seek cure for this, it is necessary that they lie on their back and apply the softened skin entirely to the natural skin. Then gather the two lips together with缝合：如果你愿意，在最初可以用三条或四条线来处理多余的软化皮肤，然后再做牢固的缝合。
Then care for the remaining wounds until they heal, and the stitches fall out.
¶ Concerning Castration.
Head LXIX.
You should know that Castration is forbidden by our law and on account of this, it would be permissible for me not to mention it in my book. And its mention is not necessary except for two reasons.
One reason is that it may be asked about this in the science of medicine when questioned about it: and so that one may know the cure for him who has been affected by it.
And the other reason is that we often require castration of certain animals for the benefit of our livestock, such as rams, hyenas, and leopards, and similar animals.
I say that Castration is performed according to two methods. Or through friction.
Or through a slit and sectioning.
In that which is performed through friction, the procedure is as follows: we make the animal sit in warm water until its testicles soften and relax and hang down. Then, we apply them with your hand until they become completely relaxed and cannot be felt upon touch.
In castration through a slit and sectioning, you must hold the animal and press the skin of its testicles with your left hand.
And this method of castration is better than that which is performed through friction, because friction might leave something in the testicles, causing the animal to desire copulation.
Then care for the wound until it is healed.
¶ Of the care of Hermafridites in two ways.
Head LXX.
Hermafridita is of two sexes.
Their vagina is because it appears in what follows the space, or on the skin of the testicles, between the two testicles, where there is a figure like that of a woman, with hair: and sometimes urine runs from what is on the skin of the testicles.
In women, however, there is but one species, and it is the woman's vagina above the pubis, like very small testicles completely prominent to the outside: of which one is like a priapism of a man, and two like two testicles.
And the care for three species, two of them of men, and one of women, is: because it is necessary to cut away the added flesh until the impression of them is removed.
Then care for them with the care of other wounds.
In the second species of men, from which urine comes, which is on the skin of the testicles, there is no operation, and there is no care for it at all.
¶ On the incision of Tentigo and protruding flesh in women's wounds.
Head LXXI.
Tentigo perhaps is added to the natural condition until it spoils and becomes ugly: and sometimes it enlarges in some women so much that it extends like in men, and reaches up to copulation.
Therefore you must hold the excess of the blister with your hand or with forceps and cut: and not the last parts in the cut, especially at the deep root: so that there does not occur a flow of blood.
Then care for the wound itself with treatment until it is healed.
But flesh has arisen, which is flesh that grows in the opening of the womb until it fills it: and perhaps it emerges to the exterior according to the likeness of a tail: and because of this some call the illness taeniac.
Therefore you must cut it as you would cut a blister, and treat it until it is healed.
¶ Concerning the care of Alratica, which is an unperforated wound of a woman.
Chapter LXII.
Alratica is either an unperforated wound of a woman or has a small aperture.
And it is either natural or accidental.
Accidental is from an illness that preceded: and it itself arises either from flesh grown added, or from fine thread, or from thick material: and it occurs either in the deep part of the womb, or on its sides, or on its upper part, or on its lower part: and it prevents intercourse and conception, and childbirth, and perhaps it prevents menstruation.
And its recognition is made through the appearance to the midwife if the obstruction is evident nearby.
If it is not evident, then seek it out with your fingers, or using a speculum.
If the fistula is from a fine passage and is close to two lips: then act quickly, and disrupt it.
And place pultils over the two lips.
Then place your fingers of both hands simultaneously, and the woman should lie on her back with her legs spread.
Then extend the two lips with force until the fine fistula is disrupted and the fistula is opened.
Then take a woolen cloth, soak it in oil, and place it over the area. Let the woman apply this every day to prevent the wound from healing over.
If the fistula is thick and large, then you must cut it out using a sharp blade or a broad similar leaf of myrtle.
If the fistula is from flesh that has grown, then suspend it with hooks, and cut it out. Have ready medicines that stop the flow of blood without cutting, such as acacia, dragon's blood, and tamarind mixed with alum.
Then administer a large catheter made of lead, so that the wound does not heal quickly. Hold it for a few days, and then apply dry linen. Continue the treatment until it is healed.
And when other flesh wounds are born in the matrix, they must be cut out according to this method: while there is no abscess, for an abscess that is cancerous, what is in the matrix will not contradict iron entirely.
¶ Concerning the care of hemorrhoids, Athelil, and Bothor rubea in the vulva of women.
Chapter Seventy-Three.
Hemorrhoids are indeed the opening of veins, until much blood flows forth continually from them.
When therefore hemorrhoids are enlarged, they become thrombosed: and I have already spoken of the division of their species and the signs thereof: and here I will say which of them receive cure and which do not.
I say therefore that hemorrhoids which are in the opening of the uterus and do not appear by touch: then there is no cure for them with iron.
Those, however, which from them are in the opening of the uterus upon which sensation falls, are those which can be cured.
Therefore, you should introduce the woman into a cold room.
Then extend the thrombosed hemorrhoids with forceps or with a rough cloth, and cut them from their roots.
Then powder them near the flow of blood from one of the cut areas without applying any caustic substance: as with acacia, and dragon's blood, and thuya, and similar substances.
Then press her feet against the wall for one hour.
Then place her in cold water.
If the flow of blood persists, then make her sit in a decoction of sumac, pomegranate peel, and gooseberry, and similar substances.
Then take barley flour, and make it with honey and vinegar, and apply a paste of it to her back.
If therefore blood is cut off with it, it is good; and if not, make it adhere to the backs of the suction cups and the nipples without scarification.
Then take wool and immerse it in the juice of tamarisk, or the juice of arnoglossa, or the juice of alaula branches, that is, aglanther, wine of Pontus, and make it adhere with heat.
When therefore the abscess has settled, then care for the area with ointments until it is healed.
Albarth is reddish and resembles the heads of algae, and has a rough appearance.
Therefore you must incise what is apparent from it, according to what I said concerning the thilil equally: and care for it until it is healed.
¶ Concerning the perforation of the exiture that occurs in the matrix.
Head LXXIIII.
Many species of abscesses occur in the matrix, such as cancer, and lithogenous abscess, and ulcers, and adubelati, and alekilati, that is, herpes, aestiomemus, and fistulas, and hemorrhoids, and ragadiae, and thilil, and hot abscess.
And I have indeed already said all these illnesses and their species, and their signs, and their cures in the division: it is necessary that I say in this treatise on the hot abscess that occurs in the matrix, when it is from abscesses which gather pus, and you must know how its opening is made with iron.
Therefore you must consider.
Then if the pain of an abscess at its onset is acute with percussion and flame and fever: and you see it turn red; if sensation falls upon it, then do not hasten with perforation of it: and care for it along with it as may help toward maturation until the acuteness of the accidents abates.
Then you must cause the woman to sit on a seat which sags at both ends, and recline or apply heat to her back, and bring her feet toward her lower abdomen: and let her thighs be spread apart, and place her arms under her knees, and bind her with a bandage fitting for that.
Then the midwife should sit on the right side, and administer the instrument by which the opening of the uterus is dilated.
The form of which comes next.
And you must place the depth of the uterus of the woman with the Radius when you wish to administer this instrument: so that what enters from the instrument is not more than the depth of the uterus, and does not harm the frail one.
If, however, the instrument is deeper than the depth of the uterus, then you must place pessaries over the covering of the depth of the uterus: so as to prevent the entire entry of the instrument into the depth of the uterus. And you must place a speculum, which runs from the upper side, on the instrument: and hold the instrument and rotate the speculum until the depth of the uterus is dilated.
When therefore the exit is apparent and is touched by hand and is soft and yielding: then you must separate it at its head with a spatule broad.
When therefore the pus is evacuated, then you should place a mild one submerged in rose oil, or green oil with some styptic in it, and place the mild one, and extract the section from the deep matrix.
And place externally over the matrix, and over the wick, clean wool submerged in water in which pears have boiled.
Then treat with the appropriate ointment for two days until it is healed.
And when the matrix and wound are washed, let it be irrigated with water and honey, then with water in which the root of lilac or long aristolochia has boiled. Then return to the ointment.
If the wound is hidden internally in the matrix, then you should refrain from treating it with iron. Instead, treat it as we have said in the division.
The Doctrine of Midwives, how to treat living embryos that have emerged in an unnatural position.
Chapter LXXVI.
It is necessary for the midwife to first recognize the natural position of labor.
By the signs, therefore, you can recognize this: when you see a woman compressing herself towards her lower parts, and desiring to smell the air, and something above her is alleviated, and the exit of the embryo hastens: then know that this labor is in the natural position, and the exit is over its head, with the afterbirth coming with it: or hanging or suspended from the umbilicus. When therefore you see these signs, then it is necessary that the abdomen be compressed so that the embryo may descend quickly.
Whoever is beyond this birth is unnatural, unacceptable.
For sometimes the fetus emerges with its feet first, and its body comes out before its head, and its feet or one of its feet, and its hand or hands: or its head and its hands: or its abdomen: and perhaps it turns over its neck, and similar figures that are unacceptable.
Therefore, it is necessary that the obstetrician be prudent and subtle in all these matters, and guard himself from error and deception: and I am showing every figure from them, and how the nature thereof is, and it is signified by that, and stands above it.
When the fetus emerges with its head naturally, and this causes strain on the woman, and makes the delivery difficult, and you see its strength already weakened, then make her sit on a seat, or have women support her: and let vapor from fennel decoction and from moist oils rise to her.
Then the obstetrician should introduce a small spatiumile between his fingers and feel for the afterbirth, and cut it with his nail until what is there due to moisture moves out: and press the woman's abdomen until the fetus descends.
If it does not descend, then the woman should be given a cleansing enema with fennel mucilage and olive oil.
Then command her after washing, that she be compressed: and make her sneeze when laying down, and hold her mouth and nose for one hour.
The foetus will immediately emerge.
If two hands of the foetus emerge first, you should reduce them with gentle and gradual effort.
If it does not yield on emergence, then place the woman on a seat, and lift her feet upwards: then shake the seat upon the ground: and the woman should be held so that she does not fall during the shaking.
If therefore the hands do not emerge, and the foetus dies: then cut them, and extract the remaining foetus: and bind her hand with a cloth, and extract it with equal pressure: for it will emerge itself.
The exit of the embryo over its feet.
When the foetus emerges over its feet, you should push them upwards: then turn the foetus gradually: afterwards adjust it.
Then receive one of its feet and extend it gradually.
When therefore they emerge down to the thighs, then command her that she be compressed, and make her sneeze when laying down: for she will emerge if God wills it.
And if it does not emerge with what we have narrated, then reduce the foetus gradually until you place it in its natural position.
For it will then emerge with an easy exit.
If it is prohibited for him to do all that we have narrated: then take from the thick mucus, and olive oil, and gum dissolved: and pound all of it well in a mortar: then with a linen cloth mix it with the woman above her genitals.
Then make her sit in warm water until hypochondria is achieved.
When you see that her lower parts are already warmed, then apply to her some myrrh: and apply it.
When she holds the myrrh for one hour, then make her sit on a seat.
Then make her sneeze: and close her mouth and nose: and apply a gentle compression to the lower part of her abdomen.
For the fetus will immediately emerge.
The exit of the fetus over the mother's knees and hands.
When it emerges in this form, then introduce your hand slowly.
Then the woman should be placed with her back over her neck, and her feet hanging downward: and she herself should lie on the bed, and draw up her hands.
Then apply gentle pressure above her abdomen.
Then extract what is under her feet from the birthing cloths until it is prepared in the lower part.
If the fetus does not emerge, then take her feet and move them with a vigorous motion.
Then apply gentle pressure above the hypochondria until the fetus ascends to the upper part.
Then insert his hand and equalize the fetus gradually: and command the woman that it may be compressed until the fetus emerges.
The exit of the fetus hanging laterally from the hands.
Let there be an adjustment in the reduction of his hands.
If he cannot reduce it, then lift the woman and make her walk.
If she cannot walk, then make her lie on the bed: and shake her thighs with violent shaking.
Then apply the ointment you have prepared from mucilages.
If she receives the delivery, then make her sit on a seat.
Then study the adjustment of his hands, and equalize the fetus according to its natural position: and make the woman sneeze, and command her that she may compress herself until the fetus emerges.
The exit of the fetus is over its neck, with outstretched hands, and its face is toward the back of the mother.
The midwife should hold the hand of the fetus, then rotate it gradually, and equalize it with ease.
When it is equalized, then place it over the vulva as we have described from oil and mucilages.
Then command her to move gradually.
When you have done this, then make her sit on a seat, and command her to lean to the right side.
Then order her to be compressed: and make her sneeze as she is placed.
The exitus foetus praeparati super latus.
When it descends to the opening of the uterus in this manner with the speculum, then cut the speculum with your nail until it is evacuated by the moisture.
If therefore it is suspended over the face of the fetus, and its neck, then cut it from the umbilicus: so that it is not retained and may die.
Then push the fetus into the interior, until you place it as it should be: and order the woman to compress herself several times: for it will emerge through the light opening.
The exitus Geminorum, or foetuum multorum.
Know that twins often are born: and sometimes three, and four.
Yet that is foreign, and rarely occurs.
Yet there are five things outside of nature, and they do not live at all: and contain them, although they multiply, with one speculum: and are separated by the sifach, distinguishing between them with a ligature around each of their umbilici.
And sometimes they emerge as a single fetus does naturally, easily: and they emerge through an unnatural exit, as we have reported. And if some of them are difficult at the birth, and reach that which we said from unnatural figures, then care for them as we have reported: and let it be a fine forceps, and do what it does with ease and delay, and devise according to every figure with what is prepared for it by the skill leading to health.
Sometimes one, and two, and three, and four, and five, and six, and seven, and more than ten are formed in the matrix: and it has been verified to me that a woman aborting gave birth to seven, and others fifteen, all formed.
What was measured by the glorious wise man.
Therefore, this should altogether be in the science of Obstetricians. For perhaps it will come to something like that of the other; let him therefore oppose to it what is necessary.
On the Extraction of the Dead Fetus.
When you are treating a dead fetus and it does not pass after the treatment I mentioned in the division of medications, and you are forced to use manual operation, then you should consider.
If therefore the woman is in good condition and there are no complications from which her loss is feared, then it is necessary to have the woman lie on her back on a bed, with her head inclined downward and her legs elevated: and the attendant should hold her from both sides, or she should be tied to the bed so that her body does not get in the way during the extraction of the fetus.
Then moisten the cervix with a mixture of oily substances and honey, fennel, and flaxseed. Then the obstetrician should anoint her hand with these oils and mucus: then she should introduce it into the cervix with ease.
Then let him inquire where he may place the hooks from the fetus, and places suitable for this.
Consider therefore if the fetus is prepared to descend upon its head: then place hooks in its eyes, or in its neck, or in its mouth, or in its palate, or under its beard, or in its hyoid bone, or in nearby places of its ribs and under the hips.
If the descent is upon its feet, then place hooks on its sacrum and its middle ribs.
And it must be that he holds the hook with his right hand and places its curvature between the fingers of his left hand. He shall introduce it with his hand with facility, and place the hook in one of those places which we have said, until he reaches the open space.
Then extend it with equal tension, and let it not be merely extended straight. Rather, move it in all directions to facilitate its removal. This is similar to what is done with a tooth during its extraction.
And it must be that the tension is applied between those things to soften them.
If a part is retained, then the Surgeon must anoint some fingers with oil and introduce them from one side to rotate what is retained with them.
If therefore a part of the fetus emerges, then the hooks shall be moved to another place that is higher. Do this until the entire fetus has emerged.
If therefore the hand comes out first and it is not possible to reduce it because of its constriction: then it must be covered with a cloth over it.
Then extract it until when the entire hand emerges, cut it either at the ankle joint or at the elbow: and thus you must do the same in the other hand and in both feet.
If the head of the fetus is large, or there is a constriction in the exit, or water has accumulated in its head: then it must be that Spatumile the spiny is introduced between the digits, and it should be forced with it until the head, and the water should be extracted: or it should be ruptured with an instrument called Almisdac: whose form comes with the forms of the other instruments in the chapter which follows.
Similarly, if the fetus has a nature of a large head, then it must be that Algengema is cut: or extract it with Misdach, as we have said.
Then extract the bones with forceps.
If the head comes out and is constricted at the pelvis: then it should be forced until the moisture in the chest is discharged.
If, however, it is not constricted and does not yield to extraction: then cut the head by sawing, as far as possible for you.
If, however, the lower part of the abdomen is abscessed, or there is hydrocele in it: then you must pierce it until the moisture flows out from it.
If the fetus is above the feet, then its extraction is easy, and its direction towards the maternal mouth is gentle.
If it is constricted within the abdomen or chest: then you must extract it with the cloth which you wrapped around your hand, and compress the abdomen or chest until what is within them passes.
If the remaining limbs are removed and the head returns: then the Obstetrix must insert her left hand. If therefore the opening of the womb is open, then insert your hand into the depth of the womb, and seek out the head, and draw it with your fingers until the head reaches the opening of the womb: then insert one hook or two hooks, and draw it with them.
If the opening of the womb is constricted, because of a hot abscess that has occurred: then it is not necessary to labor over it, but rather you should administer an application of moist substances, oils: and apply poultices: and sit in waters that soften and moisten.
If the fetus is in a breech position, then it is possible to correct it: then administer what we have said about a living fetus.
If it is not possible to correct it, then it should be delivered by cesarean section and extracted.
And you must not allow anything from the afterbirth to remain entirely within.
When therefore you have completed your operation, then administer what we have said about hot abscesses that occur in the wombs.
If there is a flow of blood, then let it be washed with astringent waters, and administer the remainder of the cure.
And I have indeed seen a woman whose fetus had died in her womb: then she became pregnant again over the same spot, and another fetus also died.
Therefore, after a long time, a boil appeared on his navel and became inflamed until it opened: and it began to discharge pus.
I was therefore called to cure him, and I treated him for a long time: and the wound did not heal.
I therefore applied to it some of my strong attracting ointments: and the hole emerged from its place.
Then some days passed, and another hole emerged.
I therefore marveled then, since there is no hole in the womb.
I therefore concluded that the holes were due to the bones of the dead fetus.
I therefore examined the wound and extracted many bones, the woman being in better condition: and she has now lived for a long time and discharges only a little pus from the place.
And I did not cauterize this foreign matter here, except because there is knowledge and assistance in it for what the skilled physician administers with his hand in the cure.
¶ Concerning the Forms of Necessary Instruments in the Extraction of Fetus.
Head LXXVII.
Here is the form of the Strictorius, where two spindles are equalized, with two vertiges at both ends of two rods.
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilius strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.
And let the width of every piece of wood be about two fingers: and the edge of each is about one finger, and the length of each is a palm and half. And in the middle of the two pieces of wood are two additions of the same kind of wood, which are already firmly set in both, whose length is about half a palm more or less: and the width of each is about two fingers, or more or less.
And these two additions are inserted into the mouth of the matrix, so that it opens with them when you revolve the two Vertigos.
Forma Vertiginis qua aperiatur matrix.
Forma alia ad simile illius, subtilius, et leveius.
Let it be made from ebony or bussi wood, according to the likeness of forceps.
Verumtamen in extremitate eius sint duo additamenta, sicut uides hic supra: et longitudo omnis additamenti ex eis est quasi palmus: et latitudo utriusque est duo digiti.
When therefore you wish to open the matrix with it, then cause a woman to sit on a bed, with her feet hanging between her thighs.
Then insert these two additions joined together into the matrix: and you are holding the lower end of the instrument between her thighs.
Then open your hand with the instrument, as you do with forceps, equally according to the quantity you wish from the opening of the matrix's mouth, until the midwife does what she wants.
Forma Vertiginis alii dicunt Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.
Forma Almisdac quo conteritur caput paruum. Forma Vncini habentis spinam unam.
Forma Vncini habentis spinas duas.
Forma forcipis cui sunt dentes serrae, cum quo conteritur caput foetus.
Forma Spatui milis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.
Forma duorum Spatumilium etiam latorum.
These instruments are all used, and the more various their forms are, and the better prepared they are by the craftsman, the faster they are for use, and the higher regarded by men, on account of their quantity.
Therefore, do not disdain any of these instruments if they are prepared for you.
For the necessity of these is inexcusable.
¶ De extractione Secundinae.
Chapter LXXXVIII.
When Secundina retains the breath at childbirth, then you must command the weakened one to hold her breath.
Then make her sneeze when you place the instrument: and hold your hand over her mouth and nose.
If it comes out through this, that is good.
If not, then take a pot and make a hole in the cover: and put herbs opening the mouth of the uterus, such as calamus, rue, angelflower, chamomile, safflower, wooden cinnamon, and centaury, into it: take all these herbs or some of them, and immerse them in water, and place them over fire.
Then place a reed bulb over the hole in the pot cover, and the other end into the uterine opening: and hold it there until the vapor reaches the cavity of the uterus.
Then make her sneeze, as we have said.
For Secundina will come out with ease.
If, however, she remains after this treatment and does not come out, then command the midwife to immerse her hand in olive oil or the juice of euphorbia. Then introduce her into the uterus and seek out Secundina with her.
When she finds it, then grasp it and slowly extend it.
If it is attached deeply in the uterus, then insert the hand, as we have described, until he finds the Secunda and withdraws it gradually according to its straightness, so that the uterus does not fall due to strong suction: indeed, it should be alternated with facility to the right and left sides: then added in the quantity of the suction.
Then it obeys and is preserved and withdrawn from the adherence.
If the os matrix is constricted, as we have already described: treat it with a sneeze, and from the medicine of the pot with herbs.
If it does not come out with all that we have described, then beware lest you exhaust yourself in repeated attempts to extract it.
Indeed, what comes out to the os matrix from it, bind to the woman's thigh.
Then treat it with a clyster using a tetrapharmcon ointment.
For it will putrefy it after days, dissolve, and come out.
Indeed, when it putrifies, a bad smell rises from it to the stomach and head, and afflicts them with illness.
Therefore, appropriate fumigations should be administered for that.
Some of the ancients have already found fumigations with nasturtium and dried figs to be effective.
The form of the instrument with which fumigation is performed on the woman during the retention of Secunda and menstruation.
Let it be made from a bladder or from a sponge: and place the broad end over fire: and the suffumigation should be placed over the pears: hold it until that suffumigation is consumed: and repeat another.
Of the Cure of an Unperforated Wound.
Chapter LXXIX.
Many boys are born, and their wounds are unperforated, which he has already treated with a fine instrument.
Therefore, the midwife must perforate it with her finger: and if not, she should perforate it with a sharp Spatumilus: and let her be careful that her hand does not touch it.
Then place wet wool soaked in wine and oil over it.
Then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
If you fear that it is perforated, then insert a tube of lead into the opening for many days, and remove it when the boy wants to urinate.
And now perforation of the wound can also occur due to the consolidation of the wound or an abscess.
Therefore, that consolidation must be cut out, and then it should be treated with what we have said regarding treatment and lead. Of the Cure of Fistulas That Occur in the Lower Part.
Chapter LXXX.
Fistulas that occur in the lower part are Nodatio and Grossitudo, which arise near the anus external: or in the space of one side: and they can be one fistula or multiple.
When therefore that Nodation is ancient, it is opened, and a white watery moisture or subtle pus runs out from it.
And sometimes they are from these fistulas penetrating.
And they are fistulas when they are in the space penetrating all the way to the bladder and to the meatus virgis.
And they are penetrating fistulas all the way to the hip joint and all the way to the sacral node.
From the point where a penetrating fistula is recognized as reaching the anus, even if it does not penetrate deeply, you can introduce your index finger into the anus: and insert a fine probe from air or iron into the fistula when there is no tortuosity.
If there is tortuosity in it, then introduce a fine probe made of lead or horsehair into the fistula until you feel the probe or hair on your finger.
If you do not feel it completely through, nor does anything emerge from the opening during defecation, nor flatulence, nor a worm as I said: then know that it is non-penetrating. Hurry therefore to treatment.
And when the fistula is penetrating to the bladder or to the urethral meatus, then its indication is the exit of urine from it, and its obstruction to prevent the place from consolidating with medicines.
If it penetrates to the junction of the thighs or to the hip bone: then its sign is that it has been touched up to there, if there is no tortuosity to the hip: and the discovery of pain around the part, and that pus always comes out from it: and that it does not respond to medication, nor is it consolidated with ointment.
And in all these fistulas that penetrate, there is no complete cure: and the cure of them is labor and vanity to him, at the hands of foolish physicians, upon whom it forms. In that one which is not penetrating and not old, healing is hoped for with a needle: as I tell you according to what I have proven: and it is, that the sick person lie on his back: and raise his legs above his thighs, and let his thighs be inclined toward his abdomen.
Then insert lead or air, if there is tortuosity in the fistula, until you know where it has penetrated.
If the patient feels it around the anus, then you must insert your index finger into the anus.
If therefore you feel the probe has penetrated through itself when withdrawn, beyond what you feel between your finger and the syringe or flesh, then you may be certain that it is penetrating: hence do not trouble yourself with it, for its cure is not as we have said.
They have also said that in some people the flesh is cured, and from medication where hope of relief is given, it is necessary to ignite a fine cautery according to the width of the fistula, as has been mentioned before, and to insert the ignited one into the fistula until it reaches around the anus.
Then repeat this process twice or thrice until you know that all those added meats, filtered and similar to the tubes of bird feathers, are now fully cooked.
Then wrap it with licentious cloths in butter until those cooked meats emerge: then treat it with ointments that generate flesh and consolidate.
If therefore it is healed, it is good.
And if not, then it is never cured with any other treatment.
And if it emerges and does not withstand until your finger, which is in the anus, and there is a thick membrane of flesh or sinus between it and the probe, and you see the fistula beneath the surface of the skin, then dry the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and you proceed cutting with the probe that is in the fistula until the cut reaches where the probe's end emerges, and the probe is freed and falls.
Then cleanse those filtered meats, which resemble the tubes of bird feathers, so that nothing remains from them.
If however blood overcomes you and separates those meats between you and the operation, then it is better that you cauterize it with fire or with sharp medicine.
Since cauterization with fire aggregates good qualities, such as the burning of those added meats, and the excision of blood, and the drying up of moisture.
Then wrap it with licentious cloths in butter, or with roasted stalks, until the place discharges pus, and those cooked meats emerge as pus.
Then the care of the wound when consolidated with ointments that generate hard flesh: and they are medicines in which there is cauterization and drying.
For when it is healed, then it is already cured: and you need not fear recurrence. If, however, the fistula has reached the depth of the anus and has lengthened due to excess body fluid: then insert your finger into the anus and examine it with it.
If therefore you feel a membrane, and between you and it there is either a thin skin or flesh, and it is near penetration: then the operation is not to be performed there, unless according to the way of faith and hope.
For this is because it is treated in one of three ways: either you cauterize it, as we said, or you cut it away until you reach its cavity, so that it is possible for you to insert a probe and effect the cure by proximity.
And do not cut too much so as not to pierce the wall containing the anus, and let not a severe evacuation occur without volition. Then care for that with what we have said. For it may be healed on its own: or you may lengthen that membrane and clean it after drying it close to the anus, as we have said, or you may probe it or use another sharp instrument.
Then cleanse those filtered flesh wounds that are in the incision until you can do so with probing.
Then attempt the healing of the entire wound with the incision and the upper opening where it is consolidated: and the fistula will remain open in the inner part of the anus, and this will be less severe for the patient.
And sometimes a fistula is缝合 according to this mode: and it is when you introduce a probe into the fistula: and it is on the side of the anus near the surface of the body with skin and anal margin: then take a probe with its perforated end, which is like an aleksa needle, that is, a preparation needle, according to this form.
And introduce into it a thread wrapped in five threads, and around it.
Then introduce the probe with thread into the fistula until it reaches its concavity.
If therefore it penetrates to the anal margin internally near, then extract the thread from that opening: thus, introduce your finger into the anus, and extract the end of the thread, and join both ends together: and tighten both, and leave them for one or two days. The more the thread incises the flesh, tighten it well until those tissues between the two ends of the thread grow together and fall off. Then care for the wound until it consolidates and heals.
For you do not have the means to make it for the sake of the limb without incising it.
Then proceed with it as we have said until it heals.
The form of the spatumilis spine used to treat the fistula, whose sharp part is very acute, and the other part is not sharp so as not to incise what is not necessary, as you can see.
On the缝合痔疮，其中血液从其切开处流出：和治疗裂伤。
Head LXI.
There are Hemorrhoids in two modes.
For they are either within the anus, similar to bladder warts or wens: or as if they themselves be grains of gravel.
And from them there are both small and large. Blood always flows from them, and there is one, and there are many.
And they are outside the anus and at its extremities.
Indeed, those that are outside the anus are for the most part few in moisture, from which yellow water or a little frequent blood flows: and they are according to the color of the body.
And the treatment for that which is within the anus is to advise the patient to sit in a warm bath: and express it until the anus expels it and the warts become apparent to you.
Therefore, hang them with forceps: or hold them with your finger.
Then cut them at their roots.
If, however, they are not retained in them with forceps, because of their moisture and softening: then grasp them with a rough cloth or with a clamp from double-threaded linen, and extract them with your fingers.
Then cut them and dust them with certain warm powders after the incision to serve as a substitute for cauterization.
Cauterize them according to what was preceded in the chapter on cauterizing.
Then care for them with the rest of the treatment until they are cured.
If the anus does not yield to evacuation, then give a mild purge with a clister, so that it may relax what is in the anus, and may yield more readily to evacuation when the patient expresses himself.
If the ulcers are external to the anus, then their condition is slight and easy: and you may remove them with your fingernail, or with a lancet, and cut them.
Then care for them with what we have said until they are cured.
And if one is hesitant to make an incision with a刀具， then it must be sewn with sutures according to this method.
Take a wound thread and insert it into the needle.
Then extract the ulcer to the upper part, and make it penetrate with the needle at the root on the other side: and wrap the two ends of the thread around the lower part of the needle, making them broad: and tie the ulcer tightly with a strong knot.
Then tie off the thread with a knot, and withdraw the needle.
Do this with all the ulcers, and leave one open so that the excess blood may flow from it.
Then place a cloth soaked in rose oil or mercury ointment over the anus and put it there. And command the patient to rest.
Then release it until it falls.
Then, when the glands have fallen, care for them with ointments and other treatment until they are cured.
¶ Concerning the Care of Fissures.
For they often occur from the drying up of feces, and the natural constriction.
When therefore they harden and medicine is ineffective: then you should scrape them with points of Spatium (a type of surgical instrument), or with your own nail, until they become moist, and the outer layer of skin which prevents their healing should be removed.
Then care for them until they consolidate as needed.
If they do not consolidate, then scrape them more vigorously than before until they bleed profusely. Then care for them until they are cured.
¶ Concerning the care of Almirmar both inverted and not inverted, and of glands dried by worms.
Then care for that. And if you wish, cauterize it as was described in the previous chapter.
From dry healthy tissue there is a small prominence, rough, filtered, round above the surface of the body.
And often occur in the hands of boys.
And the treatment thereof is to extend the tissue, and incise it; or to tie it with a silk thread: or with hair, until it falls.
And if you wish, cauterize it according to what was previously stated with fire, or with a sharp medicine. And now the inverted and non-inverted tissues are eradicated with the instrument which I shall say. A small prominence filtered, coarse, above the surface of the body, going very deep: and when it finds it, cold is felt there like a bite of an ant, and it happens throughout the entire body: and most of it happens in the hands.
And the treatment thereof is to take a quill from a goose, or a strong vulture feather: and place that quill over the ant, until a circle of the parts is contained by the quill.
Then turn your hand with the quill until you cut what is around the ant: and place it deep into the flesh, and eradicate the ant from its root. And if you wish, do this with an air quill or iron quill, according to this form.
Let the quill be drawn to the depth of the deaf canal, so as to alleviate the grasp on the finger and its turning.
And if you wish, cauterize the ant according to what was previously stated in the cauterization of Athelil in the chapter on cauterization.
On the Forms of Instruments Used for Enemas in Diseases of the Anus, and for Bowel Emptying and Colic.
Chapter LXXXIII.
Sometimes an enema is made from silver, or from brass, or from drawn copper, or beaten copper.
And sometimes it is made from these instruments, both small and large, according to those in which they are administered.
That which is administered in the cure of young children should be small, and for those whose anuses are weak or painful, so too should the enemas be.
Enema magnus.
Clister parvum.
Its cannula, that is, the upper part where the uterus is tied, should be broad according to this measure. And there should be a distinction such that the uterus is tied as you see. The lower extremity which is introduced into the anus, should be dumb, that is, not open, soft, very fine, drawing towards subtlety: and on one side thereof are two openings, and on the other side one opening.
And the width of the opening should be according to the thickness of the ribs, and somewhat broader. The uterus in which medicines from an animal bladder or from sheepskin are placed should be shaped like a small saffron bulb, whose root is one handbreadth.
When therefore the catheter is placed in it, tie a thread at the head of the clyster between two distinquentia with strong constriction.
Then the clyster is tied to it.
And this is the form of the circle here depicted, and the apertures. The quality of the clyster to be used with it is as follows: fill the catheter or bladder with medicine that has been heated according to the tolerance of the patient. Be careful that it is not excessively hot or excessively cold.
Then the patient is turned face down on his back, and he lifts his legs toward the upper part. Place a cushion, that is, skin where people lie, or linen, under him.
Then anoint the end of the clyster with oil, or with alum solution, or with fennel mucilage, or similar.
Then insert it into the anus with ease.
Then the attendant should take the catheter with both hands and squeeze it vigorously until all the contents of the clyster are evacuated into the intestine. Then withdraw the clyster, and the patient lift his legs to the wall. If the medicine compels him to evacuate, then he should hold on as much as he can.
And if he sleeps with her the entire night, it is more final in healing.
If, however, you give him a clyster in illnesses of the bowels, and the evacuation is prompt: then repeat the clysters until he is cured.
And if there are hemorrhoids or inflamed abscesses in the anus, then use a very fine, gentle clyster, with those clysters that are used for children.
And this be the form of a very fine clyster when the skin is tight.
¶ On the Treatment of Head Injuries Without Fracture of the Bone.
Chapter CCCXLIV.
I have already spoken of the division of the treatment of wounds in the book, and I will now speak of the treatment using both hands and medicines according to need.
I say that wounds are differentiated according to the manner in which they are inflicted, and according to the location on which the wound falls.
The things by which wounds are inflicted often are like the投掷石头：或者刀剑的切割：或者长矛、木棒或箭的打击：以及其他类似的多件事物。
Wounds that are inflicted according to the locations of the body are, for example, a wound that falls on the head, or the neck, or the chest, or the abdomen, or the flank: and similar ones from other body parts.
And I am recounting the treatments of certain wounds so that I may set forth this reasoning and rule for other wounds.
And I will begin with simple wounds of the head: for the recall of their composition will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
I say therefore.
When a simple wound occurs on the head and there is no fracture of the bone: consider then if it is from the throw of a stone or something similar, and has already broken only the skin: and it is a large wound, and fear an unfavorable outcome with a hot abscess: then hasten, and perform a cephalic phlebotomy immediately: and do not delay that: and draw off from him according to the quantity of his strength: if nothing prevents phlebotomy, especially if the blood coming out of the wound is scanty.
And let the phlebotomy be from the opposite side of the wounded area.
And let the patient beware of overindulgence, and of wine, and of heavy foods.
If, however, something prevents reduction, then it should be reduced by diet, and he should not approach meats, nor wine.
And apply over the wound if it has developed a hot abscess, a compress soaked in rose oil alone, or with wine in which there is astringency.
If, however, you are free from a hot abscess, then apply over the wound if it is recent with its own blood and has not been changed by air, the powder which I will describe in a little while: and if it has already been changed by air, then apply to it some ointments until it heals.
If, however, the wound is large, or it is from a cut with a sword or similar: and the lips of the wound do not aggregate through small granulations, then aggregate them together with sutures, as I will describe in wounds of the abdomen regarding their suturing.
If the wound is already detected from the bone and hangs down, and there is no retention of it except by a slight suspension: then cut it.
Then care for the wound with medicines, and restore in it hard flesh in place of skin, and prescribe to the weak that they eat foods in which there is thickness, such as heads, and cooked wheat, until he recovers: and similar things.
If you find putrefaction in the skin and it does not adhere to the bone: then cut away the entire putrefied part and discard it. Then care for that.
If, however, there is an artery or vein through which blood flows in these wounds: and it is not cut by medicines, then inquire about the artery.
If, therefore, you find it uncut, then cut it with Spatumili, or ligate it.
If necessity prompts you when it does not provide what we have said, then cauterize it until the blood is cut off.
**The Method of the Powder of Incarnated Blood.**
Recipe of libanum one part, and of dragon's blood two parts, and of unquenched lime three parts: grind all this much, and sift it: and fill the wound with it, and bind it with good binding until it adheres well upon it and coagulates with the blood.
Then sew it from above with sutures, and release it, do not untie it while it remains, so that it does not become inflamed.
For the medicine does not take effect until it is cured.
Then care for the rest of the wound until it is cured.
¶ Of Wounds of the Neck.
Chapter LXXXV.
If a wound occurs in the neck, then there is no difference in treatment between it and a simple wound of the head.
If the nerve of the neck or the artery has already been cut: then if it is a nerve, there is no skill in this, except to treat its curative method with a strong styptic, like zincierite, zegi, and similar substances.
Because the sinews are harmful and contract them.
And do not apply anything absolutely cold over the wound: for the substance of the sinews is cold, and its continuation is with the brain, which is more sublimely situated among the members: let that be used which is cured from medicines gently, as burnt lime mixed with sweet water several times infused with oil or rose oil, and tuthia, when washed even with sweet water: and the remaining mineral stones according to this mode, and wet ointments.
If the wound is great, then administer sutures: or draw together its edges with stitches.
Then care for it until it is healed.
If the wound is deep, or a sinus forms in the lower part of it, in which pus has already accumulated, then puncture it in a more depressed place thereof.
If the artery is incised in the wound and there is a flow of blood from it, then separate it, or dry it out, and tie it off: or cauterize it if necessity demands that.
If the spoundiles of the throat, or the whole throat, have been saved: then draw together the edges of the skin with sutures over the throat cane, and do not touch the throat, but level it off, and restore it to its natural shape.
Then tighten it with an appropriate suture, and remove it after a few days.
Then care for it with ointments containing styptic and drying ingredients until it is healed.
If the wound has already made an impression in the bone, then inquire about it: then if there are fragments of bone in it, extract all that you can or what you can from them; and leave that which is not prepared until the wound putresces, separates, and facilitates its exit.
If the wound is recent, then powder it with the powder which I have described.
If it is seen in the wound that there is bone, and a fistula forms: then treat both with what is mentioned in its own chapter.
Chapter LXXXVI.
If therefore there is effusion of wind from the wound, when the sick person breathes hard from it, then know that the wound is fatal.
If it has no depth and is recent with its own blood: then do not apply powder to it from the first hour, nor compress it, so that blood does not remain deep within it and return to the heart and kill the sick person. But apply an attracting ointment to it, and release it twice a day.
If indeed ointment is not present for you, then apply old wool to the wound, so that it absorbs what effuses from it due to humidity. And make sure the sick person sleeps on the wound, so that what aggregates there flows out.
If indeed three days or more have passed since the wound, and no spasm, nor bad heart tremor, nor constriction in breathing occur, and you see all its dispositions good: then know that the wound is healing.
Therefore cure it also and with ointments, and the rest of the treatment until it is cured.
If the healing is excused and it opens up again always, then you know that a Fistula has now been formed.
Therefore cure it from its own chapter.
And if the wound is from an incision by a sword or knife, and it is simple on the surface of the chest or back: then cure it with what preceded from suturing if it is large; or with powder if it is small.
And if it has already made an impression in the bone and causes fragments: then examine the wound and hasten to extract those fragments if they are separate.
And if they are not separate, then leave them alone until the wound putsrefies, for the extraction of them is harmful.
The judgment for other wound accidents in the remaining members in treatment is the judgment that we have said.
On Wounds of the Belly and Intestinal Discharge, and Their Treatment.
Chapter LXXXVII.
The rupture that occurs in the belly is great, medium, and small.
From a great rupture, the intestine or the number of intestines sometimes emerges.
This results in their more forceful and difficult suturing and introduction.
And even a small rupture can be difficult due to another method.
Therefore, reduction is more difficult if you do not hasten in his introduction to his place immediately, for it inflates, opens, and becomes obstructed; hence its entry becomes difficult.
Therefore, the medium disruption is better: for when it does not become a difficult reduction of the intestine, as it becomes easier in these two species.
Know that the suturing of veins is according to four modes.
Two common stitches agree in suturing the vein and in suturing other wounds of the body: and two other stitches properly concern other wounds.
However, they are more proper for suturing the vein: and I will tell you each one with an explanation and declaration. I say that when the wound is small and something from the intestine emerges from it, making its reduction difficult, then it is due to one of two methods.
Either because of the smallness of the disruption, as we have said: or because of inflation in the intestine due to cold air.
Therefore, when this is the case, you should warm it, such that you immerse a sponge or a wet cloth in warm water.
Or boil it in water with saffron, cyperus, and spike, and foment the intestine with it until the inflation resolves.
Sometimes it causes this with wine in which there is vinegar: and it is better than water alone in the resolution of inflammation.
When therefore you see the swelling already resolved, then moisten the intestine with water in which althaea or marsh-mallow has been decocted.
For through this the entrance of the intestine is nourished with a small quantity.
If however the return of its flow is hindered after this cure, then cut a little in the rupture using the instrument with which hemorrhoids are cut.
And the first cure is better when it is prepared than the section: and there is no coercion to cut after necessity and deficiency of the instrument.
Let one part be that which is twisted and acute, and the other part not acute, and let the extremity not be thin with the thinness of Spatumilis, but rather be somewhat blunt: and it is that which resembles a lancet, as you see.
When therefore the wound is enlarged and enters the intestine, then it should be reduced according to its natural form in its proper place, if possible above it: for that is better.
When however the rupture is large in the lower part of the belly: then it should be made to lie down on its back, and raise its legs higher than its head.
And if it is in the upper part of the belly, then raise its head and its chest higher than its lower parts.
And similarly, if the rupture is in one of the two parts of the belly, then direct your intent and consideration always to this: let the part in which the wound is be higher than the other part.
And thus it should be administered in large wounds and in medium-sized wounds.
In wounds small, place that according as it is prepared for thee.
Then make sure that a pious minister is present in thy hands, who hold the entire wound with his hand: and bring close his lips.
Then detect from it for him who follows to suture something after something: and this is the common mode of suturing one.
And take the needle, or a number of needles according to the width of the wound.
Then release the length of the wound equivalent to the width of a finger, that is, a physician's finger: and fix the needle with one thread at both extremities of the skin, with two internal extremities beneath the skin, until you make it penetrate from the other side, and now you have joined the two extremities of the skin, and the two internal extremities: and four orders are made.
Then stitch with a doubled thread around the needle several times from both sides simultaneously, until the two lips of the wound are joined by a suitable closure.
Then release the width of a finger as well, and fix another needle in them: afterwards stitch it with a thread, just as you did with the first needle.
Therefore, do not cease to do this with the needle where you need it until you complete the closure of the entire wound.
And let the needles be of medium size between thickness and thinness: for very thin needles quickly pierce the flesh, and thick ones are difficult to introduce into the skin: therefore, they should be of medium thickness and size.
And it is not necessary to fix a needle in the two extremities of the nearby skin too closely: so that flesh does not quicklyincid, and a wound be opened before its consolidation, and also not elongate even with suturing, so that a wound is not prevented from consolidation.
Then incise the extremities of the needle, so that they do not harm the weak during their sleep: and place small cloths from all parts on them, which hold the extremities of the needle: and release them until you know that the wound is already consolidated.
And this species of suturing with needles is indeed more suitable for small wounds.
Since one or two needles suffice in suturing them.
The second common suturing method is to aggregate the extremities of four: two edges of the skin and two extremities alternately with one needle, using a needle in which the thread is wound equally in terms of thickness and diameter.
Then, when you have penetrated with the needle these four extremities, withdraw the needle from the part where you began, in the same manner, so that the thread retained from the upper part of the wound falls: let the suture be as a suture of cloth which is tied up, and place the width of a minor finger between each suture.
This suture is known to people.
And with this suture, I treated my own wound that occurred in a man in his belly, who had been wounded with a knife, and the wound was a breach of more than one palm: and it had come out from the intestines about two palms from the middle intestine, and there was a breach in the middle of the belly.
Therefore I returned that after twenty-four hours when the intestine was extruded through the wound.
Therefore the wound consolidated in the space of about fifteen days: and I treated it, and it was healed: and he lived many years after that, occupied with his affairs.
And the physicians judged that it would not be healed.
And it was a miracle that I did not treat that with ointment.
Since I was in a place where ointment and anything from medicines could not be found.
Therefore I placed old cloth over the wound twice a day, and attended to its washing with honey water until it was healed.
I will now speak of two species of suturing proper according to the narrative speech.
And you should begin with acute suture: and introduce the needle from the external to the internal part.
Therefore when the needle penetrates through the skin and enters the muscle according to the length and width of the entire body: release the end of the thread on the side where you introduced the needle, and make it penetrate to the other end from the internal part to the external part in the opposite direction.
Therefore when you have made it penetrate, then make it penetrate in the same direction from that side in the opposite direction from the external part to the internal part: release the end of the thread on the side where you are, and make the needle penetrate to the other end from the internal part to the external part. And as you make it penetrate in the opposite direction in the end where you are, do so until it penetrates through the entire area.
Then begin also from this same side, and cut into it with the point, which is from siftac on the other side, and draw out the needle from the skin which it penetrated.
Then reduce it to that skin, and with the point of siftac, which is on the other side, use this point mirach: and draw it out from the skin which is on its part, and do that in one manner, and another: and do that in one after another, until you have completely separated it according to that example.
And the summary of this suturing is to use the sutures of pelliparists when they sew skins: thus, with the point of siftac in one manner from one part of the skin edge, and release it in another manner from the other part until you complete it.
The second kind of suture proper, which Gale mentioned.
His speech is narrated thus: they join the entire part to a corresponding whole by nature, and apply the point of siftac to another part of it, and the point of mirach to another part of it.
And this is done according to what I am narrating to you.
You must fix the needle at the point of mirach near to you from the outer part, and make it penetrate to the inner side in that place alone: and release the two points of siftac.
Then rotate the needle, and make it penetrate from the outer part to the inner part through two points of siftac, that is, on both sides.
Then roll both, even making both penetrate from the inner side to the outer, into two extremities of the mirach, which are on the opposite side.
And this method of suturing is better than the common easy suture, and is the suture of which the mention preceded.
This is therefore Galen's word as well.
And some said.
The abdominal suture is made with two needles.
That is, you should introduce one thread into both: and start with the needle entering from where it is near you, and make it penetrate to the opposite side, according to the suture of those who sew skin equally.
And know that when the rupture is in the middle of the abdomen, then its suture is more difficult than that of other places in the abdomen.
The judgment of wound treatment is the judgment of other wounds.
That is, when you treat a recent wound with its own blood before the air alters it, and you reduce the intestine and apply it properly, then place it over powder of chalk.
If the air has already altered the wound, then place on it certain ointments that are present with you until they produce pus. And let the threads fall out, and may the flesh heal properly and the mirach.
Then treat it as the treatment of other wounds until it heals.
If, however, the medicines are not at hand, then place over it immediately, from the moment it begins to discharge pus, fresh old brine: and change it twice a day, as I have taught you, until it is healed.
If, however, you fear that the wound communicates with the principal members in the injury, then it must be that you soak a mild cloth in temperate warm oil or in rose oil: and place it around the areas between the thighs and under the armpits.
If he feels pain, or punctures, or putrefaction in his intestines (for this often happens), then use a clyster with styptic black wine: especially if the putrefaction has already reached the intestines and caused an ulcer penetrating to its depth.
And know that which comes from the large intestine is easier to heal, and that which comes from the finer parts is harder to heal.
And know that the intestine called Jejunum does not receive healing from a wound that occurs in it at all: and this is because of its abundance, which comes from veins, and the size of those veins, and because of the subtlety of its body, and the proximity of its nature to nerves.
If, however, what proceeds from the wound is zirbum, and you detect it fresh: reduce it according to your reduction method, by which you reduce the intestines equally.
If, however, the time has passed and it has already become green or black: then you must bind it with a thread above the place that has darkened from it, so that there is no flow of blood.
In sinewy tissues are veins and arteries.
Then cut what is beyond that ligament, and place two ends of the thread hanging from the lower part of the wound outside it: so that when the sinew is drawn above you, and extracted at that place in case of the sinew, the discharge of pus from the wound may be promoted.
Recall the wound that occurs in the Intestine.
When there is a rupture in the Intestine and it is small, then restoration may occur in some individuals: for I have seen one who was wounded in his belly with a lance, and the wound was on the right side of the stomach, and the wound was old: and it became a fistula, and evacuation and flatulence occurred from it.
Therefore, I provided the treatment until I was not confident in its cure: nor did I cease to refine it until it was healed and the site was strengthened.
After I saw the site had become consolidated, I feared for the patient, lest some evil happen to him in his belly: and no evil happened to him from that.
And he remained in better condition, eating and drinking, and copulating, and bathed, and exercised according to his diet.
And some experienced practitioners have said that when a wound occurs in the Intestine and is small, then it should be ligated in this manner.
And you should take large-headed ants.
Then bring together the two lips of the wound, and place one ant with an open mouth over the two lips of the wound.
When therefore he speaks of it and tightens his mouth, cut off its head, for it adheres and does not loosen.
Then place another ant near the first, and continue doing this with the ant after the ant according to the size of the wound.
Then reduce it and apply it to the wound.
For the heads remain attached in the Intestine until the Intestine is nourished and heals, and no harm comes to the sick person. And it is now possible to tie the Intestine even with a fine thread: which is extracted from the intestine of an animal and attached to it after it is introduced into the needle.
And you shall take the end of this thread from the intestine and it shall be stripped much.
Then tie the fine linen thread around its end.
Then introduce that thread into the needle, and apply it to the intestine.
Then reduce it to the disruption. And this method of suturing with ants and intestine is not anything other than according to the way of faith and hope.
Know that a wound which is great and wide, especially if it is in one of the slender intestines, then there is no skill but delicate suturing, and its complete healing is not possible.
¶ Concerning the care of Zuchemen and Fistulae.
Chapter LXXXVIII.
Know that every wound or apstema when it grows old and becomes an ulcer and does not consolidate, and always emits pus and is not cut: then it is universally called a fistula, and we call it zuchemen.
And a fistula according to truth is a filtered, hard, white swelling, with which there is no pain, and which has the凹陷如羽毛: for this reason some call it Risati, that is, feather.
And it is sometimes moist, which emits pus.
And perhaps the moisture is cut in some hours.
And sometimes this moisture is great and little, and thick and thin.
And I have already mentioned in the division when I said wounds that every ulcer which does not heal and does not grow flesh in its place is nothing but due to one of nine causes.
Of which one is, either because of the scarcity of blood in the body, or because of its malice, or because there is hard flesh between it and the edge thereof, hindering the growth of flesh: or because it is full of dirt and filth: or because the ulcer itself is putrid, and the matter emitted by it is of bad quality: or because the medicine used in its cure is inappropriate: or because corruption falling into that region is a kind of pestilence, or by virtue of the property of that region, as happens in Caesaraugusta: where digestion of diseases is difficult, and the healing of apstemas by nature is delayed there: or because there is one opening or number of bones.
And I have now shown all these causes and their signs, and the treatments of them with medicines in division: and it is necessary here that you be made to know the treatment of Fistula and Boil, which is done through the way of operation with the hand.
Therefore, know that Fistula occurs in all parts of the body.
For from these arise fistulas that reach the great veins and arteries, or nerves, or sinews: or to the intestines, or to the bladder, or to some from the ribs: or to some from the vertebrae of the back, or to some compound joints: such as the hand, and foot: and from these arise those that go in proximity to the main limb, and similar parts.
Which of these fistulas is according to this mode is from diseases that are difficult to cure, and it does not receive treatment, and when occupied with it, there is labor and ignorance.
If it is from some fistula whose depth does not reach the places I have said: and you hope and trust in its cure, and wish to arrive at knowledge of it, then take a probe of wood or iron, if the fistula extends straight, and inquire after it with it.
If there is a tortuosity in the fistula, then investigate it with probes of fine lead.
Since lead, when introduced gently, yields and bends around the tortuosity.
If the fistula has many openings, it is not possible for you to indicate it with probes.
Therefore, the catheter is removed from the openings through which it was inserted.
For the moisture with which you filled the catheter flows in through other openings and runs out from them.
Then inquire precisely according to the manner in which it is possible for you: that you may know whether there is a mouth or a nerve, and whether it is a distant concavity of the fistula, or near: or whether it is one fistula with many openings, and remain over all that, with the utmost strength you can muster. With your inquiry, by which you question the patient, and in finding pain at the compression with your hand upon the place, and similar from significations and causes leading to suppuration.
Therefore, when you stand in that station truly, then proceed to the cure according to your confidence. And then consider whether it is a near fistula apparent, or at a distant healthy location from the joint, or from the nerve, or artery, or vein, or one of the places I have said to you. Then dry the fistula as previously described in my narration, and remove what is in it from filtration, and decaying flesh, which arises at its opening from flesh or thelul, and similar substances. Cure it until it is healed.
If the fistula is of great depth and is straight, then you must cut it deeply as much as is possible.
Then cleanse it from all decaying flesh.
Then apply an undressed lint cloth soaked in sharp medicines and insert it until it reaches the concavity of the fistula that you grasped with the iron. Do this repeatedly until the sharp medicine corrodes all that remains in the concavity of the fistula from decaying flesh.
Then restore it with ointments which generate healthy flesh until it is healed.
If it indeed does not heal through that, then cauterize it according to what we have narrated.
If therefore the cause of the fistula is the opening, and you are certain of that: then seek it out, and cauterize it according to what I have told you. If nothing from the vein, or nerve, or principal member forbids you, as we said.
If therefore the opening is detected, and there is some corruption and blackness in it: then scrape it until all the corruption is removed.
Then treat it with what induces flesh to grow there until it is healed.
If it is not healed and discharges pus as it did before: then know that you have not reached the complete removal of the corruption.
Therefore examine that again carefully, and make an exact account of it, and cleanse it with your utmost diligence.
Then restore it.
If therefore it is healed, it is good; and if not, then know that the corruption is at a deep part of the body, which you have not reached.
Therefore, you do not have the ability to treat it further unless you let nature take its course.
If the opening is slightly corrupted, and it is possible for you, draw it with fine forceps that are suitable for that.
If there are many bones, then make an exact draw of all of them, and do not leave anything out with your diligence.
If however something from the humors causes you contrary effects, and there is no fear or mistake about the incision: then cut those humors and the flesh if they are there, and free the bones.
If however you do not have the preparation to remove the bones at your time, then place something over the wound that will cause its own putrefaction: and leave it until what is around those bones putsrefies from the flesh and humors.
And watch over the wound so that it does not consolidate.
And tie off the incision which you made in your operation.
Place over it, if you fear it, a cloth submerged in ground sulfur with oil: or a cloth submerged in Egyptian ointment, or some green ointments.
For when these humors putrefy and separate from the bones, the removal of them and their draw are alleviated.
If however there is one large opening, such as the thigh bone or the hip bone, and what is corrupted from it is a large part: then scrape it with the sharpest blade until that blackness and corruption are removed.
Then restore the wound.
If however what is corrupted there is a large part, and the corruption has already reached the bone marrow, then it is necessary to saw through it, and cut it entirely until the place where the corruption ends: then care for it until it consolidates. And I will narrate to you an example of what happened to a man in his thigh: so that you may use this as an example and aid in your operation.
There was a youth of about thirty years of age who suffered pain in his thigh, caused by something that was moved upon him within the body, that is, from the interior, until the matter reached the thigh and an apostema formed: and there was no external cause for him.
Therefore, time was extended with him until the error of the physicians was discovered, and much matter came to the surface.
And the treatment of him was postponed until the thigh became fistulous, and many openings were made in it: all of which emitted pus and bodily humors.
Therefore, a multitude of physicians treated him for about two years, and there was no skill in their hands until I was called, and I saw his thigh, and the materials which were flowing from those openings in great quantity: even all the man's body was now wasted, and his color was yellowish.
Therefore, I inserted a probe into one of the openings, and the probe reached the cavity.
Then I examined all the openings: and I found them communicating with each other from all parts of the thigh. I probed and cut above one of those openings until I reached the bone: and I found it corrupted: what was now consumed, blackened, rotted, and perforated, until it had penetrated to the marrow.
I cut away what was found corrupted, and prepared it from the decayed bone.
And I removed what was not in the bone except that corruption, which I cut and cut away.
And I had already eradicated it.
Then I applied restoration of the wound with medicinal substances over a long interval.
And it had not consolidated.
Then I endeavored to restore it.
And it had not been restored.
Then I restored it with medicinal substances, and it quickly consolidated and was healed. And this repetition was not necessary in his operation and sectioning, except on account of the weak condition of the patient, and the scarcity of his tolerance, and my fear for him concerning death: for he suffered from syncope symptoms at all times due to excessive evacuation.
Therefore it was completely healed: and the flesh grew hard in its place, and his condition in his body was well established, and his strength returned: and he reverted to his usual states: and walking did not at all harm him.
If the bone is protruding in the body and already broken, then it must be cut as follows: and do this: take a ligament and tie it at the end of the protruding bone. Command someone to extend it upwards. Place another ligament, thicker than the first, over it. Then ligate it over the flesh, which is upon bone: and extend its extremity, that you may draw the flesh towards the lower part: and you shall cut the flesh over the place where you wish to incise, so as not to wound the flesh with the knife.
Place a stick or board under the lower bone centrally: for when you do this, it does not prevent the knife from cutting rotten flesh.
And the incision should be slightly over the rotten place, so that it is not in the concavity of the bone, and should not appear conspicuous to the touch, compelling another incision. And if the bone is rotten and not prominent, join its part with another part: and the rot is in its middle or part: then cut away the flesh from all its parts entirely.
Then place a stick below.
Then incise it from the first part where the rot is, until the incision continues from the other side: and let the incision be slightly according to the length of the rot, as we have said.
And if the rot is at the joint, incise the rotten joint and cut the bone where it continues from the other side.
And if the rot is in the continuity of two joints, then there is no skill but mere scraping.
And if the rot is in the heel of the hand or the heel of the foot, then the matter is greatly difficult.
Truly, you must inquire how the rot appears to you.
And I will cleanse it and make it clean according to whatever arrangement is possible for you, and when corrected by any ingenuity it is done for you: when the Vein or Nerve does not cause you opposition.
And know that incisoria and Serrae for cutting these bones are many, according to the position of the bones, and their preparation, and their thickness, and their subtlety, and their magnitude, and their fineness, and their hardness, and their rarity.
Therefore, you must prepare an instrument suitable for each species of operation.
And know that these operations indicate to you the species of instrument you need when you have a long study.
And the knowledge of the modes of this art is a testimony to the modes of disease: for then you will find by yourself what is suitable for it from the instruments for every illness.

¶ Of the Incision of Extremities, and Fractures of Bones.
Chapter LXXXIX.
Extremities putrefy either from an external cause or an internal cause.
When therefore you have treated that corruption with medicinal cure and the cure does not take effect, and you see the corruption spreading to the limb, which nothing checks: then it is necessary to incise that limb until where the corruption spreads, so that the patient may escape death through that incision, or from the evil which is greater than the defect of the limb.
And the sign that this happens is when the limb darkens until it rots; which fire has burned or decayed after discoloration: until that corruption is incised until it reaches what follows that limb and spreads throughout the entire body.
Therefore, when making the incision of that limb, and similarly if the cause of the corruption is from the impact of certain venomous creatures: such as the marine scorpion, viper, or rhinoceros beetle, and similar ones.
If therefore the corruption or impact is on the extremity of a finger, then cut off the finger, and do not leave space for the corruption to spread to the rest of the hand.
And similarly if it happens in the hand, then cut off the entire hand from the root of the finger, and do not leave space for the corruption to spread until it reaches the forearm.
And if it enters there, then cut the arm at the elbow joint. If corruption nevertheless passes through, and you see it about the elbow: then there is death for the sick.
And to administer beyond that in cure, is the quantity of virtue.
And similarly do for the foot, when corruption invades a digit, then cut off the digit at one of its nodes: and if it reaches the pedal bone, then cut off the entire foot.
And if it ascends to the knee, then cut off the leg at the knee joint.
If corruption has already reached above the knee, then there is no remedy except dismissal and leaving the sick man to death.
And the method of cutting the limb, or sawing it, is to tighten the ligament below where you wish to cut: and tighten another ligament above the place.
And let the attendant stretch one ligament downward: and let him stretch another ligament upward above.
And you separate the flesh that is between the two ligaments, using Spatulum wide, until all the flesh is exposed.
Then cut it, or saw it.
And it must be that you place a linen cloth from all sides, and the saw does not touch the healthy site: and a wound is inflicted on the sick person, and a hot abscess occurs.
And if a internal blood flow occurs while working, then cauterize the site quickly: or place some blood-absorbing powders over it.
Then return to your treatment until it is completed.
Then bind the wounded limb with an appropriate bandage, and care for it until it is healed.
And I tell you what happened to a man in his foot, the same thing that I am telling you about.
For there was a darkening of his foot due to a burning similar to the combustion of fire: and that corruption first occurred on his toe until it began to affect his whole foot.
Therefore, the man treated himself, after he saw the corruption occur on his limb with its accompanying swelling, which he found from pain and burning: and it affected him at the joint, and he was healed.
And after a long time had passed, the same corruption occurred on his index finger. Therefore, he came to me, and I attempted to reduce the swelling with what I applied to his hand from medicines after cleansing his body: but the swelling did not subside, and it began to affect another finger: until the corruption spread to his hand.
Therefore, he called for me to treat his hand: and I did not want that, hoping for the swelling to subside on its own through my treatment: and I even feared death for him at the incision in his hand.
For the man's strength was superior to the condition.
Therefore, since he had given up on me, he returned to his homeland: and he came back to me in haste because his hand had fully become affected: and he was healed.
And I have not brought this narration except as an aid to that which falls under the genus of this illness: and as a signification by which it should be understood and acted upon.
¶ Concerning the care of Sinuses, and the quality of clisterization with medicines.
Head XC.
When an abscess occurs in certain fleshy members, and the space of the abscess is prolonged until a collection of sanious matter is formed: then it breaks or is perforated, and what is therein exudes from it, leaving behind a void like a vessel: and the skin above it resembles a thin cloth: and it does not reach its ultimate corruption, nor imprint itself in the mouth, nor in the nerve, nor in the ligament: it deserves to be called a Sinus: and it is not named a Fistula: yet if the space thereof is prolonged until corruption imprints itself upon one of these members, then it is called a Fistula or zuken.
And the care of it is to incise that skin completely as it has turned thin: and especially when it has become thin like a cloth: and you may be confident that it does not adhere to the place because of its corruption.
If, however, you suspect that the skin will adhere, and it does not result in that ultimate corruption: and if there is thickness in the skin from flesh, then treat it with a clister, and consider it as for a Sinus.
Then if it is large, and the pus that is emitted from it has a foul odor, then treat it with a clister containing Egyptian medicine, which is a mixture of vinegar, oil, and ziniar in equal parts, aggregated in a vessel: and heat it over fire until the medicine turns red: and become as thick as honey.
Then take what is necessary for you: and dissolve it with water and honey, and pour the enema with it. Tighten its orifice, and let the medicine be in it for the quantity of two hours.
Then extract it with expression: do this for several days until the sinuses are cleansed and the odor is removed.
And when an enema is performed with water of ashes, if this medicine is not at hand: and you should take the ashes of vine twigs, or ashes from holm oaks, and pour it over them.
Then apply it and perform an enema with it until you are confident that the sinuses are now cleansed.
If the patient cannot tolerate the Egyptian medicine or the water of ashes, then perform an enema with it using water and honey, to which some powdered zinc has already been mixed.
Or perform an enema with it mixed with honey and wine, for honey has the property to cleanse and wash, and wine makes the sinuses adhere, especially when there is excess astringency and dryness in the wine.
When you do this several times and are confident that the sinuses are no longer corrupted, then perform an enema with it to cause flesh to regenerate in them.
And you should take from the plaster of Dyafinicon: dissolve it with rose oil and astringent wine: or perform an enema with it using certain medicines and other ointments, whose properties I have written about in the treatise on ointments.
If the sinus opening is narrow and does not accommodate the catheter: then enlarge it slightly with a knife, or place therein a rolled ligature in Egyptian ointment or basilicon ointment until it is enlarged.
And similarly, if the opening is also wide, then draw together its lips with a suture and remove from it a quantity through which the catheter can enter without addition.
And similarly, if the opening from which pus flows is elevated above: then dry it out in a lower place that is within it, so that the pus flows downward. For when pus is constricted in the depth of the sinus, it prevents flesh from growing there.
And if it is not possible for you to dry the sinus below as you wish: then try to prepare the member with a preparation whereby the pus flows out easily according to how it is prepared for you.
Try to ensure that nothing from the pus is retained there at all: and take conservative medicines which are applied over the mark, suitable for what you wish.
And apply them on a linen cloth.
And let the cloth be of such quantity that it can cover the entire sinus.
Then cut with forceps directly into the sinus opening to make a hole slightly larger than the sinus opening.
Then apply another cloth soaked in mild ointment over the hole, according to the size of the opening: and place it far from the sinus opening so that the exit of the pus is eased. Do not remove the large cloth unless after several days once it has been changed.
He who is above the sinus orifice, is that which you remove at all times, so that what aggregates in it from pus may exit: and know whether that which flows from it is much or little, whether digested or undigested.
And consider again the place of the sinus itself: whether the lord feels pain therein, or there is no pain therein, and whether there is an abscess therein, or there is no abscess.
When therefore you conduct your treatment in this manner, and you see the matter that exits over the sinus orifice, then know that the sinus is now adhering, or approaching adherence: therefore dissolve it in the morning, or on the third day: and when you resolve the wound, then change another dressing, and renew the ointment. If however subtle poison exits from the sinus after a long interval, then do not despair of its adherence, for its healing is approaching, for among humans there are those who delay the generation of flesh in their wounds, and among them are those who act contrary to this.
If however pus undigested exits from the sinus after many days, then know that the sinus does not adhere.
If therefore the adherence of the sinus is delayed and its course is prolonged: then add to the drying of the medicines, but let the doctors do it, so that they are medicines in their substance moist and in their virtue dry: just as the ointment dyafinicon, when an excess is added to it from zegi.
And from the last stage of cure, take the ointment dyafinicon, dissolve it with rose oil, and let it be spread over old wine that is equal in its substance.
Then compound it with him, and use it.
And now it does this when you have no dyafinicon ointment at hand, using honey, when you have prepared it until it thickens, and use it.
Or take myrrh, and aloes, and frankincense: rub them all, and powder it over honey while it is on fire.
Then lay honey over it on a cloth, and tie it above the wound: and tie it with honey that you have prepared until it thickens, and powder the preparation over it, and place the cloth over it, and tie it.
And sometimes administered in it are long aristolochia, and roots of celestial lily, and lily: and herb powder, and centaury.
Use them either simple or compounded, rub them, and sift them: and powder them over the honey as I have described, and use it.
If the wound persists and is not cured by this treatment, then know that there is deep corruption within it. Or it has already made an impression in the bones, or in the other hard parts, or in the ligaments: then treat it with the cure for fistulas, as previously stated. On the care of panaritium and worn-out nail, and incision of the digit added, and sectioning.
Head XCI.
Panaritium is an abscess that arises under the thumb nail, or the foot nail: and perhaps it arises in other digits.
When therefore it is prolonged and neglected by its carer, and becomes inflamed with a hot inflammation: either it rots and emits pus until it eats into the root of the nail: and perhaps it corrupts the whole of it, and perhaps corruption reaches the mouth until there is a foul smell: and the extremity of the finger becomes broad, and its color becomes dark.
When therefore you care for it, as we have said in the division, and your care does not bring about a cure: then it is necessary to incise with a knife all the excess that remains from the nail.
Then cauterize the wound after that.
For the cautery is very beneficial.
If indeed the mouth is healthy, and the nail is also healthy, and the excess of the nail now compresses the flesh towards the interior, and begins to sting the flesh itself, and injure it: then you should place a fine radish under an angle of the nail that stings the flesh, and push it upwards: and cut the flesh with ease, and place above what remains of the flesh from the burning medicines, corroding ones, until all of it is removed.
Then treat it with ointments until it heals.
If the corruption, however, has already spread to the mouth, then you must incise that mouth and extract it: for it is never cured while a corrupted mouth remains.
If you see the corruption and decay spreading to the finger, then cut it off at one joint, according to what has been previously mentioned.
Then care for it until it is cured.
If, however, there is nail wear or injury, and severe pain occurs therein, then it is necessary to bleed the patient first.
Then dry the nail with a sharp transverse slice of Spatumili from top to bottom.
And beware that the incision does not reach the flesh which is beneath the nail, for you will cause the patient severe pain, and this will be a cause for additional flesh to grow in that place.
Then care for the area with what relieves the pain.
The additional finger that grows on some people's hands may be entirely fleshly: and in some cases, it may have bones, and there may be a nail: and in some cases, it grows at the base of the joint, or its growth is in certain nodes of the finger.
That which grows at the nodes of the finger does not move, and that which grows near the finger joint may move.
Therefore, if it is fleshly, its incision is easy.
Therefore, incise it at its base with a broad Spatule.
Therefore, the treatment for that which grows at the base of the joint is difficult.
Therefore, do not incise it.
For that which grows on the finger at the last node, you should first incise the flesh with a round cut until reaching the bone.
Then cut the mouth with one of those suitable saws for it.
Then care for it until it is healed.
Consolidation which occurs between the digits adnately is frequent, either from the nativity of the man, that is, he is born with it, or from the consolidation of a wound, or from burning by fire, and similar conditions.
Therefore, you must cut away that consolidation until the digits return to their natural form.
Then place between them licinia or wet cloths in rose oil, so that they do not consolidate quickly, and separate them. Or place between them a thin sheet of lead until the area consolidates as required.
And similarly, if consolidation occurs between some digits and the palm, then dry out that consolidation according to how it is prepared and fits the shape of the limb.
¶ Incision for Viam.
Head XCII.
Varices are veins wrapped up, thick, full of excess melancholic fluid which occur in many parts of the body: and they are most prevalent in the legs, particularly in the legs of those who walk a great deal, labor, or carry things.
Therefore, you should administer the shaking of the body from black bile several times with strong shaking.
Then phlebotomize the patient and let the basilic vein flow.
However, the care of these using iron is according to two methods.
They have a condition, it is said, from which black blood is drawn.
And another method is, the vein is elevated, and all the blood is drawn out.
The section of it is according to this method.
Rub the leg first with warm water much until the thick and foul blood resolves.
Then tie the leg of the patient from the upper part of the hip to the lower part of the knee with a ligature.
Then dry the vein in one, or two, or three broad sections.
Then dry the nail with the lower part until a quantity of blood sufficient and tolerable by the patient's strength emerges.
Then tie it: and instruct him to avoid foods producing black bile, and repeat the evacuation and phlebotomy when the veins are full, and this will harm the patient.
The elevation of it is according to this method.
Shave the leg of the patient if there are many hairs.
Then immerse it in a bath: or rub the leg with warm water until it reddens and the veins become prominent: or exercise vigorously if a bath is not available until the limb warms up.
Then dry the skin along the length of the vein section: either at its end near the knee, or in the lower part of it near the heel.
Then incise the skin with forceps, and strip the vein from all sides until it appears to the touch: and what you see when it appears is that it appears red inclining to black.
When therefore it goes out from the skin, you will see it white as if it were a string.
Then introduce the Radium under it until when it is lifted and goes out from the skin: suspend it with a blind forceps gently.
Then dry the other section near that section with three fingers.
Then strip the skin from the upper part of the vein until it appears.
Then lift it with the Radium as you have done, and suspend it with another forceps as you did at first.
Then dry the other section, or more sections if needed.
Then lift it, and cut the last section near the heel.
Then extract it to the section which is above it.
And do this until you extract it from the section above, or all higher sections, until it has completely emerged: then cut it.
If it does not yield to you in extraction and lifting, then introduce a needle with a strong double thread, and tie it, and extract it. Or introduce the Radium under it, and turn your hand in all directions until it emerges.
And beware, lest it happen.
For if it happen, it will be difficult for you to lift it very much, and it enters beyond the weak point causing harm.
When therefore you have drawn it out entirely, then place over the wound wool soaked in wine and rose oil, or oil, and take care of it until it is healed.
If the vine is contracted, having a twist and involving parts thereof, and is not as we said according to straightness: then you must find over it at every part of its twist, and the places where it is involved.
Then suspend it with hooks until you lift it entirely: and beware at your cut not to pierce a vein or wound it, for it will be difficult for you to lift or extract it.
Therefore preserve your prudence.
Shape of the Incidence as the Vine is Cured.
Shape of the Blind Vine.
It does not have the same elasticity as other vines, nor is it pointed at its extremity, so as not to wound a vein; and it has a large and gentle flexibility: for if it were fine, it would pierce the vein with its subtlety; rather, its excess in thickness, as we said, is appropriate.
On the Extraction of the Vein of the Leg. Head 93.
This vein is generated in the legs of people in warm lands, such as Alizegi, and the land of the Arabs, and in dry, warm, weak-soil lands, that is, in which neither grass nor tree grows.
And perhaps it is generated in other parts of the body besides the legs.
And its generation is from putrefaction that occurs under the skin, just as snakes and ascaris worms occur within the body, and worms are generated between the skin and flesh.
And the sign of the onset of this event is inflammation in the leg that occurs vigorously.
Then the area blisters.
Then the Vein begins to emerge from that blistered area, as if it were the root of a plant or an animal.
When therefore the extremity of it becomes apparent, then it is necessary to wrap a fragment of lead, whose weight is from one half-draic to two draics, around it and mark the lead hanging from the leg.
Whenever therefore it emerges from that to the exterior, wrap that in lead and mark it.
If it extends greatly, then cut the part of it, and wrap the remainder.
And do not cut it rootedly until it emerges entirely.
For if you cut it, it contracts and enters the flesh, causing an abscess, corruption, and a malignant ulcer.
Therefore, it should be gently handled and drawn out gradually until it emerges from the last part of it, and nothing remains of it in the body: in some people, this Vein emerges to a length of five palms and ten.
And now it has come to me, because he exited from twenty palms.
If, however, it happens to you in the hour of your medication: then insert a needle into its aperture, and perforate it with a long hole, along with the body, until all that is within it from the matter is evacuated: and administer putrefaction to the place with medicinal substances for several days. Then care for the apostema with its cure.
And indeed, this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears at the ankle or in the foot itself: and it encounters many openings, and a branch emerges from every opening.
Therefore care for it as we said in the division, and with whatever was previously mentioned.
¶ Concerning the section on Worms generated under the skin, and it is called Bovine Illness.
Head XCIV.
This illness is called Bovine Illness in certain lands among us: for it often happens to cows, and it is a small worm that is born between the skin and flesh.
And it traverses the entire body, ascending and descending: and its presence is perceived by touch during its movement from limb to limb, until it breaks through at any point in the skin and emerges.
And its generation is from the putrefaction of certain humors.
Just as worms and snakes, that is, earthworms and ascarids, occur in the intestines.
And it is feared from its malignity.
Because when it enters the body and rises to the head, and arrives at a place, then perhaps it opens there, and exits, and destroys the eye: and this happens oftentimes.
When therefore you wish to cure him and extract it, then this is done only during his movement and appearance before the senses.
Therefore, you must tighten what is above it and what is below it with a strong constriction.
Then dry it above, and extract it.
If it is deep in the flesh and you do not find it, then place a cautery with fire over the spot until it dies.
And greater than what is feared is its corruption, through which it destroys the eye, as we have said. If you see it already arrived at the head near the eye, then tighten beneath it the eyebrow with a good constriction.
Then dry it above, and extract it.
And the patient should use a cleansing of his body with medicines that dissolve putrid and harmful fluids.
And let him beware of foods that cause putrefaction.
¶ Concerning the excision of the disease Nakir.
Chapter XC.
This disease is called Nakir in our land: it is a pain that occurs in certain limbs and then alternates from limb to limb.
And I have indeed seen it myself, according to what I narrate to you.
I was called to a sick woman in certain villas.
And he exposed his arm, and I saw a small swelling in the vein of the arm.
And after I remained for one hour, I saw a swelling move with rapidity, as a worm moves, ascending to his shoulder faster than can be perceived: so that it is like live silver when it runs from place to place.
Therefore, the pain recessed from that place and fixed itself in his shoulder.
Then I sat for one hour, and it ran through the rest of his body until it reached the other arm.
Then he told me that it was moving throughout his entire body, as I had seen.
I was therefore amazed at the speed of its movement from one limb to another.
And I had indeed not seen this illness with my own eyes in such a manner before.
Indeed, I have seen many who find the pain shifting from one limb to another: but I did not see it with my own eyes as I saw it in this woman.
And I do not think that it is anything other than what it is because the woman was among those who have dry-bodied veins detected in the villas: therefore, this airiness is evident to the senses as it shifts.
And it is necessary that they not appear according to this reason in those who are delicate and in bodies that are moist, of hidden veins.
And when therefore you wish to effect a cure and the patient feels that pain: then if it is apparent to your eye, as we have said, then bind above it and below it quickly: and dry above it until that compressed wind escapes: and cauterize the place.
If, however, you do not see it with your eyes: then treat it with the evacuation of the body, and with what expels winds, and plug up these winds with foul pills, and pills of sarapin, and similar remedies.
¶ Concerning the Extraction of Arrows.
Head XCVI. Arrows vary according to their kinds and according to the places at which they strike the body.
The diversity of these arrows is as follows: for some have large and small points, and一些文字无法直接翻译，因为这部分似乎没有完整表达完。您希望如何处理这些未完成的部分？还是请提供更多的上下文以便更准确地翻译？
And some have three angles.
And some have tongues.
And some have blades.
Those that fall upon the body parts vary according to two modes.
For the limbs are either from the principal concave parts, such as the brain, and the heart, and the liver, and the lungs, and the kidneys, and the intestines, and the bladder, and similar organs.
When therefore one of these members falls victim to it, and you perceive the signs of death, which I am about to narrate to you, then it is necessary that you perform a proper extraction of that arrow from them, for death follows him in whom it is, in many dispositions.
And when these evil signs do not appear to you, and the arrow is not hidden in the depth of the member, then extract it, and care for the wound.
For when an arrow falls into the brain and penetrates the mouth and exits through the siphon which is above the brain, then there arise from it violent nausea, blindness, dizziness, redness in the eyes, swelling, redness of the tongue, spasms, confusion, and vomiting of cholera.
And perhaps blood may come out from the nostrils or the ears.
And perhaps speech is cut off, and the voice is destroyed.
And moisture white like pus comes out from the wound.
And something similar to the moisture of flesh exits from it.
And if these signs appear to you, then refrain from treatment and extract the arrow if it does not come out.
The signs of an arrow when it falls into the heart are: it is near the left mammary gland; and one feels as if it is fixed in a hard substance, not in a hollow one.
And perhaps the movement of the arrow is similar to the pulse: and black blood flows from the wound.
And follows that of cold in extremities, and cold sweat, and syncope.
Therefore, know that death descends without doubt.
And the sign of the arrow when it wounds the lung is the exit of foamy blood from the wound: and the vessels which follow the neck become inflamed, and the color of the sick person changes.
And he exhales a great, deep breath: and seeks the attraction of cold air.
And if the arrow falls into the veil, which is in the chest: then it is near the small ribs: and there is a great panting with a violent pain, with a sigh: and all the members of the shoulders move.
And if the arrow falls into the stomach, then perhaps something undigested from the wound will be discharged.
And if the arrow falls into the abdomen and is fixed therein: something of feces will be discharged from the wound, or that which is intestinal and already disrupted.
Therefore, there is no hope of curing him, nor in extracting the arrow.
And if the arrow falls into the bladder and urine is discharged: and something proceeds from it to the exterior, and the pain is stronger upon the sick person: then know that it is mortal.
And the other members, such as the face, neck, throat, spatula, auxiliary muscles, spine, furcula, thigh, leg, and similar parts are affected from the wound according to various dispositions: when the arrow does not hit an artery or nerve: and the arrow is not venomous.
And I narrate to you what I have seen concerning these arrows, that you may signify through it regarding your cure.
Which is, because a arrow fell into the lacrimal eye of a man, at the root of his nose.
Therefore, I extracted it from the other side, beneath the fat of his ear: and he was cured, and no harm came to his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from a Jew, which fell into the fat of his eye beneath the lower eyelid: and the arrow was already hidden, and I obtained from it only its small end, with which it adheres to its wood: and the arrow was large among the arrows of the Turkish bows, with soft iron, in which there are no ears.
Therefore, the Jew was cured, and no harm befell his eye. And I extracted an arrow from the throat of a Christian.
And it was an Arabic arrow, and it has ears.
And I incised over it between two guides: and it was already submerged in his throat.
And I extracted it with great care until I removed it: and the Christian was cured.
And I extracted another arrow from a man which fell into his abdomen: and we thought that he would die from it.
And after thirty days had passed from him, and nothing changed in his condition, I incised over the arrow: and I extracted it: and he was cured, and no harm came to him.
And I saw a man whom an arrow had fallen into his back, and the wound had healed over it.
Therefore, seven years later, the arrow emerged at the root of his thigh.
And I saw a woman whom an arrow had fallen into her belly, and the wound had healed over it, and the arrow remained within her: and none of its position was changed, and the woman found no harm in any of her natural operations.
And I saw another man, whom an arrow had fallen into his face: and the wound healed, and remained, not finding for him much pain: and similar to these many things.
And I extracted the arrow from one of the king's men, which had fallen into the middle of his nose, and it had already tilted slightly to the right: and the entire arrow was hidden.
I was therefore called to cure him after the arrow wound for three days.
I found the arrow wound very deep.
I examined it with a fine probe and did not sense the arrow: indeed, he himself found a puncture and pain near his ear on the right side.
I hoped that that puncture was at the tip of the arrow.
I applied a plaster to the area with a healing plaster, and confident that the spot would develop an abscess and show me the sign of the arrow, so I could cut over it: and nothing happened in the spot that would indicate that the arrow had reached the area.
Therefore, apply the plaster to him assiduously for many days: and no accident happened, and the wound became consolidated in the meantime: and the sick man remained without the extraction for a space of days until he felt the arrow in his nose on a certain day.
And he narrated to me that.
Therefore, I applied sharp and corroding medicine to the wound for many days until it opened up: and when I probed it, I felt the fine tip of the arrow adhering to the wood.
Then I added the sharp medicine to the opened wound until we could visibly see the tip of the arrow: and it remained with me for a space of time about four months.
Then, after the wound had enlarged, and it became possible for me to introduce forceps into it and move it, and it did not yield to removal: then I continued to refine and devise methods for it until one day I began to remove it with properly made forceps, as their form will be shown at the end of this chapter, until I extracted it.
Then I restored the wound.
And the physicians indeed judge that the cartilage of the nose is not restored.
Therefore, I restored it, and the wound became consolidated, and the sick man was cured with complete health: and nothing at all harmed him.
And I narrate to you the quality of the extraction of certain arrows: that you may establish a rule and definition for what I have not said.
Since the parts of this art and their distinctions are not comprehended with the narration: neither does that book, and a prudent artisan compares with a little more than enough: and with what is present, over what is absent: and he finds a new operation, and a new instrument among the descents of foreign matters when they occur.
I say that arrows do not exit from the limbs on which they are fixed, except according to two modes. Or by attraction through the place from which it entered.
Or by the opposite part of the other.
And that which exits from where it entered, whether it is an arrow proceeding into a fleshy place and being attracted and exiting.
And if it does not comply with the exit at the time it falls, then you must let it go for a few days until the flesh around it putrifies. The attraction of it will diminish, and its exit will follow.
And similarly, if it is embedded in bone and does not comply with your desire for its exit, then let it go for a few days. Repeat the procedure with attraction and motion every day until it exits.
And if it does not comply with your desire for its exit after several days, then you must puncture around the arrow in the bone from every part with a fine probe until the arrow expands.
Then attract it, and extract it.
If the arrow is fixed in the head bone and has already penetrated into one ventricle of the brain, and symptoms of the conditions I have said appear in the patient: then abstain from attracting the arrow, and let it be until its condition equals out after several days.
For if an arrow reaches the heart, then death is not prolonged for him.
And if the arrow is not fixed, unless in the body of bone only, and does not penetrate all the way to the heart: and the sick person remains for a few days, and nothing happens to him from those accidents: then skill in attracting the arrow and extracting it.
If it is fixed very deeply, and does not yield to you in attracting it: then apply ointment around the arrow, as I have told you: then care for the place until it is healed.
If the arrow has already been hidden in the body and is concealed and hidden from sensation: then seek it out and probe for it.
If you feel it, then attract it with instruments that are suitable for its extraction.
If you cannot reach it due to the constriction of the wound and the length of the arrow in the deep tissue: and there is neither bone, nor nerve, nor vein there: then enlarge the wound above it until it becomes possible to extract the arrow.
If there are ears with which it is held, then free the flesh fixed in them from every side, by all means you can, and use other skills if it cannot be extracted by freeing the flesh without breaking or twisting the ears until it comes out.
And when you perform the extraction of the arrow in any place, then use the twisting of your hand with forceps for all parts until you make it come out: and with utmost subtlety, so that the arrow is not broken, and the attraction and extraction become difficult for you.
If thou canst not over her in one hour, then let her go for a few days until that which is about her decays.
Then iterate with her: for she will be encouraged by it. But if she gives thee contrary symptoms, namely a change in the flow of blood, then administer what we have said in the cure in his chapter: and guard thy virtue from incision of the vein, or nerve, or chord.
And administer the arrow in every way in which it is possible for thee to effect its exit: and may it be so with facility, and tranquility, or tardiness, and firmness, as I have told thee.
And thou must do so when thou drawest the arrow, that the patient be weak according to the figure, according to which it was at the time of the arrow's flight.
For it is more advantageous.
If, however, it is not possible for thee to do so, then administer what is possible for thee according to the figures.
The arrow which emerges from the opposite part of the other, or has already proceeded from it to the exterior, will cause a hump at the end of the arrow through a sensation from the proximate skin above, and thou wilt see it protruding. Therefore, cut above it, and let the cut be according to the quantity that forceps can grasp in it.
Then draw it out; for it becomes easy to extract.
If, however, it is retained in the bone, then twist thy hand according to the roundness until the arrow impresses itself into the bone and expands more: then draw it out.
And if not: release her for a few days; then repeat it until she emerges.
And if the arrowwood is in her, then press it with her.
And if the arrowwood has fallen, and you wish to administer a pressure: then introduce into her an concave instrument, so that its concavity enters the shaft of the arrow: then press it with him.
And if the arrow is concave, then press it with an instrument entering into her.
The arrow is alleviated by that.
And if the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary to apply a concave instrument to all the flesh in which the poison is: if it is possible for you to do so.
Then care for her with what is appropriate for that.
And if the arrow is embedded in the chest, or in the abdomen, or in the bladder, or in the side: and it is nearby what you touch and feel, and it is possible for you to cut above it: then cut it out, and be careful of cutting a vein or nerve, and extract it.
Then tend to the wound if you see one, and care for it until it is healed.
And this is the form of the forceps with which arrows are extracted.
Let the ends be similar to the beak of a bird, made like metal: when they grasp over the arrow, they do not release it.
And from them many kinds are made, great and small, and medium, according to the magnitude of the arrow, its smallness, and the width of the wound, and its contraction.
Forma Impellentis concavi.
And the form of Impellentis surdi.
This is the surda extremity as with a Radius, so that the entrance of it may be alleviated into a concave arrow, and it may be pushed along with it.
The extremity of the impellent concave is concave like a bird's feather: so that the entrance of the arrow may be alleviated into it and its impulse.
¶ Concerning the Phlebotomy of Veins.
Head XCVII. Veins to be phlebotomized, of which custom has run in the body, are thirty.
Of which in the head are sixteen: two Pulsilines, which are behind the ears and called Two Herbs: and two Arteries, which appear in the two temples: and two Veins which are in the two lacrimal glands of the eyes, which are called Aspicientes: and one Prepared Vena in the middle of the forehead: and one Vena which is at the tip of the nose.
And two Guidegi, which are in the neck.
And two veins which are in the upper lip of the mouth.
And two veins which are in the lower lip.
And these are the veins which are called Algecherich.
And two veins that are beneath the tongue.
The veins that are punctured for phlebotomy in the arms are five veins in every arm.
One of them is Cephalic, and it is from the side of the tree: and the common people call it the vein of the head.
And Fusca.
And it is the Median vein, and it is composed of the branch of the Basilic and the branch of the Cephalic: and the common people call it the body vein.
And the Basilic, and it is placed on the domestic side: and it is also called Titillicaris.
And the common people call it the vein of the belly.
And the Basilic vein, and it is placed above the cephalic: and it is that through which phlebotomy is performed, and it is that which appears above the thumb with a clear palpation.
And Salvator: and it is the vein that is between the ring finger and the little finger: and it has two branches.
And in the thigh and in the foot there are three veins.
One of them is that which is below the curvature of the thumb from the side of the tree.
And the second is the Saphenous: and its place is near the heel from the domestic side.
And vein Nesse: and its place is at the heel from the side of the tree.
And in the thigh there are three veins similar to those.
¶ Concerning the phlebotomy of two veins behind the ears.
Phlebotomy of the two veins behind the ears is helpful for ancient catarrhs, hemigraina, sahafati, and old malignant ulcers of the head.
And the quality of phlebotomy for this is as I narrate.
And it is done by shaving the head of the sick person: and the back of his head at the place of the two veins should be rubbed with a rough cloth using good friction.
Then the sick person should tie his neck with a bandage until the two veins become visible.
And their places are behind the ears in two depressed areas of the head.
Seek out these veins with your finger, and where you feel the pulse of the veins beneath your finger, mark those places with cauterization.
Then take the phlebotomy knife, which is called Incidens.
Then insert it under the vein in the skin until the phlebotomy reaches the vein.
Then raise your hand with the vein and skin upwards, and cut the vein along with the skin with a slicing incision.
And the length of the incision should be that of two joined fingers, or about that length: and let the blood flow out as much as you desire.
Then ligate it with ligatures and release it until it is healed.
And the cutting and cauterization of them have already been discussed at the beginning of the book.
¶ Concerning Phlebotomy of Two Arteries at Proper Times.
Of the two arteries at which phlebotomy is beneficial in two times, it is for ancient headache, and for crooked strabismus, and for constant conjunctivitis. It is also for the course of excess fluids to the eyes. And the quality of phlebotomy for these is as I am about to tell you.
The patient should ligate his neck much until two veins become明显可见，并且你可以感觉到它们的脉动。
Then apply the cauterization.
Then lift the skin above the vein with your index finger and introduce the lancet coming from below, and lift the vein upward.
And cut it, as you did with the other two veins: and let the blood flow according to the amount necessary. Then release the ligature on the patient, and place your finger on the vein for one hour.
Then place the cloth and ligatures over it, and ligate it from above with a strong constriction. Release it until it is healed.
And the recall of these, and their cutting, and their extraction have already been discussed at the beginning of the book.
Of phlebotomy of the frontal vein after phlebotomy of the head.
Indeed, the ligature of the phlebotomy of the frontal vein is after phlebotomy of the head, for ancient diseases of the face: and for hemigraine, and erythrasma: and for foul ulcers.
And the quality of this phlebotomy is, as I shall tell you.
The sick person compresses his neck with a string until the vein appears.
Then take the instrument called Fossorium.
Of which this is the form.
Place a prominent point at the top of the Fossorium over the vein, and strike it with a plectrum or some other object in that manner, and let the blood flow according to the amount you desire.
Then release the perforation of the sick person, and bind it tightly until it is healed.
And sometimes it is opened with a broad phlebotomy.
Indeed, it is not appropriate, however, to be a sharp-ended phlebotomy, as are the other phlebotomies, but rather a broad-ended one.
And perform the phlebotomy according to the displacement: for the opening is nearby, and perhaps the phlebotomy will be broken when it is fine.
Of phlebotomy of the Veins in the Two Lacrimal Areas.
The ligature of the two Veins which are in the two Lacrimal bones of the eyes, is for the eye from scabies and russet taint: and it infects the eye, and diseases of the face.
And the quality of their phlebotomy is that the sick person tightens his neck with a woody rod.
Then phlebotomize them: and you stand over his head.
And let the phlebotomy be made across the length somewhat, using a small phlebotome that is a little broad, for there is no flesh in that place.
For if the phlebotome is thin at the tip, it may perhaps break.
Then let it run with the blood as much as you need.
And place cloths over them, and tighten them for one night, and release them.
¶ Concerning the phlebotomy of the Nasal Veins.
The phlebotomy of the Nasal Veins is applied to acute fever, sore throat, and severe diseases of the face, such as hemigraine and russet taint that occurs on the face: particularly when it is old.
And the quality of this phlebotomy is that the sick person tightens his neck.
Then hold his nose with your left hand, and take a thin, long phlebotome: and insert it in the middle of his nose, between what distinguishes the nostrils according to their straightness.
Since the veins do not appear to the sense there, and because blood begins to flow immediately.
And you must use your last hand with the phlebotome slightly: and make the blood flow according to your need.
Then ligate it on the same night.
For it is restored quickly.
¶ Concerning the Phlebotomy of Veins according to Guidehi.
The efficacy of Guidehi's phlebotomy is for the constriction of shortness of breath, and the onset of leprosy, and melancholic illnesses, and impetigo and malignant sores, and those corroding, that is, eruptive diseases.
And the quality of their phlebotomy is that the sick person be tied under both sides at the neck with a ligature: and let the craftsman stand over the head of the sick person, and let the sick person sit on a seat.
Then make the phlebotomy broad along the vein slightly.
Then draw from the vein a measured quantity of blood, or according to what you see is necessary for that.
Then do the same with the other vein.
Then undo the ligature, and tie the two veins with a medium tightness: so that the sick person does not become suffocated.
And let her remain thus until morning.
For the wound is healed.
Of Phlebotomy of Veins Al Gebir.
Veins, however, are useful for phlebotomy because they contribute to febrile conditions in the mouth, and corruption of the gums: and bad sores: and fissures of the lips, and bad sores, even those that are in the nose and around it.
And the quality of these veins for phlebotomy is that you make the sick person sit before you: and press his neck with a cloth.
Then roll back his lip and look at two veins: of which one is on the right lip, and the second on the left: and the demonstration of both is by the blackness of both.
And that is true: for around them are small veins, black.
Therefore cut both with an incision slanting in. If there is any doubt about you, and you do not know which one it is: then direct your incision to the larger one, and make that one more apparent.
And similarly do for the two veins in the upper lip: and indeed the custom directs most often to that: and cut the two veins which are in the lower lip.
Of Phlebotomy of Veins Under the Tongue after Cranial Phlebotomy.
Of the Veins under the Tongue, for phlebotomy: it is that phlebotomy of the Cranial kind is for congestions in the throat, and swelling of the uvula, and ailments of the mouth.
And the quality of phlebotomizing is that the sick person sits between your hands before the sun: and raise his tongue, and look under his tongue on one side for a vein, and on the other side for another vein: and the color of both declines to blackness.
Phlebotomize both: and watch that your fingers do not remain on the veins during phlebotomy.
For beneath them are the arteries, and perhaps blood may flow from those arteries.
¶ Concerning the three veins in the elbow.
The three veins to be phlebotomized in the elbow are those on which the practice of phlebotomy has run most commonly in all men.
And phlebotomy of these veins is performed according to two methods.
Or by pricking with a broad phlebotomizingawl: or by cutting to the desired depth: or by slicing with a surgical knife, and this is Alnesil.
And this is its form.
Thus Alnesil is what is suitable for cutting.
And from these there are broad and subtle types according to the width of the veins and their tension. The form of the phlebotomizingawl should be broad, as you can see.
And it is suitable for opening concave, full, flowing, visible, thick, and those that contain thick, turbid blood.
And this phlebotomy is of lesser width and finer at the points.
And it pertains to phlebotomy of subtle veins, which contain thin yellow blood
¶ On the Phlebotomy of Basilicae.
Basilicae, however, which is one of these three veins, is useful for phlebotomy. Because it extracts blood from illnesses that are below the throat and neck, as the chest and abdomen follow. It is suitable for the phlebotomist to use this vein, but he should be careful, for there is an artery beneath it.
If therefore he errs and adds the incision for phlebotomy too high, he will hit that artery, and there will be a flow of blood.
Therefore, it is necessary to puncture this vein with the phlebotomus needle, not incising it as with Alnesil.
If however Basilica does not appear with a clear appearance, then it is necessary to feel for it and exchange it for another vein, or you may seek one of its branches: or puncture the place where it is in the arm.
It is clear and should be punctured with the Anesil phlebotomus needle, as we have said.
If you wish to perform phlebotomy at this place, then you should first compress the arm to find the location until you recognize the pulsating spot.
Then mark the location with cautery, afterwards the arm, and incise the vein with a concave incision using the Anesil phlebotomus needle, as we have said.
And beware that the percussion does not fall through the space from the site of the artery.
And when you see, when you tighten the ligature, inflation in the place you marked with cauterization, then that inflation is due to the artery: avoid it therefore.
And if you see blood springing at the phlebotomy as urine in a child, and it is thin, red blood: then know that it is from the blood of the artery.
Therefore hurry, and place your finger over the long space, then remove your finger.
If therefore blood is cut (for it is cut many times), then tie the arm, and release it: and let the patient beware of its motion: and let there be a fear of it.
And let it not move for several days until it is healed.
If, however, the blood is not cut and it overcomes you, and there is no medicine present at your moment, then incise the artery if it appears to you.
For its extremities are contracted, and the blood is cut off.
Or take the bark of a fig tree, and cut it: take half and tie it over the place of the vein's constriction with a ligature and wool until another day.
Then if blood is cut, it is good.
And if not: then observe it with the one whose recall preceded from the place of the powder dischargers' flux of blood. And the cutting off of its blood is not difficult in many disposals, because of the location of the small wound and the possibility of tying from the arm.
On Phlebotomy of the Blue Vein.
The blue veins are useful for phlebotomy, which draws blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body: because they are composed of a branch of the basilic vein and a branch of the cephalic vein, as we have said.
And it suits the phlebotomist that this vein be above the fear of harm from the phlebotomy, for beneath it is a nerve.
If therefore one makes an incision for phlebotomy and finds a nerve there, it happens that a stupor occurs in it, and the healing of it becomes difficult, and perhaps it is not cured at all.
And this nerve often appears to the sense.
And if it is concealed in some people and is subtle and not revealed, then you must make your incision where you are phlebotomizing this vein, cutting with Alnise and avoiding the nerve with your skill.
If the vein is between two nerves, then incise the vein lengthwise.
On the Cephalic Vein.
Phlebotomy of the Cephalic vein is useful because it draws blood from the head and contributes to diseases of the eyes.
And it is proper in this vein, if you wish, to make a puncture for phlebotomy with the olive stick or with the myrtle stick: for it is safer than all other veins, for it is neither an artery nor a nerve. Indeed, however, it behooves you at the time of phlebotomy to avoid using the arm only from the elbow and seek a softer place: and it does no harm to him if, on the first percussion, it is not found, that it be repeated over her with phlebotomy several times. Indeed, however, perhaps an abscess forms in some people when not subjected to phlebotomy on the first percussion, but that abscess does no harm to him in some way.
On the usefulness of Phlebotomy and precautions to be observed in it.
The quality of phlebotomy, and its accidents arising from it, which you should consider in its correction.
First of all, you should know what it is about, namely that phlebotomy is not administered except for the preservation of health, and its continuance, and caution against the approach of illness.
And for phlebotomy to be made in one of the three veins which are in the elbow, namely the Cephalica, and Fusca, and Basilica.
And for phlebotomy to be made at the beginning of Spring on an empty stomach, in spring and summer, in autumn and winter after eating when signs of excess are apparent.
And phlebotomy should be made on the first day, or the third day, after three hours have passed from the day.
Phlebotomy which is administered during illnesses does not have a fixed hour: but when convenience and necessity summon it, it can be done at night, or during the day, and at any hour, and at any time.
And it is not necessary to bleed children until they reach fourteen years of age.
Nor is a pregnant woman to be bloodlet until the fourth month through the seventh.
Nor are old people to be bloodlet who have already passed sixty years.
When therefore someone wishes to be bloodlet for any reason: it is necessary that he cleanse his intestines before bloodletting with a gentle clyster, if there is much retained feces: so as not to draw from the veins at the time of bloodletting foul and harmful matters from the intestines into the main limbs.
Nor is a patient who has a colic, that is, severe nausea, nor one who is intoxicated, nor one who has just recovered from intoxication, to be bloodlet until that condition is removed from them.
Nor is a patient with dropsy to be bloodlet.
And bloodletting should be avoided again after colic, vomiting, flux of the bowels, increase in copulation, labor, exercise, watchfulness, fasting, and all that dissolves virtue from the bodily or animal substance.
Then consider the subtlety of the humors before that, if blood is thick with food and drinks and medicines: if it is possible for him to do so.
Then enter the bath if nothing forbids it: or exercise some exercise, so that the blood may become more subtle.
And set his bloodletting on the third day in the chest, as we have said, and try that his breast is evacuated of all animal maladies on that day: such as oppression, anger, and fear: and of all bodily ailments, such as labor, pain, excess of copulation, and similar conditions.
And let there be present on his seat things of whose use custom among men has arisen from the aroma, and fragrance, and pleasure and similar ones according to the quantity possible.
Then let the phlebotomist seat himself on a stool which is higher than the phlebotomy tray: afterwards he should extend his arm, and the phlebotomist should rub it twice or three times with his hand.
Then tie the ligament with pincers, and wrap it twice.
And let the tie be适度的，因为当捆扎不均匀，或是由于过度紧绷时，就会阻碍血液流动；同样，在过于松弛时，也会阻碍血液流动。
Then after the tie, let the phlebotomist rub his arms together until the veins swell and become apparent to the touch.
Then let the phlebotomist cleanse the patient with a little old oil.
Then let the phlebotomist place his left index finger on the vein at the spot where he intends to make the incision, lightly enough so that the vein does not slip and the strike can be made.
Because what you find in the veins is like a string fleeing at phlebotomy, and what is full of wind: when you place the patient there, it contracts under the phlebotomist and deceives the phlebotomist, and he does not open the vein. And if he does open it, it will be too tight. Therefore, it is necessary for the phlebotomist to be firm and attentive to all these matters.
Then let him lower the lancet.
And if not, then make another incision at a different place below that spot or above it with haste: if the place does not become abscessed.
And if it becomes abscessed, or the sick person improves, then let him rest for a day, or two days: and do not bind with a ligature.
For it might draw a hot abscess.
Neither let him enter the bath.
Then he may repeat the venesection if he wishes.
And if the opening is small, or the blood flows slowly: and beware that the quantity you wish to extract does not go beyond the blood: then repeat the venesection at the same opening according to its exact position, and add a little in the procedure.
And do this with haste before the place becomes abscessed, for an abscessed place often occurs in many people after a small operation.
And if you see it has already become abscessed, then do not repeat the procedure over it at all, for nothing excuses you in this. And apply something from the mixture of oil over it: for it will facilitate the flow of blood.
And it is better in this place than pure oil, and than other oils.
And similarly administer the mixture of oil in every venesection where you need to stop the flow of blood: and they do this with Tyriaca Alfarach and Sagzenea when applied from one of them to the place.
For blood is made subtle and resolved when it is thick.
If an apostema occurs at the site of phlebotomy, for it often happens, especially to those who are bled only twice a month, or where there is a small opening in the vein, then hasten and place a sponge soaked in water and salt on the area, heated slightly: and bind it for one hour, for it will be resolved.
And you should do this after the blood has exited the vein itself, with its complement, or from another vein.
And indeed, apostemas and swellings often occur at the site of phlebotomy in Basilica.
Therefore place your hand on it, then if you find it soft upon compressing it, then that swelling is bad.
Therefore, be careful to place something from what we have said on it.
For perhaps blood from the artery is flowing from it.
But make a poultice for it with something containing styptic substances to harden the area.
Then attend to it along with the rest of the treatment until it is cured.
And it is necessary to draw blood from every man according to the strength of his virtue.
And that which is apparent from the color prevailing over the blood.
For if the blood is black, let it be allowed to escape until it becomes red: and similarly, if you see it thick, let it be allowed to escape until it becomes thin: and similarly, if it is sharp, let it be allowed to escape until its sharpness is removed.
And it must be that one who is full, strong, and needs a single bloodletting, should have the phlebotomy of the vein enlarged, and let the incision be broad: and in him who is weak, the opposite should be done.
And it must be that it extracts it alternately and that the opening be narrow: and better for a phlebotomy of a vein is a transverse cut, not a puncture.
And this method of phlebotomy is safe from the flow of blood and from cutting the nerve: and it is more commendable and safer than a phlebotomy by width and length.
And for those to whom it is accustomed to come upon fainting at phlebotomy, it must be that they eat before phlebotomy a small amount of bread infused in pomegranate water: or secanabin, if it is warmed: and extract from the blood in three alternations, or four.
And if it is of a cold complexion, then let him take before phlebotomy bread infused in mulberry syrup, or in aromatic honey syrup, or in fragrant syrup.
And if fainting occurs at phlebotomy, and the cause of its fainting is the escape of much blood, then it must be that he takes in drink water of meat and fragrant thin syrup: and use aromatic with alum and apply it to his breast with it: and use the rest which we have said in the division in the chapter on fainting from evacuation.
Whoever wishes to evacuate his arm and release his blood in the second method: it ought to be for him who has phlebotomy because of great evacuation, and his strength is weak, that he release the blood gradually according to the quantity of his strength over continuous days.
Whoever wishes to evacuate his arm and release his blood in the second method, and his body is strong: then let him do this seven or nine hours after his first phlebotomy.
Whoever wishes to draw blood from his body to the opposite side of the part that is diseased: it ought to be evacuated for him on the second or third day.
In whose body the blood is already much heated and quickened, and causes a fever: it ought that the blood go out from him in one course, and a large quantity be drawn from him: and the opening be enlarged until syncope occurs: after which you are to preserve all the conditions of phlebotomy: and thou shalt lay thy hand upon his pulse at the course of the blood, that there does not occur death instead of syncope.
For this often happens when the phlebotomist is ignorant and falls into negligence.
And it ought not to be done when you wish to release the arm and release the blood in the second method, if the vein's opening is already closed, and the exit of the blood becomes difficult, so that it must be pressed upon with frenzy and the incision extended quickly.
For this is very evil, indeed leave it until the second phlebotomy.
Or remove with the sharpness of the phlebotome that which has coagulated from the blood in the opening of the vein, and place something of dissolved salt on top of it.
And place something from Tyroca alfaroch or sagzenea above it, and apply it with gentle compression until the blood comes out.
If the vein is already an apostema, then release it and do not tie it until the apostema settles.
If necessity prompts you to bleed the patient a second time, and there is no excuse, then either perform phlebotomy above that place, or on another arm in another vein.
But the vein of the arm is phlebotomized at the place of Fuscæ and Basilicæ, when they are not found and are hidden, because it is composed of them.
And the quality of the phlebotomy is such that the patient should place his hand in warm water until it becomes reddened, and the vein should become apparent clearly.
Then tie it above with a ligature, but not too tightly in the middle.
Then perform the phlebotomy obliquely, not laterally nor along the length: and let the opening be large, and let your phlebotomy pass slightly above the wrist joint.
And the blood flows most readily into warm water during the winter.
And the phlebotomy of this vein is safer for all veins, because there is no pulse vein nor nerve beneath it.
Phlebotomy of the Saluatella of the right hand is beneficial for liver diseases.
And the quality of this phlebotomy is, that you tighten the mahason of the hand with a ligament, or with your hand, after you introduce it into hot water until the vein becomes pliable and clearly demonstrated by sensation.
Then make the phlebotomy by crossing it.
And if you puncture it completely, it will not harm him in any way.
And conserve, lest you withdraw your hand with the phlebotome.
For beneath it are the nerves of the fingers stripped of flesh.
Then repeat the procedure with your hand in hot water, and allow the blood to flow in it.
For if you do not repeat the procedure in hot water, the blood will coagulate at the opening of the vein and be prevented from flowing.
When therefore you have drawn off the quantity necessary from the blood, then place oil and salt over the vein: so that it does not harden quickly.
And similarly, you should do this with every tightly drawn vein.
The ligature for the phlebotomy of this vein is from the left hand: because it is beneficial for spleen diseases. And similarly, do this in the phlebotomy of its counterpart, as you did in the second one equally.
Saphenae autem phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad aegritudines quae sunt in inferiori parte corporis, sicut aegritudines matricum, et retentionem menstruorum, et infirmitates renum, et ulcera coxarum et crurium antiqua, et similia ex aegritudinibus.
And the quality of phlebotomy for this is that the patient should insert his foot into warm water and make friction over it until the veins become prominent: then ligate above the ankle with iron.
And the location of the veins is at the heel, visible opposite the big toe: and from there they branch into many branches on the face of the foot.
Therefore phlebotomy should be made on a larger branch of it, or at the heel where it aggregates: for this is better and safer.
If you make the phlebotomy on the face of the foot, then be careful of the nerves that are beneath it on the face of the foot.
And place your phlebotomy where you make the incision as if you wish to cut through it: and call the phlebotomy Nesil.
If the outlet of blood is forbidden, then re-insert his foot into warm water: and permit the blood to flow into it until it is evacuated.
If the vein is missed in the first attempt, then repeat with the phlebotomy at a higher location for a short while, for the place is safe, and you should not fear any harm from it, provided you are careful of the nerves, as we have said.
And similarly when Saphena of the other foot is equal.
The place of the Sciatic veins, as we have said, is beside the heel from the wild mulberry side.
And the aid for its phlebotomy is when there is pain in the hip due to hot blood.
And the quality of its phlebotomy is that the sick person should enter the bath and hasten: and bind the leg from the side of the hip up to above the heel with a thin long bandage: for it would not be apparent otherwise.
When therefore it is apparent, then phlebotomize it according to whatever skill is possible for you, or by transversion: it is better, either to incise it, or to cut it by section.
For its place is safer, and it is hidden in many people to a great extent.
And if you do not find it and it does not become apparent by any sense: then phlebotomize some branch of it, and that one is the one that appears on the back of the foot and toward the ear: and beware of the nerves, and let the quantity of blood flow that you wish.
Then release the bandage, and place skin over the phlebotomy site, and bind the area.
For it is quickly cured.
¶ Concerning Ventosation and the quality of its use.
Chapter XC VIII.
Wounds are made from horns, and from air, and from glass.
And ventilation is indeed done according to two methods.
With scarification and bloodletting: and the other is ventilation without scarification. And this ventilation which is done without scarification is according to two methods.
Or it is done with fire.
Or it is done without fire.
And the ventilations administered with scarification and bloodletting are fourteen places of the body.
Of which one is Ventosatio Alnocrati, and it is the last part of the head; and Alkehel, and it is in the middle of the neck; and Ventosae Alhagdahim, and they are two laminae of the neck from both sides simultaneously; and Ventosae menti, and it is under the mandible in the lower lip; and Ventosae duarum spatularum; and Ventosae Alachosos above the end of the tail; and Ventosae duorum focilium, and they are in the middle of the two arms; and Ventosae duorum crurium; and Ventosae duarum cauillarum.
And ventilation indeed does not extract blood from you through small veins scattered in the flesh, and for this reason, its virtue does not decline as it does with bloodletting.
And ventilation should not be administered with or without fire when the illness is caused by congestion until the entire body is evacuated.
If necessity provokes to Ventosation from illness, or on account of custom, we administer it at every hour at the beginning of the month, at the end thereof, and in the middle thereof, and at whatever time it may be.
Which is because there are persons for whom, when blood is multiplied in their bodies until it needs to be extracted through ventosation, they find heaviness in their head, and so forth.
And among them are those who find fullness and redness in their face, head, and neck.
And among them are those who find itching in their face, forehead, and darkness, and dullness in their eyes.
And among them are those who palpitate the place of their ventosation. And among them is one whose laughter is increased.
And among them is one who finds a taste of blood in his mouth: or his tongue swells, and he spits blood.
And among them is one whose sleep is increased.
And among them is one who sees in his sleep blood, redness, and slain persons, and wounds, and things similar to these. When therefore we see something from these, and properly it is in the middle of the third week: then we order ventosation to be performed after two or three days have passed. The application of ventosation to the neck is: because it contributes to heaviness in the head, and what flows down to the eyes.
