If the patient does not respond to the incision and procedure that we described in its place and is afraid of it, he may sometimes be healed by cauterization. So, if a fistula develops in someone, and pus and corrupt humors have been flowing from it for a long time, the first thing you should do is measure it with a thin probe.	When the patient will not submit to the cutting operation we have described in its own place, and is afraid of it, he may perhaps be cured with the cautery. So when somebody gets a fistula, and pus and foul humidities have for a long while been running from it, you must first explore it with a fine probe and judge of its depth by the probe.	0.8940248
Then know the extent of its depth with the probe. Then heat the cautery that resembles the probe. Then insert it hot into the fistula itself, following the direction and depth of the fistula reached by the probe. Repeat the cauterization until all those corrupt tissues are burned, once, twice, or three times, as needed.	Then heat a spike-shaped cautery and introduce it, hot, into the fistula, in the direction of the bottom of the fistula and to the depth to which the probe entered. And repeat the cauterization till all those corrupt bodies are burnt away; once or twice or three times over, as you have need.	0.87757313
And beware of burning a nerve if there is one there, or a large vein, or if the fistula leads to the body of the bladder or to the body of the intestine.	But beware of burning a nerve should one be there, or a big blood-vessel. If the fistula penetrates to the urinary bladder or the intestine, beware of all these parts.	0.81946063
So be cautious about all these places. You should only do this if the fistula is in a fleshy area and you judge that it is not deep. Then treat the area until it heals. If the area closes and the discharge stops and it remains so for a while, know that it has healed completely.	Do this only when the fistula is in a fleshy part and you judge that it does not open into any other part. Afterwards dress the place till healed. If the place cicatrizes and the flux of humours ceases and it remains so for a long while, you may know that it is perfectly healed.	0.8202306
But if the discharge does not stop, know that it is deep, or that there is corrupt bone at its bottom, or something similar, which will be mentioned in its place.	But if the flux of humours from it is not stopped, understand that it has perforated or that at the bottom there is a piece of diseased bone or the like; which will be mentioned in its proper place.	0.846098
