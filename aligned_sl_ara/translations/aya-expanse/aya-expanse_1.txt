The author of this book, having completed for you, O sons, this book which is a complete part of the science of medicine in its entirety and having reached the pinnacle of its clarity and expression, has deemed it fit to complete it for you with this article, which is a part of the practical application.
Because the practical application, being an improvement in our country and in our time, is completely absent, to such an extent that its science is studied and its impact forgotten. Only a few traces of it remain in the works of the earliest authors, who, through their hands, altered it, and its actual content became filled with errors and confusion, making its meanings obscure and its benefits remote.
I have therefore decided to revive it and compose this article, explaining, clarifying, and concisely summarizing its content. I will include illustrations of surgical instruments and other tools used in practice, as this adds clarity and addresses the needs of the subject matter.
The reason there are no skilled artisans in our time is that the practice of medicine requires extensive training, and one must first master the science of anatomy as described by Galen. So as to understand the benefits of organs, their structures, and compositions, as well as their connections, disconnections, bones, nerves, muscles, their numbers, origins, arteries, and veins, both moving and stationary.
Therefore, Albucasis said that many are called physicians, but few truly are, especially in the art of manual surgery, and we have mentioned something about this in the introduction to this book.
For whoever is not knowledgeable about the anatomy that we have mentioned is likely to make errors that cause people's deaths, as I have often seen many who falsely imagined themselves experts in this science.
I have seen a physician, ignorant of anatomy, attempt to cut a tumor in a woman's neck, accidentally damaging the neck's arteries and causing the patient to bleed to death in his hands.
I have also seen another physician, in attempting to remove a kidney stone from a man who had been stabbed, carelessly use an instrument that tore off a piece of the bladder wall along with the stone. The man died approximately three days later, and I had been called to remove the stone; upon examining it, along with the patient's condition, I estimated that this was the cause.
I have also seen another physician, who practiced medicine for a living, catering to some of our country's leaders.
I witnessed a physician, through his ignorance, hastily treating a young black boy who had a fracture near the ankle, along with a wound. The doctor, without understanding anatomy, tightly bound the fracture using iron bands and splints, completely obstructing the wound's air supply.
Then he released himself from his desires, and left him for several days, commanding him not to untie the bandage until his leg and foot had swollen, and he was on the verge of death.
Then I was summoned, and I quickly untied the bandage, bringing him relief and freeing him from his pains. However, the damage had already taken hold in the member, and I could not stop it.
The damage continued to spread in the member until he died.
I witnessed another physician treating a patient with a malignant tumor; it ulcerated after several days, and the condition of the sufferer grew worse. This is because if cancer is purely from black bile, then iron treatment should never be applied to it.
Unless it is in a member where the entire mass can be surgically removed.
Therefore, my son, you must know that manual work divides into two parts: the work accompanied by safety, and the work that leads to harm in most cases.
I have warned in every part of this book about the work that involves risk and fear; you must be cautious and reject it.
So that the ignorant do not find a way to speak or accuse, take firm and careful action for yourselves and gentle and stable care for your patients.
And employ the best path leading to safety and a favorable outcome, avoiding dangerous and difficult diseases.
Purify yourselves from what you fear may cast doubt upon your religion and world, for it is the stay of your honor and the elevation in the world and the hereafter of your destiny.
As Galen said in one of his precepts: 'Do not treat a bad disease and call yourself a bad doctor.'
This article is divided into three doors.
First Door.
In this door, we discuss the use of fire and sharp drugs, arranged from the ancient to modern times, with illustrations of instruments, cauterizing irons, and all that is needed for manual work.
Second Door.
In this door, we discuss incisions, blisters, cupping, bloodletting, surgeries, removing arrows, and other similar procedures, all arranged and illustrated with machines.
**Third Chapter**
In the chapter on reduction, dislocation, treatment of fractures, and similar topics, there is a systematic arrangement from ancient times to the present, along with illustrations of instruments.
**First Chapter**
**On Incision**
Before discussing the technique, it is necessary to mention the benefits and drawbacks of this procedure, as well as the temperament in which it should be used.
I say that discussing the benefits and drawbacks of incision is a lengthy and precise topic, containing a hidden secret, and several wise men have spoken on this matter.
They have differing opinions, and I have condensed their brief statements to avoid prolonging this discussion.
I say that incision is beneficial in general for all bad humors, whether with or without a material cause, except for two humors: the hot humor without a material cause and the dry humor without a material cause.
As for the humor with a material cause, there is disagreement. Some say that incision is beneficial in such cases, while others argue to the contrary, stating that incision is unsuitable for illnesses characterized by heat and dryness due to their inherently hot and dry nature.
It is impossible to cure a hot and dry disease with a hot and dry remedy, and he who says otherwise claims that burning with fire may be beneficial for a hot and dry disease occurring in the bodies of people. For when you add the human body and its moisture to the temperament of fire, it makes the human body cold.
And I say according to his saying, for experience has revealed this to me many times; however, one should not imagine this matter except for those who have become proficient and well-trained in the art of burning. And he [the surgeon] must be aware of the differences in the temperaments of people, as well as the nature of diseases within themselves, their causes, symptoms, and the duration of their course.
As for the other temperaments, you have no reason to fear them, especially cold and wet diseases. All doctors agree on this, and they do not differ in the benefit of burning in their treatment.
Know, O my sons, that the secret of treating with fire and its superiority to burning with a hot drug lies in the fact that fire is a single essence whose effect does not extend beyond the member that is burned, and it only slightly harms another connected member.
The use of caustic drugs may extend their effect beyond the intended organ, potentially causing a difficult-to-treat illness or even death. The fire, out of respect for its noble and generous essence, only does so when excessively applied.
This has become clear to us through experience, given the long service and care in the practice and observation of its facts.
For this reason, I have spared lengthy speech, and if it were not inappropriate for this book, I would have shared with you a secret, mysterious fire and its effect on bodies, as well as its ability to ward off illnesses, in philosophical, rational discourse that would astound your understanding.
Know, my sons, that there is disagreement regarding the optimal time for cauterization, and they consider spring to be the best season.
I say that cauterization can be applicable in every season, for the damage caused by time can outweigh the benefit gained from cauterization. Especially if cauterization is for essential, powerful, urgent pain that cannot be delayed, out of fear that the delay will lead to greater harm than the pain itself, which follows from the damage caused by time.
Do not be led astray, my sons, by the misconceptions of the general public and ignorant physicians, who believe that burning (cauterization) which heals a certain illness will never recur and make it a permanent solution.
And the matter is not as they thought, for cauterization is not like a remedy that alters the humor and dries up the moistures that cause pain.
Cauterization, however, is superior to remedies in terms of its swift success, powerful effect, and severe authority.
The illness may recur at some point in time, depending on the patient's humor, the strength and severity of their condition, and what is present in their body from the accumulation of impurities and neglect of self-care through diet and other causes.
Except in cases where the illness is mild and present in a body part with few impurities or moistures. Such as cauterizing a tooth for pain, it may not recur and this can be considered minimal.
And the statement of the general public that cauterization is 'the end of medicine' is incorrect, as they believe that no treatment, whether medicinal or otherwise, can be effective after cauterization, while in fact, it is not so.
And indeed, the cauterization is the last resort in medicine; for when we employ various remedies for a disease and they prove ineffective, then we use cauterization, which if successful, becomes the last remedy. Not as the common understanding or the ignorance of many uneducated doctors implies.
The ancients mentioned that gold cauterization is better than iron cauterization, as they stated, due to the moderation and noble nature of gold, and said that it does not cause pus formation in the site of cauterization, which is not entirely accurate.
Because I have tried it and found that it only works in some bodies, and cauterization with gold is better and more preferable than with iron, as they said, except that if you heat the iron in the fire, you will not be able to determine when it reaches the desired temperature due to the red color of gold.
Because it is quickly cooled down, and if you add more heat during fever, it melts in the fire and mixes, causing the practitioner to be occupied with that. Therefore, cauterization with iron has become for us faster and closer to the correct practice, God willing.
I have organized this chapter on cauterization into sections, from the head to the foot, in order to make it easy for the student to access what they need, God willing.
Chapter One.
In the treatment of the head, there is one basic operation.
This operation is effective against the moisture and cold that overwhelm the brain, causing headaches, excessive discharge from the head to the eyes and ears, excess sleep, toothaches, and sore throats. In general, it is useful for any illness that arises from coldness, such as paralysis, seizures, apoplexy, and other similar conditions.
The procedure involves first ordering the patient to induce vomiting with a purgative that clears the head, for three or four nights, depending on the patient's strength, age, and general health.
Then, he is instructed to shave his head with a razor and sit between your hands, with his hands on his chest.
Then, you place the palm of your hand on his nose, between his eyes, and where your middle finger ends, mark that spot with ink.
Then, hold the oil-soaked poultice as follows: ... (image or description of the poultice)
If the bone exposes itself to the extent of a tooth's root or a grain of coriander, raise your hand. Otherwise, if it cools, use the same iron or another one. Until you see what was mentioned to you about the bone, take some salt and dissolve it in water, then dip a cotton in it and place it on the area, leaving it for three days.
Then, take a cotton dipped in lard and leave it on the area until the blister from the fire disappears, then treat it with the quadruple ointment until it heals, God willing.
They say that the wound, the longer it remains open, the more pus it produces, which is better and more beneficial.
Some mention that the skin should be burned to the bone with a hot iron, until some of the bone's thickness is burnt, then the burnt part of the bone should be removed and treated.
Others say that the burning should be excessive, affecting the bone strongly enough for it to fall out like amber or a small seed, and they claim that this releases fumes from the head, keeping the wound open for a long time.
Then, it should be treated until it heals, and I do not at all recommend these types of burns, except in some cases and on risky grounds. Leaving it alone is better, if it does not heal, as the head weakens when its natural connection is broken, as we have observed in other parts of the body.
Especially when the patient's head is naturally weak, the first type of cauterization is safer and better in my opinion, and it is this that I have used and recommend.
The Second Chapter.
On the Head as Well.
If a chronic pain occurs in the head and persists for a long time, and treatments such as cauterization, cupping, poultices, snuff, ointments, and bandages have been tried without effect (especially if the patient has already undergone the described single cauterization without success), then consider the following. If the patient's head is strong in structure naturally and is not weak, and they experience severe cold, then cauterize a second time, slightly above the first one. Then cauterize each of the patient's temples until the skin thickness decreases and reveals the desired amount of bone. Cauterize the patient's head at the back, in the area known as the occipital bone, and be gentle with your hand to avoid exposing the bone. The patient will experience severe pain from this cauterization, unlike any other pain caused by the head's cauterizations. I will mention this particular cauterization in its proper place.
The iron used to treat the horns of the head and its back should be softer than the iron used for the middle of the head, and this is its form.
Chapter III
In the treatment of a non-chronic concussion.
If a fracture of the head causes pain with a headache that radiates to the eye, and the patient vomits, then the patient should be treated with purifying drugs for the head and all other treatments mentioned in the classification of diseases. If this does not work, there are two faces (or methods) of application. Either with a sharp, burning medicine or with iron.
As for the burning medicine, take a single clove of garlic, peel it and cut off both ends, then with a broad scalpel make a cut in the place of the headache on the temple, creating a space beneath the skin that fits the garlic clove.
It should be inserted beneath the skin until it disappears, then secured tightly with bandages and left for about fifteen hours. Afterwards, loosen and remove the garlic and leave the wound to heal for two or three days before dressing it.
On it, apply a cotton ball soaked in butter until the area discharges, then treat it with ointment until it heals, God willing. If you prefer, you can do this with some burning drugs as mentioned in the eighteenth article on burning drugs.
As for burning with iron, it is done in this manner: heat the iron with this shape.
It is called the nail iron because its head resembles a nail with some concavity and a small protrusion in the center.
Then place it on the affected area and hold your hand while you rotate the iron slightly, so that the amount burned is one-and-a-half times the thickness of the skin. Lift your hand to avoid burning the artery below, which could cause bleeding, then soak a cotton ball in salt water and place it on the area, leaving it for three days. Then apply the cotton ball soaked in butter, followed by treatment with ointment until it heals, God willing.
If you prefer, cauterize this wound with the sharp edge of the iron and be careful not to cut the artery in this acute wound, especially.
Chapter IV.
In chronic sisterhood.
If the treatment for phlegmon (chronic inflammation) as described above and as outlined in the classifications of diseases is ineffective, and one observes a condition that cannot be cured by the initial application of heat or by fire, then... Then, the surgical scalpel should be heated until it turns white, after which a line of about half a finger length is marked on it and drawn along the affected area. Leave it once and tighten your grip to sever the artery and reach towards the bone.
However, you must be cautious to avoid damaging the jaw joint's movement during chewing, which could burn the muscle or nerve controlling it, causing spasms.
And be careful and watchful for the blood loss from the artery you severed, as its vessels (the "garres" mentioned) are vulnerable. Especially for those who are unfamiliar with the procedure, it is best to abstain from acting if it's not a proven path, leaving the task to experts.
Further details regarding the treatment of spontaneous bleeding from an artery will be mentioned in its appropriate section in this book, God willing. If you observe a condition that cannot be cured by this application of heat, then...
And I saw the sick body susceptible to a cauterization in the middle of the head as we described, and treated the wound until it heals, God willing.
And if you prefer, you can use the cauterization that we mentioned in the chapter on arterial bleeding with a two-bladed iron, for it is a better and more effective cauterization.
Chapter V.
On the treatment of ear pain.
If ear pain occurs due to cold and is treated with laxatives and other remedies mentioned in the classifications, but does not alleviate, then apply the iron, known as the point, in the following manner.
Then, after heating it, apply the iron around the entire ear, or both ears if the pain is in both of them, by moving it circularly. Move the cauterization instrument slightly away from the ear's base after marking the point with ink, and make the cauterization in each ear about ten points, or as needed, then treat the wounds until they heal, God willing.
Chapter VI.
In the name of strength.
The strength that is treated with cautery is of the type that occurs from phlegm, as I mentioned in the classifications of diseases.
And one should avoid cautery of the type that occurs from dryness and nerve spasms.
When cautery with arrows, poultices, and gargles does not cure this type of strength, the patient should be cauterized three times. One at the origin of the ear, the second slightly lower on his cheekbone, and the third at the junction of his lips.
And make your cautery from the opposite side of the afflicted area, for relaxation occurs only on the side that appears healthy.
The image of cautery is to make a single cauterization opposite the upper corner of the ear, slightly below the forehead, and another in the temple, with a length equal to that of the thumb.
Lower your cautery hand to burn at a depth of half the thickness of the skin. This is the image of the cautery, which is a type of scalpel as described earlier, but slightly milder. The knife should have a slight excess of thickness, then treat the wound as mentioned earlier until it heals, God willing.
Chapter VII
In chronic sores.
If the sore becomes chronic and treated as mentioned, but the treatment is ineffective and there is no fever, apply four cauterizations. Apply a cauterization to each horn of the head, as mentioned, and another in the middle of the head, as well as a cauterization at the back of the head, following the same method.
Apply the cauterization as mentioned, and you may also apply a cauterization on the stomach's opening, which is more effective, then treat as previously described.
Chapter VIII
On amnesia.
The patient suffering from amnesia should be given drinks to clear the lungs and cerebrospinal fluid, as well as herbs that purify the brain.
Then he shaves his whole head, and a poultice of mustard, as described in the article on poultices, is applied to his back. It is carried several times, for it is a form of cauterization.
And do this in the same order mentioned there, for if he recovers from it, otherwise, he will receive three cauterizations across the back of his head, aligned from the top of his head to the base of his neck.
And between each cauterization, make it the thickness of a finger. Then treat the cauterization with the remedies mentioned previously. If you wish to add more and the patient can withstand it, cauterize the middle one.
If you wish to add more, cauterize both ears, and treat it until he recovers, and the iron should be olive-shaped, as described previously.
Chapter IX.
For treating stroke and relaxing the entire body.
One should begin by cleansing the head with lye and what we have mentioned, then shave the patient's head, and cauterize it with one burn in the middle of the head, and one on each ear, and one on the back of the head.
Three on the neck vertebrae, if in need for treating a condition that requires more, and the patient is able to withstand it and the disease is strong and persistent, then apply four burns on the vertebrae of his back. And continue with the burn until most of the skin is burnt away, then raise your hand and treat it as mentioned earlier, so that it heals, God willing. The iron should be olive-shaped.
Chapter Ten.
On convulsions.
The convulsion should be burned only in the case of a seizure caused by phlegm. First, the brain should be purified with powerful purgatives and other treatments mentioned in the classifications, if the patient is elderly and able to tolerate medications.
However, if it is a child who cannot tolerate medications, then use gargles and a purifying mouthwash for the brain several days in advance, along with improving his diet.
Then he should shave his head, and apply one burn in the middle of the head as mentioned earlier, and another burn at the back. And on each side of his head, make a burn. If the patient is strong and can endure it, apply the burns mentioned for the one suffering from paralysis, relaxing the body along the cervical and dorsal vertebrae. The iron should be olive-shaped, as described previously.
If the patient is a child, make the iron gentle in this manner.
Chapter Eleven.
On the treatment of melancholia.
If the cause of melancholia is putrefied humors and thick phlegm, apply the burns as mentioned for the one suffering from paralysis.
If the cause of melancholia is a tendency towards blackness and the patient's body is filled with putrefied humors, cleanse his brain as described in the previous division.
Then shave the patient's head. Make a compact cake from linen fiber in the shape of a circle, and place it in the middle of his head while he sits cross-legged. Take one pound of ancient sheep fat.
Then warm it over a moderate fire until the finger can tolerate it when inserted. Pour it into the circular mold at the center of his head and leave it until it cools. Perform this procedure on the patient once a week, along with all other beneficial measures, until he recovers, God willing.
If you wish to cauterize, apply small, frequent drops without holding the iron with your hand, but rather using a gentle touch. This type of cautery moistens the brain moderately.
Then apply a cotton swab soaked in lard or chicken fat.
Chapter Twelve.
In the cauterization of water that falls into the eye.
If you notice the onset of water falling into the eye, as described in the previous sections, promptly treat the patient to clear the eye and protect it from all moisture, and sweat them in a hot bath on an empty stomach for several days.
Then shave their head and cauterize it once in the middle of the head, and apply two cauterizations on each side (if water is falling into both eyes), or one cauterization on the single affected eye.
Then cut all the veins and arteries beneath the skin using the iron, making the cauterizations long and wide across both sides of the temples, taking care not to cause blood loss.
If you notice any of it, cut it off at the base with any treatment available to you, and we will discuss wisdom in clamping and cutting arteries while taking care not to cause bleeding.
A severe burn may occur on the nape, between two vertebrae.
Chapter XIII.
In the treatment of chronic tear discharge.
If the tear discharge from the eye is chronic and persistent, originating from the veins and arteries on the surface of the head, and you have determined that this is due to a thick, cold humor in the lymphatic vessels, then apply the cauterization described earlier to the affected area. Cauterize the middle of the head, two on each side of the face (on the temple), and two under the vertebrae at the nape. If necessary, add a further cauterization on either side of the eye, just above the eyebrow, using a small iron.
Chapter XIV.
On cauterizing the nose's mucous membrane.
If the treatment mentioned in the previous sections does not improve the condition, then proceed as follows: after three nights of treatment, shave the patient's head and cauterize the central area with a hot iron (zaitoni). Then apply the iron (koyat) twice over the eyebrows, slightly below the hairline, and take care not to cut the artery, as shown in this illustration of the iron.
**Chapter XV**
In the treatment of eyelid drooping.
If the eyelid droops due to disease or moisture, apply one ironing with this semicircular iron.
And if you wish, apply them above the eyebrows slightly, with two irons on each side, spaced apart from the temples, and make each ironing as long as the eyebrow.
Do not overdo the ironing, but apply it to the extent that one-third of the skin is burned, as shown in this illustration of the iron.
**Chapter XVI**
In the ironing of the eyelid.
If the eyelids turn inward, the treatment involves two types of ironing. Either by burning with fire or by burning medicine, if the treatment is by burning with fire, then order the patient to remove his beard, if he is one who pulls it, until it grows long and even.
If you trim it while it is still young, bind the patient's eyes with a bandage so that they do not move until it grows and becomes even. Once it has grown and straightened, place the patient's head in your lap, then draw on the eyelid with ink a mark shaped like an Asian paper fan.
The mark should begin near the eyelashes, then place a cotton ball soaked in white of egg or saliva under the eyelid, and heat it with an iron whose shape is as shown.
Then, in several applications, heat the mark you have drawn with the iron little by little until the surface of the skin burns and takes the shape of a paper fan, so that its entire appearance is like that of a paper fan. The sign of the success of your work is to see the eyelids tightened and the hair raised from the eye's flesh.
Then raise your hand and leave it for three days, after which apply a cotton ball with butter to remove the stubble and treat it with ointment until it heals, God willing. If any hair returns after some time and the eyelid relaxes.
Then, apply the cauterizing agent to that same area as you did initially. If it is a hair in the lower eyelid, remove it until it returns to its natural position without damaging the eye, and for cauterization with a burning medicine, order the patient to leave the lashes intact until they grow long and even.
Then, make a paper from the bark of the *Aspa* tree and take from common soap and unquenched lime, each weighing a drachm or its equivalent, grind them all very well with a mortar, doing this quickly to avoid drying out. Then, spread it on the paper made from the bark of the *Aspa* tree, in the shape of an eyelid, and place a cotton ball soaked in egg white under the eye, while the patient lies on your lap.
Place your index finger on the application, gently compressing it, and move it as the patient feels the burn of the medicine, as they will experience a sensation like fire. As long as they feel the burn, leave the medicine and continue to move your finger. Once the burning subsides, remove the medicine and wash the eye with water.
Look, if you see the eyelid has lifted up as it does when exposed to fire or cut, then proceed. Otherwise, reapply the medicine to the area that was not affected and did not turn black until your work is complete and the eye is restored. Then, apply a cotton ball greased with butter over the burned area until the sensation of burning disappears.
Then treat it with an ointment of nettle or otherwise until it heals. In your work, be extremely careful not to let any of the medicine fall into the eye, for if the eyelid relaxes after several days and there is a fear of hair in the eye.
Then prepare the medicine for that relaxed part of the eyelid, especially as you did at first, and treat it until it heals. This is an image of the ase (a plant) leaf.
Know that people's eyes may vary in size and shape, so adjust your treatment accordingly, for the path to correctness is not hidden from those who have experience in this craft.
Chapter XVII.
On the treatment of the naphthal (a type of infection) that appears in the eye socket.
If you treat the naphthal with what we mentioned in the classifications of diseases and it does not respond to your treatment, then it should be cauterized in this manner.
Command the patient to place his head on your lap and have a servant hold his head with both hands, not moving or striking it.
Then place a wet cotton ball in egg whites or in the saliva of an ox, and heat the iron with this shape.
It is hollow in the shape of a bird's feather tube, with one end for cauterization and if you prefer, the other end can be perforated or solid like a plug, except that this hollow space is better for your work, God willing.
Then, if the abscess is open, squeeze it and remove the pus and dry it; or if it is closed, open it, extract the pus, then place the hot iron on it and hold it with your hand until it reaches the bone.
And move your hand slightly away from the eye towards the nose when cauterizing, so that your hand does not err or the patient becomes anxious, causing the iron to fall into the eye and damage it; if it reaches the bone with the first cauterization, otherwise, reheat the iron a second time if necessary.
Leave it for three days, then apply a cotton ball with butter and treat it with a drying ointment until it heals; if it does not heal in forty days, apply a sharp, corrosive medicine to expose the bone and remove it as mentioned later in its section, God willing.
Another method for cauterizing abscesses, mentioned by some early scholars, involves incising the abscess and inserting a thin tube (this is its shape) into the same incision.
Pour this into a container with a capacity equal to that of a dirham, and melt the lead within it. Hold the crucible firmly with your hand, ensuring it does not move, lest the melted lead spill into the patient's eye. It is necessary to place a wet cotton ball over the patient's eye, either in egg white or water.
Lead, when applied to the site of a fistula, burns and heals it in a miraculous manner. If the fistula is healed through the mentioned burning and treatment, then there is no alternative but to use nasal surgery to restore the fistula to its natural course within the nose, as will be explained in detail in its designated section.
Chapter XVIII
On burning the fissure of the lip.
Often, a fissure occurs in the lip, known as the "hairline," especially on the lips of young boys. If this fissure is treated using the methods mentioned in the previous sections but does not heal, take a small, thin iron (as shown) and apply it to the affected area.
It should be shaped like the blade of a knife, then placed over the fissure while still hot, ensuring that the heat penetrates deeply into the fissure. Subsequently, it is treated with a poultice until healing occurs, God willing.
Chapter XIX.
On the treatment of the naphthic ulcer occurring in the mouth.
If a tumor appears in the gums, or on the soft palate, or at the base of the teeth, and it becomes ulcerated, and bursts, and pus flows, forming a fistula, and treatment does not take effect, then you should heat a poultice to fit over the fistula.
Then insert a protective cover into the fistula hole, hold on to it, and with the heated iron protected, reach its depth and end, and do this once or twice. Then treat it with the mentioned remedies until it heals, God willing.
If the material stops and it heals, otherwise, you must examine the place, and remove the rotten bone as mentioned in its section, God willing.
Chapter XX.
On the treatment of loose teeth and gums.
If the gums become loose due to moisture, and the teeth move, and treatment with medication does not help, then place the patient's head in your lap. Then heat a poultice that will be described later, after placing a tube on the tooth.
In this procedure, the iron is applied with a wheel and your hand presses lightly until the patient feels the heat of the fire reaching the root of the tooth. Then you raise your hand and repeat the application as desired. The patient should then fill their mouth with salt water.
And it is held for a time and then thrown, and the mobile tooth will be stabilized, the relaxed gums will tighten, and the corrupt moisture will dry up.
**Chapter 21.**
**On Treating Toothache.**
If the toothache is due to cold or has a worm and does not respond to drug treatment, there are two methods of application: either with butter or with fire.
As for the application with butter, one takes pure sheep butter, boils it in a cast-iron ladle or shell, then takes a cotton swab, wraps it around the end of a rod, immerses it in the hot butter, and applies it to the aching tooth with a wheel, holding it until it cools down.
Then repeat the application several times until the heat of the fire reaches the root of the tooth. If desired, one may dip a woolen swab or cotton in cold butter and apply it to the aching tooth, then place a heated iron on top to ensure the fire reaches the base of the tooth.
And as for burning it with fire, one should take a copper or iron pipe that has some thickness to prevent the heat of the fire from reaching the patient's mouth, then heat the iron until its shape is formed and place it on the tooth, holding the hand until the iron cools. He should do this several times.
The pain will go either that same day or the next, and after applying the burn, the patient should fill their mouth with good butter and hold it for a while before spitting it out, which is the shape of the iron.
One can burn with any side desired, according to what is possible, and this is the shape of the pipe.
Chapter Twenty-Two.
On burning the pigs.
If the pigs are affected by phlegm and cold humors, and do not yield to treatment for maturation, and you wish to hasten their maturation, then heat the hollow iron with both ends as shown.
Let the smoke come out from the other end when burning, place it protectively on the same tumor once and again if needed, until it reaches the depth of the tumor. If the tumor is small, make the iron according to its size.
Then leave it for three days, and apply a cotton swab soaked in lard until the burnt area heals, then treat it with ointment and bandages until it is healed, God willing.
Chapter Twenty-Three
On the treatment of hoarseness and shortness of breath.
If humors overwhelm the bronchial tubes, especially if accompanied by a cold temperament, the patient should first be purged with purgative drugs, then applied with heat to the throat at the lower point of the neck, near the base of the tongue.
Beware not to apply heat to the throat, but only to half of the skin, then apply another heat treatment at the joint of the neck, at its last vertebra, with a nail-like iron, in the manner previously described.
Then treat it as mentioned until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Twenty-Four
On the treatment of lung disease and coughing.
If cough and lung disease due to cold moistures, and there is no fever or phlegm, and the illness is chronic, then apply two cauterizations on the upper ribs in the lower, soft, empty places, and another cauterization in the middle of the chest between the breasts.
The cauterization should be done in a nail-like shape as described previously, and if desired, it can be a drop cauterization using the cautery pen called 'al-nqatah', whose image was presented earlier for treating earache. The drops should be approximately thirty to that number.
Then treat it with the methods mentioned until recovery is achieved. You can also make a cautery instrument with three prongs, as illustrated, to speed up the process, as you can apply three cauterizations in one go. This is the image of the cautery instrument.
Chapter Twenty-Fifth.
On the armpit cauterization.
If the head of the upper arm (humerus) becomes detached due to slippery moistures or does not become firmly attached when returned, making it a habit to dislodge upon even slight movement, as we have observed, then the joint should be reduced first. Then the patient should lie on their back or on their right side. Then raise the skin inside the armpit with the fingers of your left hand if the joint has dislocated inward.
Then heat the iron with two handles as shown here.
Then use the iron to burn the skin until it reaches the other side. The shape of the burn will be four burns, and it can also be burned with an iron having three handles, making the shape of the burn six burns, with the handles on the tender part of the wound.
And this is the image of the iron with three handles.
And sometimes one more can be added, making the burns eight. Then apply heated balls with salt and bind the patient still, without moving the limb for a while until it gains strength, although such dislocations usually occur downward.
Apply a single burn above the shoulder with a good nail or many burns that drip, as this strengthens the joint and removes moisture, allowing the patient to heal.
Chapter Twenty-Six.
On the removal of the stomach
If, in the stomach, cold and excessive moisture occurs, to the extent that it alters its state, and numerous discharges (fluids) accumulate therein, and various treatments are applied without effect, the patient should lie on his back with his legs and arms extended, and then three burns (procedures) should be performed. A burn under the breast with a spoon-shaped tool, about the size of a finger, and three burns below on each side of the single burn, forming a triangular shape, and spacing them apart to prevent them from merging if they become inflamed, with a depth of two-thirds of the skin's thickness.
According to this image and this measure, without any excess.
And if you prefer, perform a single large burn in the middle of the stomach according to this image.
The tool used for this single burn, according to this image, is in the form of a circle.
The stomach may be burned with a point for those who are alarmed by this burn, which is to mark the stomach with dots using ink, then burn it with a pointed tool, and treat it with the previously mentioned remedies until healing occurs.
Chapter XXVII.
In the treatment of coldness of the liver.
If a pain in the liver is caused by coldness, moisture, or excessive heat, to the extent that it deviates from its natural condition and no improvement is observed after treating the patient as described in the preceding sections. The patient should lie on his back and have three burns made with a reed on the liver, below the ribcage where the elbow ends, in this exact shape and size.
After each burn, make a gap equal to the thickness of your finger, and make the burns straight along the body, without pressing the reed with your hand.
The amount burned should not exceed half the thickness of the skin. If the patient cannot stand, he should lie down with his legs extended and arms raised, following this image of the reed.
You can use a sharp reed to make these burns if you are skilled and careful, taking care not to burn the skin excessively, which could harm the stomach and reach the intestines, as the skin there is thinner. Be aware of this.
Chapter Twenty-Eight
In the treatment of a tumor of the liver with heat.
If a cyst in the liver presents itself, and you wish to determine whether it is a tumor in the liver flesh or in its capsule, then if it is within the liver flesh, the patient will experience a sense of weight and pain but without sharpness.
And if it is in the liver capsule, there will be a sharp pain with great difficulty in treatment; so the patient should lie on his back and then mark the location of the tumor with ink.
Then heat the iron, which is like a wedge, in the fire; this is its form. Apply it with a single burn to cauterize the skin entirely, and continue burning until you reach the capsule, so that all the pus is extracted. Then treat it as you would any cyst until healing occurs.
This type of burning should only be used by those who are well-versed in medicine and have practiced these procedures many times; otherwise, it is better to leave such actions to me.
Chapter Twenty-Nine
In the case of gangrene.
The earliest authorities mention the use of turpeth (a form of raw alum) in cases of gangrene, specifying that one should take a single, longer piece of dry turpeth, no thicker than a finger, immerse it in oil, and heat it over fire. Then apply a single burn between the clavicle and the neck, and two small burns below the jaw, slightly inclined towards the side under the beard, and two large burns above the breasts, between the third and fourth ribs.
Apply two more burns between the fifth and sixth ribs, slightly inclined towards the back, a burn in the center of the chest, another one above the stomach, and three burns from behind, one between the shoulders and two on either side of the ribs below the burn between the clavicle and neck.
One must not insert the burn too deeply into the skin, but rather apply it superficially as a friction. Some early authorities mention that people used to employ an iron instrument shaped like a funnel, heating it and inserting it between the ribs until it reached the affected area.
The duration of this treatment, as we have mentioned, is in line with the size of the liver tumor. In this case of burning, there are risks; either the patient dies immediately, or a fistula may develop at the site, which cannot heal.
Chapter Thirty
On the spleen.
If the treatment for the spleen, as mentioned in the previous section, does not take effect, there are three valid options: to apply three or four burns (kiyas) aligned along the length of the spleen.
In the form of liver burns, with each burn spaced apart by the thickness of a finger or slightly more, and using the same technique as described for liver burns, without deep penetration. The patient is positioned lying on their back.
The other option involves making incisions in the armpit and lifting the skin opposite the spleen, where the patient's left armpit ends, and lifting the skin across the width of the body, so that the burns fall along the length of the body.
Then, insert the rods carefully until they pass through the skin from the other side, and remove the cauterization tool, leaving four burns, or, if you prefer, use the other tool with three prongs.
Then, treat the burn site after allowing it to drain pus for several days, as it is more effective than any other treatment mentioned.
Chapter XXXI.
On the treatment of edema.
The application of heat (kīy) is effective only in the case of edemas that are particularly viscous. If you treat the edema with various remedies as mentioned in the classification, but they do not take effect, you should apply four burns around the navel and one burn on the stomach.
Apply another burn on the liver, one on the spleen, and two behind the ribs, one facing the chest and the other facing the stomach. The depth of the burn should be close to the thickness of the skin, and then leave the burns open to allow pus to drain for a long time.
Do not discontinue treatment after the application of heat, as it is necessary to combine various remedies to speed up recovery. The shape of the burn on the back should be nail-like, as described previously, and the one on the stomach should be olive-shaped.
Chapter XXXII.
On the treatment of foot and leg edema.
If the feet and legs are edematous and filled with yellow water, a burn should be applied on the back of the foot at the point between the little finger and the ring finger.
And establish your hand with the iron, do not bend it, then raise your hand and do not return it, for it exudes the yellow water and the iron should be in this form.
Then, make two burns on each leg with the flat side of the iron, one above and one below the knee, and on every thigh, make two burns extending from the hip to the middle of the leg.
Leave the burn open without treatment for some time, and it will exude water. Then treat it with all that has been mentioned.
Chapter 33.
In the burn for diarrhea.
If diarrhea is due to cold and moisture, weakening the digestive and absorbing forces in the stomach and intestines, and after trying various remedies without improvement, and seeing the patient strong enough to endure it, then apply a large burn on their stomach. As mentioned earlier, burn the stomach with a circular iron, and make four burns around the navel, gently using the hollow iron, and apply a large or two burns on the cotton above the anus.
If you observe abundant moisture and the patient is susceptible to it, then apply a cauterization on the groin and another on each side (of the body). You may also add two small cauterizations near the larger one on the stomach. It is an effective treatment that will not fail, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
On cauterizing hemorrhoids.
If there are chronic hemorrhoids in the anus, numerous or singular, of thick, cold humors or putrid moisture, and they have been treated as mentioned in the previous sections without success, then cauterize the patient with three incisions below the tailbone, slightly under the table, in a triangular shape.
Cauterize under the navel with two fingers, and if you judge that the patient's stomach has cooled and their food is not digesting well, and you observe facial swelling, then apply a large cauterization on the stomach and another on the liver. And another cauterization on the spleen with a nail-like iron, leaving it open for some time, then treat until healing occurs, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-Five.
On the removal of warts.
After cutting it, if you cut off a wart, heat the iron that resembles a crescent and insert it carefully into the same cut wart while applying pressure with your hand until the iron reaches the opening of the vein from which the blood flows. Do this once or twice.
If there are many warts, cut off each one with the iron as we have described, then treat them with appropriate ointments until they heal. If you apply a large iron burn to cotton, it will be even more effective.
Chapter 36.
On the removal of fistulas that occur in the buttocks and its surroundings.
If the patient does not respond to the incision and treatment as described in its proper place, or refuses it, then he may heal with burning. If a fistula occurs and pus flows from it along with corrupt humors, first measure it with a fine probe.
Then, determine the depth of its entry with the probe, heat the iron that resembles a crescent, and insert it carefully into the fistula following the same straight path as the probe entered, and reapply the burn until all those corrupt bodies are burned, once or twice or three times, according to your need.
Beware of burning a nerve, if present, or a substantial vein, if the fistula leads to the bladder or to the intestinal wall.
Beware of these locations, and only perform the procedure if the fistula is in a fleshy area and you estimate that it is not permeable. Then treat the site until it heals. If the site closes up and no longer allows materials to pass through for a certain period of time, then know that it has healed completely.
And if no longer allows materials to pass through, know that it is permeable or there is a dead bone or something similar within it, as mentioned in its place.
Chapter 37.
On the kidney.
If a pain occurs in the kidneys due to cold or severe chills, and as a result, the patient's strength is reduced, one should apply heat to both kidneys using the copper plate described previously. It can be applied three times on the same day at intervals, with three applications in a row being even more beneficial.
Chapter 38.
On the Bladder Stone
If there is weakness and relaxation in the bladder due to cold and moisture, so that the patient cannot retain urine, make a cut below the navel on the bladder where the hair of the pubic area begins, and make incisions on both the right and left sides of the navel.
After making the incisions on each side, make a cauterization of about the size of a thumb joint, and an additional one if necessary, at the base of the spine, with a surgical iron as previously described.
Chapter Thirty-Nine
On the Uterine Cutting
If there is a formation in the uterus due to cold and moisture that prevents the embryo from developing, or if there is difficulty in delivering it, or if there is pain during delivery, it is necessary to cauterize three incisions around the navel as we mentioned in the cutting of the bladder. Cauterize with a surgical iron at the base of the spine, or use two irons if necessary, with a flat point.
Chapter Forty
In this manner, dislocate the hip.
Misplaced mucous membranes can lead to hip dislocation, indicated by a longer leg when compared to the other. If measuring them reveals a gap, the patient should be treated with a semi-circular burn directly on the hip joint.
After marking the hip joint with ink so that it falls in the center of the circle, and if you do not have the special cauterizing iron, make three burns using a large olive-shaped iron.
Make the burn deep enough to penetrate the entire thickness of the skin, then treat it until healing occurs, God willing.
Chapter Forty-One.
Cauterizing the sciatic nerve.
If pain occurs in the hip joint due to cold and moisture, and the treatment mentioned in the sections does not work, leaving the condition unresolved over time, the patient should ease the heavy humors with putrid perfumes or sabra (a type of plant) or similar substances.
Then, apply the caustic to the affected area in two ways: either with burning drugs or with fire. The application with fire can be done in several ways, one of which is to burn three triangular incisions on the hip itself, as shown here.
It should have a suitable depth, and between each burn, the distance should be equal to the thickness of the finger. The cautery should be olive-shaped, and you can make one burn in the middle on the hip itself, which would be four burns. Alternatively, you can apply it in a circular motion as mentioned earlier for a single burn to dislocate the hip.
The circle should encompass the entire hip, burning all the skin thickness, this is the cauterization for sciatica when the pain is localized to the hip itself and does not extend to the thigh or leg.
If it extends to the thigh and leg, apply two burns on the thigh at the spot indicated by the patient as painful, and a single burn above the ankle with four fingers slightly towards the outer side. The cautery should be sword-shaped, and the depth of the burn should be equal to the skin thickness only.
If the patient indicates that the pain extends to the toes, apply cauterization at the indicated point three or four times or more if necessary. If the pain is below the knee and extends towards the leg, apply a single sword-shaped burn in that area.
Be cautious in all incisions to ensure that you do not cause the burning of a nerve or major artery, which could result in a severe injury or complication for the patient.
I have observed some cases where individuals, in their eagerness to burn above the ankle, have excessively burned the area, leading to a gangrenous condition that extends to the foot, causing it to rot completely. Consequently, severe diarrhea and death ensued. If the pain affects both sides, treat them in the same manner.
Some wise scholars have described a specific procedure for burning the hip, involving the creation of a metal cup with a diameter of approximately half a span (about 10-12 inches) at its mouth, slightly less than the width of a date palm kernel. Inside this primary cup, a smaller secondary cup is placed, followed by a third cup.
After placing each cup, there should be a space of about the width of a thumb between them. The cups are open on both sides and have a height of approximately one or two spans (around 5-10 inches). A handle made of secure iron is attached to these cups, as illustrated.
Then, heat the metal in a fire until it turns red and sparks. Place it on the hip of the patient, who should be lying on their right side. Burn three circular incisions at once with a hot iron, then leave it for three days, applying sesame oil as a dressing without covering the wound.
Many times, then treat it with a poultice until it heals. The author of this book states that this type of cauterization is rarely used due to its severity and the horror of its appearance, and there are few in Arabia who can bear it, except that it is effective cauterization for those who can endure it and suffer from it.
And as for cauterization with burning drugs, it is to make two half-circles, in which the door panel (reticule) is made of copper or iron.
It has a height of about two fingers or similar, and is open at the bottom and top, with some parts securely fastened together in this manner.
Then lower it onto the right hip of the patient, who is lying on their healthy side, securely fasten your hand, and pour between the circles water that has been slightly cooled over a short period of time from fire. Hold it for about an hour, and the patient will feel a pain similar to that of fire.
Until the pain subsides, then raise your hand with the instrument and wipe away the sharp water from the hip completely with clean water. Leave it for three days, applying butter to it until the burn's blackness disappears, and let it rest for several more days; this is most beneficial.
Then treat it with ointments until it heals. If the pain spreads to the thigh or leg, make a mold for it to hold water in the same way as you did for the hip, and this is the description of the sharp water which I have discussed in the article on preparing medicines.
Take part of the saltpetre and slaked lime, mix them together in a new pot with a small hole at the bottom, and place another pot, sealed below, inside it.
Pour fresh water over the saltpetre and slaked lime, squeezing them well with your hand, and leave the pot until the sharp water has settled at the bottom of the sealed pot. Then gather all the water and pour it over new saltpetre and slaked lime.
It becomes then very sharp, acting in many medical tasks and in healing other members, as it behaves like fire itself. Among the remedies is what is used to burn the hip, such as thapsus, honey from blackberry, and lime mixed with soap.
Galen tells a story of an ancient man who had a remedy for hip pain, sciatica, and bone stiffness, claiming that it is so powerful that no other treatment is needed, and it heals in just one application.
Even if he is carried into the bath and comes out having healed, one should use green comfrey root if available; if not, use recent dry comfrey root, finely pounded with some fat and applied to the hip where the pain is or on the leg or thigh.
And bind it and leave it for three hours or until the patient feels the burning has subsided; then, place him in the bath. If his body is moistened, submerge him in the tub. The pain will go away and he will heal, God willing. If he does not heal, repeat the bandage after ten days.
He will heal, God willing. Note that no one should use heat with these medications unless the body has been emptied first. Dioscorides mentioned that goat's sweat, when applied with heat, is beneficial for sciatica.
The heat should be applied as follows: take wool soaked in oil and place it on the deep area between the thumb and wrist, closer to the wrist. Then, use a dry goat's sweat.
Ignite it over fire until it becomes a hot coal, then place it on the wool and leave it until it cools. Take another one and repeat this process until sensation reaches the hip through the upper arm, and the pain subsides, God willing. This type of heat treatment is called "kay al-ba'ari.
The 42nd Chapter.
In cases of back pain.
Back pain may result from numerous causes, such as a fall, a blow, excessive vomiting, and the like. It is often due to the accumulation of cold, damp fluid. The application of heat (kī) is indicated for this specific condition alone.
When the pain is due to the accumulation of cold fluid, after making the patient vomit, one should apply heat (kī) to the back in three rows across the width of a table. In each row, there should be five or more applications of heat, depending on the patient's tolerance and strength.
The heat should be applied using a point iron (kīya) or, if preferred, three to four applications with a medium-sized hammer iron (kīyā sīna) as depicted here.
The 37th Chapter.
In the treatment of scoliosis (curvature of the spine).
This condition often affects young children, and its initial sign is shortness of breath during physical activity and movement. In the lower back, you may notice a prominent vertebra, protruding more than the surrounding vertebrae.
If you observe this and wish to stop it, apply an iron (ironing) tool that forms a circle in this manner. To apply the cauterization to each side of the vertebra evenly, and if you wish, encircle the vertebra with a point iron in two or three rows, making the dots close to one another, then treat the site until it heals as we have mentioned.
Beware of using cauterization on the curve that forms from nerve spasm.
Chapter Forty-Four.
On the cauterization of gout and joint pains.
If joint pains result from cold moisture accumulating in any part of the body, and if the pain occurs in the legs, doctors usually call this condition a specific gout.
If the cold gout, caused by various treatments as mentioned in the divisions, does not go away, cauterization will remove it, which is to apply iron (ironing) around the joint of the legs after vomiting, making many circles with a medium olive-shaped iron, like this.
If you need to apply a poultice on the face, do so with a poultice-making tool. If the pain ascends to the knees or other joints, and this occurs frequently, apply three or four poultices from each side to every knee or joint using this very same olive oil tool.
If more than this poultice is required, apply it without deep-sinking your hand in the heat, but only to the thickness of the skin. If the pain ascends to the hips or back, use the same poultice method as mentioned for its specific area.
If the pain is only in the hands, apply poultices around the wrists as if you are forming two rows; if the pain remains in the fingers, apply a poultice to each joint and to the palm, and if after several days the pain ascends to the elbows or shoulders,
Apply them from each side, and do not neglect the patient's care and medication. If they take good food, expel phlegm, and follow this poultice method, they will recover with God's will.
Chapter Forty-Five.
On the poultice for hernias.
If a hernia appears in the groin, with some of the intestines and fat descending towards the testicles, and it is a recent onset, you should order the patient to abstain from eating for a day and use laxatives to facilitate defecation.
Then he lies on his back between your hands, and you command him to hold himself until the hernia or intestine protrudes. Then push it back with your finger, and then mark with ink beneath the hernia on the pubic bone a sign resembling a half-circle, whose ends point towards the upper part of the body.
Then you heat up the iron to this shape.
Until a white surface emits sparks, then push the intestine or hernia back into his body. Then the attendant places his hand on the spot to prevent any further protrusion, and another assistant separates the patient's legs and places a cushion beneath him.
And another assistant lies on his chest and holds his hands, then the heated iron is placed on the same mark, and your hand with the iron stands straight, holding it until it reaches the bone or returning it if it didn't reach the first time.
And be careful with your effort to prevent the intestine from protruding while you apply heat, otherwise he may suffer death or severe harm. Know that if you do not reach the bone with the heat, your work will be unsuccessful, and the iron should be gentle on the children's bodies and firm on the adults'.
Then, after three days, you treat the burn site with lard until the skin heals from the heat damage. Then, apply other ointments until the wound heals completely. The patient should lie on his back for forty days until the scar is fully formed.
The patient's diet should be adjusted to the duration of treatment, making it soft enough to prevent the intestines from protruding during movement and defecation. Then, if he wishes to stand up after forty days, a firm bandage is applied and worn for another forty days, reducing fatigue, fullness from food and drink, and excessive shouting.
If this measure is applied in this way, it will heal completely, God willing. I will mention the treatment of hernias by incision in its own section, God willing. As for the hernia that occurs in the rest of the abdomen and was just beginning, if you want to prevent its progression, make a circular incision around it of the same size. The skin burned should be about two-thirds of the hernia's size, then treat it as mentioned above; it will not increase, God willing. Some of the earliest writers mentioned that a hernia should be cauterized with a triangular iron tool like this.
After learning about hernias using a marker, make a line across the width of the hernia on the upper side and another line down below, then lower your hand in the middle with a single, nail-like incision. The first burn is easier and better, God willing.
Chapter LXIV
In the cauterization of females.
If a pain occurs in any part of the body due to a fall or a blow, and this pain persists for a long time and does not respond to medication, then it should be cauterized with a point burn instrument. The burning should be done on each member according to its size, smallness, weakness, and strength.
If the pain and discomfort persist after the first cauterization, repeat the process, as these pains often spread to nearby areas. Therefore, apply cauterization until the patient is cured.
Chapter 74
Cauterization for leprosy.
As for those with leprosy, cauterization can be of great benefit, especially for the type of leprosy that occurs due to the putrefaction of phlegm and blackness.
If you wish to cauterize, examine the leprosy. If it is in its early stages and treated as we have mentioned in the divisions, but does not improve or stop, and there is a concern that the patient may suffer from corruption of all their humors, then apply five burns on the head. 1. The first burn is in the middle of the head, as usual.
It removes scales to facilitate the escape of thick vapors and also burns a burn on the spleen, as mentioned earlier. If leprosy continues in the patient and appears clearly, these burns, which we have mentioned for the head, should be applied. And burns at the tip of the nose, two on the cheeks, two on the neck vertebrae, six on the back vertebrae, one large one on the ischium at the base of the spine, and another above it on the same table, and two on the hips, one on each hip. And two on the knees, one on each knee; two on the elbows; two on the shoulder joints; two on the chest joints; a burn on every joint of his hands and feet; and on both heels of his feet, and on his wrists.
Beware of the nerve behind the heels, so as not to burn them. A burn may also be applied to the pubic bone, the opening of the stomach, and the liver. Know that the more burns you apply, the more effective and beneficial it will be.
Know that the patient does not feel the burns as painfully as a healthy person, because their body is numbed. The burns should be applied, large or small, according to the members and joints, as mentioned earlier regarding the qualities of the cautery.
Then treat the burn with fine alum and honey, along with other remedies, until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Eighty-Four
In a case of numbness where a body part is numbed and treated with medications, oils, and dressings without healing, remove the numb member by making incisions according to the severity or mildness of the condition, making sure to cut slightly thicker into the skin than other parts.
Then treat it with a poultice until it heals, and sometimes a burn is used for some numbness in the hand or foot at the spinal column where the nerve emerges that moves that member, and the numbness goes away.
Only one who is knowledgeable about the anatomy of the members and the emergence of nerves that move the body should undertake this.
Chapter Forty-Nine
On scabies (or 'brus' in the original Arabic):
If scabies persists and does not respond to medical treatments, make a burn on it with some depth corresponding to the thickness of the skin, so that the white color goes away and its color changes.
Then treat it with a fine lens and rose-petal fat, taking one part from each of the camel's tongue, dove's blood, or spider's blood. Mix all together, apply to a cloth, and secure the area until healed.
Chapter Fifty.
On Cancer.
If cancer is in its beginning stages and you wish to stop it, burn around it with a circular iron, as it spins. Some scholars have mentioned burning a severe burn in the middle of it, but I do not agree with this, as I expect it to ulcerate, and I have seen this happen many times.
The correct method is to burn around it with a circular shape as we mentioned, or with multiple severe burns.
Chapter Fifty-One.
On the treatment of gangrene.
If gangrene occurs and its healing is slow, either due to the inherent strength of the affected area or because the patient is elderly and has little blood, or due to the passage of time, and you wish to hasten its healing, burn around it with many small burns, dropping them one by one.
Then leave it, for it will speed up the healing. If you wish to apply heat, use an iron with this shape.
Then insert it in the middle of the abscess until it penetrates the skin, and make the burn below, so that the pus can flow easily, then treat it as necessary until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-Two.
On the burning wound.
The ulcer is nothing but a corruption that moves in the member and eats it, as fire eats dry wood. If you see an ulcer in a place where burning with fire is possible, use many small and large nails-irons according to what is suitable for that place affected by the ulcer.
Then burn it from all sides until the corruption is completely removed, and nothing remains of it. Then leave it for three days, and apply sulfur powder mixed with oil to the burned areas to remove all scabs and corruption.
Then treat it with ointments that promote tissue growth. If, after three days, you see that the flesh is growing back healthy and free of corruption, do not repeat the burning, unless there are still corrupt areas left. The ulcer can also be treated with strong medicine.
It serves as a substitute for fire, doing so more effectively, and I have mentioned its treatment with sharp drugs in the division, so take it from there when you need it.
Chapter LXXIII
On the types of nails, reversed and unreversed.
This ailment often occurs in the soles of the feet, a rough substance that hurts the foot, and it can be treated by fire or sharp water.
As for the treatment with fire, it involves heating a hollow iron tool shaped like a falcon's feather on all sides around the nail, making the edge thin, then lowering it over the nail and rotating the hand with the tool around the nail until the tool reaches the depth of the nail.
Leave it for three days, allowing the pus to form, then apply a paste of wild garlic crushed with salt as a dressing for the night. The next day, the nail will come out at its root, and the wound should be treated with a healing ointment until it is cured, if the nails are not reversed.
It often occurs on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet. One should take a tube of copper or iron or falcon's feather and lower it onto the nail or wart, then pour a small amount of sharp water into the tube.
Hold your hand and rotate it, slightly pressing the edge of the tube against the base of the nail, allowing the sharp water to penetrate the root of the nail, and the patient should endure the stinging sensation of the sharp water for a moment.
Then leave it, for the nail will come out with its roots. You should do this to each one, until you have removed all of them from the body. Then treat the sites after they have been freed, using the appropriate ointments that promote tissue regeneration.
Chapter XLIV.
On the Pince.
If a pince (a tool for holding or extracting) becomes frozen due to cold, or if there is an inflammation of the nerve, or a quartan fever (a type of intermittent fever), or any other condition, one should apply four or five burns with a hot iron on the spine, between each vertebra, and also on the chest. And apply a burn with an olive-shaped iron on the stomach, for the pince will calm down and expedite the maturation of the cold illness.
Chapter LXV.
On the Pince for Treating Abscesses on the Body.
When ugly boils appear in the body caused by cold, thick, corrupt materials, it is advisable at first sight to apply a gentle burn to each boil using a stick of fire, or the end of a long turmerik root, or a lens-shaped iron.
The boils, when first appearing, should be treated in this manner so that they do not increase or spread, and the healing power is exhausted, leaving the patient relieved, except that this should follow draining the patient through phlebotomy.
Chapter LVI.
In applying burns to stop bleeding from an artery.
Bleeding from an artery that has been severed often occurs when a wound is inflicted either externally or during the removal of a tumor, or when a member is burned and the like, making it difficult to cut.
If this happens to anyone, quickly place your hand over the artery's mouth, put your index finger on it and tighten it so that the blood is contained under your finger and does not escape, then take several small and large hot iron tools (possibly calamine irons), and blow on them until they become very hot.
Then take one, either small or large, depending on the wound and the place where the artery burst, and lower the iron on the same vein after quickly removing your finger. Hold the iron until the bleeding stops.
If, when lifting the finger from the artery's orifice and applying the iron, it extinguishes, take another iron with haste from among those prepared in the fire, and continue to do so one after another until the blood stops.
Be careful not to burn a nerve, for if there is an opening, it will cause the patient further harm. Know that if the artery bleeds, it cannot be cut, especially if it is a large artery, unless by one of four methods: either by burning as we have said, or by amputation if it has not already separated. If, after amputation, the ends contract and the blood stops, either tie it tightly with threads or apply drugs that stop the blood flow and secure it firmly with bandages.
As for those who attempt to stop the bleeding with bindings, or by tightening rags, or placing burnishing objects, etc., such methods will not stop it at all, except rarely, if one does not have a doctor or medicine. In such a case, they should immediately place their index finger over the wound's opening as we have described.
Tighten it firmly until the blood stops, flows from above the wound, and onto the artery and finger, never removing it with cold water until the blood freezes and thickens and cuts off. During this time, examine what is needed for burning or medicine.
The Second Chapter.
In incisions, punctures, lances, and various surgical procedures.
As we mentioned in the first chapter, every disease that can be treated with fire and burning medicines, its causes, symptoms, instruments, and types of cauterization, I have discussed these in detail from ancient times to the present.
And I will follow the same approach in this chapter to make it easier for the student to understand their requirements.
Before I begin, you should know, O my children, that this chapter contains risks beyond what is found in the first chapter on cauterization.
For this reason, caution should be stronger in this chapter, as the work involves risks that can lead to blood loss, which is the source of life. This can occur when opening a vein, incising a tumor, draining pus, treating surgery, or extracting an arrow, among other procedures, all of which carry danger and fear, and often result in death.
I advise you to avoid anything that raises doubt, for in this profession you will encounter various types of people suffering from different ailments. Some may have endured their illness and become indifferent to death.
In cases where the patient's suffering is severe, his condition critical, and the disease persistent, indicating a fatal outcome, some may offer you their wealth in exchange for health, seeing their illness as an enemy. However, you must never seek help from such individuals.
Let your caution be greater than your desire and diligence, and do not undertake any of these actions unless you have certain knowledge that confirms the favorable outcome, utilizing all means of knowledge and warning in the treatment of your patients to ensure their safety.
For in this, you will find assistance in gaining praise, glory, and gratitude. May God guide you, O my sons, and grant you wisdom and success, for it is all in His hands, there is no god but Him.
I have organized this chapter into sections, following the order of the previous chapter on cauterization from the tip to the base, to make it easier for you to find what you need from it, God willing.
Chapter One.
On the treatment of water retention in the heads of children.
This condition often afflicts children at birth when the midwife exerts excessive force on the baby's head, or it may arise from an unseen underlying issue.
And I have not seen this condition except in boys, and all of them whom I have seen, death comes to them swiftly. Therefore, I have decided to abandon this treatment, for I have seen a boy whose head has filled with water, and the head increases in size every day. Even the boy could not sit because of the enormity of his head and the increasing moisture, until he perished.
And this moisture either collects between the skin and bone or under the bone on the peritoneum. The procedure is, if the moisture is between the skin and bone and the tumor is small, a single cut should be made across the middle of the head, about two fingers in length, to allow the moisture to drain. This is an image of the scalpel.
If the moisture is excessive and the tumor is large, make two intersecting cuts as shown:
And if the moisture is under the bone and you see the stitches of the head opening on all sides, and when you press it with your hand, the water sinks inwards and this is not hidden from you, then you should make three cuts across the middle of the head, as shown.
After the cuts, all moisture is drained, then the incisions are closed with bandages and tourniquets. Subsequently, compresses of wine and oil are applied for five days. Then the bindings are loosened and the wound is treated with twists and ointments, without neglecting to maintain a moderate tension on the head. The patient should be fed with dry, slightly moist food.
Until the member strengthens and heals, another method of incision is to observe where the bone of the tumor appears and the collection of fluid, as it may be more in the back of the head or at the front, or on the right or left side.
You intend by the incision where the tumor appears to you and the accumulation of fluid, so make an incision as possible without cutting an artery, which could cause bleeding leading to the patient's death due to loss of fluids.
Chapter II.
Cutting the two arteries behind the ears, known as the sensitive ones.
When a sudden descent occurs to the eyes or chest, and this condition persists despite the use of drugs, the most effective treatment is to cut these two arteries.
Therefore, if you wish to cut them, you should shave the patient's head with a razor, then rub the area with a rough cloth to expose the artery. Tighten the patient's robe around their neck, look for the pulse, and locate the two depressions behind the ears, where they are most clearly visible in most people.
Then, mark them with ink and cut them with a sharp knife all the way to the bone, making a cut across the head's width. If you prefer, insert the knife from beneath the artery and move it upwards by cutting, ensuring a length of about two closed fingers.
If the sweat stops, the blood will flow out in a pulsating manner, advancing and receding repeatedly. If the artery is not visible to the touch, it should be located behind the ear, approximately three fingers from the surface, then marked with ink and incised into the bone.
The blood will flow in six waves, or perhaps more or less, depending on the patient's condition and the fullness of their arteries. Then, examine the wound. If there is any remaining tissue attached to the bone, cut it away.
To prevent a hot swelling, apply pressure with a cloth thread, then treat the wound with ointments until it heals.
Chapter III
On the arteries in the temple.
If a person suffers from chronic phlegm or acute attacks of fever in the muscles of the temple, or severe chronic headaches, and has undergone various medical treatments without improvement, we have found that cutting (or cauterizing) the arteries in the temple is effective for these conditions.
The procedure for treating the condition involves shaving the hair from the temple, focusing on the visible artery in the temple area. By observing its pulse, you can determine the state of the artery, and it rarely remains hidden except in unusual cases.
If the cold is severe and you cannot feel the pulse, the patient should tighten their neck with their cloak. Then you should rub the area with a cloth or apply hot water to make the artery clearly visible. Then take the scalpel whose image this is. Then use it to carefully peel the skin until you reach the artery. Then cast a hook into it and pull it up to extract it from the skin, freeing it from all adhesions below. If the artery is thin, twist it with the tip of the hook. Then cut from it a part, according to the distance between its ends and its contraction, without causing bleeding. For if it is not amputated or severed, the blood will not flow at all. Then drain the blood from six to three openings.
If the artery is large, it should be tied in two places with a strong, doubled thread. The thread should be either linen or string from a lute, so that putrefaction does not reach it before the wound heals, causing bleeding.
Then cut away the remainder between the ties. You should do this at that moment or later, and if you wish, brand it to the bone with a skewering iron, so its ends are severed, serving the same purpose or even better as described.
Unless the patient suffers from fever or mood alterations, as burning (from heat) is beneficial in expelling humors, it is the most useful course of action. After draining the veins, the wound should be filled with old cotton and bandaged tightly. Afterwards, dry medicines that nourish the flesh and twisting should be applied until healing occurs, God willing.
If, while working, bleeding occurs from an artery, immediately cut it either by burning or by filling the wound with wax and pressing firmly until the blood stops. If nothing is at hand, put your finger in the wound until the blood clots.
If the wound is washed with very cold water to calm the inflammation, and bandaged as necessary, one of the easiest ways to drain a vein is to burn the sweat with this two-bladed iron, after marking the locations with dye.
Remove it with a strong force until it reaches the bone, and cut the vein at two points to separate its ends; for this burning will never cause it to heal. This is the image of the iron.
It (the iron) should have two sharp blades, resembling small pincers, but less acute than a knife. For if they are as sharp as a knife, cold will come to them more quickly, and the flesh will not be cut off as swiftly. If there is some thickness in them, it will grip well against hot fire.
And I cut the flesh swiftly, and this action is better than every other, lighter, and easier, and let it be between the two knives as thick as a finger.
Chapter IV.
In the treatment of continuous, hot tear drainage into the eyes.
If the tears are continuous, and the drainage is from the veins on the skull from outside, and no benefit is derived from medical treatments with drugs, and you observe that the patient's face has turned red. He feels a tingling on his forehead, similar to the sensation of ants crawling, and his eyes are weak, moist, with dried-up eyelids, caused by the intense tearing. The initial treatment for this condition, known as "al-Siif" (the sword), involves commanding the patient to shave the hair on their forehead.
Then, make three parallel cuts on the forehead, each about the length of two fingers, aligned with the bridge of the nose in the center of the forehead, the second slightly away from the muscle movement in the temple, and the third on the other side.
Be careful not to cut the two arteries on the sides, and keep your hand away from the jaw's connection. After each cut, ensure a distance of three fingers (with hands clenched) and have sponge pieces or dry cloth ready to absorb the blood.
Then enter the sharp scalpel with both ends, whose image is this. From the wound next to the temple to the middle wound, and by this all the skin between the two wounds, along with the peritoneum on the bone, is peeled away, and then you do the same from the middle wound to the third wound, then remove this scalpel. You also insert into the first wound another tool called a "scie" (scalpel) with one sharp end and the other smooth and not sharp, and this is its image: .
You position its sharp side towards the flesh adhering to the skin, and its smooth side towards the bone, and push it until it reaches the middle wound, cutting all vessels that descend from the head to the eyes without reaching the surface of the skin.
Then you do the same in the middle wound to the other, after allowing enough blood to flow, squeeze the areas of clotted blood, and then insert a cotton thread in each wound, placing a bandage soaked in a mixture of wine and oil or vinegar and oil.
To prevent a hot swelling, and on the third day, loosen the bandage and use plenty of hot compresses with warm water, then treat it with a paste of basil and rose fat and all other remedies used for wounds until healing occurs, God willing.
Chapter Five.
In the treatment of tears and discharge into the eyes from within the head.
When a person experiences frequent, severe, persistent epidaemics (outbreaks) that cause the eyes to appear emaciated and small, with weakened vision and irritated eyelids, leading to the loss of eyelashes. There is a sharp, painful sensation in the depth of the head, accompanied by frequent sneezing, indicating that these symptoms arise from numerous deep veins. The best treatment for this condition involves instructing the patient to shave their forehead and then make a single cut through the middle of the forehead.
There is a sharp, painful sensation in the depth of the head, accompanied by frequent sneezing, indicating that these symptoms arise from numerous deep veins. The best treatment for this condition involves instructing the patient to shave their forehead and then make a single cut through the middle of the forehead. Alternatively, make the cut slightly higher and extend it from one side of the temple (left) to the other (right), reaching the bone. Remove your hand away from the moving muscles of the temples when chewing, ensuring the cut reaches the bone and all blood is absorbed using a sponge.
Separate the edges of the cut using old cotton or a twist of linen, then secure it with bandages. Soak the bandages in a solution of wine and oil to prevent swelling. If, after healing, you notice that the swelling has subsided, but the bone is exposed, gently rub the bone until flesh begins to re-form.
Then treat it with the drying plan that makes flesh grow, such as taking two parts of flour from wheat and four parts of colphonia, prepare a paste from them, and use it to heal the flesh in such wounds.
Chapter VI.
In the treatment of what falls into the ear.
All that falls into the ear is one of four types, either a metallic stone or semi-stone such as iron and glass, or a plant seed like lentils and nuts, or something liquid such as water, vinegar, and the like.
And if it is an animal, when a stone or the kind of stone that does not increase in the ear falls into it, and you receive it with the ear towards the sun, then squeeze some violet or sage oil into it, and try to remove it by moving your head or sneezing. And plug the nostrils when sneezing comes, after placing a bandage around the ear with cloth or wool, and stretching the ear upwards. This treatment often removes the stone, but if it does not, try to remove it gently using an instrument of this type.
If it does not come out with the instrument, try a blind hook made of delicate wire with little curvature. If that does not work, make a tube from copper and insert its tip into the ear hole carefully.
Seal the area around the tube with softened pitch mixed with fat, so that the wind has no other path but through the tube. Then draw it strongly and frequently with your breath, and often it will come out. If it does not come out as described, take a small amount of gum from the Nabatean or the prepared gum used to capture birds, and place it at the end of the rod.
After wrapping it tightly with a cotton, gently insert it into the ear hole once the ear is dry. If it does not come out as described, hurry to make an incision before the hot swelling or spasm occurs.
The procedure involves first draining the patient's eardrum of fluid, if necessary, and then sitting the patient between your hands, turning their ear upwards, and making a small incision at the base of the ear, just above the cartilage.
The incision should be in the shape of a crescent, extending until the stone is reached, at which point it can be removed using appropriate tools. Then, quickly sew up the incision and treat the area to facilitate healing.
If the object falling into the ear is a small grain that swells and accumulates, attempt to remove it as described. If it does not come out, take a thin, delicate scalpel, as illustrated.
And try to cut that type of grain falling into the ear, but only do so if you are certain that the grain has been moistened by the steam of the ear, becoming many small pieces, and then remove them with a deaf hook or a delicate dry cloth or by sucking.
As we mentioned, it is easy to remove them. As for the water in the ear, the patient should first use a nosebleed device or something similar to fill their ear with cotton waste while lying on the affected ear, and if that removes the water.
Or, take many small, smooth stones and warm them slightly over fire. The patient should then insert one of these stones into the hole of their ear, bend on one leg in that direction, and hit the stone inside the ear with another stone.
They should continue this process with one stone after another until all the water is removed. Water may also be extracted using a reed or feather, inserting one end into the ear and heating the other end over fire until most of it burns away, then repeating with another feather.
Do this several times until all the water is removed or use a tube, as mentioned with the stone, to suck it out. As for removing any animal that may have entered the ear (such as a tick), treat it as described in the previous sections.
If the mass is large and visible, attempt to remove it using forceps and hooks; its extraction is easier than that of any other growth in the ear. However, if you have treated the earworm as mentioned in the section on parasites and it does not respond to your treatment.
You should examine the ear in sunlight; if you notice any worms, remove them using forceps or delicate hooks. If nothing is visible, use a tube with this shape.
The tube should be narrow at the bottom and wide at the top, with its thin end inserted into the ear as far as it will go comfortably. Then suck firmly on it several times to extract all the worms. If it does not come out, plug the opening around the tube with wax as mentioned earlier for the stone.
If none of the above methods work, use the parasites mentioned earlier, which the ancients have used to kill worms. You can find this in the section on parasites, and you should apply oils and medications to the ear using this instrument, as shown below:
As you can see, it is made of silver or brass, with a narrow bottom and a small hole, and a wider top. If you wish, the tube inside can be made of tight copper, or you can use a rod, wrapping a cotton ball tightly around its end.
Then, receive the fat or juice or whatever you wish from these medications in the tube while it is in the ear. Then, insert the curette with a cotton swab from above and squeeze it gently with your hand until the fat flows into the inner ear and the patient feels it.
Introduce the remedy into the ear, and if what you pour into it is warm from the fire, ensure that it is not too hot or too cold, for the ear cannot tolerate such extremes.
Chapter VII
Treatment for sudden blockage of the ear.
Some infants may be born with their eardrums unperforated.
Some people may also experience a blockage in the ear canal due to injury or flesh growth, and this blockage can be deep within the eardrum hole, making it invisible to the naked eye.
It may protrude slightly and be visible, but what is deep within the ear and invisible is usually difficult to treat. Therefore, for what is visible, place the patient's ear in the sun. Examine it, and if you see the obstruction is visible, open it with a delicate scalpel, and this is its appearance:
Its end should be slightly narrower, with both sides smooth to avoid damaging the ear. If the obstruction is due to a growth of flesh in the ear canal, hold it with a delicate hook and cut it carefully until all the flesh is removed.
If the blockage is deep within the ear, take a mild, smooth curve and warm it slightly in the fire, then insert it into the ear canal. If you feel the obstruction along with the patient's hearing impairment, gently break off its tip.
Be careful not to injure the ear drum, then create a wick inside the ear of appropriate size, coated in Egyptian ointment, and do this for several days until you are certain the wound will not adhere or close. Alternatively, take a wick, soak it in water, and sprinkle crushed glass on it.
Use it if you see the ear has become swollen and hot. In this case, remove the wick and replace it with a new one coated in rose oil-based paste to alleviate the hot swelling, then treat it until it heals.
If there is bleeding, dip a sponge or cloth in cold water and place it on the ear, using all other treatments mentioned in the article on cataplasms to stop the bleeding.
Chapter VIII.
In the treatment of warts that appear on the eyelids.
These warts that appear on the eyelids may be moist or dry, and they should be seized with a file or hook and cut off at their bases with a scalpel. Then, a powdered glass should be applied to the site.
If blood flows from them, it is better to cauterize them with a gentle lens-shaped iron after cutting them off. They often return if any of their roots remain. If they are cauterized with fire, these roots are burned and they do not return.
Chapter IX.
In the treatment of cold that affects the eyelids.
It often occurs on the eyelids something that resembles cold in its severity and hardness.
It is therefore called "cold" (برد) due to the accumulation of thick moisture in both the upper and lower eyelids. If the cold (moisture) is prominent on the surface of the eyelid, moving to every side, then the treatment is straightforward; make a vertical cut (شقّ) across it.
Then, carefully peel it from all sides until you are free, then hang it on a hook and cut it. If you can only cut it after the eyelid has been entirely cut through, that will not harm the patient. If the incision is large, sew it together and treat it until it heals.
If it is small, there is no need to worry, as the ointment will heal and seal it. If the eyelid is inclined inward towards the inner surface, turn the eyelid upside down and hang the lid with a hook without needing to cut, then trim it from all sides.
If the eyelid has been entirely cut through, it will not harm the patient. Then, wash the eye after cutting off the lid with salt water and treat the area to seal it until the patient heals.
Chapter X.
In the treatment of a fistula that occurs in the eyelid.
A fistula (or "شرناق") is a flesh growth that occurs in the upper layers of the eyelid, most commonly affecting children. It can weigh on their eyes and cause discharge at night, preventing them from seeing sunlight. Due to the influx of tears.
Therefore, they rest and sleep with their faces down, and their eyelids are moistened by the eyebrows, with a swelling beneath them. The hernia is visible, and when you press on the area with your fingers, you can feel the hernia between them. The proper procedure is for the patient to lie with their head in your lap.
Then take a piece of linen cloth, prepare a wick from it, and make a circle with the wick around the hernia on all sides. Place it over the hernia and press from each side with your fingers to gather the hernia in the center of the circle.
Then, using a sharp scalpel, make a vertical cut through the moistened area, not larger than the cut made during phlebotomy. However, in terms of depth, you should cut through all the skin layers to reach the hernia.
In most cases, the hernia will protrude from the cut as a white piece of fat. Use a piece of cloth wrapped between your fingers to draw it out and rotate your hand to the right and left until it is free. Be careful not to increase the cut too much, or the scalpel may damage the eye.
If the hernia does not appear at first, you should slightly increase the cut gently until it emerges. Then, draw it out as we described and soak a cloth in vinegar and water, apply it to the area, and secure it with a bandage. Some people use salt as well.
He places it in the wound to dissolve what remains of that moisture, then treats it until it heals. If a hot swelling occurs at the site, he treats it with soothing medicines until it heals.
**Chapter XI**
**On Types of Eye Twitching**
If hairs grow on the eyelid in an abnormal pattern beneath the natural lashes, and they become persistent, they damage the eye and cause various ailments such as constant tearing, drooping eyelids, white or cloudy appearance, and thickening, which can lead to visual impairment.
Eye twitching has four aspects: either by burning with fire, or with sharp drugs as mentioned in the chapter on burning, or through cutting and stitching, or with reeds, as I have previously explained.
You should place the patient's head in your lap and, with your left hand, turn the eyelid over. If it flips, otherwise, insert a needle with a thread underneath the eyelid and pass the needle through the thread from above. This should be done near the hair itself, and then pull the thread upwards to lift the lid.
Turn it with a spatula, then incise the inner eyelid without touching the surplus hair using an aseptic scalpel from the outer corner (margins) to the inner corner (margins). Then thread the needle and place a small pad of cotton or cloth underneath the eyelid. Finally, mark the eyelid with ink.
Like the shape of an apricot leaf, but the shape should be adjusted to the extent required for raising the eyelid, as it may vary from person to person. Some may need a suitable amount cut from the eyelid according to its relaxation.
Some may need to cut less, adjusted to the eyelid's relaxation, then make incisions with a scalpel along the marked lines, starting from the outer corner of the eye (lamina) to the inner corner, with each incision close to the natural lashes, similar to the thickness of a thread.
Then, insert the forceps into one corner of the skin and completely peel it away. Then, sew the edges together with a needle and thin woolen thread, clean the blood, and attach any remaining threads to the eyebrows using sticky substances.
You may choose to do so or not, but the stitches and threads will remain for approximately three or four days, then you can treat it. Alternatively, if desired, you can leave the wound unstitched and treat it with drying and constricting agents, as the eyelid will raise when the wound heals and is sealed, and stitching is preferable.
This method of elevation (or 'tension') is mentioned in the earliest texts, and it is beneficial for the patient, being one of good practice with no danger. Another aspect of tension involves marking on the eyelid a shape similar to that of an apricot leaf, as we have described. Then raise the eyelid with three forceps, either spread apart or grouped in this manner:
Then cut the remaining eyelid with a small scissor, cutting it gently in this manner:
If you cannot hold the forceps, take a needle with a thread and insert it in the middle of the shape. Insert another thread near the larger eyelid and a third thread near the smaller eyelid. Then, gently gather the threads between your fingers and raise your hand slightly.
Lift the entire marked skin as we described, then sew together the edges of the wound and treat it until it heals. If a hot lump appears when you cut or slit, soothe it with cauterization and similar soothing ointments.
The lower eyelid may also experience a condition where its lashes turn inside out. In this case, one should use the techniques mentioned: cutting, stitching, and binding with fire or harsh medication, as these methods are more effective and less harmful for the patient compared to simply cutting and stitching it.
Binding with reed (or similar materials) is done as follows: turn the eyelid inside out, making a slit from within as described. Then create two thin strips or wooden splints, each as long as the eyelid and narrower than a surgical blade.
And I have borrowed from both sides of their extremities where the threads adhere, then gathered them gently on what remains of the eyelid and tightened the sutures from both sides tightly, leaving it for days; for the stretched skin will die and turn black and putrefy.
Until it falls on its own, if it is slow, cut it with a scalpel and then treat it until it heals; when the wound heals, the eyelid will rise and the eyelids of the eye will not be affected. And this is a picture of the sutures made in this shape and size, exactly the same length and width:.
Chapter XII.
Raising the protruding hair from the eye with the needle.
If it is a single hair or two, the work is to take a fine needle and insert a thin, smooth silk thread into it, then gather the ends and tie them with a very delicate knot. The length of the thread should be about an inch.
Then, you assemble another thinner thread in the bandage, shorter than the previous one, and tie its ends if desired. The patient should then lay their head on your lap, close to the sun so that the work can be clearly seen, as it is a delicate task. Then, insert the needle with the bandage into the root of the excess hair.
Perform this procedure on the eyelid with haste to extract it above the natural hair, then pull the thread over the ligature and insert that hair into the ligature, whether it is one, two, or three hairs at most.
Then, using your hand, you pull on the thread until the hair comes out with the ligature in the eyelid alongside the natural hair. If you pull the ligature without the hair coming out, you draw the ligature down using the thread it is attached to, until the ligature emerges from the upper hole.
Then, you put the hair back into the ligature and pull on it, until it rises in the upper hole and becomes clearly visible. At that point, release the ligature and thread, and close the eye, keeping it tightly closed for two or three days, until the hair takes its place and flesh grows over it.
If the hair is short, either add a longer natural hair to it so that it rises with it, or leave it until it grows longer after some time, then lift it.
Chapter XIII.
On the treatment of the gap that occurs in the upper eyelid of the eye.
The conditions that are dealt with in this chapter are called "arnabiyah," and these conditions can be either natural or accidental. The accidental condition arises from the healing of a wound, tear, burn, or similar injuries.
The method of treatment involves incising the scab, separating its edges, and inserting a thread of linen between them, securing it until healing occurs. It is not advisable to use agents that dry and contract the skin in the treatment.
If you do this, the condition will return worse than before, and you should use agents that relax, such as horseradish, boiled in water with fennel seeds and flaxseed mucilage, mixed with a certain amount of fat, applied to the thread and used for treatment.
The essence of the treatment is to try by all means not to allow it to heal in the same shape as before. The procedure we have mentioned is only part of the repair; it does not aim to restore the area to its original state.
Chapter XIV
In the treatment of a wound on the lower eyelid.
The wound located on the lower eyelid, which is truly called a "shatra," can be either natural or accidental. The accidental condition arises from injuries such as a wound, tear, or burn.
The method of operation: Take a needle with a doubled thread and pierce it into the flesh, passing it through from the left nostril to the right nostril, so that the thread is at both ends of the flesh. Then, using the needle, pull the flesh up and cut it with a broad scalpel.
If the shape of the eyelid returns to what it should be, otherwise take a rod and place it on the site of the cut and turn the eyelid with it, and make two cuts inside the eyelid, and let the ends of the cuts meet at the angles of the incisions made until they form an angle. Until they meet, it will have the shape as follows:
It forms a Greek letter lambda, then remove that flesh as much as the sharp side is below the eyelid, then gather the scattered parts with two stitches using woolen thread, and treat it with the mentioned relaxing drugs and tourniquets until it heals.
If the opening occurred from a cut, stitching, or burning, then you should make a simple gap without affecting the hairs of the lid, and separate the lips with tourniquets as mentioned.
In summary, when treating an opening in the eyelid, whether from above or below, conduct the procedure according to what you find regarding the shape of the opening; it can vary significantly, and the surgeon must adapt their method as best as possible.
Until the shape returns to its natural state or approximates it, the same disease indicates what works for it and what tools are suitable in most cases.
Chapter XV.
In the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or cornea.
This adhesion may prevent many people from moving their eyelid freely and impede it from performing its natural functions, requiring the insertion of a rod under the eyelid.
Then raise it above or extend it with a wire, and then cut the adhesion with a delicate knife that is not as sharp as surgical knives, but rather slightly blunt, to avoid disturbing the patient during the procedure and prevent the knife from causing harm to the eye with its sharpness, making the cut akin to peeling off the adhesion.
And expect that when the eyelid returns to its natural state and the adhesion is completely healed, you should then pour salt water into the eye to wash it or apply a drop of ginger extract mixed with water, followed by separating the eyelid from the eye using a cotton thread.
Place a damp woolen cloth over the eye and, after three days, use the bandaged compresses until it heals.
Chapter XVI.
In cutting the tendon, care must be taken not to damage the surrounding flesh.
The tendon is of two types: either it is nervous, resembling a thin, rigid membrane, or non-nervous, resembling a hard, white substance that, when touched by metal or caught with a hook, easily breaks.
And if a hook does not adhere to it, both types begin from the larger joint and gradually become thicker, covering the eye and preventing light and eye movement. The method of cutting it is that the patient places his head in your lap.
Then he opens his eyes, you raise the eyelid with your hand, catch the tendon with a slightly flexible hook, and pull it up. Then take a needle and insert a horse or cow hair and a strong thread into it, bend the tip of the needle slightly, and pierce it in the middle of the tendon.
And you pass the needle through it, binding the tendon with the thread, pulling it up, and peeling the side of the tendon next to the pupil with the hair, as if spreading it with the hair to the end. Then cut the rest at the base of the joint with a delicate scalpel or small scissors, leaving the natural eye flesh.
To prevent the constant flow of tears from the incision, the bleeder can be extended with a forceps alone or with a thread, as we have said, and then scraped with a smooth-ended scalpel, whose shape is depicted here: .
And be careful not to touch the scalpel to the cornea, which may cause a tear in the pupil, and then, after cutting, apply some powdered salt or zinc dust to the eye and leave it for another day, then treat it as necessary until it heals.
If the bleeder is non-nervous and cannot accommodate an needle or hold a forceps, this type of bleeder is often treated with medications as described in the sections, and it will heal as mentioned. If you decide to cut it, open the patient's eye.
Take a gentle, smooth, weak-bladed scalpel, as depicted here: . Disengage the bleeder from above gently. If you see that it is loosening, breaking off, and there is no deep cut from the disengaging, then apply some zinc dust or red dye or powdered salt to the eye and leave it for another day.
Then, repeat the process until all of it is gone, unless a hot, swollen lump appears in the eye, in which case leave it and treat the swollen lump until it heals, then resume disengaging until it heals completely. And if there is a flesh protuberance in the corner of the eye, treat it as necessary until it heals.
If the natu (eyelid) causes severe damage to the eye, suspend it with a hook and cut off some of it, but do not cut too much so as not to cause excessive tearing. Then apply red myrrh or zinc dust to the affected areas until healing occurs.
**Chapter XVII**
**On Cutting the Eyelid and Removing Excessive Flesh from the Eye.**
In some people, a red flesh may grow in the eyes, covering or almost covering the pupil, or extending beyond the eyelids, and sometimes the eyelids may even turn outward, resembling the rose-colored narthex.
The procedure involves the patient lying on their head in your lap, then opening their eyes and using appropriate hooks to remove all the red flesh.
Or, using a scalpel or tweezers, cut off the flesh from the inner to the outer edge, ensuring all of it is removed while being careful not to harm the eye during the procedure. You can use either the instrument described for cutting the nail (scalpel) or small scissors. as shown in the illustration accompanying this text.
If the eye is injured and all the moisture is lost, fill it with finely ground salt or drop in a few drops of red powder or other caustic medications, and apply a white cloth soaked in egg white from the outside to prevent the hot swelling.
If there is some remaining moisture and you are overcome by blood, and you fear a hot swelling, leave the eye alone and treat it with something that reduces swelling, then resume treatment until it heals. The same goes for any excess tissue or meat that appears in the eye from this condition.
However, you should avoid treating any weak eye naturally or through surgical intervention with iron, and do not put your hand into any of these treatments unless you are certain that the organ is capable of enduring such a procedure.
Chapter XVIII
On the removal of foreign bodies from the eye.
The condition, known as "the red threads," which tangle in the eye and obstruct vision, weakens the eye over time. You should first examine it: if the eye with the threads is strong and has no other illness besides these threads, then...
Then, the procedure is as follows: instruct the patient to rest their head in your lap, and use a hook (surgically sterile) to gently pull on these threads, one or two depending on your skill. The hooks should be flexible and curved in this manner: ...
Two double needles in a single body, as shown here:
Then, with a delicate scissors, carefully snip those vessels and wipe away the blood little by little until the eye appears free of them and the blood has drained. Be cautious around the eye, do not harm it with the scissors' edges, and conduct your work during the day, facing the sun.
Be very careful in your work so as not to cut any vessels other than those intended. When you are finished, apply eye drops of green or red iris water to consume any remaining foreign bodies with its sharpness; if you cannot remove all of it at once, then dress the eye with something to soothe the pain.
Leave it for several days until the pain subsides and the swelling goes down, then repeat the procedure on that same area following the same method until the condition improves.
Leave it [while the patient's head is resting on the student's lap, one person dries the tears and checks the vision in the front and back of the eye, and another holds open the eye with a fixed or triangular instrument that the student uses to perform the work]. The basic procedure involves opening the eye with instruments like fixed spreaders or triangular ones, which a student uses.
Be precise, with the patient's head resting on the student's lap, one person drying the tears and examining vision in the front and back of the eye, while you use a knife to cut the membrane. You can choose to start by cutting from above the eye or below; ideally, snip one thread at the very end of the eyelid and another at its beginning.
Grip it between the middle and index fingers, then attach pincers underneath them. Hold it again between the ring and little fingers, and gently lift your hand to see that the tendons have retracted. Cut the tendon from the smaller gastrocnemius with scissors or a delicate scalpel.
The surgeon pierces the tendon with a needle and probes until the entire tendon retracts onto the bone, ensuring it is not cut. If blood or serum splashes, it may cause harm.
Then, cut with scissors above and below the tendon's attachment to the Achilles tendon, ensuring nothing remains attached except for the calcaneal bone. If possible, lift it from the bone using the surgeon's knife, as this is preferable. In some cases, it may come off easily.
If the tendon is cut, it causes the flap to heal over several days, alleviating pain and reducing swelling, after which further work can be done on it.
Chapter XIX.
In reattaching the feather to the nose.
The feather, when treated with cauterization or sharp, burning medicine as described earlier, and does not heal, requires no other remedy than to open the abscess when it matures and extract all the moisture or pus inside.
Until the bone is exposed, if it is revealed and you see decay or blackness in it, remove it with this instrument, whose form is as follows:
The instrument called "al-khashnah al-ras" is made of Indian iron, and its head is rounded like a seed, possibly carved with the pattern of a knife or a scalpel, finely. You place it on the site of the bone's decay and rotate it between your fingers while slightly squeezing your hand until you feel that the decay has been removed.
You repeat this process several times, then treat the wound with drying, tightening drugs. If it heals and flesh grows, and no further issues arise, it is considered healed after forty days without recurrence or complications.
You shall know that it has healed, otherwise there is no remedy but to push the fistula back into the nose hole, revealing the bone again with iron or a sharp medicine. If the bone is exposed, take a splint in this shape:
The end of the iron should be triangular, and its wood part should be cone-shaped, as you can see. Place it on the bone, close to the nose and slightly away from the eye, then rotate the splint until the bone is inserted and felt by the patient.
By feeling if air escapes when the patient holds their hand over their nose, then treat the wound with tightening, drying drugs as previously taught. If flesh grows and hardens, the material that was extruding will return to the nose, which is lighter for the patient, God willing.
Chapter XX.
The repair of the eye's net (or retina).
If the eye's net (retina) is detached but no harm or loss of vision occurs, one should ease the patient then fix it in a specific position, followed by placing a weight on the back of the head without any condition, and suck gently.
Then, place on the eye a bandage made from date palm fiber, sap, and frankincense, and tighten it above with many ribbons. The method of preparing the ribbons is to take soft, thin threads, fold each into four parts, and create many from them.
Then, place them one on top of the other as much as the eye needs, and tighten it with a strong cloth, and repeat the sucking process without any condition. Then, remove the weight, leaving the eye tight for a day and night.
If the bandage relaxes during that time, it should be tightened again, and then remove the bandage after a day and night as mentioned. If you see that the eye has returned to its place, otherwise, repeat the bandaging, ribbons, tightening, and sucking process until it returns.
Chapter XXI.
In amputating the limb.
If a hernia occurs in the abdominal wall, then it protrudes outside the abdomen like a grape and disfigures the human form, and you wish to cut it off, then proceed as I describe.
Insert a needle into the base of the hernia from below upwards, then insert another needle with a doubled thread from the opposite side and draw it through, leaving the first needle in place.
Then, cut the fold of the doubled thread and tie a portion of the hernia around the needle, pulling it tightly. Remove the needle and place a wet plaster of egg white over the wound, leaving it until the threads and hernia fall off. Then treat the wound to strengthen it.
Until the wound heals, tighten the hernia from all sides with a circle of cloth to promote healing. Then, use a thin scalpel to reach the depths of the eye, allowing the egg white moisture to drain, and lower the hernia, letting it rest until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Second.
On Treating Hemorrhoids.
This condition, known as the "coma," is merely a concentration of fluid in the eye similar to descending water but without it. The method of treatment involves having the patient sit on an upright chair and then holding their head with both hands from the sides.
You should move the patient until you observe the fluid flowing downward in the eye, then stabilize it so that it does not disappear. Light will then pass and the patient will be able to see objects as they were before. If the fluid does not flow downward, we know that it is not water; if it does not take the form mentioned, the treatment is incomplete.
If the above methods fail, place the patient between your hands and then take a thin scalpel to make a small cut above the cornea, where the sclera meets the cornea at the limbus, until the foreign matter is removed.
If the matter is expelled, wash the eye with hot water mixed with honey or water in which fennel seeds and honey have been boiled, then apply all other treatments until healing occurs.
Chapter Twenty-Three.
As we have discussed the types of water and their uses, choose the appropriate type for the treatment, explaining in detail. Then, position the patient between your hands, sitting them upright facing the light source, preferably near sunlight.
Secure and fasten the healthy eye, then raise the eyelid with your left hand if it is the watery eye (left eye), or with your right hand if it is the other eye (right eye).
Then place the end of the scalpel near the akrim (eyelid margin) with a sharp edge against the white part of the eye, on the side of the smaller corner of the eye, and push the scalpel firmly as you rotate it with your hand until it penetrates the white part of the eye, and you feel the scalpel reach something hollow.
The depth to which the scalpel goes should be equal to the distance from the cornea to the edge of the black part of the eye (the eyeliner). You will see the copper (presumably referring to a color or reflection) in the same way you see the eye due to the clarity of the corneal membrane. Then, move the scalpel upwards to the place where the water is.
Then press it down repeatedly. If water comes out, the patient will see what their vision has cleared and the scalpel in their eye. Then pause for a moment. If the water rises again, lower it a second time without removing the scalpel.
If it stabilizes and doesn't rise again, carefully remove the scalpel while twisting your hand slightly, then dissolve a small amount of pure salt in water and wash the eye from inside out. Finally, apply a moist cotton ball or cloth to the entire external surface of the eye.
Moisturize the eye with rose petal and white of egg, and bind it with a healthy eye. We and our contemporaries apply crushed cumin mixed with the white of an egg. If the point (of the instrument) does not enter the eye due to its hardness, for some people's eyes are very hard. One should take the instrument called the 'bayrid', whose image is shown here.
Punch only through the conjunctiva with this instrument, do not go too deep. Gently tap the point of the instrument onto the eye, then insert the instrument as mentioned. Upon completing the procedure, prepare a comfortable position for the patient to lie on their back in a dark room.
Avoid all movements and coughing. Make the patient's food soft to aid their condition. Do not move their head to the right or left at all. Keep the bandage in place until the third day, then remove it in that dark room and test their vision.
Show them objects, then re-bandage until the seventh day. Avoid doing this during treatment or after punching with your instrument, but instead, refrain from it until the water does not rise quickly due to intense staring.
If a hot tumor appears, unband the eye before the seventh day and treat it with something to alleviate the tumor. Once it subsides, gently release the patient's vision and place a veil over their face for several days in that dark room to help restore their eyesight.
It exits the house gradually and acts upon its causes, and know that in this art, the learner cannot do without observation multiple times before undertaking the work. I have been told by some Iraqis that he mentioned making a hollow puncture in Iraq that absorbs water.
I have never seen anyone in our country make this, nor have I read about it in any book of the first scholars, and it may be a recent invention. Here is an image depicting various types of punctures for those unfamiliar with them.
They are made particularly from copper, and their end has the same delicate shape, triangular with a sharp point.
Chapter Twenty-Four.
In the treatment of meat growths in the nose.
Different types of excess meat can grow in the nose, some resembling many-legged scorpions, and others may be cancerous, hard like stone, or soft and not discolored.
If the flesh is soft, neither malignant nor cancerous, the patient should sit facing the sun with their nostrils open, and you should insert a hook into this flesh and draw it out, then cut what you have reached using a delicate, sharp scalpel on one side.
Until you know that all the flesh has gone, if anything remains, you will not be able to cut it off. Remove it with one of the delicate instruments gently so as not to leave any behind, for if blood overcomes you or a hot tumor appears.
If it is confronted with what is necessary or was a malignant tumor, then act swiftly and remove it until the blood stops and all flesh is gone. Then, after cutting, pour into the nose a void or liquid, for if the nose opens and moisture passes through to the throat.
Know that he has healed, for if moisture does not pass as it should, know that inside there is flesh grown around the bones, and the instrument did not reach it with the cut. Then you should take a thread of linen slightly thick.
And tie many knots in it, leaving a space of a finger or less between each knot. The patient then inserts one end of the thread into his nose using a rod or what he can make similar to a plug, and pulls it until it reaches the nostrils.
It emerges in a loop, and often children in schools do this action many times. It is an easy matter for whoever desires it. Then gather the two ends of the thread: one that emerged from the mouth and the other remaining in the nose.
Then, use the knife to cut through the flesh along the stitches in the thread, until you know that the flesh has been severed by the stitches of the thread. Then remove the thread and place it inside the nose after cleaning the blood with a cotton swab soaked in the Egyptian ointment, do this for three days or more.
Until the ointment consumes all that remains of the flesh, then it will become the last thing in the nose a lead pipe for several days until it heals. If treatment is needed, use it to dry.
And this is an image of the syringe that releases oils and medicines into the nose:
Place a small, open sponge made of silver or copper over the opening of the tube and its channel as well.
And if you prefer, make the tube closed like a pipe and the sponge of the syringe flat.
It has a handle at the end, as you can see, to hold it when heating oil or any other extracts or flowing substances.
Chapter XXV.
On the warts growing at the tip of the nose.
A benign tumor often grows at the tip of the nose, increasing in size over time until it becomes disfiguring.
Therefore, it should be cut off as soon as it appears and all of it removed, then either cauterized or treated with a burning medicine that acts like cauterization. If it cannot be cut off before it grows large, examine it; if it has become hard and stone-like, it is insensitive to pain.
Do not treat it with iron, for it is a cancerous tumor, and I have often seen that cutting out this tumor causes great harm to the patient, even if the tumor is soft to the touch and not painful. If cutting it all out is possible, do so. Then induce vomiting in the patient and cut it out without hesitation or delay, and treat the wound with a drying and contracting agent until healing occurs.
Chapter Twenty-Six.
In stitching the nose, lips, and ear. If the connection between them becomes detached from a wound or similar injury, know that once the attachment is broken in any of these cartilages, little benefit will be gained from treatment, except for some people.
When dealing with any of these conditions, examine if the wound is fresh and still has its blood; then close it by stitching the edges together and treat it until it heals. If the connection between the edges has separated and each gap is a separate wound, you should peel back each gap to the depth of the visible skin until it bleeds.
Then, close the edges with stitching and tighten it, and apply a mixture of myrrh and frankincense powder on top, followed by a layer of sealing ointment made from olive oil or any other binding ointment. Leave it for two or three days before untying it.
Change the dressing and let it be until the stitches dissolve on their own, then treat the wound with ointment until it heals. The method of closing a gap involves using needles to close it as described in the treatment of abdominal wounds, or using thread as mentioned earlier.
Chapter Twenty-Seventh.
On removing knots that appear on the edges.
Many people may present with small, hard lumps inside their lips, some resembling a pimple and others smaller or larger. You should turn the lip inside out, make a cut on each lump, and use a hook to remove it.
Cut through it from all sides, then fill the wound after cutting with powdered zaj (a traditional material) until the bleeding stops, and rinse with vinegar and salt. Treat the wounds with compresses that contract until they heal.
Chapter 28
In cutting off excess flesh in the gum.
Often, excess flesh grows on the gums, which the ancients call 'abuls.' It should be removed with a hook or a scraper, cutting it at its base, allowing the bleeding to stop, and then applying powdered zaj (a traditional material) to the wound.
If the excess flesh, after treatment with a drying, contracting substance, returns, cut it again and cauterize it, for it will not return after cauterization.
Chapter 29
On the extraction of teeth with iron.
There may gather on the surfaces of teeth, both within and without, and between the gums, coarse, unpleasant scales that turn black, yellow, or green, causing damage to the gums and disfigurement of the teeth.
It is necessary that the patient should sit between your hands and head on your lap, and extract the tooth or root in which you have observed scales and something resembling sand, so that nothing remains of it, and do the same for blackness, greenness, yellowness, and other colors until it is purified.
If the initial cleaning does not remove it, repeat the process on a daily basis for several days until you achieve your desired result. Know that a tooth may require different types of tools with various shapes, depending on what presents itself to your work.
The tool used to clean a tooth internally is different from the one used externally, and also differs from that used between teeth, each with its own shape. You should have all these cleaning tools prepared.
Chapter Thirty
In the removal of teeth.
You should treat the tooth against its pain with all means and not hesitate to remove it if necessary, for it is a noble substance; even if removal is not an option, every effort should be made to alleviate the pain.
If the patient is determined to have a tooth removed, it should be done with caution until the painful tooth heals. The patient often deceives himself, believing that the pain is in a healthy tooth, so he extracts it, but the pain does not cease until the diseased tooth is removed, as we have seen many times from the actions of barbers.
If the painful tooth is indeed the one you are dealing with, then you should cut around it with a scalpel that has some force, in order to loosen the gum from all sides, and then move it slightly with your fingers or with delicate pliers until it becomes loose.
Then, firmly grip the tooth with both molars, placing the patient's head between your knees to secure it, and pull the tooth straight without breaking it. If it does not come out, take one of the tools and insert it from under the tooth on all sides gently and continue moving it as you initially did.
If the tooth is hollow or decayed, you should fill the hole with a cloth and tightly seal it with a thin rod to prevent it from falling apart during your grip on it with the pliers. You must also cut around the gum with precision on all sides.
Be careful not to break it, leaving behind some of the tooth, which could cause even greater suffering for the patient than the original pain. Do not follow the actions of ignorant barbers who extract teeth without using the techniques we have described.
Often, great harm befalls people, and among the least of these is a broken tooth, leaving all or some of its roots intact. Sometimes, it pulls out parts of the jawbone, as we have seen many times before. After extraction, rinse with a drink or vinegar and salt. If bleeding occurs, which often does, immediately crush some glass and pack it into the wound.
If the glass does not help, use a delicate hook, initially moving the tooth. It should have a long shank and a short handle, thick enough to avoid bending when you grasp it.
They should be thick-handled, as you see, to avoid giving way or bending when grasped. The ends should be short, and they should be made of strong iron or steel, with teeth at the end that interlock for a secure, firm grip.
The ends can also be shaped like scissors, which provides a strong and secure grip.
Chapter XXXI.
On extracting tooth roots and removing broken jawbone.
If, when extracting a tooth, the root remains and is broken, one should place a cotton ball soaked in lard on the site for one or two days until it relaxes, then insert forceps or pliers. Which resemble the edges of the mouth of a bird called a بلرجة (blerga), and this is an image of the forceps:
If the forceps do not come out easily, you should drill into the root and expose all the tissue with a scalpel, then insert a small lever-like tool, as depicted below:
Short-ended and slightly thick, not too slender, otherwise it may break. If the root comes out with this, otherwise use these other tools, the first of which has a triangular end with some thickness:
Another delicate triangular image:
We can also use this tool with two prongs, as depicted below:
And with other tools and instruments mentioned in the inventory of teeth, we can also use this tool resembling a large hook, as depicted below:
A curved end with a slight thickness to prevent breakage and ensure it is well-irrigated; know that there are many types of dental instruments, as well as other tools, which cannot be enumerated. A skilled surgeon may invent instruments tailored to specific needs, guided by experience and the nature of the work and diseases themselves.
Because there are diseases for which the earliest practitioners did not have instruments suitable to their varieties; if a bone from the jaw or any bone in the mouth breaks or decays, inspect it in its place using one of these instruments or forceps designed for extracting roots.
And we use the following instruments (as illustrated):
It has a slight thickness to grip the bone firmly, preventing it from slipping out until the bone is extracted; we treat the site with suitable medications, if the bone is slightly rotten, remove the rot and blackness until it is clean, then treat it until it heals.
Chapter 32.
In the extraction of teeth that have grown crooked among others.
If teeth grow in a position other than their natural place, it distorts the appearance, especially if this occurs in women or slaves; one should examine it, for if a tooth has grown behind another, it must be extracted.
If it cannot be removed nor returned to its place, and it is attached to another tooth, cut it off with this instrument, which has this form:
It resembles a small beak, and it should be made of sharp Indian steel with a very pointed end. It is used to cut through teeth in many cases due to their hardness, and to avoid damaging other teeth. If it grows back firmly, sharpen it with an Indian tool, which has this form:
It is entirely made of India, and its handle has a very fine engraving, similar to the tool used for making needles. You use it to gently sharpen the tooth over many days to avoid damaging it and causing it to fall out. Then, you smooth it with other rasps.
If a tooth has broken off and hurts the tongue when speaking, it should also be sharpened until the roughness of the break goes away, so it becomes smooth and does not hurt the tongue or disrupt speech.
Chapter XXXIII.
In the interweaving of mobile teeth with silver or gold threads.
If the front teeth become loose due to a blow or fall, and the patient cannot bite into anything edible without causing them to fall out, having tried various constricting medications with no success.
The technique involves tying a gold or silver thread, with gold being preferable as silver tarnishes and corrodes over time, while gold remains unchanged. The thread should be of medium thickness and strong enough to fit between the teeth.
The imaging of the mesh involves taking the thread and inserting its bend between the correct teeth, then weaving both ends of the thread between the mobile teeth, one or more, until the weaving reaches the correct tooth on the other side.
Then, weave the thread back to the starting point, gently but firmly holding your hand to ensure no movement, and tighten the thread at the roots of the teeth to prevent it from slipping. Cut off any excess thread with scissors, gather it, twist it with a twister, and hide it between the correct and mobile teeth.
To prevent harm to the tongue, leave it thus tightened, and if it unravels or breaks, re-tighten it with another thread, allowing it to endure for all time. This is a depiction of teeth, showing the mesh in two correct and two mobile teeth, as you can see: .
A tooth, or even both, may return to its original position after falling out and form a mesh as described, remaining in place. This can only be achieved by an experienced dentist, who might also carve a bone from a cow into a shape resembling a tooth and place it in the missing tooth's spot. And it is tightened as we have said, so it remains and enjoys that state.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
In cutting the ligament that is exposed under the tongue, it prevents speech.
This ligament that is exposed under the tongue may either be natural, born with a person, or incidental, from a wound that has healed.
The procedure involves opening the patient's mouth and head in your lap, raising their tongue, and then cutting the nerve ligament running across it until the tongue is freed from its grasp. If there is some rigidity or complexity due to scarring from a wound, insert a hook and split it along its length until the ligament breaks and the knot unties.
Be cautious that the cut does not go too deep into the flesh, as it might sever an artery and cause bleeding. After making the cut, rinse with rosewater or a mixture of vinegar and cold water, then place a piece of cotton under the tongue for the patient to hold each night.
To prevent it from healing over, if there is bleeding, apply powdered glass to the area. If blood persists, use a lentil-shaped iron to suction the wound. Then treat it with all other treatments until it heals.
Chapter Thirty-Five
On the removal of the toad that forms under the tongue.
Under the tongue, a tumor may form resembling a small toad, impeding the natural function of the tongue and potentially even filling the mouth with a hard mass. The treatment involves opening the patient's mouth facing the sun and examining the tumor.
If you see it as a black, solid mass that the patient cannot feel, then do not interfere, for it is cancer. However, if it leans towards being white and contains moisture, insert a hook in it and cut it with a delicate knife from all sides to extract it.
If blood interferes with your work, sprinkle powdered glass on it to stop the bleeding, then continue your work to completely remove the tumor, and finally rinse your mouth with vinegar and salt.
Then treat it with all other appropriate treatments until it heals.
Chapter Thirty-Six
In the treatment of tonsillar tumours.
And what grows in the throat from other tumours may present itself as glands within the throat that resemble those that appear outside, called tonsils. If you treat them with what has been mentioned in the classification, they do not heal.
Examine it; if the tumour is solid, of a dark colour and slightly sensitive, do not treat it with iron. If it is red in colour and its origin is thick, do not also treat it with iron to avoid blood loss. Rather, leave it until it ripens, either to be extracted or to burst on its own.
And if it is white in colour, round, and its origin is thin, this is what should be cut off. The action involves looking before acting to see if its hot tumour has subsided completely or partially.
Then, sit the patient facing the sun with their head in your lap. Open their mouth and have a servant, holding an instrument in your hands, press their tongue down to the bottom as shown in this image:
Make an instrument of silver or brass, thin like a knife. When you press the tongue down with it and examine the tumour, take a hook and pierce it into the tonsil, drawing it out as far as possible without pulling any surrounding tissue.
Then, cut them with an instrument that resembles a pair of scissors, but both ends are curved and sharp, made from Indian iron or Damascus steel.
If this instrument is not available, then cut them with a scalpel that looks like this:
Sharp on one side and dull on the other, so after cutting one of the tonsils, cut the other in the same manner, then rinse the patient with cold water or vinegar and water.
If bleeding occurs, gargle with boiling water mixed with pomegranate rinds or assafoetida or similar astringents until the bleeding stops, then treat it as mentioned for cutting the tonsils. After that, other growths in the throat, such as additional tonsil-like masses, should be cut in the same manner.
I treated a woman with a tumor that had grown inside her throat, affecting her ability to swallow and breathe, almost blocking the passage. The tumor was insensitive and prevented her from eating or drinking water.
She was close to death, had she not been treated immediately. The tumor had grown two branches extending out of her nostrils. I quickly inserted a hook into one branch and pulled it out, removing a suitable piece.
Then I cut it where I reached it through the nose hole, and I did the same for the other nostril, then I opened her mouth and pressed her tongue, then I inserted the hook into the tumor itself, then I cut some of it off, and only a small amount of blood came out.
Then the woman's throat opened, and she immediately drank water, then ate food, and we continued to cut the tumor repeatedly for a long time, but it kept growing back each time until it affected me and her.
I tried and squeezed the tumor inside the throat as much as I could, and it stopped growing. Then I left the place, not knowing what God had done to her after me.
Chapter Seventy-Three.
On Cutting the Soft Palate Tumor.
If a tumor descends to the soft palate and swells, becoming white, elongated, and rectangular, it is called a "column." If it is thick at the bottom and round, it is called a "grapes." If treated as described in the previous sections, but without effect.
I observed that the hot tumor had subsided and she was thinner, so it should be cut. If it is rounded, aggregated, and not very long, and has a bloody or purplish color, or if it is insensitive, one should avoid cutting it.
In it there lies a danger for the patient, so when you see it in the mentioned form, white and long, the patient should be seated facing the sun, and his tongue pressed with the instrument described earlier, then the hook is inserted into the grape.
And you pull it down and cut it with one of the instruments mentioned in cutting the tonsils, and you should only cut what exceeds the natural state without excess, for if you cut more, you will harm the voice and speech.
Then, after the cutting, you use what we described in cutting the tonsils and treat it until it heals. If the patient refuses to have it cut, you should use a trick to burn it without fear or caution, and the purpose of burning is with a sharp medicine, which is to place the patient's head on your lap.
Then, you press his tongue with the instrument mentioned, and take some of the sharp water described in the door of burning, which is not extinguished, and mix it with non-extinguished lime until it is neither too thick nor too thin, and fill the hollows of this tool with it. And this is its form:
The end of it, which holds the medicine, has a hollow shape like a spoon, and you place the instrument with the medicine on the uvula itself, and the patient lies on his side, allowing saliva to flow from his mouth into his throat, so that nothing descends to harm him.
Then grasp the medicine in your hand and squeeze it on the tongue for half an hour until you see it turn black and the sting of the medicine cease. If you wish, take a cotton ball, wrap it around the end of a rod, soak it in the medicine.
Insert the rod with the cotton ball into the tube from above until the cotton ball sticks to the tongue. Repeat this process as many times as you need to achieve the desired effect of pressing the grape. Then leave it, and it will wilt and fall off after three or four days. If you need to apply the medicine again, do so.
After pressing, wipe around the grape with a cotton ball soaked in lard and dry it, then rinse with cold water. Treat externally with bandages and internally with gargles until it heals. This type of treatment is safer than cutting and removes fear.
The tongue can also be treated with milder methods than pressing and cutting, using incense as follows: Take fennel, rue, thyme, sage, chamomile, hibiscus, and other herbs, either all of them or some, and put them in a pot, submerging them in vinegar.
Boil it in a pot sealed with clay, and on top of the lid, place a hollow instrument made of silver or copper with a hole in the middle.
The end of the pipe that contains the sponge should be inserted into the patient's mouth until the steam rises to the pharynx through the tube, allowing the pharynx to enjoy the moisture. Repeat this process several times until it becomes limp, and beware of performing this treatment at the onset of the tumor.
If the tumor increases, it is often because of its hot nature; in such cases, this treatment should be applied when the tumor has subsided. If you do not have the pipe, take a tube and attach a thin egg shell to its end to avoid burning the patient's mouth.
Because the egg shell prevents the hot steam from burning the mouth, this is one of the good treatments, safe and effective.
Chapter Thirty-Eight.
On removing thorns and other objects lodged in the throat.
Often, the throat becomes lodged with a bone, fish spine, or other object. In such cases, one should remove whatever is visible after pressing the tongue with a tool against the roof of the mouth.
To examine what is in the throat, and if something is not visible but hidden, it is advisable to make the patient vomit before their food is digested in the stomach. Perhaps the lodged object will emerge through vomiting or the patient might swallow a piece of lint or a small foreign body.
If he swallows a bite of dry bread or takes a piece of soft sea sponge, ties it with a thread, and then swallows it, when it reaches the place of the foreign body, pull the thread quickly. Do this several times.
Often, the thorn or bone becomes stuck and does not come out as mentioned. If it does not come out, use a tool made of lead in this shape:
It should be slightly thicker than a rod, with a curved end that the patient gently inserts into a ring while raising his head and being careful not to touch his throat to avoid coughing, or the doctor can insert it with his hand.
And it is better for the patient to insert it, knowing the location of the embedded object, and pushing down or pulling his hand with the tool upwards, as much as possible, until it comes out.
Chapter Thirty-Nine.
In removing the lodged tick from the throat.
If the tick is treated with the mentioned remedies and does not improve, then look at the patient's throat in sunlight after pressing his tongue with the tool described to you.
If you notice a worm, draw it out with a small hook or a delicate, tight twig. If that does not work, take an empty tube and insert it into the patient's throat near the worm, then insert a heated iron into the tube.
Do this several times, and the patient should abstain from water for the entire day. Then, take a jug filled with cold water and open the patient's mouth, allowing them to rinse their mouth with the water without swallowing any of it. Occasionally, the patient should move their hand to stir the water.
If the worm senses the water, it will retreat to a safe place. If it does not exit as described, then dry the throat with the instrument used for drying the palate, repeating this process several times until it falls.
The method for using the inhaler involves taking a container with hot coals from a fire, covered by a lid with a small hole in the center. Attach the end of the inhaler to this hole and place the other end near the patient's mouth, closing their mouth to prevent the smoke from escaping until they are certain the smoke has reached their throat.
If the worm retreats to a safe place, repeat the process with the inhaler until it falls. The patient should endure thirst and eat salt and garlic while avoiding water; this treatment will undoubtedly force the worm out using these means. Here is an illustration of a device used to attract the worm from the throat if spotted.
They resemble hooks as you see, except for this bend that enters the throat, and their ends resemble a bird's beak with the roughness of a file. If you press something with them, they do not release it.
Another instrument is used to compress the tongue, which is a wide ring of iron that fits across the mouth above the tongue, entering the mouth upright. It keeps the mouth open against the will of the patient and he cannot remove it at all until it is moved aside.
The instrument that opens the mouth to this exact measure is characterized by being a wide ring of iron, designed to fit across the mouth above the tongue, entering upright and maintaining the mouth in an open state against the patient's will.
Chapter Forty
It is used to facilitate speech in those with tumors or lesions, making incisions in them.
The tumors are numerous and varied, each with its specific characteristics as mentioned in this book. They differ in their shells (بطّ) and incisions (شقّ) based on two factors: the nature of the tumor itself and the substances it contains.
The second type is determined by the locations where they occur in the body, as a tumor in the head differs from one in the abdomen, and a tumor in a hot spot (likely referring to a specific area of inflammation or infection) varies from one in a joint, each with its own rules regarding treatment.
Some tumors should not be drained until the pus within them has matured and reached its full potential, while others should be drained even in their raw, unripened state, such as those close to joints.
Because if a tumor occurs near a joint and its condition persists until it putrefies the surrounding area, it may damage the ligaments or nerves of that joint, leading to dysfunction of the member or the tumor might be close to a vital organ.
Because if you delay draining it until the pus matures, you will harm that vital member or it might be close to the anus, and you should drain the tumor while it is still raw and unripened, near the anus, lest the pus corrupt the tissue inside the anus, making it a fistula.
It becomes, in a sense, incurable, and you should know the time to drain tumors that have fully ripened when the pain subsides, fever dissipates, redness and pulsation decrease, the head of the tumor and other symptoms become apparent.
You should drain it at the lowest possible point of the tumor if feasible, to facilitate the flow of pus downwards, or in the thinnest part of the tumor with the most distinct ridge, and the drainage should be done along the length of the body if the tumors are located around the hands and feet.
And the locations of muscles, tendons, nerves, and arteries, in general, in all flat areas with no curvature, and if they are curved, then press them according to that area. If the tumor is in the fleshy parts, it is better to leave its pressure.
Until the pus has fully formed as we have mentioned, if you press it before that, the discharge of pus will be prolonged, causing great harm and filth, and its opening may harden, and some tumors may be pressed across the body's width when necessary or according to the needs of the organ.
For small tumors, use a single pressure, and for large tumors, a wide pressure or several cuts according to the size of the tumor, and some tumors may require the skin to be flapped and cut if they have become like a cloth.
It becomes, to some extent, dead as is often seen in many abscesses and cysts, some of which are incised with a three-angled cut, and others have part of them cut off like the shape of an olive, the typical Arab tumor.
Some may require a circular or crescent-shaped cut, or other cuts, and for tumors without a head, like smooth, flat ones, only simple pressure should be applied. If the tumor is large and has collected pus over time and you press it, do not rush so as to expel all the pus at once.
Not only should you drain some of it, but also compress the tumor and repeat this process gradually until all the pus is drained.
In particular, if the patient is weak or a pregnant woman, or a young child, or an elderly person, the animal spirit (vital force) is often lost with each discharge of pus, and the patient might die without your knowledge. Therefore, be extremely careful in this matter.
After draining these tumors, you should clean the wound and examine it. If the tumor wound is small or the split is simple, use old linen or cotton thread. But if the tumor is large and the splits are numerous, consider other methods.
You should insert a thread in each split, connecting them together, and if the tumor has torn off some skin or formed an ulcer, stuff it with old cotton or hempen hair without moisture and secure it until the third day.
Then remove it and treat the wound with appropriate ointments until it heals. If bleeding occurs during the treatment, use cold water and vinegar. Soak a piece of old linen in it and press it on the bleeding area several times.
If the bleeding persists, you must employ the measures and treatments we have described in various chapters of this book, depending on the location and nature of the tumor. If it is winter and the area around the tumor has many nerves, soak bandages in a hot drink and oil.
And place it in the right position. If it is summer and the affected area is hot, then the compresses should be soaked in water and oil, or a drink and oil, all of which should be cold, so that on the third day, as we have said, you should dissolve and clean the swelling.
And in its treatment, you use things similar to it until healing occurs; this is what you need to know about the treatment of tumors in general. As for the detailed method, each tumor has been described with a summary of how to treat it.
Chapter Forty-One
On the incision of tumors that occur on the scalp.
On the scalp, small tumors may occur, which are of the type known as "sclera," containing bags with their own specific conditions, similar to a chicken's egg. There are many types, some fatty and others containing a liquid resembling mud.
Some contain moisture resembling butter, curds, or soup, and others are solid and hard. All of these pose no danger when incised and removed, unless a vessel (artery) is encountered during the incision.
The procedure for incising them is to first probe with an instrument, which will be described below (called a "diss"), to determine what they contain. If they contain moisture, make a longitudinal cut along the tumor, as shown in the figure: a simple, straight cut.
Begin by making an incision from line ~B~ to line ~C~. If the moisture has dissipated, peel and completely cut the sac that contained it, leaving no remnant whatsoever; for often, if any part remains, it will recur.
Then, dip a cotton ball in pure honey if available, or in salt water, and fill the wound with it, leaving it for another day; for it will consume what remains of the sac. Then, repeat the process with the cotton ball in pure honey a second and third time if necessary.
Until you are certain that no part of the sac remains, then treat the wound with ointments until it heals. If the swelling contains a fatty substance, open it in this manner:
Make a cross-shaped incision and pry open the wound with forceps, peeling it from all sides. Strive to remove the peritoneum that contains it; if you encounter a blood vessel, follow the described steps after addressing it. Similarly, act in the case of a hardened mass from the incision.
The treatment is the same as mentioned, and the incision on a hardened mass is easier because it contains little blood or moisture. Some of these masses in the head may have no moisture at all, for I have opened a mass in my own body that was devoid of any fluid.
The head of an old woman: I found the tumor like a hard stone, rough and white, unable to break it, even if someone threw it, it would only crack the skull, and this type was different from other tumors that occur in the head, like those that appear on the heads of children.
At the bases of the ears, make a simple incision through them all and turn their flaps downwards to facilitate the flow of material downwards, then treat them with the appropriate treatment.
Chapter Forty-Two
In the incision on pigs, these tumors often occur in the neck, under the arms, and in the groin, and they can also appear on other parts of the body. Some may be single, while others are numerous and some may arise from one another.
Each pig has a sac of its own, similar to the sacs in fruits, and tumors within this sac, as described for head tumors. There are numerous types: some are hard, others contain fluids, and some are malignant and do not respond to treatment.
I have not seen a good case upon examination, as it appears similar to skin in color and moves in all directions, not attached to the neck's nerve, tendon, or artery, and is not sunken. It is necessary to make a simple incision from above to below the body, in this manner, following the line from ~J~ to ~B~:
You should peel it from all sides and expand the skin flaps with a hook or two or many hooks, as needed, as we mentioned regarding tumors of the head. Gradually extract them, leaving a small portion on the neck, taking care not to cut any blood vessels or nerves. The scalpel should not be too sharp.
To prevent excessive cutting or causing the patient anxiety, do not cut what is not necessary. If you cut a blood vessel or artery and are hindered from completing the task, apply powdered ash or some flour to the wound to stop the bleeding.
Secure the wound and leave it until the swelling subsides and the wound relaxes, and if it starts to putrefy, then the blood flow will cease. Then return to your work until finished. Afterward, inspect with your index finger to see if any remaining smaller clots or debris are present, and remove them carefully.
If there is a large vein in the root of the clot, do not cut off the clot from its root, but rather tie it tightly with a doubled thread and leave it until it falls out on its own without causing harm. Then fill the wound with old cotton that has been soaked in Egyptian ointment and treat it.
If the whole pig is cut, one should gather the edges of the wound and sew it up immediately, realizing that no remnant has been left behind. If there is a remnant due to the pig's bone, you shall remove it.
One should intend to cut at its root and foundation, and use stitching as mentioned, and for pigs that contain humidities, cauterize them with a simple bandage where the place of their healing appears, and make the bandage from what is below, as we have said.
Then, use a twist with Egyptian ointment or similar to consume any remaining decay. Once you see the wound has healed, treat it with flesh-regenerating ointments until it is cured.
Chapter 34.
In the incision of the throat, regarding a tumor occurring within the pharynx.
The earliest mentions described this incision in the throat, but I have not seen anyone perform it in our country, and this is the pattern of their speech. As for those with strangulation, they should avoid the incision in the throat, as it is useless to them.
In order that all the veins and lungs are injured, and for those with a hot tumor in the mouth, throat, or tonsils, if there is no illness in the trachea, it is necessary to use the incision in the throat to escape the damage that occurs due to strangulation.
If we wish to do so, we should make a cut in the throat below three circles of the trachea or four small cuts across the width between two circles, to the extent that the cut is in the peritoneum, not in the cartilage. This position corresponds to the cut.
Since it is devoid of flesh and the blood vessels are distant, if the healer is timid, he should pull the throat skin with a hook and cut the skin until he reaches the trachea, avoiding blood vessels if he sees any.
Then he should cut the peritoneum that we described, and he can identify the cut in the trachea from the mucus that comes out of it, along with the feeling of a stab and leaving the wound open for a while. If the time when he was afraid of suffocation passes, he should close the edges of the wound with skin.
He should operate only on the cartilage, then use medications that promote tissue regeneration until healing occurs. According to the author of this text, when they see that a patient's throat is blocked by one of these mentioned tumors, this is what all the aforementioned steps are for.
When a patient is on the brink of death, and he himself feels that he cannot breathe, they should operate by making a cut in the throat so that the patient can breathe through the wound, thus saving him from death. They are instructed to leave the wound open until the illness passes, which usually takes three days or so.
When then they ordered the wound to be stitched and treated until it healed, which I myself witnessed: a servant took a knife and cut through part of her lung, so she was called for treatment, and I found her gasping as if she were being slaughtered, so I exposed the wound.
I found the blood that emerged from the wound was thin, confirming she had not cut an artery or vein, and air was exiting from the wound, so I cleaned it and treated it until it healed, without any further harm to the servant aside from a slight sound.
After several days, she recovered to her best condition, so from here we say that cutting the throat poses no danger.
Chapter Forty-Four.
In the incision on the tumor that appears in the throat from the outside and is called the phlegm of the throat.
This tumor, called the phlegm of the throat, is a large tumor resembling the color of the body. It is frequent in women and has two types.
It can either be natural or accidental. The natural one is beyond control, but the accidental one has two types: one similar to fatty tissue and the other resembling a tumor that forms from the complexing of an artery, and its incision poses danger. It is not appropriate to treat them with iron at all, except for what is small if you explore and examine it with a probe, and you find that it resembles fatty tissue and is not attached to any vessels, then cut it as you would cut merchandise. If it is in a sac, remove the contents; otherwise, carefully inspect all of it and then treat the area as necessary.
Chapter Forty-Five
On Cutting According to Types of Merchandise.
Merchandise comes in many varieties, and all types have been mentioned in the classification. Here, it is essential to distinguish between merchandise and a discharge (or excretion), which is complex. I say that a discharge is characterized by heat, fever, and severe pain until the excess fluid subsides. When the discharge (or excretion) completes its process, the fever and severity subside. In contrast, merchandise does not exhibit heat, fever, or pain. It is enclosed in a sac-like membrane, which serves as its special casing, and resembles the color of the body. Its initial appearance is similar to a pimple, and it develops into a blister-like form, becoming larger or smaller in size.
They are of two types: either fatty or containing moisture. The colors of the moisture vary, as mentioned in the classification. When treating merchandise, it is essential to first explore and examine it with a tool called a probe, as depicted in the image following this text.
Determine the size of the tumor, then remove the probe and observe what comes out. If it is a liquid secretion, of any color, cut it open as I have mentioned for other tumors. If no liquid comes out after the probe, know that it is fatty.
Make a cross-cut on it as I have taught you, hang it with pincers and carefully peel the skin from all sides. If possible, preserve the bag and remove it intact with the goods.
If the bag tears while working and you cannot remove it intact, this often happens, so cut it into pieces until nothing remains, for if any part is left, whether small or large, the goods will be affected by it.
If you are unable to remove it and only a small part remains, cut the wound with some sharp, edible particles, tighten the wound, and place something that soothes the hot tumor on top. Treat it with all other remedies until it heals, and if the goods are large, mark its edges and treat it with what binds.
If you encounter a pulsating or non-pulsating vein and bleeding occurs, immediately cut the area with powdered glass and leave it tight for two or three days until the wound putrefies and the blood fever subsides, then proceed to remove what remains of the goods.

In the Figures of Instruments
Which operate in the fissure and cavity, images of scalpels, of three types: large, medium, and small.
Image of a large scalpel:
Image of a medium scalpel:
Image of a small scalpel:
Made of steel, square-ended, tightly woven to quickly penetrate tumors. These are the images of the drill, called the blade, and they are also of three types: large, medium, and small. Image of a large drill:
Image of a medium drill:
Image of a small drill:
Suitable for examining tumors, surgical incisions, sinuses, and hidden spaces to determine what is inside, such as bones or other objects. They are made round, polished, smooth, like a file, from copper, bronze, iron, or silver, but the best are those made of bronze (spade-like).
Surgical Drills Can Also Be Made from Black Lead and Used to Puncture Diverticula with Curvature, So That They Bend Along With That Curvature, and They Too Come in Three Types: Long, Medium, and Short.
According to the depth of each diverticulum, making its thickness according to the capacity of the diverticulum and its narrowing. Image of a large lead drill:
Image of a medium lead drill:
Image of a small lead drill:
Images of forceps, with many types: simple ones with one claw, and three types each of large, medium, and small forceps; blind forceps, with three types; forceps with two claws, also in three types; and curved forceps with two claws, again in three varieties. They come in three types, and among them are forceps with three claws, also in three types. All these types require specific uses; image of a large simple forcep: Image of a medium simple forcep: Image of a small simple forcep:

And here are images of scalpels used to incise and remove tissues, which come in three types: large, medium, and small. Image of a large scalpel.
Image of a medium scalpel.
Image of a Small Scalpel:
The blades used for incisions are limited in number, while the other edges are unlimited, and they have been designed to assist in removing skin without cutting into blood vessels or nerves. They are also intended to provide the patient with some relief from the discomfort caused by removing a growth.
And here are the images of the knives, which come in three types: large, medium, and small. Image of a large knife:
It is made of semi-hard copper, used for scraping and having a blade hidden within its head, resembling the beak of a bird, which can be extended in and out as desired.
Images of the scalpels used to remove tumors, which are placed between the fingers and cannot be felt by the patient. They come in three types: large, medium, and small. Image of a large scalpel:
Images of the bleeding cutters, which have three types because some are large, others medium, and others small, Image of the large hemostat:
These hemostats are made of brass or rounded iron, slightly longer than they are wide, and must be of various sizes in your possession, large and small, to cut through blood quickly when necessary, and when medicine is not readily available.
However, they should not be used to cut through blood everywhere on the body, but only in fleshy places such as the muscles of the leg, thigh, arm, breast, abdomen, and groin, and other similar fatty parts.
And you can make other small tools from them that resemble pistachio shells, as shown in this image:
These can be used to cut through blood if it bleeds from a phlebotomy site or when cutting a vein or artery, and they can also be made round as shown in this image:
Chapter LXXIV.
In the treatment of men's breasts.
Which, resembling the breast of women, may become swollen in some people at the age of puberty, even resembling the breast of a woman, and this causes an unsightly lump, then he who dislikes it should make a crescent-shaped incision on the breast.
From line ~B~ to line ~C~. Then remove all the fat, and fill the wound with a salve of salt, then close the edges of the wound with stitching and treat it until it heals, for if the breast leans downward and relaxes due to its bone structure, as it does in women.
Then one should make two crescent-shaped incisions on its upper sides, connecting at their ends, so that the larger line encircles the smaller as shown. From line ~B~ to line ~C~, then peel the skin between the incisions, remove the fat, and use the stitching, staples, and any other treatment required until it heals.
If you fail to remove what needs to be cut in order to alleviate the patient's distress or prevent blood loss, then you should pack the wound with cotton soaked in a consumable ointment and leave it until the remaining fat is consumed, after which you should treat it until it heals.
Chapter LXXIV
In cases of tumours under the arm.
These tumours that occur under the arm are of a pig-like consistency contained within a sac, and some contain moistures. As such, those containing moistures should be incised in an semicircular fashion, as illustrated.
From line ~B~ to line ~C~, once all the contents of the tumour have been expelled, pack it tightly with old cotton and leave it until the following day, after which you should remove the cotton.
Treat it with a suitable ointment until it heals. If the tumour is of the pig-like variety, make an incision as we have described for pig tumours. If the wound persists and pus forms, use cauterization as we have previously mentioned.
Chapter XLIX
In the incision of the tumor that is exposed by the artery or vein, called aneurysm.
If the artery is injured and the skin above it heals, a tumor often develops from this, as well as a bulge and swelling in the vein.
The signs by which it is known whether the tumor and swelling are from an artery or a vein: if it is from an artery, the tumor is rectangular and located deep in the body, and if you press the tumor with your finger, you can feel a clicking sensation.
And the one that is from a vein, the tumor is round on the surface of the body; the incision on these tumors is dangerous, especially those in the armpit, groin, and neck, and in many places on the body, and they can be very large, so you should avoid treating them with iron.
And what was from them in the limbs or head, you should avoid; for what was a bulge of an artery, make an incision in the skin longitudinally, then open the wound with forceps, and then remove the artery from the adhesions.
Until it is exposed, then insert an needle under it and penetrate it to the other side, tighten the artery with a doubled thread at two points, as I told you about the arteries in the temple, then use a scalpel to strike the place between the ligatures until all the blood comes out.
The tumour dissolves, then the treatment that produces pus is employed until the bands fall off, after which it is treated with suitable ointments until healing occurs.
If the tumour is located next to a vein, you should grasp as much of the tumour with your hand as possible, along with the skin, then insert an needle from below the site where you are holding, and pass it through while containing a doubled thread within until you emerge from the opposite side. Then, tie it well to the tumour as I have mentioned to you in tying the grape from both sides with the ends of the thread. If you fear that the threads may unravel, then insert another needle with a new thread beneath the entire tumour at the intersection of the first needle.
Pull on your threads in four places, then make an incision in the middle of the tumour. Once what is inside comes out, cut away any excess skin and leave what was attached. Then apply a dressing that has been soaked in a mixture of wine and oil. Then employ the treatment involving twisting and ointments until healing occurs.
Chapter Fifty.
On tumours that appear due to nerve twisting.
As the tumor appears in the artery and vein, so it appears in the nerve if it is struck or occurs due to excessive fatigue or similar, and this is most common in the wrists and ankles.
In every location where a joint moves, there is a firm tumor that resembles the color of the rest of the body. In most cases, it does not cause pain, and if pressed firmly, the patient feels a sensation similar to numbness. The tumor is not typically located deep within the body.
Instead, it is located beneath the skin and moves in all directions, neither going forward nor backward. As for what is found in joints, it should not be treated with iron, as it may cause permanent damage. And as for what is found in the head or forehead, it should not be treated with iron either.
Make a cut in the skin with a scalpel. If the tumor is small, use a dissector to remove it from its origin; if large, hang it on a hook and peel it off, then remove it entirely and sew up the wound until it heals.
Chapter Fifty
On cutting the warts that occur on the abdomen.
They may occur frequently in some people on their abdomens and other parts of their bodies, known as warts that resemble mushrooms due to their thin base and thick head. Their outer layers may split, and they can range from small to very large in size.
And I observed a man with two growths in his abdomen, similar to mushrooms, with no discernible difference between them; their bases were thin and white. Their lips had turned inwards and they were constantly exuding moisture. So I cut them off, weighing one at approximately eighteen ounces and the other around six ounces.
And when performing the incision, if the patient is moist and the growth is white and damp with a thin, soft base, cut it with a broad blade; have hot iron at hand, as blood often flows abundantly upon cutting.
If blood becomes overwhelming, apply hot iron; if the patient is timid and frightened of having their growth cut with iron, take a tight lead string and secure it around the growth, leaving it for two days, then increasing the tension on the lead string daily until it is removed.
Whenever the growth is affected until it disconnects and falls out on its own without assistance, there is some risk, especially when located in the abdomen. It may be possible to cut off half or part of it.
Then apply hot iron to prevent its return; then treat the wound until it heals. Be cautious when cutting a growth that is pale in color, lacking sensation and unappealing in appearance, as it may be a cancerous tumor, which we will discuss later.
Chapter LXXV.
In the treatment of navel hernia.
A navel hernia can result from various causes, either a tear in the peritoneum that allows the omentum or intestine to protrude, as is the case with other hernias, or from blood originating from a vein or artery, as previously mentioned, or from gas accumulating within.
If the hernia is due to a tear in the peritoneum and the protrusion of omentum, the mass will be similar in color to the body's tissue, soft without pain, and its position will be changeable. If it is due to the protrusion of intestine, its position will differ significantly from what we described. If you press it with your fingers, it will disappear then return, and there may be rumbling accompanied by severe pain, especially when entering a bath or after strenuous activity. If it is due to moisture, it will be soft.
It will not disappear if pressed with your hand, and its size will neither increase nor decrease. If it is due to blood, the mass will appear black with these signs. If it is caused by flesh that has grown in, the mass will be firm and maintain a consistent size.
If it is due to gas, the mass will be soft upon examination. If the navel hernia is caused by blood from an artery or vein or gas, you should refrain from treating it, as this may lead to fear and uncertainty, as I explained in the chapter on tumors caused by arteries and veins.
If the navel hernia protrudes from the peritoneum or the fat, you should order the patient to hold himself and stand upright, then trace around the navel with a pen. Then, you should order the patient to lie down on their back between your hands, and with a wide scalpel, cut around the navel at the marked point with a pen. Then, using a large forceps, pull the middle of the hernia upwards, and tightly tie off the incision with a strong thread or silk thread.
The knot should be a loop, then open the hernia sac above the knot and insert your index finger to feel for the peritoneum. If it is caught in the knot, loosen the knot and push the peritoneum back into the abdomen. If you feel fat (throb), extend it with a forceps.
Cut off the excess, and if you encounter an artery or vein, tightly tie it off. Return to your work and take two needles, threading them with strong thread, and insert the needles into the cut you made around the hernia, crossing each other inside. Then, pull the hernia tightly at four points over the needles.
Alternatively, you may remove the needles and leave the site to heal on its own until the stretched flesh decays and falls off or cuts itself free if it becomes loose and rotten. Then, treat the area with appropriate ointments for healing. If the navel hernia is from a protruding piece of fat.
If there is moisture, it should be incised as we have said and the blood or moisture found therein then removed, after which the wound should be treated with what seals the place.
Chapter LXXV.
In the treatment of cancer.
We have mentioned the types of cancer and the path to treating it with medication, as well as the warning against treating it with iron to prevent ulceration. We also discussed cancer that develops in the womb and warned against its treatment.
The ancients stated that when cancer is located in a place where it can be completely removed, such as cancer of the breast or thigh or other organs that allow for its complete extraction, especially if it is in its early stages and small, one should do so. However, when it has progressed and become large, one should not attempt to remove it.
I have not been able to heal anyone of it, and I have not seen anyone before me achieve that. If one is able to act as we have said, they should advance and ease the sufferer from the black plague multiple times, then stop if there is obvious swelling in the veins.
Then prepare the patient in a way that allows for action, and cast upon the cancer the appropriate instruments, then incise it from all sides with the skin, thoroughly, until not a trace of its roots remains. Let the blood flow without cutting it off quickly.
Press the sites and express all the thick blood with your hand or as much as possible with instruments. If it obstructs your work, a great deal of blood will be lost from cutting an artery or vein, so extract the sweat until the blood stops, then treat it with all other remedies until it heals.
Chapter Forty-Five.
In the treatment of hernias.
We have previously discussed the types of ascites, how water accumulates, the signs of each type, and their treatment with medications. The type treated with iron is solely the edematous type, and it should not be confused with the surgical or flesh types in any way.
If this is fatal, if the treatment of the edematous hernia with medications does not work, then consider whether the patient has reached extreme weakness or suffers from another illness in addition to the hernia, such as a disease that weakens them.
If the patient has a cough, diarrhea, or similar symptoms, do not treat them with iron, as it is dangerous. If you examine the patient and they are strong, without any illness other than hernia, and are neither a child nor an elderly person, then the course of action is to keep the patient standing in front of you. A servant behind him squeezes his abdomen with his hands, pushing the water down towards the groin. Then take a spinal knife in this manner:
A long, two-sided tool with a defined end, similar to a scalpel, except that it has a slight concavity to prevent it from penetrating into the intestines during use and causing them harm. If the hernia protrudes from the direction of the intestines, examine it.
It should be noted that the incision should be made three fingers below the navel, parallel to the groin. If the hernia originates from liver disease, make the incision on the left side of the navel, also at a distance of three fingers. If it arises from spleen disease, make the incision on the right side, following the same measurement.
The incision should not be made on the side that the patient prefers to lie on, as this may cause excess fluid to accumulate in that weak area, which could then lead to a complete breach of the skin and the tool entering the wound, causing further harm.
Using the scalpel, make an incision between the skin and the peritoneum as if you were peeling it, removing about as much as a fingernail. Then, puncture the peritoneum until the scalpel reaches a hollow space (the cavity), remove the scalpel, and insert the tool into the hole.
It is a tube-like object made from a thin pipe, crafted from silver, copper, or polished brass. At the bottom, there is a small hole, and along its sides, there are three openings, two on one side and one on the other, as you can see.
And he may place its tip, sharpened like the point of a pen, in this manner:
At the upper end, there is a ring; if the instrument reaches the water, it will naturally descend upon the instrument, thus draining an appropriate amount of water at once; for if you drain more than necessary, the patient might die due to the dissolution of his animal spirit.
Or, he may experience a cloud that resembles death, but he should vomit from it as much as his strength allows, and according to the patient's pulse strength and the goodness of his color; then, remove the instrument and stop the water, for it will naturally be retained.
Due to the skin that holds the hole in the peritoneum, as I have previously described, then reinsert the instrument another day if you see the patient strong enough for it.
It also releases a small amount of water over several days, always monitoring and preventing any errors so that there is only a slight remainder; if you are concerned for the patient and left a significant amount of water, treat it by burying it in hot sand.
And induce excessive sweating in the bath and under the sun, be patient with thirst, and treat him with drying drugs until he heals; apply heat to the stomach, liver, and spleen after removing the water as previously described.
Chapter LXV.
In the treatment of newborn children with undilated or narrow or incorrectly placed urethral openings.
Some boys may be born with their anus undilated, and it is necessary to promptly dilate it from the moment of birth.
With a very fine surgical instrument as shown in the figure:
Then place a very thin nail of lead in the opening and tie it, keeping it for three or four days. Whenever urination occurs, pull out the lead and then replace it. If you do not use lead, the urine that passes through the site may prevent it from closing.
As for those with a narrow opening, they are treated with lead as mentioned for several days until it widens, and some have the opening in the wrong place; that is, they are born with the opening at the end of the anus, preventing them from urinating forward.
Until the urethra is raised above with the hand, and he does not urinate forward, so that the semen cannot reach the uterus straight, which is a very bad condition. The treatment for this involves having the patient lie on their back.
Then extend the urethra with your left hand firmly, and cut the head of the urethra with a knife or a sharp scalpel, as if you were carving something to form a middle part that protrudes, so that the opening is in the center as it should be.
And be careful in your work to prevent bleeding, as it often occurs; counter it with what stops the blood and treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter LXVI
In the fistula that occurs in the foreskin, urethra, glans, and surrounding tissue, and in cases of adhesion between the foreskin and urethra.
This fistula often occurs in the urethra, appearing as a hard, painful lump, which may be benign or malignant. The benign ones should be suspended with a delicate hook.
Cut it until it is completely cleansed, then apply a cotton swab soaked in Egyptian ointment, and subsequently treat it with Arabian ointment until it heals. However, if the fistula is malignant and discolored, cauterization should be used after cutting and scraping it.
If the fistula is in the foreskin, which has not been circumcised, treat it as follows: Remove the internal fistula first until it heals, then treat the external portion.
Because when you treat them together, the foreskin may puncture, and it may also turn black and corrupt in women or the foreskin, so you should cauterize all that has turned black, lest it corrupt or has corrupted.
Then apply honey with crushed and strained pomegranate rinds and alum, and treat it with all other remedies until it heals. If bleeding occurs, use a curved iron to cauterize in this manner:
If cauterization is beneficial for both conditions, that is, blood loss and a corrupted wound, then if the glandular tissue disintegrates completely at any time, one should insert a lead pipe into the urethra to help the patient pass urine, and as for the adhesion of the foreskin to the glandular tissue.
This adhesion occurs in those whose foreskin is intact and did not undergo circumcision, and it may be caused by a wound or tumor. Therefore, remove the foreskin with a curved scalpel to dissolve the bond and free the glandular tissue from all sides.
If it is difficult to distinguish them upon examination, one should remove a small piece of the glandular tissue and foreskin. The foreskin is thin, so it may puncture easily, so use a thin cotton cloth soaked in cold water to prevent further adhesion.
Then he treats it with a contracting drink until it heals.
Chapter LXXVII.
In the purification of boys and the treatment of what afflicts them of errors.
Circumcision is nothing other than the separation of union, like any other surgery; however, since it is an act done willfully and practiced specifically on boys, we must outline the best practice in it.
The easiest path to safety is, therefore, to say that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books because it was not practiced in their laws; on the contrary, it is something we have acquired.
By experience, I have found that the majority of surgeons and healers use purification with a knife and scissors, as well as cauterization, binding with thread, and cutting with nails; I have tried all these methods.
I have found no better method than purification with a knife and binding with thread, because purification with a cauterizing iron often damages the skin, as the foreskin has two layers of skin, and it is possible that only the upper layer of skin is cut while the lower layer remains.
In cases where he is forced to cut another part and the pain persists, cleansing with a catheter cannot be assured if the urethra has entered its hole, as the skin may slip and ruin your work or the boy's skin might naturally be short.
Often, they are born in such a condition that they do not need cleansing, and I have seen this. As for cleansing with scissors and tying with thread, experience has shown me its advantage, as the scissors' cut is proportional to the lower blade.
When you press your hand, if the blades are in proportion and cut at once, it makes the thread's grip similar to a wall around the urethra from all sides, ensuring no error, and the first step in the procedure is to calm the boy.
In particular, if he is someone who understands a little, you should only tie the thread to his urethra and leave it for another day, then cheer him up and delight him as much as possible, and then stop him between your hands with his head held high.
He should not be sitting, with the scissors hidden in your sleeve or under your foot, so that the boy's eyes do not fall on them or any of the tools. Then, insert your hand into his urethra and blow on the skin, lifting it upwards until the head of the urethra is exposed.
Then purify it from any dirt, tie the marked area with a doubled thread, and tie another below it slightly, then hold it firmly with your thumb and index finger, and cut between the two ties. Then lift the skin quickly and remove the urethral head, letting a little blood flow, which is better and reduces swelling of the urethra. Then dry it with a wet cloth and sprinkle it with ashes from burnt dried squash or fine meal, both of which have proven effective.
Then lift the skin quickly and remove the urethral head, letting a little blood flow, which is better and reduces swelling of the urethra. Then dry it with a wet cloth and sprinkle it with ashes from burnt dried squash or fine meal, both of which have proven effective. Then place a slice of boiled egg in rose water infused with fresh rose fat on the wound, leaving it for another day, after which treat it with all other remedies until it heals.
And this is an image of the scalpel suitable for cleaning:
It should be a sharp, straight scalpel, moistening the nail and making both blades of equal length to the handles. If there is any error in cleaning, the skin might turn inside out or partly so when cutting, hence you should extend it with your fingernail from your clock before it swells.
Cut it evenly, if you cannot hold it with your fingernail, use a hook and cut it. If after three days the area below the urethral head remains swollen and warm, leave it until the hot swelling subsides and then peel it gently.
Cut it as you see fit, but be careful with the urethra's head; if anything is cut from the head of the urethra, it will not cause harm. Treat it with the same techniques used to heal wounds with the small particles we described in the article on small particles.
If the skin above the urethra is cut and shrinks upwards, it will not cause significant harm. Treat it as we have mentioned until it heals.
Chapter LXXVIII
In the treatment of urination retention in the bladder.
Urination retention in the bladder occurs due to an obstruction caused by a stone, congealed blood, pus, or growing tissue, among other things. Treat it with the various methods of treatment described in the sections.
If urine cannot be released and you observe that the retention is due to a stone that has damaged the bladder neck, the patient should sit on his knees with his back straight and have someone stand behind him who places one foot on the patient's lower back, pulling it towards them. The patient should hold their breath as much as possible.
At this point, the bladder neck will push the stone back, allowing urine to flow. However, if it still does not release and the patient's condition worsens, a catheter (a device called 'qathatir' as illustrated below) should be used.
A silver catheter, thin and smooth with a hollow interior resembling the tube of a bird's feather, approximately one and a half palm-lengths long, with a gentle funnel at its tip. To use it, take a folded string and secure a wad of wool or cotton at its end.
Insert the loose end of the string into the catheter's tip and cut it with a scalpel if necessary, ensuring no wool remains to prevent obstruction. Lubricate the catheter with oil, butter, or egg white and have the patient sit on a chair.
Introduce the catheter into the urethra, using wet oils or a mixture of oil and warm water, gently pushing it until it reaches the origin of the urethra. Then, fold the urethra over towards the navel and insert the catheter further inside.
Once the urethra is folded and the catheter inserted, tilt the penis downwards while the catheter remains inside. Then, push it further until it reaches the bladder, where the patient will feel a sense of emptiness.
This is done to accommodate the curved path of the urethra; by securing the wool or cotton at the end of the string, the urine follows its lead, allowing for the catheter's removal and the flow of urine.
Continue to do this until the bladder is empty and the patient feels relief.
Chapter LIX.
How to inject the bladder with elixir.
Images of the instruments suitable for this purpose are made of silver or hollow ivory with a long, delicate tube through which water and medicines can be slowly discharged. This is known as the elixir bag, and here is its image:
Made of silver or hollow ivory, this instrument has a long tube with a delicate, milled edge on one side and a single hole on the other, as illustrated.
The hollow space, with its holes carefully sized to prevent overflow but allowing for the passage of moisture, functions similarly to a syringe used in medical applications. When drawn upon, it absorbs fluids; when pressed, it expels them, as with a squirt gun employed in naval warfare.
If you wish to expel moisture into the bladder, insert the tip of the elixir bag into the moisture and draw upwards with the pump; the moisture will then be drawn into the bag. Next, insert the tip into the urethra as described for catheters, and push with the pump to expel the moisture.
If that moisture reaches the bladder, it will be felt by the patient, and this is a diagram of a delicate syringe used to inject the bladder.
It is made of silver or sponge, with its upper part resembling a small funnel and a cut underneath where the ligament fits, then take a camel's bladder and put in it the moisture you wish to inject into the bladder, then tie it tightly between the ligaments with a doubled thread.
And warm that moisture slightly over fire, then insert the tip of the syringe into the urethra and tighten your hand on the bladder with the moisture firmly until the patient feels that the moisture has reached the bladder.
If you do not have a bladder, take a thin cloth and make a circle from it, puncture it all around, then insert a tight thread through those holes as you wind it, then gather the circle together to form a sac after placing what you want of moisture, oils, and water inside.
Then tie it to the instrument and make with it as you made with the bladder, by pressing your hand until the moisture reaches the bladder.
Chapter Sixty
On the removal of stones.
In the previous section, we discussed the types of stones and their treatment with medications, highlighting the distinction between kidney-formed stones and bladder-formed stones, along with their respective symptoms. We also described the stone that requires manual intervention or incision.
It is specifically the bladder-formed stone that takes root in the urethra, and I will describe it with a clear and concise explanation.
I state that the bladder-formed stone is more common in boys, and its symptoms include urine exiting the bladder resembling water in its lightness.
It appears sandy, causing irritation and itching around the genitals, often leading to a hanging sensation before eventually dispersing, revealing the anus in many cases. It is easier for young boys to pass these stones until they reach 14 years old, while it becomes more difficult for older men. For adolescents, the duration is typically between these two extremes.
The treatment is easier for larger stones and more challenging for smaller ones. If we proceed with treatment, the patient should first be injected with a solution to expel all waste in their intestines, as this may prevent the stone from being detected during examination.
Then, the patient is positioned with their legs elevated, shaken, and lowered to move the stone towards the neck of the bladder. They may also be made to jump from a height multiple times or sit upright with their hands under their thighs, tilting the bladder downwards for inspection.
Examine from the outside. If you feel a stone in the space, immediately make an incision on it. If it does not come under your touch at all, you should wipe the index finger or the middle finger with oil from your left hand, if the patient is a child.
If the patient is a fully developed boy, insert your finger into his groin and search for the stone until it is under your finger. Then move it little by little towards the neck of the bladder, then press on it with your finger and push it out through the desired incision site.
Command a servant to squeeze the bladder with his hand. Command another servant to extend the male genitalia with his right hand and stretch the skin below the genitalia away from the incision site with his other hand. Then take the sharp scalpel, whose image is as follows:
Make an incision between the anus and the genitalia, not in the middle but to the side of the left leg. The cut should be around the stone and your finger inside the anus, pushing it outward diagonally so that the external opening is wide, while the internal one is narrow enough for the stone to pass through.
Do not force it if it seems the finger inside the anus pushes the stone during the cut, as it may come out without difficulty. Keep in mind that some stones may have angles or edges, making their exit more difficult.
Among them are smooth ones resembling oak, which are rounded and roll out easily. If they have corners or letters, they increase the depth of the cut slightly. If they do not come out this way, one should maneuver around them by grasping them with a firm clamp whose end is like a plane.
To hold it in place on the stone so that it does not slip, or insert a delicate, curved tool from underneath; if this fails, slightly widen the cut. If blood persists, cut it with glass.
If there are more than one, first push the larger one into the bladder's mouth, then make a cut on it, and afterwards push the smaller ones; if they are very large, it is ignorance to make a large cut on them, as it may expose the patient to either of two dangers.
Either he dies or he experiences permanent urinary incontinence, as the site never heals; but try to push them out or manipulate them with calipers until they are completely removed.
Having completed the task, cleanse the wound with ash, patience, and a poultice; tighten it and make an opening on top, moistening it with oil, elixir, or butter and rosewater mixed with cold water to soothe the hot swelling. Then have the patient lie on their back, leaving the bandage intact until the third day.
If the wound dissolves, apply a large amount of water and oil, then treat it with aloe ointment and basil ointment until it heals. If a hot swelling, excess oedema, or similar complications occur, such as blood clotting in the bladder and preventing urination, this is indicated by the presence of blood in the urine.
Then insert your finger into the wound and remove the blood, as if it remains, it may lead to bladder corruption and infection. Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt, and treat each type accordingly until it heals.
During all stages of treatment, it is necessary to bind and gather the thighs to fix the medications applied to the area. If the stone is small and enters the urethra, becoming lodged and preventing urination, treat it with the described methods before it progresses to a tear.
This treatment often avoids the need for a tear, as I have found it to be effective. Take a fork-like instrument made of steel, and its shape is as follows: .
A triangular-shaped fork with a sharp, pointed end, attached to a stick. Take a thread and tie it around the penis below the stone to prevent it from returning to the bladder. Then, insert the fork gently into the urethra until the fork reaches the same stone.
Turn the stone in your hand gradually on the same spot as you attempt to puncture it, until it passes through from the other side. Urine will then flow and you should grip what remains of the stone outside the penis; it will break off and exit with the urine, curing the patient.
If this treatment is not possible due to a hindrance, tie a thread under the stone and another thread above it, then make a cut on the stone along the penis between the two threads, and remove it.
Then untie the thread and clean the clotted blood in the wound. Tying the thread under the stone prevents it from returning to the bladder, while the thread above ensures that when the stone is removed and the thread untied, the skin returns to its place, covering the wound.
Therefore, if you tie the upper thread, you should lift the skin upwards so that it returns to its place when the stone is removed and covers the wound as we mentioned.
Chapter 61.
On removing stones from women.
Stones in women are rare, and if one is present, it is difficult to treat and easily avoided for many reasons; one being that the woman may be a virgin, and another that you will not find a woman willing to allow a doctor to examine her.
If the patient is a chaste woman or from among relatives, thirdly, you do not find a woman skilled in this art, especially manual work, fourthly, the location of the incision on the stone (in women) is far from the stone itself, so a concave cut is needed.
In such a case, there is risk; if necessity demands, one should take a skilled female physician, who is rarely found; if unavailable, seek a virtuous and companionable doctor, or bring a qualified midwife, or a woman who has some knowledge in this art.
She should be instructed to perform all that she is ordered, starting with examining the stone first; she should check if the woman is a virgin, and insert her finger into her vagina to feel for the stone, pressing it with her finger.
Then she should be ordered to make the incision; if the woman is not a virgin but married, the midwife should insert her finger into the patient's vagina and check for the stone after placing her left hand on the bladder and squeezing it firmly.
If it is found, she should remove it from the bladder opening down to its full extent, reaching as low as the thigh; then make an incision at the opposite side of the vulva, near the origin of the thigh, whichever side the stone is felt on.
And if her finger does not remove the stone that is pressed under it, make the cut small first, then insert the rod into that small cut. If she feels the stone, increase the cut as much as you know the stone will come out from it. Know that there are many types of stones.
Some are small and some large, smooth or rough, long or round, and each has its own characteristics. Know their types to discern what you need. If blood prevails, sprinkle the powdered glass in the wound and hold it for a moment until the bleeding stops, then resume your work.
So that the stone may come out, and bear in mind that you must prepare with yourself among the instruments mentioned for removing stones from men to assist you in your work. If blood loss overcomes you and you know that the pulse of the blood is from an artery that has been cut off, place the pressure on the wound.
Tighten it securely with forceps and do not touch it again, leaving the stone in place. The patient may die if you remove it. Then treat the wound; if after a few days the blood flow slows down and the area becomes infected, resume your work to extract the stone.
Chapter LXXXVI.
On the cut over the seminal vesicle.
The Hydrocele is merely the accumulation of moisture in the white peritoneum that lies beneath the skin of the scrotum, which surrounds the testis, and is called the scrotum. It may also be found in a special membrane prepared by nature on one side of the testis.
It may even seem like another testis, located between the skin of the testis and the white peritoneum we mentioned, which only happens rarely. This hydrocele is caused by a weakness in the males, leading to the accumulation of this fluid, and it may also occur due to a blow to the females.
This moisture may have various colors, either yellow, or blood-red, or dark black, or watery white, which is the most common, and its signs are as follows.
Where the moisture accumulates, if it is in the white peritoneum we mentioned, the tumor will be somewhat elongated and round, like an egg, and the testis will not be visible as the moisture surrounds it from all sides.
If the moisture is in a special membrane, the tumor will be round with one side resembling an egg.
Therefore, a person may mistake it for another egg. If the moisture is between the skin of the testis and the white peritoneum, it lies under sensation. To determine the color of the moisture, one should press the tumor with a square rod (as depicted), and based on what emerges after pressing, one can judge the contents.
If we resort to treatment with iron, you should order the patient to have bloodletting if possible, and if you see that their body is swollen, they should lie on their back on a slightly elevated surface, place several pieces of cloth under them, and sit on their left side.
You should then command a servant to sit on his right, extending his penis to one side of the scrotum and towards the inguinal region, and take a wide scalpel to cut through the scrotal skin lengthwise from the middle down to near the groin.
You should make the cut straight, dividing the scrotal skin into two halves, until it reaches the white tunica that contains it, peel it off, and be careful not to cut through it. Peel from the side closest to the testicle more thoroughly, extending the peeling as much as possible.
Then, cover the water-filled tunica with a wide pad and remove all the water. Separate the edges of the incision with forceps, stretch the tunica upwards, do not touch the scrotal skin containing the testicle, and cut the tunica as much as possible, either in one piece or in several cuts.
Especially, be careful not to cut too shallowly, as you risk the fluid reaccumulating. If the testicle emerges from its skin during the procedure, once you've finished cutting the tunica, replace it and sew the edges of the scrotal skin together.
Then treat it as other surgeries until it heals. If the egg has been affected by another illness, you should tie the vessels in the scrotum to prevent bleeding, then cut the testicle from the scrotum and extract the egg, then treat it as we have mentioned.
If the fluid has collected on both sides, know that they are both hydatid cysts, so make an incision on the other side as you did on the first, regardless of whether it is uniform or not, and then clean the blood.
You insert into the cracks a cloth soaked in oil or rose fat, making it from outside a new cloth soaked in a mixture of wine and oil, stretched over the testicles and belly, and place a folded rag on top, which are called "refaid. And tie them above with the six-sided strap, as illustrated.
Then take two rags, sew them together, and stuff them with fluffy wool, as shown. Make the ends that are tied around the thighs from cotton or moist wool, tighten them in a belt, and one end is taken to the seat, back.
And take the second one towards the groin, and both ends on the thighs below, and the remaining two ends on the calves, and tighten all the straps in a belt around the waist. You can also make this dressing by cauterization instead of incising with iron.
And take a thin, sharp iron and make an incision through the scrotal skin while it is numbed, as we have described, until the white peritoneum containing the water is exposed. Then take another iron in this same shape:
It resembles the Greek eye, then cover it with the peritoneum while it is still protected until all the moisture is removed, then stretch the peritoneum with pincers and scrape off the layer containing it with the iron, cutting it as much as possible to completely remove all of it, preserving the testis from fire.
Know that this method is safer and avoids blood loss, and it is better than making incisions. If an obstacle arises during the incision or while applying heat, such as a hot tumor, blood loss, or something else, treat each of these issues with the appropriate remedy as previously described.
If the patient is timid and does not endure this treatment due to its severity, then use a poultice as we have described, provided that it is correct according to what we have previously mentioned as evidence.
If the adenoma is watery, have the patient sit on a high chair, then cover the tumor at its base with a wide knife, place the poultice along the body, making sure the opening is large enough to allow all the water to drain, then apply cotton and secure it with a bandage.
Let it exude the rest of the water, then treat it until the wound heals. If the water does not come out in time, it is because the white membrane obstructs the opening of the wound.
Therefore, a feather of a goose or the instrument used to extract rose water (as illustrated) should be introduced into the wound, or the opening of the wound slightly increased.
Be aware that the water may return and accumulate after six months or so. If it accumulates, treat it in the same manner and the patient will recover day by day.
Chapter 63.
On the incision of muscular tissue and its treatment.
Know that an incision into this tissue is one of the dangers leading to death in most cases, so we advise leaving it and seeking safety, and I will discuss the procedure and types of swelling related to it.
I say that various swellings may occur in bodies with a female constitution, and this can be due to many reasons, either from excessive heat that flows towards the female organs or from a blow. The color of the swelling is usually similar to the color of the body, and it does not have water.
And the tumor may be cystic and possibly a hardened tumor with a black color and no sensation, and it may be due to the complexity and swelling of the arteries as mentioned earlier, or due to the swelling of veins. What was caused by the swelling of arteries is known by the dispersion of the tumor.
If you press it with your fingers and it should not be at all, while that is caused by the swelling of veins, nothing will disperse from it when pressed with fingers, and this type may be difficult to cut through and other tissues.
This involves incising the scrotal skin, extending the testis above and removing it from the white membrane (peritoneum), freeing the vas deferens from its attachments, tying off the vessels, and cutting the vas deferens after ensuring it is detached from all sides of the testis. If the testis has adhered to surrounding tissues.
It is necessary to extract and cut the testis, and if there is adhesion between any of the membranes or among the vessels, all such adhesions should be freed and cut off in a circular manner.
If the adhesion is due to tissue growth in the rear area, it is necessary to cut all of it and extract the testis as we mentioned. Once the task is complete, apply a wound dressing soaked in rose fat and then treat it with all other remedies until healing occurs.
Chapter LXXVI.
In the treatment of an adenoma with a pedicle.
The pedicle is a tumor twisted with some torsion, similar to a cluster, with relaxed antheia and difficulty for the patient in movement, exercise, and walking. In the treatment of this condition, the safe method is as mentioned earlier.
However, it is necessary to mention the procedure as done by the pioneers. I say that the patient should sit on a high chair, then push down the antheia ligature, and grasp the scrotal skin with your fingers along with the vessels close to the penis.
And another assistant should hold it, stretching it firmly, then make a curved incision with a broad, sharp knife alongside the vessels until they are exposed. Then, as mentioned to you before, peel it from all sides, just as you would do with the arteries in the groin, and insert a needle with a doubled thread into it.
Tie it in the first place where the pedicle was exposed, and also in the last, then make a straight incision through its middle along the body's length, and remove any accumulated purulent, foul-smelling fluids.
Then treat the fistula with the treatment of other wounds that require a period for the vessels supplying one of the ovaries to fall, which is not harmful. If the duct affects all the vessels, one ovary should be removed along with the vessels, otherwise the egg will lack nourishment. By cutting the vessels, they wilt and cannot be used.
Chapter LVI
In the treatment of intestinal adenoma.
This adenoma occurs through an opening in the peritoneum extending across the abdomen towards the hips, causing the intestine to protrude through this hernia into one of the ovaries.
This hernia can either be a tear in the peritoneum or an extension of it, and these types are caused by numerous factors such as a blow, a jump, a shout, or lifting a heavy object, etc. Its sign is that if it's due to an extension of the peritoneum, it develops gradually over a long period of time.
It does not occur suddenly, and the tumor is flat towards the depth as the peritoneum squeezes the intestine. Its sign is that if it's due to a tear in the peritoneum, it begins with severe pain all at once, and the tumor becomes clearly visible under the skin near the site.
And thus, when the intestine protrudes and exits the peritoneum, it may carry with it adventitious tissue, which is then called intestinal and adventitious, or it may contain feces that become trapped there, leading to the patient's demise.
Because it causes severe pain and rumbling, especially if pressed, treating this condition with iron is dangerous, so one should be cautious not to resort to it. The treatment involves commanding the patient to return the intestine to its original position within the body if possible.
Then the patient should lie on their back between your hands, raise their legs, and you should stretch the skin next to the testicles upwards. Then, cut the entire length of the scrotum's skin and insert forceps into the incision to open it as needed.
The incision should be of a size that allows the egg to be removed. Then, peel the membranes beneath the scrotal skin until the white, solid peritoneum is exposed on all sides. At this point, insert your index finger into the space behind the testis.
Between the white peritoneum beneath the testis and the second peritoneal layer, loosen the adhesions behind the testis. Then, with your right hand, bend it inward towards the scrotal skin, while simultaneously lifting the white peritoneum upwards with your left hand, elevating the testis along with the peritoneum towards the incision.
And command the servant to extend the egg upward, and you release the adhesion from behind with a complete release, and inspect with your finger to ensure there is no twisted intestine in the rigid white membrane; if you find something, push it down into the abdomen.
Then take a needle with a thick thread twisted from ten threads, and insert it at the end of the peritoneum that lies next to the incision, then cut the ends of the thread bends so that there are four threads. Then arrange them one on top of the other in a cross-like manner and tie the peritoneum, which is under the scrotal skin, with a strong ligature from both sides; then also twist the thread ends and tie them tightly so that nothing can reach the vessels that nourish it. To prevent this, leave a space the size of two fingers between the ligatures; after these two ligatures, leave part of the peritoneum under the scrotal skin, as large as a finger.
To prevent this, leave a space the size of two fingers between the ligatures; after these two ligatures, leave part of the peritoneum under the scrotal skin, as large as a finger. Cut the remaining part round and remove the egg, then make a slit below the scrotal skin from which blood flows, as described previously; then use wool soaked in oil, place it in the wound, and apply the ligature as described.
And if the white peritoneum, which we mentioned after cutting it carefully to prevent bleeding, often occurs, leave the ligature until it falls on its own. If its fall is slow, pour hot water on it and carry what causes it to sweat until it falls.
Then treat the wound with all the treatments for surgical wounds until it heals.
Chapter Sixty-Six
In this gaseous adenoma, I have seen no one dare treat it with iron. The ancients mentioned that it should be made as described for the adenoma accompanied by a daly (a type of plant), namely, to bind the vessels after making the cut gently below.
Then make a cut in the middle and treat the tumor to open it, so that the vessels fall, and treat the wound as we mentioned until it heals.
Chapter Seventy-Six
In the hernia that occurs in the groin.
The hernia in the groin may present itself as we mentioned, filling the area without any descent of the intestine into the scrotum. If there is a descent, it is slight and returns to its place at all times.
However, if time passes, the tear in the peritoneum will increase until the intestine and testicles descend, and this is due to the extension of the peritoneum in the abdomen as we have mentioned. This is because the peritoneum extends, then relaxes and the organ drops, twisting, and its treatment is by cauterization as we have previously described.
It may also be treated with a metal instrument in this manner: the patient lies on his back between your hands, and you make an incision across the bulging hernia, about three fingers wide, then cut through the peritoneum beneath the skin.
Until the white peritoneum beneath it is exposed, take a rod and place it on the area where the peritoneum has separated, pressing it deep into the abdomen, then sew the two sides together, one against the other, using stitches to hold them in place.
Then take the end of the rod, without cutting the peritoneum or touching the egg or any other organ, as we taught you in treating intestinal hernias, and treat it as a regular surgical wound.
If the stitches break, clean the wound and dress it until it heals; then the peritoneum contracts and the hernia does not increase in size.
The best course of action in this case is preferable because it is closer to safety.
Chapter LXXXVI
On the relaxation of the scrotal skin.
The scrotal skin often relaxes in some people without the muscles inside relaxing, which makes it look ugly. Therefore, whoever wishes to treat it should put the patient on his back.
Cut all the relaxed skin from the thick skin, then gather the edges and sew them together with three or four stitches, making sure to secure the stitches, then cut between the stitches.
Then treat it like any other wound until it heals, and the stitches fall out.
Chapter LXXIX
On castration.
Castration is forbidden in our religion.
For this reason, I should not mention it in this book, but I have included it for two reasons. One is so that the physician, when asked about it, will know the treatment for those who encounter it. The other reason is that we often need to castrate some animals for our benefit.
As with lambs, goats, cats, and similar animals, I say that castration is done in two ways: either by pressure or by cutting and severing. In the case of pressure, we make the animal sit in hot water until its female organs relax, soften, and hang down.
Then, you smooth and relax them with your hand until they become soft and no longer resistant to touch. For castration by cutting, you must hold the animal and, using your left hand, grasp the scrotum and then tie the testicles before making a single cut on each testicle.
Once the testicles are exposed, cut them after having removed the outer covering, leaving only the thin membrane covering the vessels intact. This method of castration is superior to that by pressure.
Because pressure may leave some residual sensation in the female organs, causing the animal to desire copulation, then you should treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Seventy
In the treatment of hermaphrodites.
Hermaphrodites in men are of two types: one where it appears below the perineum or within the scrotum, having a shape resembling a female vagina with hair, and urine may drain from the one within the scrotum.
And as for women, there is one type, where it appears above the vagina on the pubis, resembling a smaller male phallus protruding from outside, similar to a man's; both are feminine in nature. Treatment for all three types.
The two types of men and the one type of woman should have the excess flesh cut away, so that its mark is removed, and then treated like any other surgical wound until healing occurs; however, for the second type of man from whom urine drains through the scrotum, there is no operation, and it will never heal.
Chapter 71.
On cutting the clitoris and the flesh extending from the vulva of women.
The clitoris may grow larger than the normal size, becoming distorted and repulsive in appearance; in some women, it may swell to a degree comparable to that of men, leading to sexual intercourse.
It is necessary to hold the clitoris with your hand or a forceps and cut it, without overdoing the cutting, especially at its base, so as not to cause bleeding.
Then treat it with surgical treatment until it heals. As for the tissue that grows, it is tissue that grows inside the uterus, filling it.
And it may protrude outside, like a carbuncle. Therefore, some early scholars call it the "carbuncle disease," and it should be cut as you would cut the clitoris, using a suitable instrument and treating it until it heals.
Chapter 72.
On the treatment of hernia.
Hernia is when a woman's vagina is either completely closed or has a small opening, either due to birth or an accidental injury. The accidental hernia can be caused by excess tissue or a growth.
Or it can be a thin or thick peritoneum, located deep within the uterus, or on its sides, or above or below, preventing intercourse, conception, and childbirth. It may also cause amenorrhea (absence of menstruation). This should be determined by an experienced midwife.
If the blockage is visible, examine it; if not, use your fingers or a probe. If the blockage is made of thin perineum tissue and is close to the labia, act quickly to incise it, making cuts resembling a comb on the labia, then place your thumbs from both hands underneath.
For a woman, lie on her back with her legs spread apart. Then force open the labia to puncture the thin perineum tissue, allowing the blockage to open. Take a cloth, soak it in oil, and apply it to the area. Have sexual intercourse with the woman daily to prevent the wound from healing and sealing again.
If the perineum tissue is thick and dense, use a wide scalpel similar to a banana leaf to cut through it. If the blockage is made of flesh, hang it with pincers and cut it. Have on hand medications to stop bleeding without causing pain, such as calamine, chamomile, and frankincense mixed with egg whites.
Then use a wide lead pipe to prevent the wound from healing quickly. Grip it for several days and apply a dry cotton string as a dressing. Treat it with all remedies to promote healing, but be aware that another meat-like growth may occur in the uterus; if so, cut it in the same manner.
Unless it is a benign tumor, the cancerous growth in the uterus should not be treated with iron under any circumstances.
Chapter Seventy-Three.
In the treatment of hemorrhoids, warts, and red sores that occur in a woman's genital area.
As for hemorrhoids, it is an inflation of the veins' openings such that they discharge a significant and constant amount of blood. If hemorrhoids are left untreated, they transform into warts, and I have mentioned in the previous section their types, signs, and symptoms.
As for what accepts treatment and what does not, I say that hemorrhoids and warts, if they are located deep within the uterus and have not appeared to cause discomfort, then they do not respond well to direct treatment with iron. However, those that are found in the opening of the uterus, which do cause sensitivity, are the ones that can be treated.
A woman should enter a cold house, then use a scalpel or a rough cloth to remove the warts and cut them back to their roots. Then, she should apply pressure over the wound to stop the bleeding from one of the cutting edges without causing further injury.
She should apply similar remedies like fennel, calamine, and myrrh, and then elevate her legs against a wall for a while. If the bleeding persists, she should immerse them in cold water. If the bleeding continues, seat her in a bath of sumac, pomegranate peel, and gallnut, and finally, prepare a dough with barley flour, honey, and vinegar to apply to the affected area.
Apply a dressing to the back, and if the blood stops, then fasten the splints to the ribs and breasts without any condition. Then take a cloth and dip it in an infusion of tramel or an infusion of camel's tongue or an infusion of date palm branches with oak bark juice, and apply it to the wound.
If the tumor subsides, treat the area with a ointment until it heals. As for the red pustule, it resembles the heads of hair, rough to the sight, so you should cut what is visible of it, as you would with warts, and treat it until it heals.
Chapter LXXIV
In the case of an abscess in the fallopian tube that appears in the uterus.
Various types of tumors may occur in the uterus, including cancer, fibroid tumors, ulcers, abscesses, festering sores, hemorrhoids, fissures, warts, and hot tumors. All these conditions and their types have been described in detail in the previous sections.
In this discussion, we should mention the hot tumor that appears in the uterus, especially if it is one of the tumors that persists for a prolonged period. You should examine it; if the pain from the tumor is acute at its onset, with pulsation, inflammation, and fever, then consider treating it accordingly.
I have seen that when the sense of touch perceives redness, do not hurry to bind it. Treat it with what aids in maturation. Until, when these symptoms subside, then the woman should sit on a chair with two seats and lean back.
And gather her legs towards the lower abdomen, opening her thighs, and place her arms under her knees, securing them with a suitable band.
Therefore, the midwife should sit on the right side and use the instrument that opens the cervix, whose image will be described later. If you intend to use this instrument, you must assess the depth of the woman's uterus to avoid inserting more than necessary.
If the instrument causes harm because it extends beyond the depth, one should place pads on the cervix's edge to prevent its entire insertion into the uterus. The thread that is drawn through the instrument should be from the upper side.
While you hold the instrument, the assistant turns the thread until the cervix opens. If an effusion appears and feels soft when touched with the hand, it should be incised at its base with a wide scalpel after allowing sufficient time.
A soft thread soaked in rose fat or green oil with some tension should be placed in the wound. The thread should emerge from the cervix incision and be wrapped around the uterus and vulva, using pure wool soaked in boiled water.
Then, it is treated after two days with the ointment that is suitable for it until it heals.
The womb and the wound may be washed by injecting water and honey, then water in which the root of the herb or long fennel has been boiled, and finally apply the ointment, for if the abscess is hidden internally within the womb.
One should refrain from treating it with iron, but instead, treat it as we have mentioned in the classification.
Chapter LXXV.
In teaching midwives how to treat living fetuses that have emerged in an abnormal form.
The midwife should first know the signs of normal childbirth, which include if you observe the woman straining downwards and longing to breathe in fresh air, and finds it easier despite her postnatal state.
And if the baby comes out quickly, know that this is a normal delivery; the baby should come headfirst, and the placenta may be with or hanging from the umbilical cord. If you observe these signs, squeeze the woman's stomach to expedite the baby's delivery.
If the foetus descends with the placenta, it is a natural and desirable delivery. However, if the foetus emerges with its legs first, or its hands before its head and legs, it is an abnormal and condemned birth.
If one hand or leg emerges first, or if the head and hand, or even the foetus is curled up and potentially flips over on its back, these are undesirable positions. The midwife must be skilled and careful in handling all such situations to avoid mistakes.
I will illustrate each of these positions and explain the techniques to recognize and manage them. If the foetus emerges with its head first in a normal position, but the mother experiences difficulty and her strength wanes, I will have her sit on a chair while other women support her.
Moisturize the mother's vagina with cooked fennel and wet oils. Then, the midwife inserts a small scalpel between her fingers, cuts the placenta, allowing the moisture to flow out, and presses on the woman's abdomen until the foetus is delivered.
If the foetus does not descend, the woman should be given a mixture of fennel saliva and sherbet oil. After this application, she should sneeze and blow her nose while holding her mouth and nose shut. This often facilitates the foetus' descent. If the hands emerge first, they should be gently pushed back, little by little.
If the baby cannot be delivered, place the woman on a bed and raise her legs above her head. Then shake the bed on the ground while she holds onto it to prevent herself from falling. If the hands do not deliver the baby and the fetus dies, cut them off and pull out the remaining fetus.
If the baby is positioned with its legs up, tie the woman's hands with a cloth and gently pull them to help deliver the baby. If the baby comes out on its feet, you should raise them slightly and turn the baby slowly until it is in a flat position. Then take one of its legs and stretch it out gradually.
If the baby's legs reach the hips, instruct her to cough and blow her nose gently (using a handkerchief), as this often helps deliver the baby. If this does not work as described, slowly turn the baby until it is in its natural position; it should then come out smoothly. If none of these methods work, try turning the baby again until it is ready to be delivered naturally.
Take some gum from the date palm, horse radish, and althaeas, mix them well in a mortar, then apply this mixture to the vagina and lower abdomen, and have her sit in warm water until the contractions begin.
If you notice that her contractions are not effective, prepare a mixture of honey and create a vaginal tampon for her. Once she feels it and leaves it in place for an hour, have her sit on a chair, then gently cough and press on her nose and mouth while lightly massaging her lower abdomen; the baby should come out naturally at this point, positioned with its knees and hands.
If the patient is in this condition, insert his hands a little at a time, then have the woman lie on her stomach and lower her legs while lying on a bed, and bring her arms together. Then press slightly above her abdomen a little at a time. Then remove the cushions under her legs so they are pointing downwards. If the baby does not come out, take both her legs and move them vigorously. Then press above the perineum little by little until the baby ascends. Then the midwife should insert her hand and gently adjust the baby.
Order the woman to move until the baby is born, with the baby's hand extended and grasping one of hers. If she cannot withdraw her hand, hold the woman upright and have her walk. If walking is not possible, have her lie down.
Then place her on her bed and vigorously shake both her legs. Use the instruments described from the birthing kit. If she experiences strong contractions, sit her down on a chair, treat to withdraw the hand and adjust the baby to its natural position. Have her sneeze and order her to move until the baby is born.
When the baby is born on its back with its hands extended and facing its mother's spine, the midwife should grasp the baby's hand and gently turn it, straightening it carefully. Once aligned, she should support the baby with the oil and lubricants as described.
Then make her move little by little. If she does, sit her on the chair and order her to lean to the right side, then instruct her to stretch and sneeze with the handkerchief, for it will come out, just as the fetus comes out upright on its side.
If it descends into the cervix in this manner, with the placenta, cut the placenta with your nail until it is free from moisture. If it attaches to the face and neck of the fetus, cut it from the umbilical cord to prevent suffocation and death. Then push the fetus back inside until it is in the correct position.
Instruct the woman to sneeze several times, for it will facilitate the delivery of twins or multiple fetuses. Know that twins are often born together, sometimes three or four, and they can survive, though this is rare. Five, however, is beyond nature; they never live.
They are surrounded by a single placenta, and they are separated by a membrane that connects them at their umbilical cords. They can be delivered naturally and easily, like a single fetus, or they can be delivered poorly as we have described.
If some become difficult at birth and proceed to the conditions we have described, treat them as we have mentioned, for the midwife must be gentle, act with caution and patience, and use all means at her disposal to ensure safety.
Describe the fetuses that are imagined in the womb and then fall, it may be one or two or three or four or five or six or seven or more than ten. It is confirmed with me that a woman miscarried seven, and another had fifteen, all of them were imagined as such.
By the grace of the Wise Creator, all of this should be known by the midwife. She may one day encounter such a case and handle it as she should.
Chapter LXXVI.
In the removal of the dead fetus.
If you treat the dead fetus as mentioned in the classification of treatments and it does not come out, forcing you to use your hand, then you should consider: if the woman is strong and free from any symptoms that could cause harm, she should lie down on her back.
Her head should be inclined downward, her legs elevated, and a helper stabilizes her from both sides or ties her to the bed to prevent her body from tilting when extending the fetus.
Then, the cervix is moistened with damp oils, saliva from the chamomile flower and fennel seed, and flaxseed. The midwife should then rub her hand with these oils and salves and gently insert it into the womb. She should look for a suitable place to insert the forceps to deliver the fetus.
Look, if the fetus is positioned so that it descends on its head, then hooks should be inserted into its eyes, or nape, or mouth, or palate, or under its chin, or in the places near the ribs, or beneath the sternum.
If, however, it descends on its legs, then in the groin and middle ribs; hold the hook with the right hand and make its fold between the left hand's fingers, and gently insert the hand and hook into some of these places mentioned.
Until you reach something hollow, then insert another hook opposite it, or a third if necessary, to ensure an equal pull and prevent any leaning towards one side; then extend it levelly, not just straight, but move it in every direction.
To facilitate its exit, as is done with a tooth when it is knocked out, and in between, the extension should be relaxed; if any part becomes trapped, the midwife should grease some fingers and insert them to turn what is stuck; if some of the fetus comes out, then move the hooks to other places.
It should be slightly raised so that she does this until the entire fetus is delivered; if a hand comes out before others and cannot be pushed back due to compression, it should be wrapped with a cloth and then pulled until it comes out completely, then cut off.
Whether in the wrist or the forearm, and similarly in the other hand and feet, if the fetus' head is large and experiences pressure during delivery, or if there is water collected in its head, then you should insert a sharp instrument between the fingers.
And you should make an incision with it to expel the water, or use the instrument called a 'mushdakh', whose image is presented with the images of other instruments in the following chapter.
Similarly, if the fetus' head is extremely large, you should make an incision or use the mushdakh as we mentioned to crack the skull, then extract the bones with pincers. If the head emerges and becomes compressed at the shoulder, it should be cut until the moisture in the chest drains.
If the chest compresses, then if it does not yield and cannot be delivered, cut as you are able. If it is below the abdomen and swollen or contains pus, you should press it until the moisture drains from it.
If the fetus is in a breech position, it is easily pulled and aligned towards the womb. If it becomes compressed at the abdomen or chest, you should grasp it with a cloth wrapped around your hand and make an incision at the abdomen or chest until the contents drain.
If all other members are removed and the head is withdrawn and retained, the midwife should insert her left hand. If the cervical opening is open, she should insert her hand into the cervix and seek the head with it, then draw it towards the cervical opening with her fingers, after which she should insert a hook or two and draw it with it.
If the cervical opening is closed due to a hot, painful tumor, it should not be forced open, but rather cold, moist, greasy substances should be applied, along with remedies and sitting in water that relaxes and lubricates.
If the fetus is on its side and can be aligned, use what we mentioned for a live fetus; if that is not possible, it should be cut and removed, ensuring no part of the placenta remains inside. Once you have finished treating the patient, apply the remedies mentioned for hot tumors in the womb.
If bleeding occurs, it should be treated in a contraction bath and with all other remedies; I have seen a woman who became pregnant again after her previous pregnancy resulted in the fetus dying inside her.
Then, after a long time, another tumor appeared in her cervix, which swelled until it opened and started to discharge pus. I was called to treat her, and I treated her for a long time, but the wound did not heal, so I applied some strong, drawing ointments to it.
Then, after some days, a bone emerged from the site, and another one after that. I was amazed, as the abdomen is not a place for bones. I presumed it to be from the bones of a dead fetus, so I examined the wound and extracted many bones from the fetus's head.
I continued to do this until I extracted numerous bones from it, and the woman was in good health and lived for a considerable time, during which a small amount of pus formed at the site. I have only shared this rare case here.
Because it contains knowledge and assistance for the skilled physician who uses his hands for treatment.
Chapter 77.
It includes images of the instruments needed to extract the fetus.
Image of a spiral instrument used to open the cervix.
This device, used to open the cervix, is made of two spiral instruments attached to a handle. One should be softer than the other. It can be crafted from either ivory or aloe wood, with each handle having a thickness equivalent to two fingers.
Two holes, each with a diameter of one finger and a length of one and a half cubits, are located in the center of the two planks. They are made from the same type of wood and their depth is such that their length is half a cubit or slightly more, while their width is approximately two fingers or slightly more.
These are the ones that enter the cervix to open it when you rotate the loops, another instrument similar to this, more delicate and lighter.
It is made from ebony or yew wood in the form of claws, except that each has two holes at its end, with a length of one cubit and a width of two fingers. If you wish to open the cervix using these, you would insert them accordingly.
Then, you place the woman on a bed with her legs relaxed and spread apart. Insert these two holes, clenched together, into the cervix, holding the instrument's end below her thighs. Open your hand with the instrument as you would with claws, adjusting its tension as needed to achieve the desired level of cervical opening. Until the midwife achieves what she desires, another spiral instrument mentioned by the ancients.
An image of the instrument used to expel the fetus.
An image of the instrument used to stretch the fetus's head.
The scissors resembles a tooth at the tip, as you see, and it can be made rectangular like claws in this image. You see its teeth are like those of a saw, with which it cuts and smooths.
Image of a cannon:
Image of a fishing hook:
This hook has a slightly thicker shaft to prevent it from breaking when pulling the catch, image of a two-pronged hook.
Image of two wide scissors for cutting the catch:
These tools, the more diverse they are and the better equipped the artisan, the faster their work progresses and the higher their standing among people for their skill. Therefore, do not look down on any tool being prepared; one day, it will definitely be needed.
Chapter 87
In removing the placenta.
If the placenta becomes stuck after childbirth, instruct the patient to grip herself tightly, then cough forcefully while you press on her mouth and nostrils. If it passes out this way, otherwise take a tool (a forceps or similar) and carefully extract it.
Make a hole in the cover and insert therein open herbs such as fennel, chamomile, mint, camomile, sage, endive, and artemisia, or some of them. Moisten them with water and place over fire. Then place a silver tube on the hole in the cover, with the other end in the cervix.
Hold it until the steam reaches the bottom of the uterus, then sneeze as mentioned. If the placenta still does not come out after this treatment, the midwife should dip her left hand in shiraz oil or elephant's spit.
Then insert it into the vagina and examine the placenta. If it is contracted, grasp it and slowly stretch it until it comes out. If it is attached deeply within the uterus, insert the hand as described earlier, find the placenta, and gently pull it with caution.
So as not to cause the uterus to fall with excessive pulling, it should be gently moved to the sides, right and left. Then the amount of pulling can be increased, and it will respond and release its adhesion at that point. If the cervix is closed, the treatment has already been described through sneezing, the pot, and herbs.
If it does not come out with all the treatments described, avoid excessive pulling. Instead, tie any remaining part to the cervix and apply a four-ingredient ointment (as described) which will soften it after a few days.
It dissolves and exits, except that if it putrefies, a foul odor ascends to the stomach and head, harming the patient. Therefore, smoke should be used that is appropriate.
Therefore, some pioneers experimented with smoke from crafts and dried figs, an image of the apparatus used to vaporize women during menstruation, retention of the placenta, and other such conditions.
It is made of lead, resembling a funnel, or copper, with the narrow end inserted into the vagina and the wide end over the fire, where incense is placed on the embers, held until that incense disappears, then replaced with another.
Chapter Seventy-Nine.
In the treatment of hemorrhoids without perforation.
It may happen that many boys are born with hemorrhoids not perforating, but blocked by a thin membrane. The midwife should pierce this membrane with her finger, or otherwise, she should tie it tightly with a sharp scalpel, being careful not to touch the muscle.
Then, she should place a woolen pad soaked in wine and oil on it and treat it with ointments until it heals. If she fears that it may get blocked, she should insert a lead pipe into the opening for several days and remove it when the child wants to defecate.
The blockage of the anus may also be caused by a healed wound or a tumor, which should be incised and then treated with the remedies and plaster we have mentioned.
Chapter Eight
In the treatment of hemorrhoids occurring in the lower regions.
Hemorrhoids occurring in the lower regions are a complication and thickening that occurs near the anus from the outside or in the space from one side, and the hemorrhoid may be one or more.
If this complication persists, it will open and release a white watery or thin pus-like discharge, and some of these hemorrhoids may protrude into the rectum and colon, but if they are not protruding, they can be identified by what is discharged with the patient's stool and flatulence during defecation.
And sometimes worms may emerge from them, and they can be hemorrhoids if they are in the space and protrude into the bladder or penis, or they can extend to the hip joint and tailbone, and what is known as a hemorrhoid that protrudes into the anus without being connected to anything else.
Insert your index finger into the anus and use a thin needle made of copper or iron to enter the hemorrhoid if it is not curved, but if it has a curve, insert a fine needle made of lead or a horsehair into it.
If you do not feel the probe or a hair in your finger, and you do not sense anything at all and no excreta or odor or worm emerges from the wound as we have mentioned, then know that it is non-infectious and you should proceed with treatment.
If the fistula is open to the bladder or urethra, its indication is the passage of urine through it and its inability to heal with medication. However, if it is open to a joint in the thigh or to the coccyx, its sign is the reach of the probe to those areas.
If there is no curvature towards the bone, and pain in a specific direction, and pus always emerges from it, and no treatment takes effect, and it does not heal with ointment, then there is no cure for these types of fistulas.
Treating them is a futile endeavor for those who attempt it without knowledge, as for the fistulas that are not open or chronic, healing can be achieved with iron, as I will describe and as I have experienced, by having the patient lie on their back with their head lowered.
Have the patient raise their legs and tilt their knees towards their stomach. Then, insert a copper or lead probe into the fistula if there is a curvature, until you know where the probe ends. If the patient feels it towards the anus, you should insert your index finger into the anus.
If you feel that the probe has penetrated all the way through your finger, exposed and without feeling any membrane or flesh between your finger and it, then know for certain that it is penetrated and do not tire yourself trying to treat it, as we said before.
They say that it heals in some people rarely, and the treatment that is hoped to be beneficial includes applying a hot, thin iron according to the size of the fistula, as mentioned before, and inserting it into the fistula carefully until it reaches near the anus, then withdrawing it and repeating this process twice or three times.
Until you know that all the excess flesh accumulated, resembling a bird's feather pipe, has burned, then treat it with a wet twist in butter, to remove the burnt flesh, and afterwards treat it with healing ointments, if it heals.
If the probe does not penetrate your finger in the anus and there is a thick membrane of flesh or membrane between them, and you see the fistula below the skin surface, then make an incision at the beginning of the fistula. As you pass the probe through the incision, while it is in the fistula, until you reach where the tip of the probe ends, remove the probe and discard it, then clean away the accumulated flesh resembling a bird's feather pipe, leaving nothing behind.
Then treat it with adhesive plasters until it heals. If blood overcomes you and prevents your operation on those meats, the best thing to do and most beneficial is to cauterize it with fire or a sharp medicine, because cauterization with fire combines two good qualities: it burns that excess flesh.
Cut the blood and dry the humors, then treat it with moist cataplasms of butter or powdered sulfur mixed with oil, until the site purifies and those burnt meats come out in the pus, then subsequently treat the wound with adhesive plasters that promote the growth of hard flesh.
These are the medicines that contract and dry; if they succeed, healing is complete and relapse is unlikely. If the fistula has penetrated deeply into the rectum and receded from the surface of the body, insert your finger into the rectum and explore it.
If you feel the probe and there is a barrier of membrane or flesh between it and you, and it is close to penetrating, then the only course of action is to be ambitious and hopeful, using one of three methods: either cauterize it as we have said.
Or cut it until you reach its bottom, so that you can insert cataplasms and treat it from close range, but do not overdo the cutting lest you sever the muscle surrounding the rectum, causing the patient to suffer from involuntary defecation. Then treat it as we have mentioned; perhaps it will heal as we said.
Either you penetrate and pierce that veil after splitting it near the anus, as we have mentioned, either with a probe or with another sharp instrument, and then clean all the coagulated flesh in the wound to where you can by probing.
Then, close the wound and the incision with all its openings until it heals, leaving the fistula open inside the anus, which will be lighter for the patient, and the fistula may be formed in this way.
If you insert the probe into the fistula, which is on one side of the anus towards the body surface with the skin and ring of the anus, take then a probe with a pointed end like a shoemaker's needle in this shape: .
Insert a threaded thread made of five or more threads into it, then insert the probe with the thread into the fistula until it reaches its bottom. If it is drained into the edge of the anus from inside near the surface.
Then, pull the thread out of that hole by inserting your finger into the anus and pulling the end of the thread, gathering both ends and tightening them, leaving it for a day or two. Whenever the thread cuts through the flesh, tighten it well until the tissues between the thread ends cut off and fall away, then treat the wound until it heals and recovers.
If the fistula's orifice is not draining, drain it as best you can, but be aware that it may extend deeply and you should not attempt to cut into the muscle to do so, then proceed as we have mentioned until it heals.
An image of the scalpel used to incise cysts, the blade should be extremely sharp on one side and blunter on the other to avoid cutting through unnecessary tissue as you can see.
Chapter Eighty-One.
In the treatment of hemorrhoids from which blood flows, cutting them, and healing fissures.
Hemorrhoids are of two types: either they are inside the rectum, resembling small red blowers, or they look like grapes, with smaller and larger ones, and blood always flows from them.
They can be single or numerous, and they may be outside the rectum at the extremities, but those outside are usually less moist, releasing yellow fluid or a little blood, always flowing, and resembling the color of the body.
For the treatment of those inside the rectum, you should instruct the patient to defecate and move around until the anus opens, revealing the hemorrhoids, then quickly grasp them with forceps or your fingernail and cut them at their base; if they do not stay in place due to their moisture and laxity.
Remove the skin with a coarse cloth or a piece of gauze, pull it with your fingers, then cut it and sprinkle some sharp particles on it to act as a cauterizing agent, or use a fako (a surgical instrument) as mentioned in the chapter on cauterization.
Then treat it with all other remedies until it heals, if the hemorrhoid does not respond to treatment and come out, inject the patient with a solution that causes a slight irritation to wash out what is in the hemorrhoid and quickly withdraw when the patient moves. The treatment of hemorrhoids outside the anus is easy and simple.
Take it with your fingernail or hook it to a fishing line and cut it, then treat it as mentioned until it heals, and if one dislikes cutting with iron, they should use a needle with a twisted thread.
Then pull the wart upwards and push it out with the needle at its base from the other side, wrap the ends of the thread under the needle while it is perpendicular, tighten the wart firmly, then tie the thread and remove the needle, do this for all warts, leaving one untouched.
To drain any excess blood, then place a cloth soaked in rose fat or asphalt on the hemorrhoid and instruct the patient to rest, leaving it until it falls off. Once the warts drop, treat them with ointments and other remedies until they heal.
And as for the treatment of cracks, it often arises from dryness and a stagnation in the humors. If it persists and no remedy is effective, then you should remove it with a surgical knife or your fingernail until it becomes moist and the upper layer that prevents its healing is removed.
Then treat it until it heals as it should. If it does not heal, repeat the process with greater force, causing it to bleed and slough off. Then treat it again, for it will heal.

In the treatment of reversed nails, unreversed nails, warts, and dry moles.
A nail is a round knot, circular in shape and similar to the body's color, found throughout the body, particularly on the soles of the feet and between the toes, causing pain while walking.
One should make a cut around the nail, using a hook or a hook-and-line tool to extract it from its root, then treat it. If desired, as mentioned previously, you can apply heat to it. As for warts (thallus), each one is a small, rough, round protrusion above the surface of the skin.
And often, warts are treated by stretching and cutting them, or drilling them with a silk thread or a hair, until they fall off. If you wish, you can cauterize them with fire or sharp medication as previously mentioned.
And warts, both upright and inverted, can be removed with the instrument mentioned in the treatment for a ulcer, while the ulcer is a small, rough protrusion on the surface of the body, deeply embedded, and if it gets cold, it feels similar to a sting of a bee.
It occurs on the entire body, most commonly on the hands, and its treatment involves taking a tube of duck or eagle feather, placing it over the ulcer, and rotating your hand with the tube to cut off the surrounding tissue.
It cuts into the flesh, removing the ulcer from its base, and you can use a copper or iron tube in the same manner as depicted below.
The upper part of the tube should be rigid and cylindrical to facilitate its grip and rotation by the fingers, and you can cauterize the ulcer as previously mentioned in the chapter on burning warts.

In illustrations of the instruments used for injections in the treatment of rectal diseases, diarrhea, and colic.
The syringe may be made of silver, or porcelain, or copper that is hollowed out or hammered, and from these instruments small and large ones are made according to the users' needs. For use in treating young children, the syringes should be small and delicate, suitable for narrow or painful rectums. An example of a large syringe:
The upper cone of the syringe, which is attached to the tube, is wide and has a barrier where the tube is secured. As you can see, one side has two holes and the opposite side has a single hole.
The hole's capacity should be according to the thickness of the rod, or slightly thicker, and the tube for inserting medications, made from a bladder of an animal or thin sheep skin, is shaped like a small basket with a diameter of one finger.
Many holes are drilled as it rotates, with a space of approximately one finger between each hole. Then, a tight thread is inserted into these holes, made from twisted woolen yarn of about ten stitches or so, and the tube is gathered like a basket. If the drug is to be injected, tighten the nozzle between the two stones firmly, then inject it. This is a diagram of the syringe and the hole.
To perform the injection, fill the syringe or bladder with the drug while it is warm to the patient's comfort level. Be cautious that it is neither too hot nor too cold. Then, have the patient lie on their back and raise their legs above their head.
A pad or sheet is placed underneath, and the tip of the syringe is lubricated with fat, egg white, horse spit, or similar. Then, it is gently inserted into the anus, and the assistant squeezes the syringe firmly to expel all the contents into the intestine.
Then, the syringe is removed and the patient's legs are raised against a wall. If the drug prompts a bowel movement, the patient should try to expel it. If they sleep through the night with no result, the procedure can be repeated (with caution). This method is specifically for treating diarrhea, and the injection should be made quickly so that the patient recovers fully.
If there are hemorrhoids or painful growths in the anus, use a gentle, smooth syringe, such as those used to inject children. Here is a diagram of a soft, flexible syringe with its skin tightly stretched.
Chapter Forty-Eight
In the treatment of wounds.
Having discussed in detail the treatment of abscesses, I shall here outline their management by manual and medicinal means, as follows: surgical procedures vary according to the nature of the wound and the part of the body it affects.
The causes of wounds are numerous, such as a blow from a stone, a sword slash, a knife cut, a spear stab, or an arrowhead, among other things.
As for wounds according to their location on the body, there are those affecting the head, neck, chest, abdomen, or liver, among other organs.
I shall now describe the treatment of certain wounds as a guide and rule for all others, beginning with simple head wounds, as their complex varieties will be discussed in the initial chapters of this book.
I say that if a simple wound occurs on the head, not resulting from a bone fracture, and it is merely a contusion from an object such as a stone, and the skin is broken but there is no deep tissue damage, and one fears the development of a serious swelling, then one should promptly apply a cold compress to alleviate the pain. Do not delay this and drain the blood from him according to its strength if there is nothing preventing the phlebotomy, especially if the blood that comes out from the wound is slight, and let the phlebotomy be from the opposite side of the wounded part.
Warn the patient against fullness, drinking, and heavy foods; if there is something preventing the phlebotomy, he should reduce his food intake and avoid meat and drinks, and apply a hot compress soaked in rose fat alone or with a drink that has a contracting effect.
If the hot tumor is not present, apply pressure to the wound if it is still fresh with its blood and has not been changed by the dry air that I will describe below; otherwise, use some ointments.
Until pus is formed, then treat it until healing occurs; if the wound is large, from a sword cut or similar, and its edges do not meet with sutures, then sew it up as I will describe in the stitching of abdominal wounds.
If the skin has exposed the bone and is hanging loose, with only a slight attachment to a hook, cut it off and treat the wound with medications that strengthen the flesh, replacing the skin, and instruct the patient to eat foods that are firm like heads, skulls, etc.
If there is decay in the skin that does not adhere to the bone, cut off all the decaying parts and throw it away, then treat it. If, in these wounds, a vein or a vessel is bleeding and the blood does not stop with drugs, examine the vein.
If it is affected but does not fall apart, cut it off with a scalpel and tie it. If, in the event that what we mentioned does not help, it needs to be scraped until the blood stops. If these wounds are small and simple, their treatment is easy and requires only applying this powdery substance to stop the bleeding.
Before it is affected by the air, the recipe for the powdery substance is to take a part of resin, two parts of camphor, and three parts of slaked lime or unslaked lime, grind them all together, sift them, and fill the wound with this mixture, tightening it well to ensure a good seal.
It is then sealed with blood and further secured from above with bandages. Leave it as is without loosening it until the swelling subsides, for the treatment will not leave the wound until it heals. The lime itself may be sufficient if resin and camphor are not available.
This method can also be effective with vinegar in many deep wounds if it is applied skillfully and secured, and the wounds are fresh with their own blood, unless they have been affected by air, especially during summer.
There is no effective treatment for this condition other than applying some well-prepared ointments or a porridge made from barley flour with water and honey to promote the discharge of pus, followed by treating it with all other remedies until healing occurs.
If a fracture of the bone occurs with the wound, and it is minor, then draw it with gauze, as I have mentioned the treatment for fractures of the skull in the section on neck surgery. If the wound is in the neck, there is no difference in its treatment from a simple wound to the head.
If a nerve in the neck has been cut, or an artery (if it is a nerve), there is no remedy other than avoiding treatment with anything that causes severe contraction like tongs or similar objects, as they can harm and spasm the nerve.
Never apply anything cold to the wound, as the nerve's essence is cold and its connection to the brain, which is the most noble of organs, requires gentle treatments such as warm compresses with water or oil infused with rose petals and saffron.
If you also wash it with pure water and other metallic stones in the same manner, along with moist ointments, and for a large wound, use stitching or binding it with bandages, then treat it until healing occurs.
If a wound has depth and there is an accumulation of pus at its base, drain it in the lowest point. If a vessel (artery) is severed within the wound and its blood is flowing, cut or tie it off or sew it if necessary.
If the wound has severed some or all of the pharyngeal muscles and the jugulars are intact, sew the edges of the skin together over the pharynx using a catheter (laryngoscopy) without touching the larynx. Smooth it out and return it to its natural shape, then tighten it firmly and leave it for several days.
Then treat it with ointments that have a drying and constricting effect until it heals. If the wound has affected the bone, open it and remove any fragments of bone that can be extracted or, if you cannot, leave it until the wound becomes gangrenous and eventually heals, making it easier to remove.
If the wound is still fresh, sprinkle it with the described powders to prevent infection. If, however, the wound becomes gangrenous and forms a fistula, treat it as described in the relevant section (on chest and shoulder surgery).
If the wound is from a spear or knife and you see that it has depth, check if air comes out when the patient breathes; if so, it is a mortal wound. If there is no depth and the wound is still fresh with blood, do not immediately sprinkle it with powders or tighten it, as this may cause the blood to become trapped in its depths.
It is directed towards the heart, killing the patient, but make it with an attractive balm and dissolve it in the day twice. If a balm is not available, place a worn-out cotton ball in the wound to absorb the secretions and let the patient sleep on the wound.
If the accumulation [of pus] has occurred, and even if it has been three days or more since the wound was inflicted, and there is no spasmodic pain, no poor circulation, or difficulty in breathing, and you observe that the patient's overall condition is good, then know that the wound is healing and treat it with tourniquets and other remedies until it is cured.
If it cannot be seen and the discharge continues constantly, then know that it has become a fistula. Treat it from its opening, and if the wound is on the chest or back, treat it as mentioned before with sutures.
If it is large or involves multiple fragments, whether small or large, if it has affected the bone and cut off pieces of it, examine the wound and promptly remove those fragments if they are clean. If they are not clean, leave them until they heal.
If the wound becomes gangrenous, it will be easier to remove the affected parts. As for other wounds in various members, their treatment should follow the same guidelines as mentioned.
Chapter LXXXVIII.
In abdominal surgery, removal and suturing of the intestines.
The wound that exposes the abdomen may be large or small or medium, and a large one might expose the intestines or several parts of the intestine, making their reinsertion and suturing more difficult and challenging.
And while a small wound may also be difficult in another way, as it requires more effort to return the intestines to their position, if they are not immediately reinserted, they can swell and become stiff, making their insertion even more challenging; thus, the medium-sized wound is the best, as it does not present the same difficulties in returning the intestines as the larger or smaller wounds.
Know that the suturing of the abdomen has four aspects; two general sutures suitable for suturing the abdomen and other body wounds, and two specific sutures that are more suited to abdominal surgery.
I will describe each step in detail, starting with the first: if the wound is small and part of the intestine protrudes, but its reinsertion is difficult, this can be due to one of two reasons: either the wound is indeed very small as we mentioned, or the intestine has become inflated due to previous exposure to air.
If this is the case, then you should warm it by immersing a sponge or wet cloth in lukewarm water alone, or water in which rhubarb, fennel, and anise have been cooked, and pass it through the intestines until the bloating resolves.
And it may do this through a drink that has a constricting effect, which is better than water alone in resolving bloating. If you see the bloating has dissipated, moisten the intestines with water in which fennel or rice has been cooked, for it will facilitate its entrance with ease.
If, after this treatment, it does not return, make a small incision in the bandage using the instrument used to cut pipes, and the initial treatment is better if it can be accomplished. However, one only resorts to making an incision after necessity arises and all other methods have failed, and here is an image of the instrument.
It has one curved side with a limited range, while the other side is not limited. The thin end is not as sharp as the scalpel but is slightly convex. It is a tool similar to a small spear, as you will see. If the wound widens and the intestines enter, it should return to its natural shape.
Its specific position is best if possible, and if the incision is wide, especially in the lower abdomen, the patient should lie on their back with their legs higher than their head. If it is in the upper abdomen, they should raise their head and chest higher than the rest of their body.
If the incision is on one side of the abdomen, always intend and aim for the side where surgery is higher in rank than the other. This is to be applied both to major surgeries and intermediate ones.
In minor surgeries, place the patient as you are able to, then have a helpful assistant hold the incision with both hands, gathering the edges and revealing them to the one who does the stitching one by one.
And this is the general method of simple stitching: take a needle or several needles suitable for the wound's size, leave a margin from the edge of the incision equal to the thickness of the thumb, and sew with one needle without threading it with thread on both edges of the skin. With the edges of the peritoneum underneath the skin, from inside to the point where it penetrates on that side, having gathered the edges of the skin and peritoneum, creating four folds, then tie with a doubled thread around the needle several times on both sides until the wound's edges are firmly sealed together.
Then, leave a margin equal to the thickness of a finger and sew with another needle, interweaving it with the thread as you did with the first needle. Continue doing this until you have treated all parts of the wound, using needles of varying thicknesses between the firm and the delicate.
Because very fine needles cut meat quickly, and thick ones are difficult to insert into the skin, they should be of intermediate softness and thickness, and the needle should not be inserted at the edge of the skin near the flesh.
To prevent the meat from tearing quickly and the wound from opening before healing, and also to avoid excessive stitching which may hinder the wound's closure, the ends of the needles should be cut off to prevent harm to the patient during sleep, and cloth strips can be attached to each side to hold the needle ends.
Leave it until you are certain that the wound has healed, and this type of stitching with needles is most effective for minor wounds, as a single needle or two may be sufficient to sew them up.
As for the technique of stitching for a second-degree wound, it involves bringing together all four edges (the skin and peritoneum) in a single pass with a needle containing a moderate length of twisted thread suitable in softness and thickness, then, once the edges have been joined, the needle is returned from the direction it started.
To ensure the thread forms a mesh across the wound, creating stitching similar to that used for bags to secure goods, and to place a space between each stitch, approximately the thickness of a small finger - this type of stitching is familiar to everyone.
And with this stitching, a surgical case was presented to me of a man who had been cut by a knife, and the breach in the surgery was more than an inch, and about two inches of the middle intestine had protruded, and the wound was located in the middle of the abdomen.
After 24 hours, I managed to reduce the intestine back into the wound, and it healed in about 15 days. I treated him until he recovered completely and lived for many years afterwards, performing all his activities, while doctors had judged that he would never recover.
It is remarkable that I did not treat it with a salve, as I was in a place where there were no medicinal supplies. I would apply old cotton to the wound twice a day and ensure it was washed with honey water until it healed.
As for one of the specific types of stitching, I will mention it as described by Galen: Start with stitching through the skin and insert the needle from outside to inside. Once the needle has passed through the skin and muscle in a straight line across the entire length of the abdomen.
I left the edge of the peritoneum on the side where I inserted the needle, and passed the needle through its other edge from inside to outside in the other layer of peritoneum. Once done, I re-inserted it a second time into this same edge of the peritoneum, but this time from outside to inside.
Abandon the edge of the peritoneum on this side, and insert the needle from within to without through the other edge, and as you insert it into the peritoneum, also insert it into the edge of the omentum opposite to it, until it has entirely penetrated it.
Then, starting from this same side, trace it along the edge of the peritoneum on the opposite side, and remove the needle from the skin next to it, then insert it back into that skin, following the edge of the peritoneum on the other side with this edge from the omentum.
Remove it from the skin on his side, and repeat this process, doing so multiple times until the surgery is entirely sewed shut, with a stitching technique similar to that used for sewing fur to fur.
By sewing the peritoneum once from one side with the edge of the skin, leaving it open on the other side until it is empty; as for the second type of stitching, which Galen also mentioned, his exact words are:
It involves sewing it in a way similar to how certain healers sew, by bringing together each part with its corresponding counterpart, naturally aligned. This is done by joining the edge of the peritoneum to its other edge, and the edge of the omentum to its opposite edge.
The needle should be inserted into the margin of the peritoneum closest to you from the outside and pushed through solely into that margin, leaving the other margin of the peritoneum untouched. Then, the needle is withdrawn and inserted again from the outside into both margins of the peritoneum, and then withdrawn once more.
Then, it should be pushed through from inside to outside in the other margin of the peritoneum on the opposite side. This method of stitching is superior to the general, simple stitching mentioned, as this is what Galen described, and some have said that a stomach stitch can be done with just two needles. This is done by inserting a single thread and beginning with the needle from your side, pushing it through to the other side, and then inserting the other needle from the opposite side, following the same stitching method as for joining sheets.
Know that if the wound is in the middle of the belly, stitching it is more difficult than stitching other parts of the abdomen. As for treating the wound, its treatment is like that of all other wounds, for if you succeed in reaching the fresh wound with its blood before air changes it and return the intestines to their place, tracing and stitching them tightly, then apply hot cauterization.
If the wound has been altered by air, apply some preparations that you have made to it until pus forms and the stitches fall out, and the peritoneum and the peritonium heal, then treat it as you would any other wound until it heals.
If medicines are not available, apply a compress with old cotton pus and change it twice a day as taught, until healing occurs; in most cases, you will not need further treatment if the surgeries are simple, but if you fear that the wound might involve vital organs causing pain.
You should dip soft lint in warm oil or rose fat and apply it around the areas between the groin and armpit; if there is pain or putrefaction in the bowels, this often occurs, so inject a hot black astringent drink.
Especially if the putrefaction has reached the intestines and become an open wound into the abdomen, know that what was thick in the intestines heals more easily, while what was thin is harder to heal.
As for the cecum, known as the "psoas," it does not heal from surgery at all, due to the abundance of its blood vessels, their thickness, the fragility of its substance, and its proximity to nerve nature; however, if the debris from the wound is fresh and moist, return it to its place, regardless of whether it's the cecum or another part of the intestine.
If it has been some time and it has turned green or black, you should tighten a thread above the place that turned black to prevent bleeding, as there are veins and arteries in the debris; then cut the tie below that point.
And make the ends of the thread attached from below the surgical incision, extending outside of it, to facilitate its removal when the wound pus drains and the wound heals, referring to the wound that occurs in the intestine, if there is a tear in the intestine, small in size.
In some cases, I have encountered individuals with a wound in the abdomen caused by a spear thrust, and the injury was on the right side of the stomach. I treated the wound, but did not expect a cure, as it became a fistula through which feces and gas exited. I continued to tend to it until the wound healed and the site became sealed. However, I was concerned that a complication might occur within the patient's body, so I closely monitored them, and thankfully, no further complications arose, and their condition remained excellent. Indeed, the patient should eat, drink, engage in sexual activity, use the bathroom, and continue with their daily routine while being served. Some experienced individuals have noted that when a small tear occurs in the intestine, it should be sutured accordingly.
This involves taking a live ant with its head intact, gathering the edges of the wound together, placing the ant with its mouth open on the wound, and when it bites down, its jaws will stick, ensuring it doesn't let go. Then, another ant is placed nearby.
Continue to do this by counting several layers of fat around the wound, then close and sew it. These heads will remain attached to the intestines until they heal and there will be no harm to the patient, it is even possible to close the intestines with a thin thread.
The thread attached to the animal's intestines, after being inserted into a needle, is taken from the intestine in a continuous manner, then a fine, twisted cotton thread is tied to its end and this thread is then passed through the needle. In this, the thread of the intestine is used to close the intestines and then returned to the abdominal cavity. This type of stitching with fat and intestine is done in pursuit of success and hope.
However, if the wound is large and wide, especially in one of the thin intestines, there is no remedy or cure at all.
Chapter LXXXVI.
On the treatment of the common cold and fistulas.
Know that every wound or swelling that persists and becomes a ulcer, and does not heal and continues to produce pus, is called, in general, a fistula, and we call it a 'common cold' (in this context).
It is indeed a complex, solid, white mass without pain, with a cavity like that of bird feathers.
Therefore, some have named it a "feather," and sometimes it can be moist, constantly discharging pus, and at other times the moisture may disappear. It can be abundant or scarce, thick or thin.
In the classification when discussing surgical wounds, it has been stated that every ulcer that does not heal or develop good flesh is due to one of nine reasons: either a lack of blood in the body, its poor quality, or because there is hard flesh inside or on the edges that prevents the growth of healthy new tissue. Either the ulcer is deeply infected and filthy, or it is inherently putrid with bad material, or the treatment is inappropriate, or there is a breakdown in the town due to an epidemic, or some specific condition affecting the town.
Either the ulcer is deeply infected and filthy, or it is inherently putrid with bad material, or the treatment is inappropriate, or there is a breakdown in the town due to an epidemic, or some specific condition affecting the town. As discussed in the city of Saragossa, where the maturation of diseases is difficult and the healing of tumors slow, either due to a single bone or several bones present. All these causes, symptoms, and treatments with remedies have been explained in detail in the classification.
Here, I must introduce you to the treatment of fistulas and abscesses that are treated manually. Be aware that fistulas can occur in all parts of the body, ending in large veins, arteries, or nerves.
To the peritoneum, or to the intestine, or to the bladder, or to a rib, or to a vertebra of the spine, or to a joint of a composite joint such as the hand or foot, and some extend close to a major organ, and so on.
If any of these ruptures has not reached the mentioned locations, which I have requested and hoped for treatment, then it is one of the difficult-to-cure diseases that do not accept cure or care, and it is a source of effort and ignorance.
And if you wish to know this, take a probe of copper or iron, if the rupture runs straight, examine it with it; if there is a curvature in the rupture, use a thin lead probe, because lead softens its body.
It will slide easily at the point of entry and bend towards the curvature; if the rupture has multiple openings, and you cannot locate them with a probe, then inject moisture into one of the openings, for the moisture will flow towards the other openings and discharge.
Then, conduct a thorough examination in any way you can to determine if there is a bone or nerve, or if the depth of the rupture is distant or close, or if it is a single rupture with multiple openings, and stop at nothing to understand all this through your knowledge and observation of the patient's symptoms and pain when you touch the area.
And such signs and causes of the tumor, if you stand before them as facts, then turn to treatment with confidence, that is, to observe, for if it be so.
If the fistula appears near or in a healthy place, far from a joint or nerve or artery or vein or any of the places mentioned above, then make an incision in the fistula as described above and remove the necrotic tissue and excessive flesh.
And if any flesh or papilloma grows in its mouth, treat it until it heals. If the fistula is deep and straight, make a deep incision into it as much as possible, then clean it of all necrotic flesh.
Then use the foul-smelling drugs in hot applications and insert them into the depth of the fistula, which you can reach with iron, do this multiple times until that sharp drug consumes all the remains of the corruption in the fistula's bottom.
Then force it with ointments that promote tissue regeneration until it heals. If it does not heal in this way, cauterize it as described earlier. If the cause of the fistula is a bone and this is confirmed, examine it and make an incision as I have instructed you, unless prevented by some obstacle.
If it reveals a nerve, vein, or main member as we said, and the bone is exposed with some corruption and blackening, remove it until the corruption disappears, then treat it with what binds the flesh until it heals. If it does not heal and pus continues as before.
Know that you have not completely removed the corruption, so uncover everything once more and examine and purify it with all your effort. If it heals, then know that this corruption is deep and far from other corruptions, so uncover it again.
If possible, examine and purify it with all your effort. If it is a small corrupt bone that can be pulled out, then use delicate hooks suitable for the task.
If there are many bones, examine how to draw them all without effort, and do not leave any behind. If something prevents you from drawing them, such as a ligament, and cutting it poses no danger, then cut the ligaments and flesh to free the bones.
If it is not possible to remove the bones at once, then apply something to the wound that will preserve it from putrefaction and leave it for several days until the flesh and ligaments around the bones rot. Take care to keep the wound open so that the gap you created does not heal.
Instead, if you are concerned about this, apply a cotton ball soaked in powdered sulfur with oil or a cotton ball soaked in Egyptian ointment or one of the green ointments. If these ligaments rot and the bones become loose, it will be easy to remove them.
If it is a single large bone, such as the tibia or femur, and only the face of it is corrupt, then remove it thoroughly until that darkness and corruption disappear. Then close the wound. However, if a large part is corrupt and the corruption has reached the marrow of the bone, then it must be split open.
Cut it entirely at the point where corruption ends, then treat it until it heals, and I will tell you of a case that befall a man in his leg to serve as an example and aid to your treatment; this man was young.
Around thirty years old, he experienced pain in his leg due to a movement within the body, causing the materials inside to reach the leg and swell greatly. It was not caused by anything external, and as time passed with incorrect treatment by doctors, the swelling opened up.
Much material drained from it, and it was poorly treated, causing the leg to become gangrened with numerous openings that exuded pus and bodily fluids. It was treated by a group of doctors for about two years, but there was no skilled surgeon among them.
He came to me, and I saw the leg with great drainage from these openings, and the man's body had wasted, and his skin had turned yellow. I inserted a probe into one of these openings, which reached the bone, then I examined all the openings.
I found that they opened into each other from all sides of the leg, so I incised and split one of these openings to expose some of the bone. It was rotten, consumed, blackened, and putrefied, with holes that went through to the marrow, which I exposed.
Removing a Decayed Bone: I believe that the only corruption of the bone is what I have cut and spread, and having excised it, I then applied healing remedies to prolong the healing process. However, it did not heal, so I reopened the wound to examine the bone once again.
I found the corruption attached to the bone, so I spread what was visible of that corruption, and then tried to force it to heal, but it did not mend or fuse. I then examined it again, and also removed small pieces of the bone, attempting to heal it, but even after cutting off about an inch of the bone, it still would not heal.
I then extracted it with its core and healed it with remedies, which fused quickly and cured him. This process needed to be repeated due to the patient's frail condition, lack of endurance, and the risk of death, as he would often suffer from severe fainting spells caused by excessive vomiting.
And the flesh grew firmly in place of the bone, and its condition improved in his body, and his strength returned, and he was able to move about as usual, without any further issues affecting his walking. If a new bone forms in a broken spot, it will heal securely.
One should proceed as follows: take a bandage, tighten it around the new bone, and have someone pull it upwards, creating another bandage made of thicker wool than the first.
Then, bind it to the flesh beneath the bone and extend its end to draw the flesh downwards while exposing the flesh in the area you wish to cut, so as not to harm the saw with the flesh, and place a board or a plank underneath the bone firmly from below.
Because if you do this, the saw will not be hindered from cutting the rotten bone, and the cut should be slightly above the area of rot to avoid further corruption in the bone cavity, which may not be visible to the eye, requiring a repeat cut.
If the bone is rotten and not separated but connected, with rot in its center or parts, then expose the flesh on all sides, place a board underneath, and cut from the first side where the rot is.
Once you have finished cutting, cut from the other side, keeping the cut slightly away from the rot as mentioned earlier. If the rot is in a joint, then cut off the rotten joint itself and cut the bone where it connects on the other side.
If the rot affects the connection of two joints, there is no remedy but to remove it. If the rot is in a finger or toe joint, its treatment is very difficult, but you should peel away the rot as best as possible and clean and expose the healthy bone.
By what means can you succeed, if a vessel or nerve does not impede you? Know that there are many tools for cutting these bones, according to their position, arrangement, thickness, thinness, size, and hardness or softness. Therefore, for each type of work, you should prepare an instrument corresponding to that work.
Know that the works themselves may indicate the type of instrument you need, if you have long experience and knowledge of these arts, because he who is skilled in the craft and has witnessed various forms of illness. He may himself infer what corresponds to him of instruments for each illness, and I will show you in the last part of this door several instruments.
Make them examples to be emulated and a measure to compare with others, if God wishes, an image of a saw:

Chapter LXXVIII.
On Amputations and Bone Disarticulation.
The extremities may rot either from a cause outside or inside, and if this corruption is treated with medicinal remedies but does not improve, and you see the corruption spreading throughout the member without restraint, then there is no cure.
It is necessary to cut off the member where the corruption has reached, so that the patient may be saved from death or a great affliction greater than the loss of the member; and a sign that this has occurred is when the member turns black as if it were burned by fire.
Or the corruption may turn black, and this decay spreads to what follows that member, taking over the body, so hurry to cut it off; likewise, if the cause of the corruption is the sting of certain creatures like a sea scorpion, or a snake, or a spider, or the like.
If the corruption or sting is in the tip of a finger, cut off that finger without delay; and if it has spread to the hand, then cut it at the wrist joint, so as not to allow the corruption to spread further until it reaches the forearm.
And if, when taking the arm, you cut off the arm at the elbow in the same joint, if the damage is permissible and you see it extending towards the shoulder, never cut off the shoulder; for that would cause the patient's death, and use other treatment methods to the best of your ability.
And the same goes for the foot if decay spreads to a finger, cut off that finger at one of the joints; and if it affects the sole of the foot, cut off the entire foot, but if it reaches the knee, cut off the leg at the joint of the knee.
If the decay has reached above the knee, there is no remedy but to leave it and let the patient accept death; for the treatment of cutting off or amputating a member, tie a ligature below the point where you intend to cut, and another ligature above that point.
The attendant holding one ligature should extend it downwards, and another attendant should hold the upper ligature upwards; then, using a broad knife, remove the flesh between the two ligatures until all the flesh is exposed, and cut off or amputate, taking care to apply a piece of linen in all directions.
So that the saw does not touch the correct place, causing the patient additional pain and a hot swelling; if bleeding occurs during your work, quickly apply pressure to the site or hold some sharp materials to stop the bleeding, then return to your treatment until you are finished.
Then bind the injured member with a suitable bandage and treat it until it heals, and I will tell you of an example that occurred to a man in his foot, this very condition that I describe, for there appeared on his foot a darkness accompanied by a burning sensation like fire.
This corruption was the first sign in his toe, and it spread to the whole foot, so the man decided on his own to cut it off at the joint, and it healed.
After a long time, the same corruption appeared in his index finger, so he came to me, and I treated it with the medications I had prepared for the hand after cleaning it, but the corruption did not stop and spread to the other fingers.
Until the corruption took over his hand, he called me to amputate it, but I refused, hoping to contain that infection and fearing for his life upon cutting off his hand, as his strength was diminishing, so he gave up and returned to his hometown.
I was informed that he succeeded in cutting off his hand entirely, and it healed. I have related this story to serve as a help in cases of this kind of illness and as a guide for action.
Chapter Eighty-Eight.
In the treatment of abscesses and the method of injecting them with medications.
If a tumor occurs in some fleshy members and the tumor persists for a prolonged period, until it ruptures or drains, completely emptying the space it was occupying as if it were a container.
And the skin covering it is like a cloth that has become loose and was not deeply corrupted, affecting any bone, nerve, or ligament; hence, it is called an abscess, not a fistula, unless the duration of its corruption prolongs to affect any of these members.
At such a point, it is called a fistula or ulcer, and its treatment involves cutting off all that skin completely, as it flakes off, especially if it has become thin and fragile and no longer adheres to the wound due to its corruption.
If you wish the skin to adhere, but it has not yet reached that level of corruption and there is still thickness of flesh, treat it with injection; that is, examine the abscess. If it is large and the pus emanating from it has a foul smell, inject it with Egyptian medicine.
Which is a mixture of vinegar, oil, honey, and ginger in equal parts, boiled together over fire until the medicine thickens like honey; then take as much as needed, dilute it with water and honey, and inject it into the abscess, sealing its opening and leaving the medicine inside for about two hours.
Then, remove it with an era (potter's tool) and do so for several days until the infected area is cleansed and the bad odor disappears. If this medicine is not available, you can use ashes of date palm wood or oak wood, mixed with water.
Then, strain it and inject it until you are certain that the infected area has been cleansed. If neither Egyptian medicine nor ash water is available, inject a mixture of water and honey with some powdered ginger.
Or, you can inject a mixture of honey and drink because honey purifies and washes, while the drink sticks to the infected area, especially if it contains residual drying and astringent properties. If you do this several times and are certain that the infection has gone, then inject a remedy that promotes tissue growth.
For example, take some palm butter and mix it with rose fat and astringent drink, or inject it with other medicines and ointments that we have proven their properties in the article on ointments. If the opening of the infection is narrow and does not accommodate the syringe needle.
If the opening is narrow, expand it slightly with iron, or insert a small, contaminated string in Egyptian ointment or soriconic ointment to make it wider. If the opening is also wide, sew its edges together and leave enough of an opening that the syringe can enter without excess.
If the mouth through which pus escapes is elevated, make an incision in the lowest part to allow the pus to flow downwards, for if pus accumulates in the depth of the wound, it prevents tissue regeneration.
If it is not possible to make an incision in the wound to allow pus to flow downwards, then form the tissue around the wound so that the pus can escape easily, and ensure that no pus accumulates within it.
As for the healing drugs that are applied to the wound from outside, take one of the adhesive pastes suitable for the purpose and apply it to a cotton cloth, ensuring it covers the entire wound. Then, using scissors, make a hole in front of the wound's opening, slightly wider than the wound itself. Apply a soft paste to another cotton cloth, covering the entire area, and place it over the opening, ensuring it is spaced apart from the wound's edge. Remove the large cloth only after some time has passed.
For several days, the cloth covering the wound's opening should be changed regularly to allow any accumulated pus to escape and to observe the discharge, determining its quantity and maturity.
In addition to the above, examine the wound itself for any pain or discomfort experienced by the patient, and look for signs of swelling or abscess formation. If the treatment continues as described and the amount of discharge at the wound's opening is minimal, then consider the healing process complete.
Know that the abscess has adhered or is about to adhere, then dissolve it on the second or third day. Once you have opened the wound, replace the dressing with a new one and apply fresh ointment. If after a long time a thin pus emerges from the abscess, do not despair of its healing.
Its healing is near, for there are people whose flesh takes a long time to heal in their wounds, and others the opposite. If after many days a non-mature pus emerges from the abscess, know that the abscess has not adhered, if its healing is slow.
If the condition prolongs, increase the drying medications, and let them be in a consistency that is moist and strong like the nettle ointment if it has been enriched with more of the distillate. The nettle ointment is the most effective treatment.
You may substitute oil of rose, sprinkled with a moderate amount of ancient drink (a mild liqueur), mixed together and applied. If neither nettle ointment nor honey is available, you can prepare a mixture by boiling salt, pepper, and galangal, then crushing them all and adding them to the honey while it is still on the fire. Then apply it to a bandage and secure it over the abscess, or coat it with the thickened honey you have cooked, sprinkle medications on top, and cover it with a bandage, securing it tightly.
In such cases, one may use long ziraund, the root of the sweet violet, and fine mistletoe, either alone or combined, crushed and sifted over honey as described and used. If the condition persists after this treatment, know that there is corruption within.
It may affect bones, or other solid nerves, or ligaments, and its treatment is similar to that of fistulas, as mentioned before.
Chapter Eighty-Nine.
In the treatment of corns, crushed nails, amputation of surplus fingers, and incising fused fingers.
A corn is an excess of flesh that grows under the thumb or other fingers' nails, and if left untreated and neglected, it becomes a swollen, hot tumor.
It corrupts and decays until it consumes the nail bed, and sometimes even the whole nail, and the decay reaches the bone, emitting a putrid odor, and the end of the finger becomes wide and black, and if treated with the remedies mentioned in the sections without success.
Therefore, it is necessary to cut off with iron all the excess growth from under the nail, and then cauterize the wound, for cauterization is very beneficial in this case. If the bone is sound and so is the nail.
And the acute angle of the nail had pinched the flesh inward, piercing and damaging it, so one should place a thin rod beneath the angle of the nail that is piercing the flesh and raise it up and cut off that flesh gently.
And apply burning, corroding medications to the remaining flesh until it all disappears, then treat it with ointments until it heals. However, if the corruption has affected the bone, you should cut off and remove that bone, for it will never heal as long as there is a corrupt bone within.
If you observe decay and corruption spreading in the finger, cut it off at one of the phalanges as mentioned previously, then treat it until it heals. If the nail is injured or damaged and causes severe pain, you should first drain the blood from the wound.
Then, using a sharp scalpel, make an oblique cut in the nail from top to bottom, being careful not to reach the flesh beneath. Doing so will cause severe pain for the patient and may lead to excessive tissue growth at that spot. Then treat the area with remedies to alleviate the pain.
As for the surplus finger that grows in some people's hands, it may be entirely flesh, or it may have bones in part of it, and sometimes there is a nail, and some grow from the joint between some fingers.
If the plant is in some phalanges of the finger and grows in some phalanges, it does not move, but if it grows at the joint of the finger, it might move. Therefore, if it is only flesh, cut it off easily by cutting it at its base with a wide blade.
If the plant grows at the base of the joint, its treatment is difficult, so avoid cutting it. But if it grows in the finger at one of the phalanges, it should first be cut through with a round incision to remove the flesh, and then the bone can be separated using one of those saws suitable for this purpose.
Then treat it until it heals. The fusion that occurs between fingers, often occurring due to birth or healing from a wound or fire burn, should be incised to break this adhesion.
Until the fingers return to their natural state, place between them a thread or a small hole soaked in rose fat to prevent rapid adhesion and separation, or use a thin sheet of lead to keep them apart until healing occurs as desired.
Similarly, if adhesion occurs between some fingers and the palm, incise this adhesion according to what is available and suitable for the member's shape.
Chapter Ninety
In the removal of varicose veins.
Varicose veins are thick, twisted vessels filled with dark blood, most commonly found in the legs, especially in the thigh, calf, and ankle areas. Initially, one should employ a strong rubbing of the body to remove the dark blood.
Then, the varicose vein is incised, and its treatment with iron is of two types: one is to cut and drain the dark blood, and the other is to strip off the skin, allowing the entire vein to be removed. When cutting it, the leg should first be soaked in hot water as described.
Until the thick, cloudy blood is dissolved, the patient's leg should be tightened from above the thigh to below the knee with a bandage, and then the vein should be incised in one or two or three wide cuts.
Then, the dark blood is drained by hand from below the leg to above and from above to below until the amount of blood that is considered sufficient or that the patient's strength allows is removed. It should then be tied off, and the patient is advised to avoid foods that promote the formation of black blood. This process is repeated with vomiting and fainting (venesection).
When the veins are filled and this causes harm to the patient, its treatment involves shaving the leg if it has a lot of hair, then immersing it in hot water until it turns red and sweats, or engaging in intense physical exercise.
If a bath is not available to warm the member, then cut the skin in front of the sweat gland with a knife either lengthwise at the end near the knee or below at the ankle, and open the skin with pincers and peel off the sweat gland from every side until it appears to the touch.
Once exposed, it appears as a dark red color, resembling a tendon, and then insert a blade beneath it until it rises and separates from the skin. After that, hang it with a smooth, blind hook, and make another cut nearby, approximately three fingers' length.
Then, peel the skin off the sweat gland until it appears, and raise it with the blade as before, hanging it on another hook. Then, make another cut or multiple cuts if necessary.
Then, hang and cut it at the end of the cut near the ankle. Pull and hang it until it emerges from the second cut, then pull it towards the third cut above all the cuts. Once all of it has emerged, cut it off.
If it does not come out when pulled and hung, insert a needle with a strong, doubled thread, tie it, and pull while inserting the blade underneath and twisting your hand in every direction until it comes out. Be careful to avoid cutting yourself. If the thread breaks, it will be difficult to remove it.
A harmful substance enters the patient, and if it is completely removed, a poultice soaked in a drink and fat of rose or oil should be placed on the site of the injury, and it should be treated until healing occurs. If the affected area is twisted with wrinkles and bends towards certain directions.
If it is not straight as we mentioned, it should be cut in all directions of its wrinkles and bends, then secured with pins until completely removed. Be careful when cutting it to avoid damaging or wounding the vein, as it will make it difficult to remove.
Image of the paralysis that is cut through to remove the affected area.
Image of the blind pin.
It should not have a bend like other pins, and its tip should not be sharp to avoid damaging the vein; instead, it should be thick and flexible, as mentioned.
Chapter 91.
Removing the venous flux.
This vein is generated in the legs in hot countries like Hijaz and Arab lands, and in arid, infertile regions with scarce rainfall, and it may also be generated in other parts of the body, not just the legs, due to putrefaction occurring under the skin.
As in living bodies, worms and parasites occur within, it is necessary to pound and remove the worms that develop between the skin and flesh. The beginning of this condition is marked by a severe inflammation in the leg, followed by a discharge at the site, after which the sweating begins from that point.
If a plant or animal grows from it, when its tip appears, it should be wrapped around a small piece of lead, weighing between one and two drams, and then tied, leaving the lead hanging from the leg.
Whenever anything emerges from it, wrap it in lead and tie it. If it continues to grow for a long time, cut off some of it and wrap the rest, but do not cut it from its root before it has completely emerged, as cutting it too soon may cause it to retract and enter the flesh, leading to swelling, pus, and a bad ulcer.
For this reason, it should be gently pulled until it completely exits the body, leaving no trace. In some people, this condition may cause a growth as long as five or ten handspans.
I have heard that in one case, it grew to a length of twenty handspans for a man. If it breaks off during treatment, insert a rod into its hole and wrap it tightly with bandages for an extended period, along with the body, until all the material inside is expelled. Try to treat the site with medications for several days.
Then he treats it with tumor therapy, and this sweat may have many branches, especially if it appears in the joint or in the leg itself, causing it to form numerous openings, and each opening has a branch that should be treated as we mentioned in the classification and as previously stated.
Chapter Ninety-Two
In the incision on the worm generated under the skin, called the cow's disease.
This disease is called "cow's illness" in some of our countries, as it often affects cattle, and it is a small worm that develops between the skin and flesh, moving up and down throughout the body.
It is perceived by the sense of touch as it moves from one part to another, until it breaches the skin at a certain point and exits, forming abscesses due to the putrefaction of certain humors, as occurs with worms, snakes, and pimples in the abdomen.
The harm caused by this condition is such that if it moves throughout the body and reaches the head, then to the eye, it may open it up and exit, causing permanent damage to the eye. This occurs frequently. If one wishes to treat it and extract the worm, it must be done while it is moving and can be felt.
It is necessary to tighten what is above and below it with a strong ligature, then make an incision on it and extract it. If it sinks into the flesh and you do not find it, then apply heat to the place with fire until it burns, for the greatest fear of damaging the eye as we have said.
If you see it has moved to the head near the eye, tighten under it on the forehead tightly, then make an incision and extract it. The patient should maintain the purification of their body with drugs that facilitate the elimination of putrid, bad humors and be cautious with foods that cause putrefaction.
Chapter Ninety-Three.
On the incision for the condition known as "nafar.
This condition, known in our land as "nafar," is a pain that appears in certain members and then transfers from one member to another. I have witnessed it as I describe to you.
I was called to a sick woman in a certain desert region, where I examined her arm and saw a slight swelling in the veins of the forearm. After remaining there for an hour, I observed that swelling spreading along the arm towards the elbow with incredible speed, similar to mercury.
If the pain shifts from one place to another, it disappears from that location and stabilizes in the shoulder, then I sat for an hour, after which it spread throughout the body until it reached the other arm. She told me that her entire body was turning as I observed.
I was amazed at the speed with which it moved from one part of the body to another, and I had never before seen this disease in such a manner or to such an extent; however, I had observed groups of people experiencing pain that would shift from one member to another, but not as I saw it in this woman.
I only realized that this could be due to the woman being from a desert region, with dry skin and visible veins, which is why the sensation of the moving air was perceptible. This observation does not apply in the same way to those living in comfort, with moist bodies and hidden veins.
If you wish to treat it and the patient feels pain, then the pain will manifest as we described, so apply pressure above and below with speed and make incisions until the trapped air is released, then bandage the wound.
If you do not see it, treat the body with things that drive away air and open up the pores, such as camphor, turpentine, and other similar medicines.
Chapter ninety-four.
In Removing Arrows
Arrows may vary according to their types and the positions they occupy in the body. As for their variation by type, there are large and small ones, with hollow and solid glass, some with three angles and others with four.
Some have blades, and others have fragments. According to the organs they penetrate, they can be divided into two types: those that affect vital, hollow organs such as the brain, heart, liver, lung, kidney, intestine, bladder, and similar organs. If an arrow penetrates one of these organs and you observe the signs of death that I will describe, it is best to avoid removing it; for in most cases, death will follow. If these bad signs do not appear and the arrow has not become lodged deep within the organ, remove it and treat the wound. As for the brain, if a bone-tipped arrow penetrates it and injures the peritoneum covering the brain, severe headaches, vertigo, and dizziness may occur.
If these bad signs do not appear and the arrow has not become lodged deep within the organ, remove it and treat the wound. As for the brain, if a bone-tipped arrow penetrates it and injures the peritoneum covering the brain, severe headaches, vertigo, and dizziness may occur. Redness in the eyes, redness of the tongue, stiffness, mental confusion, spasms, and bitter vomiting. Blood may issue from the nostrils or ears, speech may become confused, and a white, mucus-like discharge may exit from the wound, akin to congealed meat juice.
If these signs appear, refrain from treating the patient and removing the arrow if it has not been extracted. As for the sign of the arrow reaching the heart, being close to the left breast, and feeling as if it had become lodged in a hard object rather than in empty space.
If the arrow's movement resembles a pulse and black blood flows from the wound, followed by cold extremities, cold sweat, and fainting, know that death is inevitable. And if the arrow wounds the lung, frothy blood emerges from the wound.
If the vessels below the neck swell, and the patient's color changes, and they breathe heavily and request cold air, then if the arrow has pierced the pleura in the chest, it is close to the small ribs, and breathing becomes extremely difficult with intense pain.
The patient sighs, and all the organs in the rib cage move. If the arrow has pierced the liver, intense pain follows, and blood similar in color to the liver is discharged from the wound. If the arrow has hit the stomach, food that is undigested may emerge from the wound.
The case is clear: if the arrow has struck the abdomen and become lodged there, or if it has exited through a wound, a rupture, or an intestine, there is no hope for treatment, nor can the arrow be removed. However, if the arrow has pierced the bladder and urine exits, there is still hope.
If a protrusion appears and the pain intensifies on the patient, know that death is imminent. As for the rest of the members, such as the face, eye, throat, shoulder, arm, spine, collarbone, thigh, leg, and similar members, they are generally safe.
When the arrow does not hit an artery or nerve and is not poisoned, I will share with you some observations on these arrows to guide your treatment, for I have seen a case where an arrow struck a man in the eye socket at the base of the nose.
He removed the arrow from the opposite side below the earlobe, and it healed without any harm to his eye. I also extracted another arrow that had struck a Jew in the eyelid below the lower lash, and only a small tip of the arrow remained embedded in the wood.
It was a large arrow from a composite bow, made of square iron without barbs, and it healed the Jew without any eye complications. I also removed another arrow from the throat of a Christian; it was an Arabic-style arrow.
This arrow had barbs, and I cut it out between the ribs, as it had pierced his throat. The Christian survived, and I carefully extracted the remaining arrow from his abdomen, but he was still considered close to death.
When the arrow had remained embedded for about thirty days without any change in its condition, I cut it open and removed it, and he recovered without any subsequent ill effects. I also observed a man with an arrow in his back, which had healed over.
After seven years, the arrow emerged from the hip joint. I also observed a woman with an arrow in her abdomen; the wound healed over, and the arrow remained without causing any harm to her daily activities.
I also observed another man with an arrow in his face, which healed and did not cause him much pain. There are many such cases. I removed an arrow from a commander-in-chief that had pierced his nose, slightly leaning to the right.
The arrow completely disappeared, and I was called to treat it after three days. I found the wound from the arrow very narrow; using a thin probe, I did not feel it, but he experienced prickling and pain under his right ear from the wound.
I assumed that the prickling was due to the arrow's tip, so I applied a compress with strong adhesive to draw and mature the swelling, hoping that the area would become swollen and reveal the arrow's track. However, nothing happened, and no signs indicated that the arrow had reached the location.
I left the bandage in place for many days, and no complications arose; during that time, the wound healed, but the patient remained bedridden and hopeful of its removal until one day he felt a sharp pain inside his nose. Upon hearing this, I applied a sharp, corrosive medicine to the wound for several days.
Until it opened and I examined it, I felt the fine tip of the arrow embedded in the wood. Then, I continued to open the wound with that sharp medicine until the arrowhead appeared visibly and stayed with me for a period of time, about four months.
Then, as the wound widened and I was able to insert hooks into it, I pulled and moved them, but they did not come out. So I continued to manipulate and devise ways with various tools until one day I caught them firmly with hooks, as shown in the final door image.
And the doctors judged that his nose cartilage would not heal, so I closed it, and the wound healed completely, without anything hurting him at all. And I will tell you how to remove some arrows, which will serve as a measurement and proof for what I have not mentioned.
Because the parts and details of this craft cannot be fully described in words or captured in a book; rather, the skilled craftsman measures with precision, applying what is present to what is absent, and devises new work and tools upon encountering rare occurrences.
If you withdraw from this art, I say that arrows leave the body from the members in which they are embedded in two ways: either by being drawn from the place where they entered, or from the opposite direction. They exit as they entered.
If the arrow is embedded in a hot spot, it will be drawn out; if it does not come out on its own, you should leave it for several days until the flesh around it rots, making it easier to pull out and remove, especially if it is lodged in a bone.
If it does not come out after a few days, you should also leave it for some time and then try to pull it and move it every day; it will eventually come out. If it still does not come out after several days, you should drill around the arrow in the same bone with a gentle drill on all sides to widen the opening and then pull and remove it.
If the arrow is embedded in the skull bone and has penetrated one of the brain cavities, and symptoms like those mentioned above appear, stop pulling the arrow and leave it until the condition improves after several days.
In the case of an arrow that is deeply embedded and does not come out when pulled, use the drill around the arrow as described, then treat the site until it heals. If the arrow has withdrawn into a part of the body, then proceed accordingly. If sensation is absent, examine it with a probe. If you feel it, draw it out with appropriate instruments. If you cannot do so because of the wound's narrowness or because the arrow is deeply embedded and there are no bones, nerves, or vessels nearby.
Make a cut until the wound widens and you can grab the arrow. If it has ears (i.e., is embedded in tissue), release the flesh stuck to it from all sides using any means possible. If you cannot do so, break and untwist the ears to free it.
If you attempt to extract the arrow from any position, use your hand with pliers in all directions until you free it. Handle it gently to avoid breaking the arrow, which would make extraction more difficult. If you cannot do so within your time frame.
Leave it for several days until the flesh around it decays. Then, treat it again; at this point, it will be easier to extract. If bleeding occurs, use the treatments mentioned earlier, but be careful not to cut any vessels, nerves, or tendons and employ other means instead.
In Every Way, You Can Remove the Arrow with Delicacy and Patience, Securing It as Described, and When Drawing Out the Arrow, Position the Patient As It Was When the Arrow Entered, for This is More Beneficial.
If This Is Not Possible, Use Whatever Means You Can, and As for the Arrow Emerging from the Opposite Direction, It Either Protrudes Something Outside or You Feel the End of the Arrow Close to the Skin's Surface, Emerging from Above.
Make a Cut on It, As Much as the Claw Will Allow, Then Pull; It Will Be Easier to Come Out. If It Sticks to a Bone, Twist Your Hand in a Circle Until the Arrow Affects and Expands the Bone for Its Exit, Then Pull.
If It Does Not Come Out After Some Days, Re-examine and Treat It Until It Does; If the Arrow's Barbed End Is Still Inside, Pushing It Out with a Matching Instrument Is Effective. Insert This Instrument into the Arrow's Shaft and Drive It Out.
If the Arrow Is Hollow, Use an Instrument Fitting Inside to Push It Out; This Facilitates Its Exit. If the Arrow Is Poisoned, Cut Off the Flesh Containing All the Poison if Possible, Then Treat the Wound Appropriately.
If an arrow has penetrated the chest, abdomen, bladder, or side and is close to what can be felt with a probe, make an incision and be careful not to cut any blood vessels or nerves, then remove it.
Then trace the wound if it needs stitching, then treat it until it heals, illustration of hooks that attract the arrows:
Its ends are shaped like a bird's beak, as if it were a file, if it grips an arrow or something and does not let go, and they can be made in various sizes, large and small and medium, according to the size of the arrow, and the width and narrowness of the wound.

This is solid at the end, like a mallion, to facilitate its entry into the concave arrow and its push:
Chapter 95.
In the draining of veins.
The veins that are usually drained in the body number thirty, with sixteen in the head, the two pulsating veins behind the ears known as the sensitives, and the two arteries in the temples, visible, and the two veins at the base of the eyes known as the lookers.
The sweat that stands out in the middle of the forehead, and the sweat at the tip of the nose, and the two glands on the neck, and the two veins on the upper lip of the mouth, and the two veins on the lower lip, these are known as the "jharak" (veins), and the two veins under the tongue.
As for the veins that discharge in the arm and hand, there are five, one of which is the 'qifal' (biceps vein), located on the lateral side, commonly known as the 'vein of the head'. The akhol (median vein) is the middle vein, composed of a branch from the basilic vein and another from the qifal, often referred to as the 'body vein'.
The basilic vein, located on the lateral side (in this case, the human side), is also known as 'al-ibti' (axillary vein) and commonly referred to as the 'vein of the abdomen' or 'the tendon of the arm'. It attaches to the ulna and appears prominently above the thumb.
This is the vein located between the ring and pinky fingers, with two branches. In the leg and foot, there are three veins: one beneath the knee cap on the lateral side, a second (the popliteal vein) at the ankle on the medial side, and a third (the tibial vein) at the heel on the lateral side.
In the other leg, there are three veins similar to these: The veins behind the ears are beneficial for draining chronic effusions, migraines, ringworm, and persistent head sores. I will describe how to drain them accordingly.
It is that you shave the head of the patient and rub his nape with a coarse cloth, rubbing it well, then strangle the patient's neck with a turban until the veins become visible, located behind the ears in the lower parts of the head. Inspect them with your finger, and where you feel their pulse beneath your finger, mark them with ink.
Then take a scalpel, the one known as the 'lever', and insert it under the vein in the skin until the blade reaches the bone. Then lift your hand with the vein and skin above, cutting the vein along with the skin, making a clean amputation, with a length of about two joined fingers.
In this manner, it sends the desired amount of blood, then ties them with bandages and leaves them until healing occurs. You have previously discussed in the first part of the book how to cut and bind them. As for the two arteries located on the temples, cutting them is beneficial for chronic migraine, severe headaches, constant eye redness, and sudden, intense discharge into the eyes.
And the technique for cutting them: have the patient tighten his neck with a turban until the veins become clearly visible and you can feel their pulse beneath your finger. Then, using your index finger, lift the skin from above the vein towards the top.
Insert the scalpel from below, lift the vein towards the top, and amputate it as you did with the other veins, allowing the desired amount of blood to flow. Then loosen the patient's neck and place your finger on the vein, feeling its pulse.
Then place a cotton ball and dressing on it, tighten it firmly from above, and leave it until it heals. The preparation, cutting, and application of these have been discussed in detail at the beginning of this book. As for lancing the frontal vein, its benefit follows lancing the temporal artery for chronic facial conditions such as tinea, sores, and redness.
And the method of lancing it, as I describe to you, chokes the patient's throat with a turban until the sweat appears. Then take the instrument called the "fask," and this is its image:
Place the sharp end of the fask on the same vein and strike it from above with a comb or other instrument in the same direction, allowing the blood to flow as desired. Then loosen the chokehold around the patient's throat until healing occurs.
It can be opened with a wide scalpel, but the scalpel should not be as sharp as other knives; it should be slightly wider at the tip. Use it carefully because the bone is close by and the scalpel might break if it's too thin.
As for the veins located above the eyes, their lancing is beneficial for eye conditions such as scabies, redness, styes, and facial diseases. The method of lancing them involves having the patient tighten a turban around his throat, then lancing them while standing over his head. The lancing should be slightly curved towards the length with a small, slightly wide scalpel.
If the site has no flesh, and the scalpel is thin, it may break, then send blood to meet your need and place a cotton on them and tighten them for one night, and then release them. As for lancing a nose vein, it is beneficial for severe fever.
And for severe headaches and facial diseases such as the red rash that appears in the nose, especially if it is chronic, the way to drain it is for the patient to tighten their neck and then grip their nose with their left hand while holding a thin, long scalpel.
And pierce it in the middle of the nose itself, between the nostrils, straightening it because the vein does not appear sensitive there, so the blood flows immediately. You should carefully apply the scalpel a little and send the required amount of blood, then tie it for the night, as it will quickly heal.
As for the tonsils, draining them is beneficial for shortness of breath and the onset of leprosy and dark diseases that appear on the skin surface, such as vitiligo, scabies, bad ulcers, and sores. The method of lancing them is for the patient to tighten them under their neck with a bandage, and the surgeon stands on top of the patient's head.
The patient sits on a chair, and the surgeon drains the vein from above, making a wide cut slightly longer, then extracts blood to the extent necessary or as required, then does the same for the other vein, and finally releases the bandage.
The veins should be tied with moderate tension to prevent the patient from choking and allow the wound to heal by tomorrow. As for the veins in the tongue, lancing them after the civel (vein) is cut is beneficial for oral cavities, gum deterioration, bad ulcers, splits in the lips, and poor wounds.
The veins in the nose and its surroundings, and how to lance them: Position the patient before you, tighten their neck with a turban, turn their lips aside, and observe the veins, one on the right side of the lip and the other on the left, determining their condition from their darkness.
If they are surrounded by thin, dark veins, cut them off completely. If it is unclear which ones to cut, aim for the largest and most prominent, and do the same with the veins on the lower lip.
As for the veins under the tongue, lancing them after the civel (vein) is cut is beneficial for phlegm in the throat and mouth diseases. To lance them: Have the patient sit between your hands facing the sun, raise their tongue, and look under it, identifying one vein on one side and another on the other, noting their dark color.
Cut them, but be cautious to avoid excessive cutting, as there are arteries beneath. The three veins in the elbow are usually cut in people, and there are two methods for lancing them.
Either sew with a wide scalpel of rhubarb or olive to the skin, or make an incision with a slender scalpel, which is the dislocation [and here is its image], the image of the wide rhubarb scalpel.
It should be wide as you see to suit opening hollow veins filled with thick, cloudy blood, and this is the image of the olive scalpel.
And this scalpel is thinner and has a more delicate tip, suitable for lancing thin veins containing pale yellow blood, and this is the image of the dislocation scalpel.
This dislocation, which is suitable for making incisions, comes in wide and slender types, depending on the size and narrowness of the veins as well. It can also be used as a reference for other tools, and it is well-known among artisans.
As for the basilic, which is one of these three veins, lancing it has the benefit of drawing blood from ailments below the throat and neck, extending to the chest and abdomen. When puncturing it, the incisioner should be cautious and aware, as underneath lies a artery. If he mistakes and exceeds in making the cut, he risks cutting that artery.
In such a case, there may be bleeding, so lancing it with a scalpel for sewing is not appropriate; instead, make an incision with the dislocation tool. If the basilic does not appear clearly visible, it is best to avoid it and seek another suitable vein or ask for some of its branches.
If you intend to incise the arm's tendon, it is clear and should be cut with a scalpel as we have said. If you wish to mark it with a single stroke of the pen, before tightening the arm, you must feel the spot to identify the pulse and then mark it with ink.
Then, you tie the arm and make a curved incision in the vein with the scalpel as we have said, and be sure to avoid striking the artery. When, upon tightening the bandage, you see a bulge at the marked spot with ink, this is the swelling of the artery, so avoid it.
If, upon incising, you see the blood bubble up like a child's urine and the blood is thin and bright red, then know that it is artery blood. In such a case, quickly place your finger on it for a long time and then remove your finger. If the bleeding stops, it often does so; tighten the arm.
Leave it, and warn the patient not to neglect it, and let it be on the neck without moving it for several days until it heals. If the blood does not stop and you are unable to find a remedy in time, then cut the artery if it appears before you; its ends will shrivel and the blood will stop.
Take a date pit, split it open, and take one half of it; tightly wrap it around the vein with bandages and twine until the next day. If the blood stops, then proceed as mentioned earlier regarding the use of small pieces to stop the bleeding. Cutting off the artery is not difficult in most cases.
For small wounds where the ligature holds firm in the arm, know this, and for the jugular vein, cutting it is beneficial as it draws blood from the top of the head and the bottom of the body due to its composition from a branch of the basilic vein and a branch of the cephalic vein, as we have said.
The person performing the incision should be aware of the nerve below, for if it is damaged by the knife and becomes inflamed, it may cause numbness that is difficult to heal, and in some cases, it may never heal. This nerve is often quite sensitive.
If it is difficult to locate in some individuals and is very thin, you should make the incision with a gentle pull and avoid damaging the nerve. If the vein is between two nerves, cut the vein lengthwise, but for the jugular vein, cutting it is beneficial as it draws blood from the head.
It is useful for eye diseases, and if you want to target this vein specifically, use the olive knife or a wide thyme knife; it is the safest of all veins as there are no arteries or nerves beneath it.
However, when making the incision, avoid the muscle's head and aim for the soft tissue. It is acceptable if it does not bleed on the first attempt; you can repeat the procedure multiple times. However, some individuals may experience swelling if the incision is not successful in the first attempt.
However, this tumor does not harm it in any way. As for the phlebotomy and its complications, and what should precede it in its repair, first you must know that phlebotomy is only used to preserve health.
And if it is used in diseases, rather than preserving health and sustaining it and preventing the onset of diseases, phlebotomy should be performed on one of the three veins in the elbow, that is, the cephalic, axillary, or basilic vein, and it should be done in early spring when signs of fullness appear.
Phlebotomy should be performed on a Sunday or Tuesday, after three hours have passed in the day. However, for diseases, there is no specific time limit; it can be done at any time of day, whether night or day, when the need arises.
At every hour and in every time, and children should not be bled until they are fourteen years old, nor should the elderly over sixty years of age be bled, if anyone intends to perform phlebotomy for any reason.
Therefore, before phlebotomy, his bowels should be cleansed with a gentle enema if they contain a lot of feces, so that no foul residue is drawn into the veins from the bowel, which could harm the vital organs. Nor should phlebotomy be performed on someone who is drowsy, drunk, or intoxicated.
One must also be cautious about phlebitis, vomiting, diarrhea, excessive sexual intercourse, fatigue, exercise, insomnia, fasting, and any other factors that weaken the body or mind, then consider diluting the humors beforehand if the blood is thick.
He should also use foods, drinks, and medications if possible, and take a bath if it is not prohibited or engage in some exercise to thin the blood, and aim to perform the phlebotomy in the middle of the day as we mentioned, seeking to clear his chest that day from all negative mental conditions.
Such as worries, anger, fear, and all physical symptoms like excessive fatigue, strain, sexual intercourse, and the like. He should surround himself with things that people usually use, such as fragrances, scents, entertainment, and so on, to the best of his ability.
Then the phlebotomist should sit on a pillow that is higher than the one on which the patient sits, and then he extracts the arm and the phlebotomist rubs it with his hand twice or three times, then tightens the tie with the hook and twists it twice or three times, making sure the tension is moderate.
Because when the tension is neither moderate (too tight, preventing blood flow) nor slack (allowing blood to clot), then after tightening, the patient should rub their hands together.
Until the veins bulge and become distinct to the touch, then the surgeon should wipe the scalpel with a small amount of old oil, especially, and place his left hand's index finger on the same vein below the desired incision site slightly so as not to lodge in the vein, thus avoiding the blow. Because some veins, when incised, cling like a tendon, while others are filled with air. When the scalpel is placed on them, they subside under the blade, deceiving the surgeon, and the vein remains unopened. If it does open, its opening is narrow.
Therefore, the surgeon should be steadfast and patient in all these matters, then lower the scalpel. If the vein opens at that time, it is well. Otherwise, he should repeat the attempt slightly below or above that spot with haste, if the swelling does not increase.
If the patient swells or becomes agitated, leave it for a day or two without binding it, for it may bring about a hot swelling. Do not enter the bath. Then, if desired, repeat the incision. If the cut is deep and the blood flow is thin.
And if you fear that the desired amount of blood will not come out, reinsert the scalpel in the same wound, applying it gently along a straight line, and increase the opening slightly. Act quickly before the swelling occurs, for in many people, small openings may cause swelling.
If you observe swelling, do not attempt to treat it at all, for it will be of no help. Apply something from the clarified oil (safflower) to it, as it facilitates blood flow, and it is better in this regard than pure oil or any other grease.
Use clarified oil (safflower) in all your vein punctures when blood flow is obstructed, and the decoctions of trifle or camomile can also achieve this, as placing either on the affected area causes the thick blood to thin and dissolve.
If, in the site of venipuncture, there is a large swelling, this often occurs, especially for those who have punctured a vein only once or if the opening of the vein is small. Act quickly and place a sponge soaked in warm salt water on the swelling, then apply pressure for an hour; it will dissolve.
You should do this after the blood has completely left the vein or another vessel, and if, after several days, any blackness or greenery remains at the site, it will not cause harm. If you wish, you can apply a solution of saffron and honey.
Or, use a solution of fennel juice or similar, as swelling and pain often occur after puncturing the basilic vein. If you press on it and it feels tender when you touch it, this is a sign of poor healing, so be careful not to apply any of the solutions mentioned.
If a vessel bleeds, it is necessary to apply pressure to stop the flow of blood, make the area firm, and then treat it with other remedies until healing occurs. The amount of blood loss should be determined for each individual based on their strength and the predominant color of their blood.
If the blood is black, allow it to flow until it turns red; if it appears thick, let it flow until it thins; and if it is sharp or intense, treat it until those qualities subside. For a person who is robust and needs to have a large amount of blood drawn at once, this should be done carefully.
It is necessary to widen the incision for perspiring veins and use a wide blade; conversely, for those who are weak, it should be narrow. The incision should be made in several stages, with a narrow opening. The best method for incising veins is to use a curved, rounded knife, not stitches.
This method of incision is effective in stopping bleeding and cutting nerves, making it safer than transverse or longitudinal incisions. For those who experience fainting during incision, it is advisable to feed them a bit of bread soaked in pomegranate juice or hyoscyamus water before the procedure.
If the incision is done correctly and blood flows out three or four times, and the person's temperament is cold, it is recommended to soak bread in a drink made from mib (a type of plant) or honey sweetened with aromatic herbs, or a pleasant-smelling herbal drink.
If fainting occurs during phlebotomy due to excessive blood loss, one should give meat broth and thin rosewater, use myrrh for aromatics, massage the chest with it, and employ all the remedies mentioned in the chapter on fainting.
If fainting is due to vomiting, and one wishes to rest their arm and allow the blood to circulate again, for those who had phlebotomy for severe vomiting and their strength is weak, they should release the blood little by little each day according to their strength.
And if one wishes to rest their arm and allow the blood to circulate again, and their body is strong, they should do so after seven or nine hours from their initial phlebotomy. If one wishes to draw the blood back towards the opposite side of where it had gathered, they should treat them on the second or third day.
And if one has a great amount of hot, intense blood that causes fever, the blood should be drawn out in one go, removing a large quantity, and opening the vein widely until fainting occurs, after ensuring all conditions for phlebotomy are met. And place your hand on the pulse while drawing blood, so that death does not occur in place of fainting, for it often happens if the phlebotomist is ignorant and a momentary lapse occurs. One should not try to rest the arm and allow the blood to circulate again after this.
If the sweat gland's orifice is closed and the blood flow obstructed, do not force it with intense squeezing or vigorous twisting, for that is extremely harmful. Instead, leave it alone until the clot dislodges itself or use a scalpel to remove the congealed blood from the orifice.
Or apply a solution of salt dissolved in water, or a distinct antidote like rhubarb or alum, and gently massage it to stimulate blood flow. If the sweat gland has swelled, leave it be.
Do not touch it until the swelling subsides. If further bloodletting becomes necessary, either repeat the process at the same site or move to another arm or sweat gland.
Instead, if neither kohl nor psyllium (basiliac) is available, as they are components of the traditional mixture, one may use an alternative method. This involves immersing the affected arm in warm water until the forearm becomes red and the sweat glands become prominent, then tightly wrapping it with a bandage.
Then, puncture the sweat gland slightly off-center, neither too wide nor too narrow, with an opening that is broad. If the blood does not flow easily, reimmerse the hand in warm water to facilitate its release.
If, during the summer days, you do not need to immerse your hand in hot water, it is because the blood flow in hot water is more prominent in winter. Lancing this vein is safer than any other. Because it has no striking veins or nerves, and lancing the 'asilem (a term for a specific vein) from the right hand is beneficial for liver ailments. The method of lancing it involves tying the wrist with a bandage or using your hand after immersing it in hot water until the vein swells.
Because it has no striking veins or nerves, and lancing the 'asilem (a term for a specific vein) from the right hand is beneficial for liver ailments. The method of lancing it involves tying the wrist with a bandage or using your hand after immersing it in hot water until the vein swells. After confirming its identity, slightly bend it and, if you cut it off completely, it will not cause any harm. Be careful; do not overuse the scalpel as there is a nerve beneath it and the area is exposed without flesh. Then, return the hand to hot water.
Allow the blood to flow through the vein; if you do not return it to hot water, the blood will clot within the vein's opening and stop flowing. Once you have extracted as much blood as needed, apply a mixture of oil and salt to the vein to prevent it from sealing quickly.
Similarly, you should proceed with each narrow channel. Lancing the vein from the left hand is beneficial for spleen ailments, and you should follow the same method as with the right hand. Lancing the 'safin' (a specific vein) is effective for conditions in the lower body, such as those affecting the uterus.
Retention of menses, kidney diseases, chronic ulcers of the thighs and legs, and similar conditions, as well as how to treat them: one should immerse their foot in hot water, apply friction until the veins become visible, and then wrap it tightly above the ankle joint, placing the sweatband at the heel towards the big toe.
It branches out in many directions on the face, so cut it at the widest branch or near the heel where it joins, for this is best and safest. If you cut it on the face of the man, be careful of the nerves beneath.
Make the cut by twisting it as if you wanted to sever it, ensuring the blade is clean. If the blood does not flow easily, immerse their foot in hot water and allow the blood to drain. If the person who is cutting makes a mistake and misses the vein on their first attempt.
If the cut does not reach deep enough and the vein is missed, repeat the process a little higher; the area above is safe and poses no risk if you avoid the nerve as mentioned. The same applies to the other foot's big toe. As for the sciatic nerve, its location is as described at the back of the leg.
Cutting the vein is beneficial for hip pain if the cause is hot blood. To perform this cut, have the patient enter a hot bath and quickly grab their leg near the hip joint with four fingers using a thin, long bandage, revealing the vein.
If it appears, amputate it in any way that keeps the site intact, which is preferable, or cut it off completely or make an incision. If its position remains healthy and it is very difficult to find, do not hesitate.
If it does not appear at all, amputate some of its roots, which show up on the back of the foot near the little toe and the index finger, while preserving the nerves and allowing blood flow as desired.
Then, release the tension. Place a cotton ball on the site of amputation and secure it, as it will quickly heal.
Chapter 69
On cupping and its application.
The cupping cups may be made of horns, wood, copper, or glass. There are two types of cupping: one for drawing blood (with a specific mechanism) and the other for non-invasive treatment.
This non-invasive cupping therapy consists of two methods.
Surgeries of the Neck, Chin, Shoulders, Hip, Arms, Legs, and Ankle.
Lymphatic drainage is the primary function of cupping, which draws blood from the delicate veins scattered throughout the flesh. Therefore, the strength of cupping should not be used to induce vomiting in conditions characterized by edema, and cupping should not be applied with or without heat in any disease that causes excessive swelling.
If cupping is necessary due to illness or as a habit, it should be performed at any time of the month, whether the first, last, or middle, and at any hour of the day.
Some people, when their blood volume increases to the point where cupping is required to remove it, experience a sensation of heaviness and headaches. Others may notice swelling, redness in the face, neck, and head, or itching on the face, sides, and eyes, or darkness and pain in those areas. Some even feel itching at the site of the cupping.
Some individuals may experience increased laughter, a metallic taste in their mouths with bleeding gums, excessive sleeping, or vivid dreams featuring blood, redness, injuries, and similar imagery. These symptoms should be considered when determining the appropriate timing for cupping therapy.
Especially if it is in the middle third of the month, we command cupping after two or three hours have passed from noon. The benefit of cupping on the point is that it alleviates the heaviness in the head and releases the water flowing to the eyes.
However, this should be done after the body has entirely emptied. This cupping can be a substitute for draining the brain, but it is advisable to avoid using it for those with cold-blooded dispositions or those suffering from a fever, as it may cause severe harm.
Therefore, the elderly or those with cold-related conditions in their heads should avoid using it, as well as anyone who frequently uses it, as it may lead to memory loss.
Therefore, the cupper should lower their hand with the cup slightly to prevent memory loss. Cupping on the nape is a substitute for draining the eye sockets and the basilic vein.
Therefore, it is beneficial for asthma, shortness of breath, headaches, coughing, and chest congestion. The cupping on the nape should be slightly raised, as placing it too low may cause weakness in the heart and stomach.
Cupping on the temple areas is effective for headaches, conjunctivitis, migraines, throat pain, and toothache. It serves as a substitute for draining the basilic vein. The cupper should avoid going too deep with their hand to prevent cutting into a blood vessel, which may cause bleeding.
And as for leeching beneath the chin, it is beneficial for cavities in the mouth and corruption of the gums, and similar diseases of the mouth, and may serve as a substitute for fistulation of the hemorrhoids on the lips; and leeching of the shoulders is beneficial for palpitations due to fullness and heat.
And as for leeching of both zendis (a term referring to specific anatomical areas), it is beneficial for what fistulation of the three veins – basilic, acetabular, and sagittal – accomplishes, as it draws blood from all those delicate veins in the flesh and draws those delicate veins from other, thicker veins below them until the attraction reaches the three thick veins.
The leechman should not excessively suck, for the area is devoid of flesh and beneath lie nerves and arteries; however, a single leech applied to the anus (or 'epixys') is beneficial for hemorrhoids and ulcers in the lower regions.
You should instruct the leechman to use a large, copper leech, as the area requires a strong suction, and a glass leech may break easily; moreover, leeches for the legs are insufficient in their sucking ability.
For they draw blood from the entire body and are beneficial for chronic pains in the kidneys, wombs, and bladders, induce menstruation, and cure pustules and abscesses, serving as a substitute for fistulation of the sinews and tendons, albeit they exhaust the body greatly and fainting occurs in most people; leeches for the tendons have nearly the same benefit as those for the legs.
The Method of Applying Catheters: Place the catheter first while empty, suctioning gently and not prolonging the application. Quickly insert and remove the catheter to allow the humors to enter the site evenly. Repeat this process repeatedly until you observe the site turning red and opening up.
When the redness of blood appears, tie it and gradually increase suction, then observe the condition of the bodies. If a person has soft flesh with porous pores, you should apply only one catheter to avoid ulceration at the site.
The surgeon should widen the tie, deepen it slightly, and adjust the suction gently and carefully. If the blood is thick, the catheter should be tied twice: first to open the way for the gentle flow of blood and its liquids, and second to completely remove the thick blood.
If the blood is very turbid, repeat the tie a third time to achieve the desired effect. In general, if you want to remove a small amount of blood, one tie is sufficient. If you aim to extract a large quantity of blood, use more ties, especially if it is thick.
One should tie a deep catheter with a moderate suction, only reaching the depth of the skin. No fat or oil should be used when applying catheters, nor should one use excessive water. This is what the surgeon should avoid. However, for those with thick, hard, dry skin and narrow pores, more ties and stronger suction may be required.
In summer, the incision sites should be lubricated with open, softening, and dissolving fats such as khayri (a type of fat), rose petal fat, sweet almond fat, or pumpkin seed oil.
However, in winter, they should be lubricated with fat from daffodils, lilies, chamomile, or narcissi, and if the excess is thick and cold, use cinnamon fat, nutmeg fat, panax fat, or mentha fat instead.
If the incision is wide, fresh, and fleshy, one should avoid applying fat. These individuals should wash their incisions after cupping with rosewater or cold water, grapevine water, cucumber water, or horsetail water, etc., especially if they have an abundance of moisture in their blood.
They should wash their incisions with vinegar or water mixed with sumac, etc. For those with thick excess, washing with old wine, marjoram water, mint broth, or chamomile, etc., is recommended. One must be cautious about performing cupping in the bath or immediately after bathing.
Instead, it is recommended to perform cupping one to two hours after bathing. No one should sleep immediately after cupping, and both the patient and practitioner should take precautions before and after the procedure.
If the patient has jaundice with blood characterized by sharpness and inflammation, then cooling agents such as pomegranates, dandelion, vinegar, lettuce, skullcap, and similar plants should be given, along with a diet of frugal meals, mutton, and fruits like sumac and others.
For those with a cold temperament, honey drink, mib (or skullcap) drink, and moderate perfumed wine between old and new should be given. They should be advised to eat less and consume frugal meals of artichokes, wild cabbage, sparrows, and pigeon chicks as purifiers. On the day of cupping or leeching, the liquid intake should surpass food consumption.
In some cases, certain people should be given a purgative such as the distinguisher elixir or musk medicine or silitha before cupping or leeching to strengthen the vital organs and purify the blood. However, it should not be given to those in a feverish state.
Cupping procedures that are unconditional are those applied to the liver, spleen, breasts, abdomen, navel, kidneys, and hip bone. These areas cannot endure any conditioning, but the purpose of these cuppings is either to draw blood from one organ to another.
When we apply cupping to the breasts for conditions like nosebleed, or to release a cold, stagnant atmosphere from an organ, similar to placing cupping on the abdomen and navel, it loosens the organ, warms it, and alleviates pain by expelling that stale air.
If applied to the kidneys, with a blockage or stone present, the pressure may open the blockage or dislodge the stone. Similarly, when placed on the liver and spleen during a wind disturbance, these vessels can be used solely through suction.
It may also be used with fire or filled with warm water in cases of constipation. The vesica should be filled with hot water alone, or with water that has been boiled with certain herbs suitable for the purpose.
Then, filled with the mixture, it is applied to the affected area, gripped, removed, and repeated as needed. This is an illustration of the vesica used with fire:
It has a capacity equivalent to two fingers when opened, approximately half a span in depth, and features a small hole on one side, about the size of an needle, made from brass or yellow copper with a thick edge.
Smooth, even, and polished to prevent injury to the organ when placed upon it, with a central rod of copper or iron to hold the candle for heat treatment. Such a vesica can be made larger or smaller depending on the condition.
The skill of the user is crucial, as the vesicas for boys and thin individuals differ from those for men. For these purposes, a small wick or candle made from flax or pitch is lit and placed on the central rod within the vesica.
To ensure the fire does not reach the patient's body, it should ascend towards the lower part of the flask. Then, place the flask over the member and place a finger on the hole we mentioned. So, when we grasp the flask, we do not need to remove the finger.
The steam escapes through the hole, and the flask adheres to the member. Then, bring the wick to the surface and repeat as needed. For the flask used in treating the condition known as "shusah" with water, it does not have a rigid rod or hole.
It is only used by filling it with water and placing it over the member, and this is its appearance: .
The larger the flask, capable of holding much water, the better it is.
Chapter Seventy-Nine
On the treatment of hemorrhoids.
The treatment known as "al-'allaq" (the leech) is primarily used in cases where the application of flasks (mayh al-kamm) is not feasible, either due to the small size of the area, such as the lip, gums, and similar regions, or because the member is exposed without any covering of flesh, like the finger, nose, and so on.
Method of Using It: Take leeches from clean, fresh water free from impurities, and leave them in the water for a day and night until they become starved, with nothing left in their bodies. Then, the body is first purged through leeching or cupping, and then the affected member is washed.
Until it turns red, then apply it. If it becomes saturated, it will fall off; if possible, suck the area with a cupping glass for greater benefit. Otherwise, wash the area with vinegar and then with plenty of water, massage and squeeze. If the bleeding persists after the leech falls off, soak a cotton cloth in cold water.
Place it on top until the bleeding stops. If there is excessive blood, sprinkle powdered gypsum, or rhubarb, or similar astringents until the bleeding ceases, or apply half of a dried and peeled calamus root.
Leave it until the calamus root sticks to the area, and the bleeding will stop. If leeches need to be re-applied, do not use the same leech if possible; if they refuse to adhere, clean the area with fresh blood.
Or, pierce the area with a needle to draw out some blood, and then apply it. If it feels for something, it will stick to the surface; if you want to remove it, sprinkle dust of frankincense or salt or ash on it, and it will fall off.
Chapter Three
In algebra.
This chapter also deals with the necessary skills in surgery, particularly the reduction and fixation of fractures in bones.
Know, O sons, that this chapter is the domain of physicians and the common people; whoever has not perused a book or read a letter from the ancient texts in it.
For this reason, the knowledge of this art has become non-existent in our country, and I have never encountered a proficient person in it. I have only gained from it what I have learned through lengthy study of the texts of the ancients and my diligence in understanding them, until I extracted the knowledge of that from them; then, I devoted myself to experience and practice throughout my life.
I have outlined for you in this chapter all that my knowledge encompasses on the subject. My experience with it has been reflected upon you, after bringing it close and refining it from unnecessary details, summarizing it to its essence, and clarifying it to the utmost extent. I have also presented numerous images of the tools used in it for your understanding.
As it is from further explanation as I did in the preceding chapters, and strength is only with the Most High, the Great.
Chapter One.
In this chapter, after presenting general principles regarding bone fractures and dislocations, before discussing specific broken and dislocated members one by one, it is imperative to initially mention certain key statements and sections. You must first understand and comprehend their true nature, whether you are yourself inclined to learn this noble art, or others who seek to do so.
Therefore, I say that when a bone is broken, dislocated, sprained, or there is a fall, you must first rush to sever or straighten it, or both. If there is no impediment such as weakness of strength, or if what occurred is a young child or an old, frail person, or if the time is extremely hot or extremely cold.
Then, one should restrict their diet to cold legumes, bird meat, and venison, while avoiding drinks, hearty meats, overeating, and any food that fills the veins with blood, until the swelling is relieved and there is no risk of any discharge to the site.
When the patient has returned to his initial treatment, if the broken bone is set, the patient should be given foods that are rich, thick, and nutritious, such as porridge, rice, meat, and cow entrails. Eggs, soft fish, thick drinks, and similar foods help speed up the healing process of fractures and promote better union. However, keep in mind that broken bones in strong young adults or elderly individuals may never fully heal to their original state.
The fragility and hardness of their bones, and sometimes they can unite and heal, but what was once soft like the bones of young children, nature produces on the broken bone from all sides a substance similar to glue that becomes thick and sticks to it, holding them together.
They stick together, becoming as strong and secure as they were originally, so that nothing hinders their functions.
For this reason, the patient's diet should include foods that are firm, viscous, and thick as mentioned earlier. Keep in mind that fractures vary depending on the affected body part; a fracture of the leg bone differs from a fracture of the skull, and a chest bone fracture is distinct from a back bone fracture.
And likewise, all other members are contrary to one another, and we will mention each type of fracture, fully explained in its own section, without any confusion, for the type of bone fracture may also differ within itself.
Because it may be a fracture without chips, and it may be a longitudinal fracture with chips and protrusions that are either healing or not, and the fracture may occur with a wound and a breach in the skin, and it may be a slight fissure.
And each type has a specific method for its treatment, which will be detailed in its place, and among the ways to recognize a bone fracture is its deformity, displacement, and prominence, as well as its sensitivity and tremor when touched with your hand.
If there is no visible deformity, or sensitivity, or tremor when palpating the bone, and the patient does not experience severe pain, then it is not a fracture, but possibly a sprain, a minor break, or a slight fissure. Therefore, one must not attempt to move it by stretching or touching it at all.
Instead, apply the treatments mentioned later, suitable for the location, and then gently wrap it. Be aware that if a bone breaks into two pieces without chips, the fragments may have detached from each other entirely.
It is your duty to correct and set it right from the beginning, before a hot swelling occurs. If a hot swelling does occur, leave it for some days until the heat subsides, then treat it as best you can with kindness and skill.
Beware, for setting it right and mending it is easier than a bone that has fractured with pieces separated, then it should be tightly bound as will be mentioned later; if the bone has fragments, it is necessary to extend the broken limb from both sides, whether it is a hand or a leg.
Either use your hands if the member is small, or two strings, or a string and a hand; place it on a level surface in its natural shape. Once the broken bone extends, then cut off the excess parts and reshape them as best you can with kindness and skill.
Take care not to cause pain or discomfort to the patient with your actions; make every effort to align one bone with its counterpart in the best way possible. At this time, you should touch and feel them with your hand; if you find anything amiss, correct and set it right as best you can.
Beware of excessive stretching and strong squeezing, as many ignorant people do, which often causes hot swellings or pain in the member, as you have seen from their actions numerous times.
Then, after adjusting and perfecting it, and tightening it, he commanded that member to rest and warned the patient not to move it during his wakefulness or sleep, when turning over or disturbed, or when defecating, or in all his movements, within his power, and to strive for the member to be positioned in a way that prevents pain.
If he feels pain or discomfort in a certain position, he should change it to a different one where he does not feel any pain, ensuring that the new position is level and straight.
To prevent any deformity in the member if it is bent, and regarding the way to tighten a broken member, as I have described to you, know that broken members vary in size and shape, such as the arm, finger, forearm, and the like, which can be small or large.
The bandages should be soft and flexible, and for parts like the thigh, back, and chest, which are large, they should be wide and firm, as a broad strap fastens and tightens the large member evenly, without any gaps.
Then, after finishing the adjustment, begin to apply the appropriate plaster. In a gentle compression, apply a layer of plaster on the fracture site, then start wrapping the strapping tape around the broken member, typically three or four layers, depending on the member's needs, and slightly tighten it with your hand, then move it upwards from the fracture site.
With less tension than you would apply to the broken site, then gradually separate by winding slightly away from the fracture location and loosen the tension little by little until you obtain a suitable amount from the correct position, then take another bandage and wind it as well over the broken site.
Then, wind it downwards towards the fracture, maintaining the tension and relaxation as we mentioned in the first winding, then place between the windings a soft splint or cloth to equalize the crack's deformity.
If there is a deformity, do not add anything, then wind another bandage over it and adjust the tight bandages from your set if there is no swelling or hot inflammation in the member.
If there is swelling or hot inflammation, apply what soothes the swelling and dispels the inflammation, then leave it for some days before tightening the bandages; they should be from half-widths of robust cane, carved meticulously, or made from wood shavings.
made from cedar or palm fronds, or heather and kelp, or any similar readily available materials, each bandage should be of this size and shape.
Except for the splint placed directly on the fracture, which should be slightly thicker and wider than the others, the length of each splint is determined by the size of the fractured member, as follows:
Then, you should tighten the bandages with another strip according to your initial tension, and then tie them securely from above with strong stitches as we have mentioned regarding the tension, ensuring that your tension is on the fracture site more. The further away from the fracture, the less tension should be applied.
The threads should be of medium thickness and softness, and they should be particularly wet linen threads. Avoid using thick threads as seen by the ignorant who make their stitches from rolled flax strips, which is a great error.
Because excessive tension causes deviation from the desired outcome, and thin threads are also unsuitable as they do not provide adequate tension. There should be no less than a finger's width between the bandage and the next.
If the patient is harmed by the edges of the bandages after proper tensioning, place under them soft padding or fluffy wool to prevent further damage. If there is a fracture with a wound and a breach in the skin, we will discuss that separately.
Know that not every fractured member should be bandaged from the first day. If the member is large, do not apply bandages until after five or seven days, or longer, to avoid acute swelling.
And this is the description of dressings that were used by the ancients to set broken bones, joints, and dislocations, a general and concise dressing that sets fractures and suits most conditions, especially for children and women, as it is free from heat and cold.
It is to take flour dust, the finest part of the flour that clings to the walls of the mill when it turns, and knead it as it is without sifting it with egg whites, making the dough neither too thick nor too thin, then rolling it out.
Another dressing description for setting fractures, dislocations, and dislocations: take hair from goats, lambs, acacia, rasen, magath, and sack, each costing 10 drams, along with honey, sage, and fenugreek, each costing 5 drams, and thyme costing 20 drams, or Armenian/Roman clay at 20 drams per 12 drams. All ingredients should be ground and mixed with myrtle water or egg whites if the patient's condition is hot, and this dressing, when applied, is well-suited, quickly setting broken bones and suitable for most people due to its moderate nature.
Another dressing effective for fractures and dislocations: take magath, hair from goats, and white chamomile, each costing 10 drams, along with honey, sage, and fenugreek, each costing 5 drams, and acacia at 6 drams, and Armenian clay at 20 drams. Grind all ingredients finely, sift them, and mix with water or egg whites to apply.
A dressing for joints and bones that have moved from their place, alleviating the pain they cause as well as bone aching and fractures. Take softened wool and dip it in vinegar and boiled oil, then apply to the affected area. This dressing does not possess strong healing power.
However, it is excellent for reducing swelling and alleviating pain, especially in hot swellings, another type of dressing that sets a broken bone; take hard fig leaves and poppy leaves, pound them all together, and apply as a moist compress. Another concise dressing used when a bone breaks.
For further reduction of swelling, take equal parts of original line (a plant), chamomile, and calendula, grind them all together, and mix with saffron or water if the part is not too sensitive; otherwise, use fennel water or regular water.
Another stronger dressing for decomposition, used when a solid swelling occurs with a broken bone; take equal parts of original line (a plant), flaxseed, fennel, rosemary, marjoram, violet, and chamomile.
Grind all together and mix with rosewater or distilled water or paint, depending on the part's temperature and condition. According to Hippocrates, in his book, he did not mention placing anything on a broken part during its healing.
Except for the caustic made from wax and oil alone, it should be of a medium consistency between hardness and softness. Galen, however, suggested applying substances with a drying effect, such as honey, frankincense, and resin, along with some heat, when setting a broken bone.
A poultice of various ingredients, including lint, chickpeas, human hair (or bird feathers), and salt, is beneficial for weakness and pain. It should be prepared by mixing and kneading the components into a paste and applied as a compress. The amount of binding material to be used is dependent on the size of the wound.
Then, it should be evaluated. If no pain, itching, or movement of the broken bone occurs, do not remove the binding for several days. However, if there is severe itching, persistent pain, or swelling at the site, the poultice should be removed.
Act swiftly and remove the poultice at the appropriate time, under no circumstances should it be postponed. Take a soft cloth or sponge and soak it in lukewarm water, then gently clean the affected area to relieve itching and pain. Allow the member to rest for an hour afterward.
Then, apply a compress of wool soaked in vinegar and oil (or rose fat) and secure it with a light bandage for the night to prevent further swelling, alleviate pain, and reduce inflammation. Afterward, reapply a lighter binding and a thin poultice.
Treat it gently until it heals, if you see that the swelling, redness, pain, and bloating, and all other symptoms have disappeared completely, but a bandage and binding are still needed, apply them as you did initially. If nothing of what we mentioned occurs in the member, then...
Do not remove the bandage until three, four, five, or seven days have passed, and it may remain for up to 20 days, depending on how the member looks to you as we said... if the fracture is healing and the flesh is almost joining.
Then increase the binding more than your initial tightening, and also thicken the patient's diet as mentioned previously... If you see that the fracture site has dried out and become weaker than it should, then know that food is not reaching it.
Then loosen it with warm water every time you remove the bandage, and do so every three days, and slightly reduce the binding... For this action causes food to flow to the member, leading to quick healing. As for what the ignorant do, breaking the member again with excessive force.
For if it is not set aright as it should be, and is instead set crooked, it is a mistake from their doing, a great risk... If it were right, they would have mentioned it first in their books, and acted upon it. And you would not have seen any trace of that from anyone of them. It is incorrect to follow this practice.
Chapter II.
On fractures occurring in the head.
The types of fractures occurring in the head are numerous, and their forms vary, while their causes are diverse. Some fractures result from a sword strike, completely shattering the bone down to the underlying dura mater. As the impact does with wood.
This type of fracture is therefore called "comet-like" (قدوميّا), as the sword may break off a portion of the bone, severing its face but not penetrating through to the end. This is known as a complete fracture (قلع), and such wounds can range from minor to severe.
Some fractures are simple cracks (هشمي) or contusions (رضّا), caused by striking the head with a stone or falling onto a stone, etc. These can result in either a fracture that penetrates close to the underlying dura mater or one that affects only the surface of the bone.
The wounds caused by these fractures can also be either large or small, and some fractures are subtle, hidden within the bone, appearing as a thin split, like a hairline crack.
Therefore, this type of fracture is called poetic, and some fractures occur due to a fall or the impact of a stone or similar object, causing a part of the bone to penetrate the tissue and create a depression similar to what happens when copper is struck.
This is most common in the soft bones of children's heads, and all types of fractures may have either detached or attached fragments. We will discuss the treatment of each type in its appropriate place and identify all these fracture types through examination.
Examine them with probes and remove any decayed flesh, while the poetic fracture is identified by revealing the bone and marking it with ink; the fracture will appear black. In treating a fracture, one must first consider the patient's symptoms.
If you observe symptoms that clearly indicate fear, such as vomiting bile, restlessness, loss of consciousness, hoarseness, fainting, fever, red and bulging eyes, and similar symptoms, do not approach the patient or treat them. In these cases, death is imminent.
If you observe less severe symptoms and wish the patient well-being, then proceed with treatment. If the wounded person reaches you soon after being injured, especially during winter, one must act quickly.
It is necessary to make every effort to remove the bone before the fourteenth day, in any case. Even in summer days, it is advisable to hasten the removal of the bone before the seventh day, so as not to corrupt the membrane beneath the bone, thereby exposing those symptoms we have described.
If the fracture of the bone has reached the membrane covering the brain, and there is crushing or bruising, you should cut off the broken and bruised part as I have described, which is to shave the patient's head.
When examining the bone, if you discover bleeding or a hot swelling, treat it as necessary, depending on the patient's condition and the nature of the wound.
This involves packing the wound with cloth soaked in a mixture of rose water and fat, cleaning the wound until the swelling subsides and bleeding stops. Then, you proceed to trim and extract the bone, which can be done through one of two methods.
The first method is to cut the bone using a delicate, narrow blade. Here is its illustration:
Then, use another blade that is slightly broader than the first one, as illustrated here:
Then, use another blade that is broader and sharper than the previous ones. You should have several blades of varying widths and lengths, all made from high-quality iron or steel.
Use gentleness in striking the wound to avoid dislodging the head and causing harm, for if the bone is strong and hard, it should be drilled around it before using the chisels, which they call non-sinking chisels, not sinking chisels.
Because the chisel's tip is rounded, resembling a ring or small circle beneath its sharp head, it prevents it from sinking beyond the thickness of the bone.
You should have a variety of these chisels, each suitable for the thickness of a particular bone, so that you have a chisel for every skull, with its sharp end matching the length and shortness of that skull, and here are three types of images. 1. Large chisel
And as for the method of drilling around a broken bone, it is to place the drill on the bone and turn it with your fingers until you know that the bone has been penetrated, then transfer the drill to another location and make sure there is enough space between each hole, or something similar.
Then, cut with scissors between each pair of holes and do this as gently as possible, as we mentioned earlier, until the bone comes out either by hand or with a specialized tool.
Use tools similar to forceps and tweezers, and be extremely careful not to touch the drill or scissors with the peritoneum. Once you have strengthened the bone and freed it from the peritoneum, if it is still attached, remove it.
Smooth the roughness remaining on the bone with another tool similar to scissors, but it should be thinner and gentler. If any small fragments or shavings remain, carefully remove them with the tools at your disposal.
Then, treat the wound with bandages and ointments as mentioned. The other aspect of the work is straightforward and free from danger, as Galen described and highly praised. First, you must begin by exposing the portion of the bone where the fracture occurred. Once this section is exposed, place one end of the lens-shaped tool underneath it.
The posterior part of the lens should be smooth, not cutting anything, and the sharp part along its sides tapers towards the length as you can see, so that the posterior part rests on the peritoneum, and the face of the sharp cut is against the bone, then strike the cut from one side.
Use a small hammer to cut through the bone gently as it rotates, and be secure that the membrane is not damaged in any frightening way. Even if the healer is the most ignorant and cowardly of people, yes, even while asleep.
If anything remains necessary for the bone from the membrane in some places of the bone, scrape it off with the same lens cut itself and release it gently, for it will be freed without harm or fear.
If the bone fracture did not penetrate the membrane, and what broke off from the bone still has a rough surface with fine fragments remaining, you should smooth that surface and remove those fragments using delicate instruments of various sizes, so that you can use them in each place most suitably according to your work.
And the same broken bone and its shape, you should first use the widest instruments in your set to smooth it, then use narrower ones afterwards, consistently proceeding with increasing precision until you reach the thinnest and most delicate ones.
And as for the rest of the small cracks and delicate fractures in the skin, it is necessary to use a treatment for each according to what leads to its healing, which is something that is not hidden from anyone with even a little experience in this art who has studied our writings and explanations regarding major fractures.
If the membrane remains exposed when removing the bone, one should take a piece of cotton cloth suitable for the wound and dip it in rose fat (or some other suitable oil) and place it over the wound. Then take another cloth, either folded or cut into a triangle shape. Dip it in a drink and rose fat, place it on the first cloth, making this as light as possible to not burden the peritoneum. Then use a wide bandage and only tighten it enough to secure the wound.
Leave it with this treatment for a day or two until the hot swelling subsides, then remove the bandage and apply medications that have a drying effect, such as dried iris roots, asafoetida flour, cardamom seeds, ziraund, and similar substances, by making fine powders from these drugs.
Sprinkle the wound with these dry substances, taking care to use a treatment that clears and does not cause irritation. Strive to keep the wound clean during treatment, free from fat, dirt, and ensure pus does not form.
Because when pus collects on the brain membrane, it corrupts and spoils it, causing great harm to the patient. It may occur in the skull's pericranium when the bone becomes exposed, especially if treatment is neglected.
If you observe a blackness on its surface, and the patient exhibits the symptoms we mentioned, know that death is inevitable. If the blackness occurs due to a treatment applied, that treatment's potency to cause such blackness is what leads to the patient's demise.
One should take a portion of honey and three parts of rose fat, mix them well, apply the mixture to the pericranium, and then treat the patient with all the necessary remedies until they recover.
Chapter III
In treating a broken nose.
Know that the nose is broken when both upper cracks (or one) are affected, as they are bone. The lower part is cartilage and does not break, but rather it bends, deforms, or cracks.
If one of the cracks is broken, you should insert your small finger into the nostril and straighten the break from inside with your index finger and thumb from outside, until the nose returns to its natural shape. This should be done gently, taking care not to cause any further pain to the patient.
If the fracture is at the top of the nose and the finger did not enter it, it should be smoothed with an iron rod slightly thicker than the bone, for if the fracture is on both sides, do the same, and hasten to set it on the first day of the fracture.
If possible, and otherwise after the seventh or tenth day when the hot swelling subsides, then enter a cotton thread into the nose hole, one thread for a single fracture or two threads for fractures on both sides.
The threads should be thick enough to fill the nose hole, and some of the first surgeons recommended greasing them with lard and changing them every day, although I do not agree with this. Instead, I suggest soaking the threads in a mixture of egg white and flour powder.
Then, leave the threads until the bone is healed and the cartilage hardens. You can also insert a duck feather pipe into the nose after wrapping it with soft cloth, which will help hold the fracture together and prevent the patient from having difficulty breathing.
This is not strictly necessary, but if you wish to prepare threads, you can do so. If a hot swelling appears during your work, apply a compress of wax or a cotton ball soaked in vinegar and olive oil, or some other diachylon ointment.
If a hot tumour is not present, it should be dressed from the outside with fine flour and powdered candelilla, mixed with egg white. Then place a soft pad on top and do not tie the nose to anything, especially if the nasal bones break in small pieces.
If the tumour breaks apart, it should be incised and removed with the appropriate instrument, then the cut should be stitched and treated with suitable healing ointments. If there is an internal nasal wound, treat it with threading and use lead pipes. so that it heals.
Chapter IV.
In the repair of lower jaw fractures.
If the lower jaw breaks and the fracture is not accompanied by a wound, and it is only broken on one side, without collapsing inward, then its condition is easily recognizable.
If the fracture is on the right side, insert the index finger of the left hand into the patient's mouth and similarly, if the fracture is on the left side, insert the index finger of the right hand and gently lift the broken piece away from the inside towards the outside.
With your other hand, control its alignment from outside the bone. If a fracture of the jaw is split into two parts, it should be pulled straight from both sides to enable its alignment; if it has affected the teeth, they will straighten.
If the split is wide, use a gold, silver, or silk thread to tighten it, then apply a layer of asphalt to the broken jaw and place a folded cloth over it, followed by a large, tight splint or a piece of leather from a shoe that is the length of the beard. Then secure it from above in the best way you know how to keep it in place, ensuring it does not come undone. Instruct the patient to rest and avoid movement, providing them with soft porridge as food. If you notice any change in the shape of the jaw after three days, unfasten it immediately.
Then secure it from above in the best way you know how to keep it in place, ensuring it does not come undone. Instruct the patient to rest and avoid movement, providing them with soft porridge as food. If you notice any change in the shape of the jaw after three days, unfasten it immediately. Then, prepare a new dressing with flour from a mortar, mixed with egg white or fine semolina, after removing the asphalt. Place soft thread over the dressing and secure it with tape. As long as the dressing sticks well and does not change the position of the bone, leave it in place.
Do not remove the dressing until the fracture has healed and strengthened, as this fracture often takes three weeks to heal completely. If a hot swelling appears during this time, use the methods we have mentioned repeatedly to relieve it.
And if the fracture is accompanied by a wound, if a piece or pieces of bone have become detached, be gentle in removing them, using whatever means are appropriate for their extraction from the body. If the opening of the wound is narrow, widen it with the scalpel as much as you need.
Then, if you have removed the shards and nothing remains, outline the wound with a line if it is wide, or apply one of the appropriate ointments to it. And stitch the wound until it heals.
Chapter V.
In the treatment of a broken clavicle.
The clavicle most often breaks in the front, near the shoulder joint, and it can break in one of three ways: either it snaps into two pieces without any shards, which is the easiest to set, or it may break into three pieces with a fragment, or it may shatter into multiple pieces.
Either the fracture may occur with shards, which is more difficult to set, or it could be accompanied by a wound. If there is no wound, have two assistants help: one holds the arm adjacent to the broken clavicle, while the other gently stretches the neck towards the opposite side.
Then, align the fracture with your fingers until its shape is as it should be, without any bumps or gouges. If more extension is required, place a ball of cloth or wool under the patient's armpit.
And you should make the bone as needed, extending and raising the clavicle, and pressing the ball with your hand until the fracture is aligned as it should be. If you cannot pull the end of the clavicle outward due to its deep position, the patient should lie on their stomach.
And a pillow should be placed under the patient's elbow, and the server should press the patient's elbow downward, so that the clavicle, which was deep, rises upward. Then, align and shape the fracture with your fingers.
If you feel that a fragment of the clavicle has broken off and is moving, you should pry it out gently. If the fragment is stuck in the bone, use one of the cutting tools prepared for this purpose to dislodge it. After the clavicle is secured, use an instrument to hold the abdominal cavity, which can be made of wood or iron. This is its shape: [image or description omitted as per instructions].
It resembles a spoon without serration, with a width determined by the size of the bone and a length suitable for your work, as you can see, one end is wider and the other narrower.
If the wound laceration that you have made while removing a bone fragment is wide and you have secured the hot edema, then close the wound by stitching it. If the laceration is slight or you fear the hot edema, then enlarge the wound with additional incisions and bandages according to the depth of the wound.
If there is a hot edema, moisten the wound with rose fat and vinegar or wine, and apply it. For a bone that is not fractured or cut, wrap it with a bandage made from flour and egg white. Then place a soft pad on it, and if necessary, place a ball under his armpit. Then take a long cloth, about a span wide, and wrap it around the splint and bandage. Then take a thin board as a brace. It should be three fingers wide and long, then insert it into a cloth, and then insert that cloth with the brace into the place on the wrap where the fracture is located, then tighten the wrap around the fracture. Apply it to his neck, under the correct armpit and under the affected armpit, and pull it back and forth on both sides. As you can see, the tension secures the fracture firmly, which is self-explanatory.
Be sure not to remove the brace from the broken bone. Therefore, you should examine the patient every day. As soon as the bandage relaxes and you see that the splint has been removed, repair it and tighten the bandage. Then make the patient sleep on his back and place a small pillow under his arm when he sleeps at night.
So that his arm may be lifted from his side, thus raising the collarbone fracture with the movement of the shoulder, or his arm may be bound to his neck. Do not loosen the bandage unless there is some change in the condition at the site after 12 days.
Then renew the bandage if you see that it is necessary. And it responds to compression, leaving it until the fracture of the collarbone heals and solidifies, becoming stronger and more powerful in 28 days. And it may be in some people in less than that.
Chapter VI.
In the treatment of shoulder fractures, it is rare for the entire shoulder to fracture at once; rather, only certain parts or perhaps a portion in the middle may break. This can be determined by touch, and according to the shape of the fracture, the treatment should be tailored accordingly.
Restoreth it to its natural form by every possible means, then apply a dusting of millstone with egg white and soft lint, and place a pad of folded cloth on top. Afterwards, apply a broad splint of a plank.
Make it as thin as possible, or slightly wider than the shoulder, and if there is a depression under the splint in one of the shoulder areas, correct that depression with soft lint until the splint rests evenly, then tighten it with a long bandage.
Tighten it securely and ensure the splint remains in place, checking the bandage daily. If it slackens, tighten it and adjust the splint as needed. The patient should lie on their healthy side, and the shoulder will heal in approximately 20 days.
After 20 or 25 days, if this period is complete, loosen the bandage with confidence, for it is a bone that is unlikely to break or crack. If a fragment does protrude and irritates under the skin, make an incision and extract it. Follow the same procedure for treating a fracture of the clavicle, applying the necessary measures to soothe any hot inflammation that may occur.
Chapter VII
In Treating Rib Fractures.
The chest may fracture in the middle, but this is rare, and its extremities are more prone to fractures and dislocation. Among its symptoms, if it fractures in the middle, it leans downwards, causing severe pain, difficulty breathing, and coughing.
If it bleeds, the deformity of the broken bone may be clearly visible to the touch. To treat it, the patient should lie on their back, with a pillow placed between their shoulders. Then, press the elbows and gently arrange the ribs from both sides, smoothing out the bone as much as possible.
And align it until the bone returns to its proper shape. Then, apply a splint and a brace made from a thin board like willow or heather, wrapped in a cloth for comfort. Then, gently secure it to the broken bone to prevent displacement. Wrap the bandage around the back in a circular motion several times and tighten it firmly. Check the bandage periodically, adjusting it as needed, and tightening it whenever it loosens.
If, however, it needs to be removed due to discomfort, pain, or swelling in the area, dislodge the bandage, address any issues that arise during treatment, and then reapply the bandage if necessary. Face and bind it tightly until it heals.
Chapter VIII
In the case of a broken rib, know that the fracture typically occurs in the stiff parts adjacent to the back or at the ends from the front, due to compression. This is because they are cartilaginous and easily susceptible to pressure during an impact. This knowledge is readily apparent upon examination with the fingers.
Set the broken rib by aligning the fracture with the fingers on the firmest part, until the shape is even as it should be. Then bandage and bind the broken bone with a splint if necessary. If the broken ribs are tilted inward, it will cause the patient severe pain.
And the stab wound, which exposes those with a bruise, as the bone punctures the pericardium, also causes difficulty in breathing, coughing, and spitting up large amounts of blood, which is difficult to treat. The ancients used many tricks in this regard.
Some said that the patient's diet should include foods that produce gas and wind, to cause abdominal distension and expansion, allowing the broken bone to push outward. We discourage this, as it may lead to the formation of a hot swelling if it hasn't already occurred, and if it has, it will only worsen and confirm its presence.
Some say that a cup should be applied to the site and then sucked out with force, similar to measurement, except that there is a fear that the cup might attract curiosity to the site due to its weakness. Some say the site should be covered with wool soaked in hot oil.
The dressing should be placed between the ribs until it fills, making the bandage even when wrapped around in a circular manner, and then treat the patient with the treatment of an inflammation using food and medication. If the illness is severe and exhausting, it cannot be endured. The bone pierces the peritoneum painfully, and we are concerned for the patient's condition. Therefore, we should make an incision at the site, expose the broken rib, and then place underneath the instrument that preserves the peritoneum (as described earlier) and carefully cut and remove the bone.
Then, we gather the edges of the wound if it is large and sew them together. We treat it with ointments until it heals. If a hot tumor appears during this time, act quickly by soaking dressings in rose oil and applying them to the site. Treat the patient internally as well to alleviate the tumor.
The patient should lie on the side that provides the most comfort and allows for easier sleeping until recovery.
Chapter IX
In the treatment of spinal and neck injuries.
However, if the cervical bones are fractured and such injuries are rare, they are most commonly caused by a blow or impact, and similarly, the vertebrae of the spine. If you encounter such a case and wish to know whether the patient will recover or not. Look, if you see that his hands have become weak, numb, and lifeless, and he is unable to move them or flex or clench them, and if pricking or poking them with a needle causes him no sensation or pain, then know that recovery is unlikely in most cases, and he will perish.
If he is able to move them and feels sensation when pricked or poked, then know that the spinal cord remains intact and the patient will recover with treatment. If a similar injury occurs in the spine, you can determine whether recovery is certain.
Look at his legs; if they have become weak and show similar symptoms to the hands, then when he lies down on his back, gas and feces escape involuntarily, and if he lies on his stomach, urine escapes without control. If he lies down on his back and tries to urinate but cannot, then know that he is beyond help, and there is no need to treat him. If none of this occurs, the condition is milder, and treatment should focus on alleviating the hot swelling.
By placing rose fat or fat from boiled egg whites on the affected fistula, apply it three times a day until the hot tumor subsides. Then, apply one of the strengthening, drying dressings to the area and secure it with a bandage, instructing the patient to rest and remain still.
He should not sleep on the affected side until the pain subsides, and if a fracture or something that has healed away is present, it should be cut into the skin and the bone removed. Then, if the wound is large, close its edges with stitches and treat it with healing ointments until it heals. If the last bone of the tailbone (os coccygis) breaks, insert the thumb from the left hand into the anus.
Adjust the broken bone with the other hand as best you can, then apply a dressing and a splint if necessary, and secure it tightly.
If you feel a broken fragment inside, cut into it to remove the splinter and treat the wound as previously described until it heals.
Chapter Ten.
On the reduction of a hip fracture.
If the hip bones break, and they only crack at their extremities, or split along their length and bend inward, this causes pain for the patient in that area, numbness, and paralysis of the leg on the broken side.
If the repair requires passing your hand over it to assess the fracture, and it is only a crack at the extremities, then correct that fracture as best you can so that it resembles its natural shape.
If the fracture is along its length or it has bent inward, lay the patient on their stomach to assess how to set the bone. Once set, apply a bandage and then place a splint made of wood or leather over it, securing it tightly.
Do not worry about the fracture shifting or the splint coming loose, and correct any gaps in the hips using padding until the pressure is even. Then instruct the patient to sleep on their back or on the healthy side. If a hot swelling appears, take appropriate measures.
Cease to extend or adjust the fracture until the hot swelling subsides, and apply what has been mentioned previously to relieve it. Then return to setting and tightening the splint as appropriate. If any fragments or detachement from its ends are seen in the bone, they should not be removed.
It should not be touched from within, but rather smoothed from without, as we have said, and its tension should be left until it heals.
Chapter Eleven.
In the setting of a humerus fracture.
The humerus is the bone between the elbow and the shoulder. If it breaks, treat it by using a curved, smooth stick of medium thickness, as shown in the figure.
Tie two straps at the ends, then hang it from a high place and have the patient sit on a chair. Then place the broken arm on the stick so that the armpit is in line with the middle of its curve, and hang a heavy object from above.
Or, a servant can extend it downwards, and the physician can adjust the fracture with both hands to return it to its proper place. Alternatively, have the patient lie on their back and hang the arm from their neck with a strap.
Then command two servants: one to hold the upper part of the fracture with both hands, and the other to hold the lower part, extending each towards their respective sides. If you wish for greater tension, tighten the bandage below the fracture and above it, and have each servant extend their arm towards their side.
If the fracture is close to the side of the shoulder joint, the bandage should be placed under the armpit and the other end beneath the fracture towards the elbow. Similarly, if the fracture is close to the elbow, the bandage should be applied at that point and also around the elbow itself.
Then, the fracture should be gently adjusted without force until it is aligned correctly and united well. If there is no sign of a hot swell, tighten the bandage. If a hot swell appears, do not tighten the bandage until the seventh day, applying a compress moistened with vinegar and rose oil.
Once the swelling subsides, then tighten the bandage. The method for tightening it involves placing a compress over the fracture, covering it with a new cloth wrap, and then wrapping the arm around the elbow, keeping the hand open on the shoulder.
Carry the cloth and tighten it around the elbow and arm, ensuring that the arm functions as a splint. However, if there is any obstacle or change in the fractured bone, consider using a splint instead.
This involves placing a splint directly on the fracture, which should be wider and stronger than other splints. Ensure there is a gap of one finger width between each splint, and adjust the length of the splints to exceed the fracture by three fingers on each side.
Then apply the binding force to the bandages as mentioned at the beginning of this book.
And it should be that the force applied to the fracture site is greater.
And the more distant the fracture, the less force should be applied; if you observe the placement of the bandages and binding as we mentioned when you reduced the member in its time, then do so.
If you fear the formation of a hot swelling, leave off the binding and bandages until the seventh day, as we mentioned; then examine the dressing every three days to ensure there is no itching, puffiness, or blockage of nutrition to the member due to excessive tightness.
If you are certain that none of these issues will occur, do not remove the binding for several days; the patient should lie on their back, with their hand on their stomach and a moderate amount of wool under the arm.
Examine at all times, day or night, to ensure the shape of the fractured member does not change or the binding becomes loose; correct any issues with your best effort. Make the patient's food mild as mentioned previously, so that when the bone begins to harden, it will be strengthened.
It is necessary to stiffen his diet, for the arm and leg usually harden within forty days, at which time they should be resolved and the patient bathed and treated with ointments suitable for the purpose, especially if the fracture is severe and dislocated.
Do not remove the bandage from him for fifty days or two months.
Chapter XII.
In setting a broken arm.
The arm is composed of two bones, called the humerus, one smaller than the other, with the smaller one attached to the thumb, and the larger one placed below it. It is possible for either the larger or smaller bone to break alone, or both may break simultaneously.
When the smaller upper humerus breaks, it is easier to set and heals faster, but when the lower humerus breaks, its fracture is poor and healing is more difficult. The worst case is when both bones break simultaneously; if the bone attached to the thumb (the smaller one) breaks, then the healing process will be quicker.
When a doctor sets a fracture, they should make the healing process gentle but firm to align the bones. If only the larger humerus is broken, the extension should be more forceful; if both humeri are broken, the extension should be even stronger.
The hand should be positioned during its setting and stretching with the palm extended on a cushion, with the thumb above all the fingers and the little finger below all the others, with the patient seated comfortably on their own.
And let the cushion be at his side in terms of height so as not to burden the patient.
Then, the servant extends the arm from below with his hand or a bandage, and another servant extends it from above as well. The doctor then adjusts the bone until it is restored to its best form possible. If there are fragments in the broken bone, they are removed.
Return each fragment to its place with effort. If a fragment is exposed and penetrates the skin but cannot be set, make an incision and extract it as described earlier. If the fracture is accompanied by a wound, a separate chapter has been dedicated to it.
If, during your initial treatment, a hot swelling appears, apply a compress with rose petal and beeswax oil, medium between thickness and thinness, and gently secure it until the swelling subsides.
Remove the compress and apply a bandage prepared with flour, then take up the splints. The splint placed directly on the fracture should be slightly wider and stronger, and note that in most cases there will be six splints for the arm.
When the fracture is in one clavicle or in both, then make your tension on the site of the fracture stronger and more intense. And whenever you rotate the tension upwards or downwards, it should be slightly looser as mentioned at the beginning of this chapter.
The bandages wrapped around the fracture should be soft and moist, not too stiff. The thread used for tension should be made of special cotton, intermediate in softness and hardness, as described earlier. Check the member and ligament after several days.
If something requires adjustment, such as an itch appearing on the member, it should be soaked in warm water to relieve the itch. The member should then be left unstrained for a night to rest, after which the tension is resumed.
If the tension relaxes and the bone moves or similar issues occur, use all your effort to correct them. Also, check if the member is deprived of food due to excessive tension; in that case, you should loosen it slightly and leave it for several days until blood and nutrients can reach it, then tighten it again.
If the patient does not exhibit any of the issues mentioned, treatment should not be initiated before 20 days or so. Then, hang the patient's arm from their neck, keeping it straight and guarding against sudden movements. The patient should sleep on their back.
Know that this fracture of the arm will heal in thirty days, or in thirty-two, and perhaps even in twenty-eight days; all depending on the conditions of the humours and the strength.
Chapter XIII.
In setting a fracture of the hand and fingers.
The metacarpal bone of the hand and the phalanges of the fingers are rarely fractured, but they are often bruised; so, if a fracture or bruising occurs in the hand, it is necessary to pay attention.
The patient should sit cross-legged, with a chair of equal height in front of him.
Then, he places his hand over it, extends it, and the surgeon straightens the broken bone until it is properly aligned. If there is no swelling or heat, a splint should be applied, followed by a cast above, according to the location of the fracture.
He should be wrapped in a soft cloth, and if the fracture is towards the palm, make a semi-sphere of cloth and have the patient grasp it with his injured hand, then secure it with a long strip of cloth.
The splint should be made of soft leather that conforms to the bend of the hand and secures it as needed. If the fracture is outward, a splint should be applied above and another below the hand to keep it open and extended.
Then, the tension should be carried as the hand rotates, and the fingers should be interwoven with bandages. If the fracture affects one of the phalanges, the thumb should be positioned as needed, then secured along with the hand. If desired, a small, separate splint can be used to stabilize the fracture.
If the fracture does not shift and affects other fingers like the middle, index, ring, or pinky finger, they should be aligned and secured with the adjacent correct finger or all tied together, which is preferable. Alternatively, a small, separate splint can be used to support the fracture.
As we have mentioned regarding the thumb, inspect during the splinting process and after to ensure it is free from excessive heat swelling. Adjust accordingly as needed, based on the previously described methods.
Chapter XIV
In the splinting of a thigh fracture.
The thigh bone is often broken and easily felt because it can shift forward or backward. Its splinting involves tying a strap above the fracture and another below, with the patient lying on their face.
Then, each servant tie should be extended to its side with moderation, especially if the fracture is in the middle of the bone. But if it is close to the origin of the thigh, a soft tie should be tightened, either from wool or similar material.
When the fracture is near the origin of the thigh, extending up, and another tie below the fracture, as well as if the fracture is near the knee, the tie should be placed near the knee to extend downward; then the physician should adjust the bone with both hands until it returns to its natural shape.
The bone will heal well when, in the absence of swelling, one should apply bandages and tension. If a hot swelling occurs, leave it for several days until the hot swelling subsides before proceeding with treatment.
As for the tension, one should wrap a wide, solid cloth around the fracture twice or three times, leaving some excess, then twist the leg until the heel is at the origin of the thigh, and insert a long thread between the thigh and the leg near the knee from below, with the ends of the thread extending upwards on both sides.
Then, wrap the excess cloth around the leg and thigh, place splints on the thigh at the site of the fracture, create a single brace on the leg bone, and fill the space between the thigh and leg with soft rags to ensure even tension.
Then begin by tightly binding the middle of the wound three or four times, and as you move further away from the fracture with the bandage, make your tension lighter and less tight.
Then, proceed to the ends of the thread that you inserted between the thigh and the leg, and tie it to the subsequent bandages above, then pass the ends of the thread downwards until it reaches the heel of the man, and also tighten the ends of the bandages on the other side with it.
In order to prevent the bandage from shifting from its position, leave the tension on it as long as it does not cause pain or swelling or any other symptom to the member. If anything of this kind occurs, then unbind it and correct what has happened, as we have mentioned many times before.
If there is a splinter in the bone that protrudes, you should smooth it out if possible, otherwise make a cut and extract it, and treat the wound as mentioned before until healing occurs. This fracture of the thigh may be secured without adding the leg with bandages.
As we mentioned regarding the upper arm and forearm, except that its fracture should not cause a patient to limp. However, if it is only bound without adding the leg, it is inevitable that the patient will always limp.
Know that the thigh will heal in fifty days or slightly more, or slightly less, all depending on the variation of humors and other conditions.
Chapter XV.
On the fracture of the knee joint.
The knee joint is rarely subjected to fracture, but it may be bruised frequently; if a fracture does occur, it is either a tear or a dislocation of its parts, with or without a wound.
All of this should be judged by touch, and it should be reduced using the fingers until the parts are aligned, then a dressing should be applied and, if necessary, a rounded splint should be used.
The bandage should be tightened according to the reduction, and then all subsequent conditions, such as swelling or heat, should be treated with appropriate remedies until healing occurs.
Chapter XVI.
On setting a fracture of the leg.
The leg has two bones, one thick, called the shin bone, and the other thin, called the fibula, and they suffer from types of fractures similar to those of the arm bones. Therefore, its treatment is the same as that of the arm, and the procedure is identical; if both bones are broken, the leg turns in all directions, and if the thinner bone breaks, the leg turns forward, and if the thicker bone breaks from below, it is something you are well aware of.
Then, use compression, shaping, and binding according to these principles, which are the same, except that if the leg fracture is severe with numerous fragments, the pressure should be less and lighter, and you should exercise caution in its treatment.
In the leg, there is an additional step in the process, as after you have shaped the splints and finished all your work, take two lengths of pine wood used for flattening rooms, or palm fronds or similar materials, to fill any gaps between the boards.
Choose a length that is slightly thick and not too thin, matching the length of the leg from the knee to below, then wrap each one with cloth twice around its length, placing one along the leg and another on the opposite side.
Make them extend from the knee to below the foot, then tie the two lengths together in three places on each side and in the middle; this harness prevents the leg from tilting to the right or left and ensures a good fit. A wooden splint of the same length as the leg can also be used.
And it is placed there to preserve it from movement, and it is most necessary to do this in fractures if there is a specific wound, then inspect the leg every day and pay close attention to it regarding swelling or distension or any other issues. If such a thing occurs, treat it as necessary until it heals, and the leg bone will heal in around thirty days.
**Chapter XVII**
**On Fractures of the Leg Bones and Fingers**
As for the heel, it never suffers a fracture, while the leg bones can suffer fractures, and the fingers even less often, as they are more prone to bruising in most cases.
If a fracture occurs in the leg bones and you see that some of them are pressing against each other, the patient should place their foot on the ground straight like walking, then you place your foot on what is raised from those bones and step on it, smoothing it out.
Until they return to their proper positions, then take the bandage and splint, placing a small board with two flat ends beneath the foot, after wrapping it in cloth and using all necessary materials.
If three or four days have passed, then release the bandage, for you will find the bones either levelled after a fracture or realigned after being dislocated. The procedure is as you have been taught for setting and straightening the fingers.
Then, make a splint for the broken finger that extends along the finger but is slightly narrower, and place this board under the foot as described, securing it tightly. If two or three or more bones are broken.
Make a splint for each finger, graduated in size and placed in a soft cloth, then secure the board beneath the foot, with each end of the board's head extending outside the sole of the foot to ensure proper support.
You must not forget to follow all that has been mentioned for the treatment of other fractures, addressing each symptom as it arises with the appropriate method.
Chapter XVIII
In this chapter, the text discusses the treatment of fractures specific to women's and men's bodies, including the fragility of a woman's pelvis (vagina) and a man's pubic bone.
When the woman's vagina is fractured, have her sit in a squatting position, gradually bending her towards her back. A midwife should grasp her from behind and insert cotton into the vagina until it fills and assumes the shape of a ball, providing support and comfort.
Then, the woman is shaken and her body raised slightly by slightly, so that this cotton emerges until it becomes like a ball at the entrance of the vagina, and the fracture of the bone returns. Then, she places a pad on her back. Whenever she wants to urinate, she removes the cotton gently until she urinates.
It is then returned to its original position, and she returns to her first pad, doing this for seven days or so, and it will heal. If you wish to use a goat's bladder, you can tighten the mouth of a tube made from a reed and insert the entire bladder into her vagina.
Then, you blow into the tube strongly so that the bladder inside the vagina expands. This will help the fracture heal. Then, fill it with cotton and maintain this position for several days as described until it heals. For a fracture of the pubic bone in a man or woman, this method is also used for healing.
This method should also be applied to the hip bone, and the correct approach to these rare fractures is clear to anyone familiar with this text. In most cases, the fracture itself provides a clear indication of the extent of the injury.
Follow the correct procedure for its repair and stabilization. If a man's phallus breaks, insert a duck's esophagus into it, wrap it with cloth, bind it, and leave it for about three days or so until it heals.
Chapter XIX.
In the treatment of fractured bones with an associated wound.
For one who presents with a fracture accompanied by a wound, especially if the bone is large such as the femur, humerus, or similar, one should immediately proceed to reduce the fracture if the conditions for reduction as we have previously provided permit.
If the wound is bleeding, one should immediately apply powdered glass (or any available material) to stop the bleeding, and then proceed with reducing the fracture on that same day without delay.
If a hot swelling does not occur, but a warm swelling does, one should postpone reducing the fracture until the ninth day, when the warm swelling subsides, and under no circumstances should one attempt to reduce it on the third or fourth day, as it may result in adverse effects.
If the fractured bone is exposed through the skin, one should attempt to reduce and set it using their hands with gentle pressure and a slight movement. If it is not possible to do so manually, use this tool, which is made of iron, about seven or eight fingers long. and position it according to the size of the wound.
Therefore, the surgeon should select three or four, depending on what is needed for treatment in each type of fracture, and they should be rounded with a slight thickness to prevent them from bending when manipulated during surgery.
And they should be sharp at the end with a bend at that end, and above it should be slightly thick, and from its middle to below very thin, and this is its form.
They are called in Greek "perim" which refers to a small lever. Therefore, it should be so that its sharp, bent end rests on the side of the bone to be moved, and with one push, it drives the bone back into place, and when the bone has slightly straightened, the surgeon shapes the ends of the fracture against each other with a chisel.
If the broken end is thin and the instrument does not grip it well, then you should cut off that bone end so that the instrument can reach it. If, under no circumstances, the bone can be straightened as described, then cut it with a suitable cutting tool that matches its shape.
Or use a saw to cut it as best you can, then remove any remaining roughness and thin scales from the bone. If, after pushing back the bone, the patient feels severe, painful pain, know that the bone has not returned to its natural position.
If you can return it to its natural position, do so, for you will greatly benefit the patient. Once you have successfully set the bone, dip a cloth in a contracting black liquid, especially during the summer, and do not place any bandages or greasy substances on the wound.
To prevent it from becoming foul or rotten, then use bandages when you have finished setting the bone and leave the wound open by making a hole in the gauze with scissors to match the size of the wound.
Be extremely careful not to tighten the wound with the fracture, as this has often been done by ignorant physicians, causing either death, gangrene, or a cold. Let your tightening be gentle and relaxing, contrary to the tightness of other fractures.
If the wound is bad or it is a large wound and you fear some of the bad symptoms we described, and it experiences pain in the affected area that is disturbing, do not place bandages on it and make for it rolls of stiff cloth in the place where the bandages would be, and tighten it with these.
If, after a day or two, you see that the wound has begun to form pus, remove the cloth you put on it with the liquid, then use twine and ointments as we usually treat wounds, such as the four-ingredient ointment and similar ones, and you should loosen the bandage.
Examine the wound every morning and evening until it heals. The member should be positioned to allow pus to drain easily downwards, for if the wound remains infected after many days without closing or pus ceasing, know that there are small pieces of bone within it.
You should inspect the wound with a probe. If any of the fragments are protruding, extract and remove them. If others are not yet ready to come out but cause pain in the member, cut them into pieces and extract them as best as you can.
If the wound develops a cold, or an infection, or any other form of corruption and putrefaction, it should be treated with the same method of cure described for its kind in its respective chapter.
And among what you should pay attention to and keep in mind: if a large bone breaks and is situated over a member, such as the thigh or upper arm bone, do not attempt to pull or remove it. Often, this leads to death. Leave it alone until it putrefies, for after about twenty or thirty days, it may fall off by itself.
Then, treat the wound if you see a place that can be treated, otherwise leave it alone.
Chapter XX.
In the treatment of the complication that occurs as a result of certain fractures.
This complication often occurs after the fracture has healed, particularly in those near joints, disfiguring the member and possibly preventing it from performing its natural function.
If the complication is soft, use drugs that contract, such as myrrh, gum arabic, frankincense, and other similar substances, taking some or all of them and mixing them with a contracting solution, or egg whites, or vinegar.
Apply this mixture to the complication, holding it firmly for a while, then leaving it for several days without releasing the pressure, and repeating this process until the complication disappears, or attach a tight plate of lead to it.
Lead has the property to dissolve all substances in the body. If the complication has hardened, and its removal is necessary, make an incision from above and cut off or scrape away the protruding fragment until it disappears, then treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter XXI.
In the treatment of fractures, if the bone heals and the member subsequently becomes softer than its original state, it is necessary to apply further treatment.
If a bone fracture heals, but the member remains soft and weak, it may be due to numerous reasons. One of the reasons for this may be either due to excessive use of ties and binding them incorrectly, or over-tightening the ties preventing nutrition from reaching the member, or excessive immobilization, or improper movements at the wrong time, or lack of blood in the patient's body and its weakness.
The treatment involves providing proper nutrition to the patient, enriching their body to increase blood volume, utilizing baths, promoting happiness and joy, and then applying tar to the member to attract a large amount of nutrition or maintaining its immobilization with warm water. until nutrition is facilitated and it returns to its original shape.
Chapter Twenty-Two.
In the treatment of broken bones that heal in a twisted position, preventing them from functioning as they should.
When a member has been set and healed with a deviation or curvature of the broken bone, or has become complicated and disfigured, the result may be unsightly. However, if the member does not prevent its natural function, one should not accept the claim that it must be broken from the root; many ignorant physicians and repairmen have done so in our country.
This action is highly reprehensible, leading to great uncertainty, and among its consequences is damage; but if the curvature and complexity are still fresh, it should be treated with water in which relaxant herbs have been boiled, such as plantain leaves, mint, and rosemary.
It is bandaged with relaxing compresses, such as well-prepared diachylon, or one may use the juice of plantain leaves mixed with chicken fat and goosefat, or take ripe figs, pounded with pigeon droppings, among other remedies known as "narcotic agents.
The complexity dissolves with continuous, gentle friction using the hands, and by moving the member in all directions at all times. If the deviation has become old, severe, and rigid, and requires iron treatment.
One should then make a cut above it, releasing the bone connection and cutting what remains of the complexity or bone with delicate cuts, using gentleness and care, and then treat the wound as mentioned before until healing occurs.
Chapter Twenty-Third.
The jaw, when it deviates from its joint and becomes dislocated, obstructs movement, distorts the shape of the member, and causes severe pain and distress to the patient. Therefore, whenever either of the jaws is displaced, one should immediately seek to reduce it.
It should not be delayed under any circumstances, for if swelling at the site delays its reduction, it becomes difficult to restore the jaw. Therefore, no delay or movement should be made once swelling occurs, as it often causes severe spasms and painful contractions in the patient.
However, if this occurs, one should immediately seek to drain the swelling, then allow it to subside slightly, after which the member is bathed in hot water and grease, and then gently reduced. Each member should be treated as described in its respective section.
The chapters on the jaw have also been arranged according to the order of the fracture, from the upper part of the body to its lower part, as previously mentioned.
Chapter Twenty-Fourth.
In the treatment of lower jaw fractures.
Fractures of the jaws rarely occur, and their treatment depends on whether they are displaced or not. If slightly displaced, they may heal by relaxing into place. If completely dislocated, they must be reduced to their normal position for healing. When the fracture involves the lower jaw, the patient may have difficulty controlling his saliva, making it impossible for him to close his mouth or speak clearly. If the dislocation is minor, in most cases the jaw will return to its normal position with minimal effort.
If the dislocation is complete, it is essential to reduce the fracture as quickly as possible. A helper should grasp the patient's head, while the surgeon inserts one finger into the mouth, at the base of the jaw on the affected side.
If the fracture involves both sides of the jaw, the surgeon should insert both thumbs into the mouth and all other fingers from outside to adjust them. The patient is instructed to relax his jaw, allowing the fingers to guide it back to its normal position.
If the reduction is difficult, especially with both jaws involved, apply hot compresses and fat to facilitate their return. Once both jaws are back in place and the patient's mouth is closed, a mixture of lint and beeswax can be applied for protection.
Then, gently bind it with a loose bandage, so that the patient lies on their back with their head resting between two pillows to prevent any movement to the right or left and to avoid the effort of chewing.
Until the pain disappears and the jaw unclenches, he may eat what he pleases, but he should do so gently and not force his mouth open while eating, drinking, or yawning, until the jaw heals.
If the jaw fails to return to its position after unclenching, it often leads to fever, persistent headache, and even abdominal pain and vomiting. If these symptoms occur, know that the patient is in a critical state.
And often, it leads to death within ten days.
Chapter Twenty-Fifth.
On the reduction of the jaw, shoulder blade, and collarbone.
As for the shoulder blade, it does not unclench from the inside due to its connection to the chest. It may dislocate outward, which is evident to the touch. To reduce it, the patient should lie on their back and extend their arms.
Then press the site firmly with your hand, and it will recede. Apply a dressing and bandages, and tighten them. As for the end that is next to the shoulder and connected to it, it will only come loose rarely; if it does, it should be returned and smoothed as we have mentioned, and what is suitable for you.
Then apply a dressing, bandages, and traction, and instruct the patient to remain motionless and at rest until they recover. With this very treatment, the end of the shoulder will also be returned if it becomes detached again.
Chapter Twenty-Six
In the restoration of the shoulder joint.
Know that the shoulder joint becomes detached in three ways: one is towards the armpit downward, the second is towards the chest, and it may detach upward over the shoulder, which occurs rarely.
It does not detach towards the back of the shoulder or in front of the nerve, but it most often detaches and protrudes downward towards the armpit, especially in those with little flesh, as it comes out quickly and re-enters quickly.
As for those with plenty of flesh, it is the opposite; it comes out with difficulty and enters with difficulty. Sometimes, a person might experience a blow or fall that causes the shoulder to swell up hot and inflamed, leading one to think it has detached; therefore, you should examine it to confirm its condition.
When treating, the shoulder joint should be examined by comparing the dislocated and healthy joints. You will find a visible difference between them, and there is a depression at the top of the shoulder joint when touched, resembling an egg.
The patient is unable to raise their hand to their ear or move it through all movements, and if it dislocates towards the chest or above, this is clearly visible to the touch and does not go unnoticed.
If the joint is soft or the patient is a child, it can be reduced by having an assistant raise their hand above their head, then place their thumbs under the armpit and lift the joint forcefully back to its position while the patient extends their arm upwards.
Then, by gently lowering it, it will quickly return; if it does not return as mentioned, and the joint has been dislocated for many days, the patient should take a hot bath and use a relaxant that softens the muscles, such as cooking roots of fennel, cumin, and rosemary in water.
The patient should lie on their back, and a woolen ball should be placed under the armpit, firm enough to provide support but not too tight. The physician then places their hand over the ball and takes the patient's hand, extending it gently downwards.
If one pushes the ball with their foot, they will be pulled back to their original position. Alternatively, you can achieve this by having a taller man assist, where he stops on the side and places his elbow under the patient's armpit, lifting the armpit upwards until the patient is suspended in the air. Another assistant pulls the patient's hand towards their lower abdomen. If the patient is light, a weight should be attached to them to make them heavier, so that the jaw dislocates naturally. It may also heal in another way.
This involves focusing on the ground a long wooden rod with a round head, not too thick nor too thin, and placing it under the patient's armpit after covering its top with a soft cloth, while the patient stands upright along the length of the wood.
Then they extend their hand downwards on the opposite side, and also stretch their body from the other side with force, causing the joint to return to its place quickly. If it is difficult to retrieve using all mentioned methods, employ this treatment: take a wooden rod approximately two arms' length in length. It should be approximately four fingers in width and two fingers in thickness, with a round head to facilitate its depth within the armpit, as illustrated.
Then, a soft cloth is tied around the round head to prevent any harm to the wood, and it is placed under the armpit. The hand and arm are extended downwards onto the wood, and the wooden rod is secured to the upper arm, forearm, and wrist.
Then the arm is placed on a support. Move the arm across and extend the hand downwards, while the rest of the body is suspended on the other side. Thus, the joint will enter naturally, and if it enters correctly, a moderate-sized sphere of wool should be placed under the armpit.
Then the prepared bandage, made from flour and mixed with frankincense and egg white, is spread over the entire shoulder as it rotates overhead. The ball under the armpit is then tightly secured, and the bandage is wrapped around it and tied above, with the hand hanging down to the neck.
He should keep his hand immobile for seven days, and the patient's diet should be light to strengthen the member, as this aids faster recovery. After seven or five days, the bandage is removed, and the joint is moved through its range of motion. If it holds up without relaxing, the patient is considered healed.
If the joint keeps dislocating due to moisture or other issues, the three black peppers should be applied as mentioned in the chapter on cauterization. After preparing it in this way and removing the bandage after seven days, if the joint does not stabilize, the treatment is incomplete.
If the bandage and pressure are applied repeatedly, but the joint does not stabilize, falls, and becomes relaxed, unable to be raised above, then know that the nerve in the shoulder joint has either been severed, stretched, or damaged. In this case, the joint will never hold its position again.
And as for the jaw that is inclined towards the chest and breast, and when it is pushed and pulled with the hands, it returns to its place, all the pulling and treatment methods are used in it until it heals, if after healing a sensitivity appears in the member and movement slows down.
The patient should take many baths until the sensitivity in the member diminishes and returns to its original state.
Chapter XXVII
In the treatment of the elbow joint.
The elbow joint disconnects with difficulty and returns with difficulty as well, it disconnects in all directions, particularly to the front or rear, its dislocation is evident to the eye and touch, for it is located under direct observation and tactile sensation, to whatever shape it has separated.
When you compare the dislocated elbow joint with a healthy one, it becomes evident due to the indentation in the joint; the arm cannot be bent and the shoulder cannot reach it. You must act promptly to reduce the dislocation before a hot swelling occurs.
If a hot swelling appears, reducing it becomes difficult, and in some cases, it may never heal, especially if the joint is pushed back. In such cases, it is the most severe form of dislocation and often leads to intense pain, sometimes even resulting in death.
Reduce the dislocation if possible by extending both hands and arms of the patient, and the surgeon's hand from above and below the joint, using the thumbs of both hands or the palm's base to push the joint back into place.
If the joint is displaced forward, it can be reduced by bending the hand once and striking the acromion with the base of the palm, facing the joint. If this does not work, use a strong pull involving both assistants to extend the arm.
The patient is also held by two assistants to prevent dislocation during the pull, then the arm is turned in both directions after being wrapped with a folded cloth or wide bandage. The surgeon should grease the joint with a lubricant to facilitate its sliding.
Then, push the joint firmly until it returns to its place. After its return, apply a compress with starch and egg white, tighten it well, hang the arm from the patient's neck, and leave it for several days.
Then, unfasten it, and if the joint remains stable in its place, release the bandage and leave it. If the joint does not strengthen sufficiently, reapply the compress and bandage and leave it for additional days until it strengthens, then release it again.
In case of difficulty in movement, use moisture in the bath and gentle rubbing and tapping until it softens, or place a fat goat skin over the joint, tie it there for a day and night, then remove it and immerse it in the bath. If it perspires, rub the joint gently.
Then repeat the application of the skin in the bath two or three times until it softens. If you prefer, you can moisten cow dung with butter and apply it, repeating this several times; it will soften and return to its original state.
Chapter Twenty-Eight
On the Treatment of Wrist Dislocation.
The wrist joint is often more prone to dislocation and its reduction is easier than other joints, except that it is necessary to quickly reduce the dislocation within an hour of its occurrence before swelling or a hot bruise develops.
To reduce the dislocation, place the patient's wrist on a board, have a helper extend the affected hand, and the physician places his hand on the joint, pushing it back into its proper position. It is important to ensure that the dislocation has returned completely to the inside of the hand.
Let the patient place the visible part of his hand on the board during flexion and extension, and if the jaw protrudes to the visible hand, let him place his inner hand on the board so that the physician's hand may fall on the same joint surface. If he immediately returns, otherwise, tighten it with a soothing bandage for the swelling.
Leave it, do not touch it again, for it is impervious to treatment, and after several days have passed, unless the joint remains in its normal position and does not cause any harm to the patient, except if the hand loses its strength and cannot be clenched.
If, therefore, you learn that the nerve is severed or injured, there is no remedy but to apply heat therapy, which may or may not be effective. Once the wrist is successfully restored, apply the dressing described and secure it tightly, leaving it for five days.
Then, it relaxes and the hand is moved. If movement is difficult or there is any discomfort, soften it with warm water and friction several times until it becomes flexible.
Chapter Twenty-Nine.
On the treatment of finger dislocation.
If a finger separates and points in any direction, when it turns to face the palm or the back of the hand, extend the finger and push the joint with your thumb until it returns to its place. Then, bind the tip of the finger and hang it towards the side it had separated to.
So leave it for two days, then release it and stretch it until it stands upright on its own that day. If at night, tie it as described before; in the daytime, undo it and move it, and at night, tie it. Do this for several days until it becomes strong.
Similarly, if it detaches inside the hand, tie it in the same direction and perform your initial procedure until it heals, and do the same when it detaches from other sides.
Chapter Thirty.
Treating the dislocation of the back bead.
When a bead from the beads of the back or neck is completely dislocated, or many beads have fallen out of place, there is no treatment as death swiftly approaches the patient.
The sign of this is that the patient's excreta comes out without their will, unable to hold it, and often some of their members relax, either both legs or both arms or one of them; and if just one bead has come loose from its place, it often falls out completely.
It can come loose in four directions: if it comes out behind, it is called a hump. Its treatment involves examining; if the hump occurred from childhood, there is no cure for it and it will never heal entirely. However, if it happened due to a fall or blow, etc., then...
They [the ancients] mentioned these treatments in long discourse, much of which offers little practical benefit. I have condensed from it what barely covers the essentials, and depicted the instrument differently than they described and explained it.
I say that the hump that occurs at the front of the chest, or on both sides, is incurable and offers no relief; however, it can be treated, specifically, by positioning the patient face-down.
On a flat bed placed near a wall, with a soft mattress below to prevent strain on the chest, place a vertical wooden pole embedded in the ground at one end of the bed, towards the head, and another pole at the other end, towards the feet.
Have a servant hold the pole, unsecured from the hole, while another holds the other pole in the same manner. Then, wrap the patient's chest and armpits with tight but soft cloth, extending the cloth to the headpole and securing it there.
Then, secure another cloth over the hips and above the knees and at the ankles. Gather all the bindings and attach them to the other pole at the feet, while each servant holds their respective poles, ensuring they remain in place.
Unless they are documented as we have said, the surgeon places his hands firmly on the hernia and pushes until it returns, or he places a board on it and then leans on the board with his legs until it retracts. If this treatment does not work, take a board that is about three arms' length long.
And dig in the wall, as we mentioned, a space for the end of the board to enter, then place the middle of the board on the hernia, and the doctor puts his legs on the other end, and tightens it well until it compresses the hernia.
And it returns to its place. If you prefer, make it with a spiral that is twisted by hand, by driving two wooden rods into the ground at the head of the patient in the far end of the bed, and also at his feet, another two rods.
After that, at a distance of one palm between each wood, make a hole in every wood through which the spiral will pass, and secure all the woods firmly in the ground so that they do not move. Insert a rounded stick, which is the spiral with the tie wrapped around it, into the holes in both woods.
At the end, make a hole through which insert a stick of one palm length that is twisted. Do the same in the other two woods. Then, tighten the strap that was tightened on the patient's chest in the spiral at his head and the straps that were tightened on his legs in the spiral at his feet.
Then he stops at each spiral, twisting his hand with the twist that twists the spiral, while the doctor aligns the hump as we have mentioned. And this is an image of the spiral, the stand, and the patient.
Then, after the spine returns and the position is levelled, one should carry the dried bandage made with egg white, then the padding, and then place a splint above the bandage, which should be a board of a width of three fingers or so, and its length should be as much as takes up the hump's place.
And on some proper beads, then tie it with the necessary bandage and let the patient use soft food until healed. If there is some remaining hump in the end of healing, then one should use loosening and softening medications along with the board we described before.
One might also use a lead plate, and sometimes a bump may remain in the last beads of the spine, leading one to think it is dislocated, and that could be an extra bone that has grown, so do not expose it to this treatment, as it might cause death.
Chapter Thirty-One.
On the treatment of the dislocated hip.
Know that the hip joint and the elbow joint only involve dislocation, not the slight displacement or malalignment that occurs in other joints. The hip joint can be dislocated in four ways.
That is because it detaches inward and outward, to the front and back, but most often inward, and seldom forward or backward; and the sign of its detachment inward is that if you compare the healthy leg of the patient with the sick one, the former will be longer.
The knee will be bent more than it should, and the patient cannot flex their leg at the thigh; and the area immediately following the thigh will be visibly swollen before the head of the femur reaches that position.
The signs of a detachment outward will have symptoms opposite to these; and for a detachment forward, the patient will fully extend their leg, except they cannot bend it without pain in the knee, and if they attempt to walk forward, they will be unable to do so.
They will retain their urine, and their thigh will be tight, and when walking, they will bear weight on the heel; and for those whose kneecap detaches backward, they cannot fully extend their knee or bend it before the thigh muscle contracts, and their leg will also be shorter than the other.
The thigh muscle will be relaxed, and the head of the femur will be clearly visible at the hip; and regarding the correction of this detachment, if you observe that the kneecap has been old and attached to its partner and did not try to return and remain in its state, there is no cure for it at all.
It is not proper to attempt to reduce it, and if the dislocation is recent and of any of the four types of the jaw, then immediately twist the joint and extend it inward and outward, moving it right and left, for perhaps...
If it returns [to its proper position] without further treatment, then the patient should be assisted with a strong helper who extends his leg from below using his hands or a cloth wrapped around his leg above the knee, and another assistant pulls from above.
by inserting his hands under the patient's armpits, then tightening a soft cloth around the hip joint, and holding the end of the cloth by a third assistant, who pulls either from the front towards the shoulder blade or from behind towards the back.
They should all be pulled at once until the patient raises his body from the ground and remains suspended, for this type of pull is common to all four types. If the jaw returns as we described, otherwise each type requires the specific treatment mentioned.
For the specific treatment if the jaw is dislocated inward, the patient should lie on his right side, then a cloth is wrapped around the hip joint between the thigh bone and the area below the knee.
Then, the bandage is extended upwards from the thigh to the upper part of the body towards the shoulder blade, and another assistant, supported by his arms, embraces the thick portion of the diseased thigh and extends it outward with a powerful pull; then it returns to its place.
And this is the easiest type of treatment for returning this member to its place, if it does not respond to this type of treatment at all, then both legs of the patient should be bound together with a strong, flexible bandage around the ankles and knees.
And each one should be separated by the width of four fingers, and the affected leg should be extended more than the other by two fingers, then the patient is suspended from a beam in the house, with a distance of two arms' length from the ground.
Then you command a strong boy to embrace the thigh and another boy to hold onto the patient, and the other boy should push the one embracing the thigh with force; then the joint will quickly return to its place. If, however, the jaw is pushed outward, it has its own return.
Therefore, the patient should lie on their side on the bed as described for the hunchback, tightening the bandage especially on the affected leg and chest. Then, place one beam at the patient's feet and another at their head, and add an additional beam in the middle of the bed, secured very tightly.
A moist bandage is wrapped around it to prevent harm to the patient, with a stick placed between his thighs to prevent it from sagging downward during the tide. Then each attendant stretches towards their side, and the physician aligns the hip with his hands, if it responds to the adjustment.
If it does not respond, place a board on it and press it as we mentioned on the hump, except that the patient should be lying on his right side. If the dislocation is forward, extend the patient's leg once while he is in this position on the table.
The physician places the right hand on the diseased thigh and presses it with the left hand, while extending the pressure downward towards the knee. If the dislocation is backward, the patient should not be pulled downward.
It should be elevated above the ground, placed on a firm surface, and according to what we mentioned, the patient's hip should be dislocated outward while he is facing down on the table with his bindings tightened.
As we mentioned earlier, the compression with a board should also be applied to the area where the joint has dislocated, and if the hip joint returns to its place as it should, and its return is evident, marked by the extension of the patient's leg.
If you observe them to be level, and the patient contracts and extends the leg without difficulty, then know that the member has returned to its proper place. At this point, join the thighs and carry the bandage, tightening it with a turban so that the hip does not move in any direction.
The patient must remain motionless for three or four days, then loosen the bandage and padding, and measure the leg against the other. If they are of equal length, know that the fracture has healed, and release the patient to walk. If there is any sign of lingering relaxation, however, further rest is required.
Then return and dress the wound again, securing it as before, and leave it for three more days. After this, untie it and allow the patient to walk slowly on it for several days until it gains strength, God willing.
**Chapter II and III**
**On the Treatment of Knee Dislocations**
The knee dislocates in three ways: inward, outward, and downward (meaning behind), but never forward. The sign of its dislocation is to command the patient to bring his leg close to his thigh.
If it does not adhere to the thigh, know that the knee is dislocated. To reduce it, have the patient sit down with his legs extended if he is strong enough, and have a servant sit behind him, gripping his middle and gently twisting it backward. Then, sit on his thighs.
Attach your back to his face, place his leg between your legs, then rest your hands on his knee and intertwine your fingers with his knee joints. Then, with firm pressure from your hands, and assistance from another helper extending his leg, the knee is returned to its proper position.
And know that its return is signified by the leg adhering to the thigh with a gentle, non-coerced movement; then bind and press it against the thigh, and wrap them together with a bandage for three or four days, after which release them, and only allow limited walking for several days until it strengthens.
If the return described above is not possible, then use the strong tension of bindings as described in the treatment of the hip to achieve its return.
Chapter Thirty-Three.
In the treatment of the ankle joint.
The ankle joint may move slightly or completely dislocate, and its dislocation is either inward or outward. The sign of its dislocation is the swelling and prominence of the ankle bone towards the side it has moved to.
As for the treatment of its slight movement, it is easy to return it with gentle manual pressure and adjustment. However, if it has completely dislocated, the patient should sit down, and a strong helper should grasp them by the back, mid-way, in order to stabilize them.
Then grasp his foot with your right hand at the top and with your left hand at the bottom, in the area of the ankle. Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand, then with your left hand, repeat this twice. Then stretch the foot with your left hand and push the front of the foot towards the leg with your right hand without force.
Do this twice as described, then in the third time, push the front of the foot towards the leg while pulling the ankle, if it returns once or twice with these characteristics and you see the foot straightened, then repeat the procedure, for it will return.
If the foot does not return as described, lay the patient face up on the ground and drive wooden pins into the earth tightly between his legs, wrapping a cloth around them to prevent injury, then have a servant hold the patient's thigh.
Then another servant extends the leg with his hands or a strap tied around the patient's neck, extending each servant in the opposite direction of the other and the pin holding the patient's legs together prevents the body from slipping downwards during the extension, then the surgeon adjusts the jaw with his hands.
Another servant holds the healthy leg downwards, if the jaw returns quickly, then take up the bandage and splint, tightening them with strong bands, and tie the foot to the leg downwards, being careful of the nerve above the heel from behind.
To prevent the bandage from becoming too tight and causing harm, leave it for two or three days. If the bandage loosens, tighten it again and then release it on the third or fourth day. The patient should refrain from walking for forty days.
If the patient wishes to walk before this period, there is a risk that the fracture may reopen and be difficult to treat afterward. If a hot tumor appears, the remedies described in other sections for relieving pain should be used until it disappears.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
On the treatment of dislocated toes.
It is necessary to adjust the dislocated joints with a slight stretch, without force, as this is easy and not difficult. If the fracture is in one of the toes on the sole of the foot, the patient should rest their foot on a level surface.
Or, they can stand on a board and you, with your foot, place pressure on the joint until it returns to its proper position, without any protrusion being visible.
Then, place a board under the sole of the foot, covering the entire foot, with two ends. Secure it tightly for three days and then release it, taking care to protect the patient from walking for many days until the fracture heals completely, so that there is no chance of recurrence, God willing.
Chapter XXXIII.
On the types of the jaw that are with a wound or with a fracture or both.
When such things happen, and the jaw is wounded or fractured, its treatment and reduction often result in death.
Therefore, one should not undertake the treatment of such a condition unless they are skilled in the craft, well-experienced, delicate, compassionate, and patient, avoiding haste and excessive confidence, and using, at first, only mild sedatives to calm the inflammation before proceeding.
To God alone belongs the will, except for what we hope for his safety from harm with a light illness and some appearance of hope, so reduce it in its initial moment before the hot inflammation occurs.
If the member returns as you intended, use measures to calm the hot inflammations and treat the wound with suitable drying ointments. If the jaw has a fracture with pieces of bone that have become separated, reduce them by extraction. Follow, in this regard, what we have mentioned about simple diseases in their respective places.
Strive to exert yourself and purify your actions from venturing into uncertain paths, as I have advised you. This will preserve your honor and protect your dignity, God willing.
