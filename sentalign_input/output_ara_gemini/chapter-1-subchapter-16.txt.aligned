So cauterization in it is of two types: either cauterization by fire or cauterization by a burning medication.	The cauterization is of two kinds, by fire and by caustic.	0.6820784
As for cauterizing it with fire, you order the patient, before that, to leave his eyelashes, if he is among those who pluck them, until they grow long and even. If it pricks him when they are growing, you tie his eyes with a bandage so that they do not move until they grow.	Cauterization by fire will be thus: tell the patient previously, if he is one of those who pluck the lashes, to let them grow till they are long and straight; and if during growth they irritate him, bind the eyes with a fillet so as not to move till they have grown.	0.8373584
When they have grown and are even, place the patient's head in your lap. Then mark on the eyelid with ink a mark in the shape of an ace of leaves. And the beginning of the mark should be near the eyelashes.	When they have grown and are straight, put the patient's head in your lap and mark upon the eyelid with ink the shape of a myrtle leaf, beginning near the lashes.	0.8732815
Then you place under the eyelid cotton soaked in egg white or in psyllium seed mucilage.	Then apply cotton wool soaked in egg-white or mucilage of psyllium seeds.	0.8876343
Then you heat a cautery iron, this is its image:	Then heat a cautery of this form.	0.5255474
Then cauterize on the shape that you marked, little by little, in many times until the surface of the skin, which is like the shape of a myrtle leaf, is completely burned, especially its surface.	Then burn over the shape marked out, slowly, with many small strokes, till the whole surface of the skin marked out to the shape of the myrtle leaf be cauterized, specially the outer part of it.	0.8808497
And the sign of the correctness of your work is that you see the eyelid has curled up and the hair has risen from the flesh of the eye, so lift your hand then and leave it for three days.	It will show the correctness of your work if you see the eyelid contracted and the lashes risen away from the white of the eye. Then remove your hand and let him be for three days.	0.84788525
Then apply cotton with ghee on it until the eschar falls off, then treat it with the ointment until it heals, God willing.	Then apply cotton wool soaked in butter till the scab falls off; then treat the place with ointment till healed.	0.7807165
If any of the hair returns after a while and the eyelid relaxes, repeat the cauterization on that place as you did first.	But if after an interval there be a return of the same condition of the eyelash and of drooping of the eyelid, repeat the cauterization in the same place just as you did before.	0.7664653
If the hair is on the lower eyelid, cauterize it until it returns to its natural position and the hair does not prick the eye.	And if it be in the lower lid cauterize this also till it falls back to its normal position and the hairs do not irritate the eye.	0.8422089
And it is necessary for you, when working, to be extremely careful that nothing of the medication falls into the eye.	But in your operative procedure take the utmost care lest the least bit of caustic get into the eye.	0.64494526
If the eyelid relaxes after days and we fear something from the hair in the eye, reapply the medication on that area of the eyelid that relaxed, specifically as you did first, then treat it until it heals.	And if, after some days, the eyelid be relaxed and some eyelash irritate the eye, then repeat the application, particularly in that part of the lid that has dropped, in the same manner as before; and treat till cured.	0.80555356
