Chapter twenty-eight on the treatment of dislocation of the wrist.
The wrist joint frequently dislocates.
And the reduction of its dislocation is easy, unlike other joints.
Except that it is necessary to hasten to reduce its dislocation the hour in which it dislocates before the place swells or a hot swelling occurs in it.
And the reduction of its dislocation is that you place the wrist of the ill person on a board and an assistant extends his hand and the physician places his palm on the prominence of the joint and pushes it until it returns.
Except that it is necessary to look, if the dislocation has shifted towards the inside of the hand, then let the ill person place the back of his hand on the board during the extension and reduction.
And if the dislocation is prominent towards the back of the hand, then let the placement of his inner hand (palm) be on the board so that the physicianâ€™s hand falls on the prominence itself of the joint.
And if it returns immediately (well and good), otherwise tighten it with a bandage that soothes the swelling and leave it, do not return to it, because it does not bear it, and you will not be able to reduce it after days have passed for it.
Except that the joint remains in its crookedness and does not harm the ill person at all, except if the hand becomes loose and is unable to grasp anything.
Then you know that the nerve has been severed or bruised, so there is no recourse for it except to tighten it with cauterization, perhaps it will benefit and perhaps that will not benefit at all.
So if the reduction of the wrist is completed, then apply to it the bandage that we described, then it is tightened and left for five days, then it is loosened, and the hand is exercised.
And if its movement is difficult and some stiffness occurs in it, then soften it with heated water and rubbing repeatedly until it softens.
