Praefatio.	Here is the translation:
Postquam compleui uobis o Filii, librum hunc, qui est postremus scientiae in medicina cum complemento ipsius, et consecutus sum finem in eo, ex expositionibus eius, et ipsius declarationibus, uisum est mihi, ut compleam ipsum uobis cum hoc Tractatu qui est pars operationis, id est, chirurgiae cum manu.	After I have completed the book for you, my sons, this one which is the last in the science of medicine with its complement, and I have reached the end of it from its explanations and its declarations, it seemed to me that I should complete it for you with this Treatise which is part of an operation, namely, surgery with hand.
Quoniam operatio cum manu prostrata est in regione nostra, et tempore nostro priuata omnino: donec fortasse periit scientia eius, et abscissum est uestigium eius: et non remanserunt ex ea, nisi descriptiones paruae in libris antiquorum, quas mutauerunt manus: et accidit eis error et haesitatio, donec clausae sunt intentiones eius, et elongata est uis ipsius: Visum est mihi, ut uiuificem eam cum ordinatione huius Tractatus in ea secundum uiam ex positionis, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et ut ueniam cum formis ferramentorum Cauterii, et reliquorum instrumentorum operis: cum fit ex declarationis additione, et ex properatione eius quod est necesse.	Since the operation with hand is laid to waste in our region and at our time, entirely private: until perhaps the knowledge of it has perished, and its trail has been severed: and there remain from it only small descriptions in the books of the ancients, which hands have altered: and an error and hesitation occurred, until its intentions were sealed, and its force was loosened. It seemed to me that I should revitalize it with the arrangement of this Treatise in accordance with the way of position, declaration, and abridgment: and to come with the forms of iron instruments of Cautery, and other tools of work: when it is done with the addition of declaration, and its necessity requires.
Caussa autem propter quam non inuenitur bonus artifex eius cum manu sua in hoc nostro tempore, est: quia ars medicinae est longa, et oportet auctorem eius exercitari ante illud in scientia anatomiae, quam narrauit Galenus, donec sciat iuuamenta membrorum, et ipsorum formas, et eorum coniunctionem, et separationem, et habeat cognitionem ossium, et neruorum, et lacertorum, et numerum ipsorum, et eorum egressionem, et uenarum pulsatilium, et quietarum, et locorum exitus earum.	The reason why a skilled craftsman of this sort is not found with his own hand in our present time is: because the art of medicine is long, and it is necessary for its author to have been trained beforehand in the science of anatomy, as Galenus described, until he knows the benefits of members, and their forms, and their connections, and separations, and has knowledge of bones, nerves, tendons, and their numbers, and their exits, and the courses of arteries, and quiet ones, and places of exit.
Et propter illud dixit Hippocrates, quod nomen cum nomine est multum, et cum opere est paucum, et praecipue in arte manus.	And for that reason, Hippocrates said that a name with a name is much, but with work it is little, and especially in the art of hands.
Nos uero iam diximus de illo in introitu huius libri.	But we have already spoken about him at the beginning of this book.
Quoniam qui non est sciens, quod diximus de anatomia, non euacuatur, quin iam cadat in errorem, quo interficiuntur homines: sicut ego uidi multos ex illis, qui formantur de hac scientia, et iactant se de ea absque scientia, et sine experimento.	For one who is not knowledgeable about what we have said about anatomy will not be corrected, and will already fall into error, by which men are killed; just as I have seen many of those who claim to know this science, but boast about it without knowledge, and without experience.
Quod est, quia uidi medicum stolidum secuisse apostema scrophulosum in collo mulieris, et incidit quasdam arterias in collo: quare fluxit sanguis mulieris, donec cecidit mortua inter manus eius.	What happened was that I saw a foolish doctor cut open a scrofulous abscess on a woman's neck and cut some arteries in the neck. Therefore, the woman's blood flowed until she fell dead between his hands.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui praesumpsit ut extraheret lapidem uiro, qui processerat in aetate, et lapis erat magnus.	And I saw another doctor who presumed to remove a stone from an old man who had grown old, and the stone was large.
Peruenit ergo ad eum, et extraxit ipsum cum frusto uesicae.	So he came to him and removed it with a piece of bladder.
Quare mortuus est uir in tertio die.	Wherefore the man died on the third day.
Et ego quidem iam uocatus fueram ad extrahendum ipsum: et uidi ex magnitudine lapidis, et dispositione infirmi, quod moriretur.	And I myself had been called to remove it: and I saw from the magnitude of the stone and the condition of the sick man that he would die.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui accipiebat stipem apud quendam Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicinam: et accidit eunucho nigro, qui erat apud ipsum, fractura in crure eius prope calcaneum: et properauit medicus cum ignorantia sua, et strinxit fracturam super uulnus cum puluinaribus, et astellis strictura forti, et non dimisit uulneri expirationem.	And I saw another doctor who was receiving pay from a certain Duke of our land on account of his medicine: and it happened to a black eunuch who was with him that he got a fracture in his leg near the heel: and the doctor hastened with his ignorance, and tightened the fracture over the wound with poultices, and splints, and strong bandages, and did not permit the wound to breathe.
Deinde absoluit eum secundum desyderia sua.	Then he dismissed him according to his own desires.
Postea dimisit eum diebus aliquot, et praecepit ei, ne solueret ligamentum: et stetit sic donec apostematum est crus eius, et ipsius pes, et peruenit ad perditionem.	Afterwards he dismissed him after a few days and ordered him not to loosen the bandage: and so it stood until his leg and foot became gangrenous and he came to ruin.
Vocatus sum ergo ad eum: et properaui ad soluendum ligamentum: et consecuta est tranquillitas, et euasit a doloribus suis.	I was therefore called to him: and I hastened to loosen the bandage: and it followed that there was quietness, and he was delivered from his pains.
Verumtamen corruptio iam confirmata erat in membro: et non potui refraenare ipsam.	However, corruption had already been confirmed in the member, and I could not stop it.
Pon ergo cessauit corruptio perambulare in membro, donec periit.	Then the corruption ceased to spread in the member until he died.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui perforauit apostema cancerosum: et ulceratum est post dies, donec magnificata est malicia eius cum domino ipsius.	And I saw another doctor who pierced a cancerous abscess: and it ulcerated after days, until the evil of his deed was greatly increased with his lord.
Quod est, quia quando est cancer purus ex humore melancholico, tunc non oportet ut perueniatur ad eum cum ferro omnino, nisi sit in membro quod toleret, ut abscindatur totum eius.	What is this, because when a pure cancer comes from melancholic humor, then it should not be cut with iron at all, unless it is in a limb that can tolerate it, so that the whole of it may be removed.
Et propter illud o Filii, necesse est uobis, ut sciatis, quod operatio cum manu diuiditur in duas diuisiones: scilicet, operationem cui associatur salus: et operationem, cum qua est periculum in pluribus dispositionibus.	And therefore, oh sons, it is necessary for you to know that the operation is divided into two divisions by hand: namely, an operation associated with salvation, and an operation with which there is danger in many dispositions.
Et ego iam excitaui in omni loco huius libri, in quo uenit operatio, in qua est terror et timor.	And I have now stirred up fear and trembling in every place of this book, where the operation is, which is full of terror.
Quare necesse est uobis, ut caueatis illud, et dimitatis ipsum: ut non inueniant stolidi uiam ad loquendum, et dehonestandum.	Therefore it is necessary for you to beware of that and let it go: so that foolish people may not find the way to speak and be ashamed.
Accipite ergo mensuram cum sollicitudine et protectione, et infirmos uestros cum facilitate et firmitudine, et utimini uia meliore perducente gratia Dei ad salutem et successionem laudabilem: et dimittite aegritudines terribiles difficilis sanationis: et tollite animas uestras ab eo quod facit uos timere, ut ingrediatur super uos haesitatio in fide uestra et commodo uestro.	Therefore receive the measure with solicitude and protection, and heal your infirm ones with facility and firmness, and use the better way leading to salvation and a praiseworthy succession by God's gracious favor: and dismiss terrible pains of difficult healing: and lift up your souls from that which makes you afraid, so that hesitation may enter upon you in your faith and comfort.
Est enim magis remanens ad gloriam uestram, et sublimius in mundo isto, et postremo ad quantitates uestras.	For it is more remaining for your glory, and higher in this world, and ultimately for your account.
Galenus enim iam dixit in quibusdam suis admonitionibus.	For Galen has already said in some of his exhortations.
Non medicetis aegritudinem malam: ne nominemini medici mali.	You will not heal bad illness: lest you be called evil doctors.
Iam autem diuisi hunc Tractatum secundum tria Capitula. ¶	However, I have now divided this Treatise into three Chapters.
Capitulum primum.	Chapter One.
De Cauterio cum igne, et Cauterio cum medicina acuta, capitulatum, et ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum, et ferramentis Cauterii: et omni quod necessarium est in operatione. ¶	On cauterization with fire and cauterization with sharp medicine, distributed and ordered from head to feet, and the forms of instruments and iron tools of the cauterizer: and everything that is necessary for the operation.
Capitulum secundum.	Chapter Two.
De sectione et perforatione, phlebotomia et uentosis, et uulneribus: et extractione sagittarum, et similibus illius: et totum capitulatum, ordinatum formis instrumentorum. ¶	On section and perforation, bloodletting and wound-cleaning, and wounds: and the extraction of arrows, and similar things to these: and all this chapter, distributed in forms of instruments.
Capitulum tertium.	Chapter Three.
De restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus illius: capitulatum, ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum.	On restoration, and setting, and curing of twistedness, and similar things to these: chaptered, ordered from head to feet, and in forms of instruments.
Soli Deo Gloria.	To God alone be glory.
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis.	The book of surgery by Albucasis.
Pars I.	Part one.
¶ De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.	On the use and harm of cauterization: to which complexions it is suitable, and at what time; and whether with iron or gold.
Caput I.	Chapter one.
Sed Ante Quidem Quam rememorer operationis cum eo, oportet ut dicam qualitatem Iuuamentorum eius, et Nocumentorum ipsius: et in qua complexione exhibeatur.	But before I recall the operation with him, it is necessary for me to say what kind of benefits and harm it has, and in which complexion it should be shown.
Dico ergo, quod sermo de qualitate iuuamenti Cauterii, et nocumenti eius, est sermo prolixus, et subtilis, scientia, et secretum occultum.	I say therefore that the speech about the quality of the benefits and harm of cauterization is a long and subtle discourse, a science, and a hidden and occult secret.
Etiam locuta fuit in eo multitudo sapientum, et dissenserunt in eo: et mihi quidem sufficit parum ex sermonibus eorum, timens prolongationem.	And many wise men have spoken about it, and they disagreed on this point; and for my part, I am satisfied with a little of their words, fearing length.
Dico ergo, quod Cauterium confert uniuersaliter omni complexioni, quae est cum materia, et absque materia: excaeptis duabus complexionibus, quae sunt complexio calida absque materia, et complexio sicca absque materia.	I say therefore that cauterization agrees with every complexion that is with matter and without matter, except for two complexions which are the hot complexion without matter and the dry complexion without matter.
In complexione autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.	But they disagreed in a hot and dry complexion with matter.
Quidam enim dixerunt, quod Cauterium iuuatiuum est in ea.	For some said that cauterization is beneficial in it.
Et dixerunt alii contrarium illius, scilicet quod Cauterium non est conueniens in aegritudine, quae est ex caliditate et siccitate: quoniam natura ignis est caliditas: et inconueniens est, ut sanetur ex agritudine calida et sicca, cum calido et sicco.	And others said the opposite of that, namely that cauterization is not suitable in a disease which is due to heat and dryness: because fire's nature is heat; and it is unsuitable for someone to be healed from a hot and dry disease with something hot and dry.
Et dixit ille qui dicit contrarium illius: quod per Cauterium fit iuuamentum in omni aegritudine calida et sicca, quae accidit in corporibus hominum: quoniam quando tu comparas corpus hominis, et humiditates eius, ad complexionem ignis, inuenis corpus hominis frigidum.	And he who said the opposite of that said: that through cauterization a benefit occurs in every hot and dry disease which happens in human bodies; because when you compare a human body and its humors to the fiery complexion, you find a human body to be cold.
Et ego quidem dico per sermonem eius: quia ex perimentum iam detexit mihi illud aliquotiens.	And I myself say through his speech: because experience has already revealed it to me on several occasions.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in se ipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.	However it is not necessary for someone to come upon that unless he has already been tested and trained in the last exercise of chapter Cauterii, and knows the diversity of humoral temperaments of men, and the disposition of illnesses within themselves, and their causes, and accidents, and the time frame of those.
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis.	But there is no fear over you from the other humoral temperaments, and especially in cold and moist illnesses.
Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.	For now all doctors have agreed on these matters and do not differ in opinion with Cauterius about their treatment.
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterisatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.	And know, sons, that from the secret of cure by Cauterius with fire and his good skill in combining medicine with burning, because fire is simple, whose action does not reach beyond the member being cauterized: and it does not harm another connected member unless causing a small injury.
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.	The action of the burning medicine reaches beyond that which is removed from the member: and perhaps it causes disease to occur in the afflicted member, and perhaps it kills.
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.	But fire, due to its subtlety and the goodness of its substance, does not do that unless it is excessive.
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super ueritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.	And now we have learned that through experience, due to the length of service and study with art, and my standing on the truth of things: and because of that I excuse myself from the length of this speech.
Et si non esset, quia non licet huic libro meo, afferrem uobis secretum occultum in igne, et qualitatem operationis eius in corporibus expulsionis suae, qua expellit aegritudines sermone philosophico demonstratiuo, qui acueretur a mentibus uestris.	And if I were not restrained by the rule of my book, I would reveal to you the secret and hidden thing in fire, and the quality of its operation in bodies, by which it expels diseases through a philosophical demonstration that would be sharpened in your minds.
Et scitote filii, quod ipsi dissentiunt in tempore, in quo conuenit fieri cauterium, et ponunt melius tempus ueris.	And know, sons, that the same ones disagree about the time when cauterization should be done, and they put better the true time.
Et ego dico, quod cauterium conuenit in omni tempore: propterea, quod nocumentum accidens propter tempus submergitur in iuuamento, quod attrahitur cum cauterio.	And I say that cauterization is fitting at any time: therefore, because the harm occurring due to time is submerged in the benefit that is attracted with cauterization.
Et praecipue si cauterium est propter dolores ex doloribus necessariis, fortibus, festinis, qui non tolerant tarditatem: propterea quod timetur ex eis, quod accidat malicia quae est maior, quam paruum nocumentum intrans propter tempus.	And especially if the cauterizer is necessary on account of pains that are grievous, excessive, and intense, which do not tolerate delay: therefore, since fear arises from them lest a greater evil occur than the small harm that may be done during the time.
Et non cadat in mentibus uestris o filii illud, quod non extimant, nisi uulgus et stolidi medici, scilicet quod illi aegritudini quae sanatur per cauterium, non est reditio semper: et ponunt illud consequens, et res non est sicut putant: propterea quod cauterium non est, nisi loco medicinae, quae alterat complexionem, et exiccat humiditates quae sunt caussae, quare accidunt dolores.	And let it not fall into your minds, my sons, that which the common and foolish doctors do not appreciate, namely that those who are cured by cauterization do not always recover: and they put forward this consequence, and it is not as they think: therefore, because cauterization is not a substitute for medicine, which alters the complexion and dries up the moistures that are causes why pains occur.
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.	However, cauterization is sufficient over medicine by the swiftness of its own health and the power of its operation and the intensity of its dominion: and it is possible for sickness to return within some period of time according to the complexion of the sick person, and the location of their sickness, and its virtue: and what is prepared in their body from excesses in it: and what comes to them in acquisition through foods and similar things from causes, unless sickness occurs in which cauterization is administered.
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor.	Subtle sickness in a few excesses and moistures of the member, such as cauterization of the tooth for pain and similar things: it is possible that this pain will not return in that place.
Sed illud fit in paucis.	But this happens in few cases.
At uero sermo uulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.	But the common people's speech is again, that cauterization is the last medicine; it is a true saying: not according to what they intend in this; for they believe that there is no cure which agrees with medicine, nor with anything after the application of cauterization.
Res autem est econtrario illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinum, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum mediciuae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt uulgus et multistolidorum medicorum.	But the fact is contrary to their intention, and it's not true that cauterization is the last medicine, unless when we administer modes of cure in some sickness, and those medicines do not agree; then we administer cauterization at the end of things, and it agrees: thus it falls out that cauterization is the last resort, not according to the understanding of the common people and foolish doctors.
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.	The old ones said that the cauter with gold is better than the cauter with iron. And they didn't say this unless because of the equality of gold and the subtlety of its substance. They also said that it doesn't make a pus location of the cauter.
Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probaui illud, et inueni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.	That is not true absolutely: for I have already tried it and found that it does not do that in some bodies without other things.
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt.	And the cauter with it is good, and better than with iron, as they said.
Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.	However, when you take the cauter made of gold and put it in fire, it is not revealed to you until it is ignited according to the quantity you want, due to the redness of the gold. And when it approaches the heat, and if you add ignition on top of it, it melts in the fire and turns into scales.
Quare cadit artifex ex illo in occupationem: et propter illud fit Cauterium cum ferro apud nos uelocius et propinquius, ex rectitudine ad operationem.	Therefore, the craftsman falls out of that habit: and because of this, the cauter with iron is faster and closer to us among our operations.
Et ego quidem iam ordinaui hoc Capitulum in Cauterio, secundum capitula: et ordinaui ea a capite usque ad pedes: ut alleuient quaerenti illud quod uult ex eo.	And I myself have already organized this Chapter on the Cauter, according to chapters: and I have organized them from head to foot: so that they may relieve whoever seeks what he wants from it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Caput in commissura coronali.	Chapter: On the manner of cauterizing the crown.
Caput II.	II Chapter.
Confert hic cauterizatio ad dominium humiditatis et frigiditatis super cerebrum: quae duae sunt caussae sodae, et multitudinis fluxus humorum ex capite ad partes oculorum et aurium, et multitudinis somni, et doloris dentium, et doloris gutturis: et uniuersaliter omnis aegritudinis, quae accidit ex frigiditate, sicut paralisis, et sodae, epilepsiae, et apoplexiae, et similia illis ex aegritudinibus.	This cauterization is helpful for controlling the dominance of moisture and coldness over the brain, which are the causes of headache, and the excessive flow of humors from the head to the eyes and ears, and many sleepings, toothaches, and throat pains: and universally all kinds of illnesses that occur due to coldness, such as paralysis, lethargy, epilepsy, apoplexy, and similar ones from those illnesses.
Modus cauterizationis est, ut praecipias infirmo: ut euacuetur in primis cum medicina solutiua mundificante caput tribus noctibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod exigit uirtus infirmi, et eius aetas, et consuetudo eius.	The method of cauterization is this: you should precede the patient with a medicine that is soluble, purifying and cleansing the head for three nights or four, according to what the strength of the patient requires, and his age, and habit.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radi faciat caput suum cum nouacula.	Then command him to make his head radiate with a scalpel.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas quadratum, ita quod iam posuit manus suas super pectus suum.	Then have him sit between your four hands, so that he has already placed his own hands on his chest.
Deinde pone radicem palmae tuae super radicem nasi sui inter oculos suos.	Then place the root of your hand on the root of his nose between his eyes.
Vbicumque ergo peruenerit digitus tuus medius, signa locum illum cum incausto.	Wherever then your middle finger comes to rest, mark that spot with a seal.
Deinde igni Cauterium Oliuare: cuius haec est forma.	Then apply the cautery of olive oil, whose form is this.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum signatum cum incausto, descensione, qua constringatur manus tua paulatim, et tu reuolues ipsum.	Then place it on top of the marked spot with a seal, with a slow descent by which your hand is gradually constricted and you will turn it over.
Deinde leua manum tuam uelociter, et aspicias locum.	Then quickly lift up your left hand and look at the place.
Quod si uides iam detegi ex osse quantitatem capitis alkiel, aut quantitatem zeuherbi, tunc eleua manum tuam.	For if you see already a quantity of bone or flesh removed from the skull, like an alkali or a zeuhuberbe, then lift up your hand.
Et si non, itera manum tuam ferro ipso, aut cum alio ab ipso si infrigidatur: donec uideantur ossa, quae dixi tibi.	And if not, repeat your hand with the same iron or with another one that is cooled down from it: until you see the bones which I told you about.
Deinde sume aliquid ex sale, et solue illud in aqua, et imbibe in ipso cotum, et pone super locum: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then take something from the salt and dissolve it in water, and pour it into the same wound, and place it on top: and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, et dimitte illum super locum, donec destruatur eschara ignis.	Then place the soaked compress on top of the wound, and leave it there until the scab is destroyed by fire.
Deinde cura illud cum unguento tetrapharmacon, usquequo sanetur.	Then care for that with the ointment tetrapharmakon, until it heals.
Iam dixerunt, quod quanto uulnus plus remanet apertum, emittit pus: quare est melius et magis iuuatiuum.	They have already said that the wound that remains more open emits pus, therefore it is better and more helpful.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum, ut cauterizetur cutis usque ad os: et teneatur Cauterium, donec aduratur quiddam spissitudinis ossis.	And some of them said that the skin should be cauterized up to the bone and held with a cautery until something thickened on the bone is burned.
Deinde radatur post illud quod adustum est ex osse, deinde curetur.	Then it will be reduced after what has been burned off from the bone, then it will be cured.
Et dicunt alii, quod oportet ut cum cauterio perueniatur ad ultimum, donec imprimat in os impressionem for tem, ita quod cadat os, quod fit sicut forma kirate: aut instrumentum quod mulieres ponunt infuso alphabeti parui: et extimant, quod exspirantur ex hoc loco uapores capitis, et dimittatur uulnus apertum tempore longo.	And others say that it is necessary to reach the end with a cautery, until it stamps its mark on the bone like a kirate form: or an instrument that women use to write small letters: and they fear that vapors of the head will escape from this place, and the wound will be left open for a long time.
Deinde curetur, donec consolidetur.	Then it should be treated until it is consolidated.
Mihi autem non uidentur hae duae species Cauterii omnino nisi in quibusdam hominibus secundum uiam timoris.	But to me, these two types of cautery seem utterly useless except in certain people according to the way of fear.
Et dimittere ipsum, apud me est melius cum salute ipsius.	And to leave it up to me is better for its salvation.
Debilitatur enim caput ex solutione continuitatis ipsius naturalis: sicut testificati sumus in reliquis membris: et praecipue quando caput infirmi debile est natura: et species quidem Cauterii prima est magis salua et melior apud me, et ea utor: operare ergo cum ea in salute.	For the head is weakened by the dissolution of its natural continuity, just as we have testified in other members; and especially when the head of an infirm person is weak by nature. And indeed, the first type of cautery is more salutary and better for me, and I use it: therefore I will operate with it for the sake of health.
¶ De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.	On the manner of cauterizing the head when the entire head is in pain.
Caput III.	Chapter 3.
Quando in toto Capite accidit dolor chronicus: et prolongatur illud in infirmo, et utitur hyeris, et cochiis, et caputpurgiis, et oleis, et empleumatis.	When chronic pain occurs throughout the entire head and persists in an invalid, and they use hellebores, and gall-nuts, and head-clearing medicines, and oils, and poultices.
Et praecipue si iam cauterizatum est cauterio uno, quod narrauimus, et non confert ei aliquid ex illis: tunc considera.	And especially if it has already been cauterized with the first type of cautery that we described, and nothing benefits them from those things: then consider.
Nam si caput infirmi est fortis creationis natura, et non est debile, et inuenit frigus uehemens: tunc cauteriza cum cauterio alio sub illo parum.	For if the head of an invalid is strong by natural creation and not weak, and it finds a moderate coldness: then cauterize with another type of cautery under that slightly.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio, do nec pertranseat cutis, et discooperiatur ex osse quantitas, quam narrauimus.	Then cauterize it above all the horn of one's own head with that cautery, so that it does not penetrate the skin and uncover a quantity from the bone as we described.
Et cauteriza ipsum cauterio uno in occipitio capitis sui, in loco qui nominatur uas: et est locus in quo ponitur uentosa: et eleua matum tuam in hoc, et non discooperias os.	And cauterize it with the first type of cautery at the back of one's own head, in the place which is called the vessel: and it is a location where a tumor is placed; and lift up your mother's hair on this spot, and do not uncover the bone.
Infirmus enim inuenit propter illud dolorem uehementem, et diuersum a dolore reliquorum cauteriorum capitis omnium.	For an invalid finds it due to that intense pain, and different from the pain of other cauterizations throughout all the head.
Et ego dicam hoc Cauterium in loco suo: et oportet quod sit cauterium, quo cauterizantur cornua capitis, et occiput eius subtilius cauterio, quo cauterizatur medium capitis.	And I will say that this cautery is in its place: and it must be a cautery by which the horns of the head are cauterized, and the back of it is subtly cauterized with a cautery by which the middle of the head is cauterized.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in hemicrania, tam cum medicina adustiua, quam cum ferro.	On the method of cauterizing in a headache, whether with burnt medicine or iron.
Caput IIII.	Chapter Four.
Quando accidit in parte capitis dolor et soda, aut extenditur dolor usque ad oculum, et euacuatur cum medicinis mundificantibus caput, et administratur reliqua curatio, quam dixi in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert illud totum: tunc cauterizatio in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterizatio cum medicina acuta comburente: aut cum ferro.	When it happens that there is pain and swelling on the head, or the pain extends to the eye, and the head is cleansed with medicines, and the rest of the treatment which I mentioned in my divisions of diseases is applied, and this does not help at all: then cauterization in it is done in two ways: either by cauterization with a burning medicine, or with iron.
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus.	The cauterization with a burning medicine is this: take one tooth of garlic, and extract the pulp from it, and cut off its extremities from both sides.
Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.	Then divide the place of pain with a broad lancet in time, until there is a space under the skin where the tooth is taken.
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso sub cute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitteuulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Then insert it into that space under the skin until it is hidden: afterwards tie a thread over it with a gentle constriction, and leave it for fifteen hours; then loose it and take out the garlic, and leave the wound two or three days; afterwards put a poultice soaked in butter on top of it until the place becomes pus-filled: then cure it with ointment until it heals.
Et si uis fac illud cum quibusdam medicinis comburentibus, quas ego scripsi in tractatu duodecimo, de Medieinis adurentibus.	And if you wish to do that with certain burning medicines, which I wrote about in the twelfth treatise on Blistering Medicines.
Cauterizatio uero eius cum ferro, est secundum hunc modum.	The cauterization with iron is done in this way.
Igni Cauterium, cuius forma haec est.	The Ignis Cauterium, whose form is this.
Et nominatur Clauilis: quoniam forma capitis eius est sicut forma claui, in quo est quiddam curuitatis, et in medio eius est quaedam eminentia parua.	And it is called Clavilus: because the form of its head is like the form of a hook, in which there is some curvature, and in the middle of it is a small projection.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum, et retine manum tuam: et tu reuolue ferrum paulatim cum uelocitate: et sit quantitas quae aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, sicut medietas eius.	Then place it on the spot and hold your hand: and turn the iron slowly with speed: and let the amount that is burned be equal to the thickness of the skin, as its middle.
Et eleua manum tuam, ut non aduratur arteria, quae est inferius, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And lift up your hand so that the artery that is below may not be burned and bleeding may occur.
Deinde imbibe cotum in aqua salis, et pone super locum, et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus: deinde pone cotum cum butyro: postea cura cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Then soak the poultice in salt water and place it over the wound, and let it be for three days. Then put the poultice with butter on it. After that, care for it with an ointment until it heals.
Et si uis, cauteriza hanc hemicraniam cum extremitate cultellari secunda Cauterii.	And if you wish, cauterize this hemi-cranium with the second edge of the cauterizer's knife.
Et caue ab incisione arteriae in hac hemicrania, non antiqua proprie.	And beware of cutting into an artery in this hemi-cranium, not one that is truly old.
¶ De modo cauteriezandi in hemicrania antiqua.	About the way to cauterize in an old hemi-cranium.
Caput V.	Head 5.
Quando curas hemicraniam, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione praecedente, et quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio: et uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei quod diximus ex cauterio primo cum medicina, aut cum cauterio cum igne, tunc oportet ut ignias Cauterium cultellare, donec albificetur postquam signas super locum doloris cum linea, cuius longitudo sit medietas digiti, aut quasi illud: et depone manum tuam uice una, et stringe eam donec incidas arteriam, et peruenias usque ad os.	When you are treating a hemi-cranium, with what we mentioned earlier in the previous treatment and what we said about divisions of illnesses, and not to give a remedy: and you see from an illness that what we said about cauterization first with medicine or with fire does not suffice for him; then it is necessary to take the burning Cauterium knife until it becomes white after which you mark above the place of pain with a line, the length of which is half a finger's breadth or so: and put your hand on one side and press it until you cut into an artery and reach the mouth.
Verumtamen necesse est tibi, ut caueas a continuatione mandibulae, quae mouetur apud masticationem, ne aduratur latus, aut neruus qui mouet ipsam, unde accidat spasmus.	However, it is necessary for you to beware of the continuation of the jawbone which moves during mastication, lest the side or nerve that moves it be burned, and a spasms occur.
Et esto super custotiam, et cautelam de fluxu sanguinis arteriae, quae abscisa est.	And be on guard against bleeding from the artery which has been cut.
In abscisione enim eius est timor, et praecipue ei qui ignorat illud quod facit, et non est studiosus, nec expertus: et dimittit operationem cum eo in primis.	For the cutting of it is a source of fear, and especially for one who does not know what he is doing and is not studious or experienced: and he leaves off the operation with that very first.
Et ego ueniam cum rememoratione regiminis fluxus sanguinis accidentis ex arteria secundum modum suum, et in loco suo huius libri.	And I come back with the recollection of the regimen for controlling the bleeding that occurs from an artery according to its own method, and in its place in this book.
Quod si uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei hoc Cauterium, et uides corpus infirmi tolerans cauterium in medio capitis, sicut narrauimus, cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	If you see that from illness the cautery does not suffice for him, and you see the patient's body enduring the cautery in the middle of the head, as we have narrated, care for the wound until it is healed.
Et si uis, administra Cauterium, quod diximus in capitulo extractionis arteriae cum Cauterio habente duos cultellos.	And if you wish, apply the cautery that we mentioned in the chapter on extracting an artery with a cautery having two knives.
Est enim cauterizatio melior hac et magis conferens.	For this cautery is better and more effective.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Aurium.	On the manner of cauterizing the ears in pain.
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Quando accidit in Aure dolor a frigore, et curatur cum solutiuis, et reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione, et non remouetur dolor, tunc igni Cauterium: et est illud quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma est haec.	When pain occurs in the ear from cold and is treated with remedies and the remaining treatment that we mentioned in the division, and the pain does not subside, then apply a cautery with fire: and it is what is called a Point, whose form is this.
Deinde puncta cum eo post eius ignitionem in circumitu auris totius, sicut reuoluitur: aut in circumitu utriusque, si simul dolor est in utrisque.	Then the point with it after its ignition in a circle around the entire ear, as it revolves; or in a circle of both, if pain is simultaneously present in both.
Et elonga te cum Cauterio a radice auris parumper, postquam signaueris loca cum encaustro: et sit cauterii quantitas decem punctorum in omni aure, et quasi illa.	And extend yourself with the cautery from the root of the ear for a little bit, after you have marked the places with encaustic: and let the quantity of the cautery be ten points on each ear, and so on.
Deinde cura loca, donec sanentur.	Then care for the places until they are healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tortura.	On the manner of cauterizing in Torture.
Caput VII.	Chapter VII.
Tortura quae curatur cum cauterizatione, non est nisi ex speciebus, quae accidunt ex phlegmate, secundum quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum.	The torture that is cured with cauterization is not from any of the types that occur due to phlegm, according to what we mentioned in the divisions of illnesses.
Et deuita cauterizationem speciei, quae accidit ex exiccatione, et spasmo nerui.	And having applied the cautery to the species that occurs due to drying and nerve spasm.
Quando curas hanc speciem torturae cum hyeris, et caputpurgiis, et gargarismis, et non confert curatio tua, tunc oportet ut cauterizes infirmum tribus Cauteriis: uno apud radicem auris, et secundo parum inferius a timpore suo, et tertio apud coniunctionem duorum labiorum.	When you treat this species of torture with hirings, head-washings, and gargling, and your treatment does not help, then it is necessary to cauterize the patient three times: one at the root of the ear, and the second a little below its time, and the third at the junction of the two lips.
Et pone Cauterium tuum ex contrario partis infirmae.	And place your cautery opposite the weaker part.
Quoniam mollificatio non accidit, nisi in parte quae apparet sana.	Because softening does not occur unless it is in a part that appears healthy.
Et forma cauterizationis est, ut cauterizes ipsum Cauterio in directo extremitatis auris superioris sub cornu capitis parum: et alio in timpore: cuius longitudo sit secundum longitudinem pollicis.	And the shape of cauterization is this: that you cauterize with the cautery directly on the upper extremity of the ear, a little below the horn of the head; and at another time: whose length is according to the length of the thumb.
Et depone manum tuam cum cauterio, donec comburatur quantitas medietatis spissitudinis cutis.	And place your hand with the cautery until it burns a quantity equal to the thickness of the skin in the middle.
Et haec est forma Cauterii, et est species ex cultellari, cuius forma praemissa est: uerumtamen non est subtilior ea parum, sicut uides: et oportet ut sit cultellus in eo superfluae grossitudinis parum.	And this is the form of the cautery, and it is a kind of knife, whose shape is as follows: although it is not much thinner than what you see, and it is necessary for there to be a little excess thickness on it.
Deinde cura loca, cum eo quod praecessit: donec sanetur.	Then take care of the area with what has preceded: until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Apoplexia antiqua.	Of the manner of cauterizing in old apoplexy.
Caput VIII.	Chapter VIII.
QUando antiquatur Apoplexia, et curas eam cum eo quod diximus, et non confert medicatio tua, et infirmus non habet febrem, tunc cauteriza eum quatuor cauteriis super omne cornu capitis sui, et cauterio in medio capitis, sicut diximus, et cauterio in occipitio capitis, secundum quod praecessit: et modus cauterii sit secundum quod praecessit.	When old apoplexy is present and you treat it with what we have said, but your treatment does not help, and the patient does not have a fever, then cauterize him with four cauteries on all of his horn-like protrusions from the head, and the cautery in the middle of the head, as we have said, and the cautery at the back of the head, according to what has preceded: and the manner of cauterization is according to what has preceded.
Etiam cauterizatur cum Cauterio super os stomachi: et est magis ultimum.	Also cauterize with a cautery on the mouth of the stomach: and it is the most last.
Deinde curetur, cum eo quod praecessit.	Then treat, with what has preceded.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Obliuione.	Of the manner of cauterizing in Oblivion.
Caput IX.	Chapter IX.
Oportet ut in potu dentur in primis infirmo hyerae magnae, et pillulae mundificantes cerebrum.	It is necessary that in the cup, be given first to the patient a great amount of hyeracium, and purifying pills for the brain.
Deinde rade caput infirmi totum, et pone super occipitium eius emplastrum de synapi descriptum in tractatu emplastrorum: et pone ipsum aliquotiens.	Then apply an emplaster to the whole head of the patient, and place on the back of his head the plaster described in the treatise on emplasters, and repeat it several times.
Ipsum namque est modus Cauterii: et fac illud secundum ordinem eundem, quem dixi illic.	This is the method of cauterization. Do it in the same order that I told you there.
Si ergo sanatur per illud, bonum est.	If it heals through that, it's good.
Si non: tunc fac ei cauteria tria in posteriori parte capitis sui, quae sint descendentia a superiori parte capitis usque ad inferiorem partem oculi: et pone inter omne cauterium grossitudinem digiti.	If not, then make three cauteries on the back of his head, which will descend from the upper part to the lower part of the eye, and place between each cautery the thickness of a finger.
Deinde cura Cauterium, cum eo quod praecessit.	Then care for the cauterization with whatever came before it.
Si autem uis additionem, et infirmus est tolerans illud: tunc fac ei Cauterium in medio.	But if you want to add more and he is weakly enduring that, then make a cauterization in the middle.
Quod si uis additionem: tunc cauteriza ipsum super duo cornua.	And if you want to add more, then cauterize him above both horns.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: sitque Cauterium oliuare secundum formam, quae praemissa est.	Then care for him until he is healed, and make the cauterization with oil according to the form that was previously mentioned.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Paralisi, et mollificatione.	About the method of cauterizing in paralysis and relaxation.
Caput X.	Chapter 10.
Oportet ut procedas in mundificatione capitis cum hyeeris, et cum eo quod diximus.	You should proceed with the cleansing of the head with hieries and with what we said.
Deinde rade caput infirmi: postea cauteriza ipsum cauterio in medio capitis, et cauterio super omne cornu capitis, et cauterio super posterius ipsius, et tribus super spondiles colli.	Then shave the head of the patient. Afterward, cauterize him with a cauterization in the middle of the head, and a cauterization above all the horn of the head, and a cauterization above the back of his neck, and three on the vertebrae of the neck.
Si autem indiges in aegritudine mollificatione corporis pluribus illis, et infirmus est tolerans, et aegritudo est fortis: tunc cauteriza ipsum quatuor cauteriis super spondiles dorsi, et ultima cum cauterio, donec comburatur ex cute plurimum eius, et eleua manum tuam.	But if you are in need of relaxation for the body, and he is weakly enduring it, and the disease is strong: then cauterize him with four cauterizations above the vertebrae of the back, and the last one with a cauterization, until most of his skin is burned away, and raise your hand.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: et sic cauterium Oliuare.	Then care for him until he is healed: and so anoint the cauterization with oil.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Epilepsia.	About the method of cauterizing in epilepsy.
Caput XI.	Chapter 11.
Non Cauterizatur epilepticus, nisi ille cuius epilepsia est ex phlegmate.	The epileptic is not cauterized unless it is the one whose epilepsy is due to phlegm.
Oportet ergo ut mundifices cerebrum eius in primis cum hyeris, et cum reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione: quando infirmus est magnus, aut est tolerans in accaeptione medicinarum.	It is therefore necessary that you cleanse his brain first with vinegar and along with the other treatment which we mentioned in the division; when he is very sick or is able to tolerate medicines.
Si autem est puer, qui non tolerat medicinas, tunc administratur gargarisma, et masticationes mundificantes cerebrum, ante illud diebus multis cum bonificatione ciborum.	But if it is a child who does not tolerate medicines, then a gargle and cleansing mouthwash for the brain are administered many days before with good food.
Deinde rade caput eius, postea cauteriza ipsum Cauterio uno in medio capitis, secundum quod praecessit in modo: et cauterio alio in occipitio eius, et super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio.	Then, quickly cut off his head. Afterwards, cauterize it with one cautery instrument in the middle of the head, just as it was done before; and another cautery instrument on the back of his head, and over all the horn of his own head.
Quod si infirmus fuerit fortis, et fuerit tolerans, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauteriis, quae dixi in habente paralisim, et mollificationem corporis super spondiles colli, et spondiles dorsi: et sit Cauterium oliuare secundum modum qui praecessit.	But if the sick person is strong and can tolerate it, then cauterize him with the cauteries that I mentioned in the case of paralysis, and soften his body over the vertebrae of the neck and back; and let the Cauterium be olive oil according to the method that preceded.
Si autem infirmus est puer, tunc pone cauterium subtile, secundum hunc modum.	But if it is a child who is sick, then place a subtle cautery according to this manner.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Melancholia.	Of the method of cauterizing in Melancholy.
Caput XII.	Chapter XII.
Quando caussa melancholiae sunt humiditates corruptae, et phlegma grossum, tunc cauteriza ipsum Cauteriis, quae diximus in habente paralisim.	When the cause of melancholy is corrupted humors and thick phlegm, then cauterize him with the cauteries that we mentioned in the case of paralysis.
Et si caussa melancholiae est superfluitas decliuis ad melancholiam, et est corpus infirmi humectum, tunc da ei in potu quod mundificet cerebrum eius, secundum quod praecessit in diuisione: deinde rade caput infirmi, et fac postea tortellam decenter factam ex lino, sicut circulum.	And if the cause of melancholy is excessive tendency towards melancholy and his body is weakly moistened, then give him to drink something that will cleanse his brain, according to what preceded in the division; afterwards, quickly cut off the head of the sick person, and make a ring later on well-made from linen, like a circle.
Deinde pone ipsam in medio capitis: et infirmus sedens quadratus teneatur ab omni parte.	Then place it in the middle of the head; and have the sick person sitting square and held back by all parts.
Deinde praesenta linimentum.	Then apply the poultice.
Et est dignius ex butyro ouium antiquo.	And it is more worthy from old sheep's tail butter.
Et calefac ipsum super ignem calefactione temperata mensura, quam toleret digitus, quando intromittitur in ipsum.	And warm him over a tempered fire by degrees, as much as his finger can tolerate when it is introduced into him.
Deinde euacua ipsum in medio capitis eius in circulo, et dimitte ipsum donec infrigidetur.	Then remove it from the middle of its head in a circle, and let it go until it cools down.
Fac illud infirmo omni hebdomada semel, cum reliquo regimine eius bono, donec sanetur.	Make him do that once every week with the rest of his good management, until he is healed.
Aut si uis, cauteriza ipsum faciendo puncta parua plurimum eius, praeter quod teneas manum cum cauterio: imo sit odorando.	Or if you prefer, cauterize him by making small holes in many places on him, except for keeping your hand with the cauterizer; indeed, with a pleasant smell.
Haec enim species cauterii humectat cerebrum cum qualitate.	For this kind of cauterization moistens the brain with its quality.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, aut adipe gallinae.	Then place a poultice soaked in butter or goose fat over it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in aqua descendente ad oculum.	On the method of cauterizing in descending water to the eye.
Caput XIII.	Chapter XIII.
Quando declaratur tibi principium aquae in oculo per signa, quae dixi in diuisione, tunc incipe et pota infirmum, cum eo quod mundificet caput eius.	When the beginning of water is revealed to you in the eye by signs which I said in the division, then begin and poultice the sick person, as long as it cleanses his head.
Et custodi ipsum ab omnibus humiditatibus, et fac eum sedere in balneo, in ieiunio diebus aliquot.	And guard him from all moistures, and make him sit in the bath on fasting days for a few days.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radat caput suum, et cauteriza ipsum in medio capitis sui.	Then command him to wash his head and cauterize himself in the middle of his head.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super duo timpora duobus cauteriis, si est incaeptio descensus aquae in duobus oculis simul: aut ex latere uno, si est incaeptio aquae in oculo uno: et abscinde cum cauterio omnes uenas et arterias quae sunt sub cute: et sint cauteria in ea longa in latitudine timporum: et caue a fluxu sanguinis.	Then cauterize him on both temples with two cauteries, if there is an obstruction of the descent of water in both eyes at once: or on one side, if there is an obstruction of water in one eye; and cut off with the cauterizer all veins and arteries that are under the skin; and let the cauteries be long in width across the temples; and beware of bleeding.
Quod si uides aliquid ex eo, tunc abscinde eum statim cum quacumque medicina est possibile: et ego ueniam cum sapientia, quae est in extractione arteriarum, et abscisione earum, et cautela a fluxu sanguinis.	What if you see something from it, then cut him immediately with any possible medicine; and I will come with wisdom, which is in the extraction of arteries, and their cutting off, and caution against bleeding.
Et quandoque cauterizatur in ceruice, sub duobus ossibus, duobus cauteriis ultime productis.	And sometimes it is cauterized on the neck, under two bones, with two cauteries produced lastly.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lachrymis antiquis.	On the method of cauterizing in Old Tears.
Caput XIIII.	Here is the translation:
Quando lachrymae oculorum sunt antiquae, assiduae: et sunt super uenas, et arterias quae sunt in manifesto capitis exterius, uerificatur quod illud est ex superfluitatibus frigidis, phlegmaticis: tunc cauteriza cauterio eodem quod narraui in incaeptione aquae descendentis, cauterio in medio capitis, et duobus cauteriis super duo timpora, et duobus cauteriis in ceruice sub duobus ossibus.	When the tears of the eyes are old and frequent: and they are above the veins, and arteries which are in plain sight on the outside of the head, it is verified that this is due to excesses of cold and phlegmatic things. Then cauterize with the same cauterization I narrated for the beginning of water flowing down, at the top of the head, and two cauterizations above each temple, and two cauterizations on the neck below each bone.
Et si indiges additione, tunc cauteriza ipsum in omni latere caute oculi, super extremitatem supercilii cum cauterio paruo.	And if you need an addition, then cauterize it on every side of the eye cautiously, above the eyebrow tip with a small cauterization.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in foetore Nasi.	Of the manner of cauterizing in the foulness of the Nose.

Quando tu medicaris illud, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert medicatio: tunc propera, et da in potu infirmocochias tribus noctibus: deinde rade caput eius, et cauteriza ipsum cauterio medio, cum cauterio oliuari.	When you are treating this, with what we said in the division, and the medicine does not agree: then hasten, and give it to drink infirm-coochies three nights: afterwards gently press his head, and cauterize it with a medium cauterization, with an olive cauterization.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio clauili duobus cauteriis, super duo supercilia sub capillis parum.	Then cauterize it with a cauterization of the hinge, two cauterizations, above both eyebrows under the hair a little.
Et custodite ab arteria, ne incidas eam.	And guard against the artery, lest you cut it.
Et haec est forma cauterii Clauilis.	And this is the form of the hinge cauterization.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in mollificatione Palpebrae.	Of the manner of cauterizing in the softening of the Eyelid.
Caput XVI.	Chapter 16.
Quando mollificatur Palpebra oculi ab aegritudine, aut humiditate: tunc cauteriza Palpebram cauterio uno, cum hoc cauterio lunari.	When the eyelid of the eye is softened by disease or humidity: then cauterize the eyelid with one cauterization, with this lunar cauterization.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum supra duo supercilia parum duobus cauteriis in omni parte: et elongentur a duobus timporibus: et sit longitudo omnis cauterii, secundum longitudines supercilii: et non ultimes manum tuam cum cauterio, imo secundum quantitatem quod aduritur tertia palpebrae.	And if you wish, cauterize it above both eyebrows a little with two cauterizations in every part; and be distant from the two temples: and let the length of all the cauterization be according to the lengths of the eyebrow: and do not end your hand with the cauterizer, but rather according to the quantity that is burned by the third eyelid.
Et haec est forma cauterii secundum hunc modum cauterii lunaris.	And this is the form of a cauterizer according to this lunar cauterization method.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Palpebram cum pili inuersantur pungentes oculum.	About the manner of cauterizing the eyelid when hairs turned inward pierce the eye.
Caput XVII.	Chapter 17.
Cauterium in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum igne: aut cauterium cum medicina comburente.	The cautery is done in two ways: either with fire, or with burning medicine.
In cauterio autem cum igne, praecipe infirmo ante illud, ut dimittat pilos suos, si est ex illis qui mundant eos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	However, in the cautery with fire, instruct the patient beforehand to remove his hairs, if he is one of those who plucks them, until they are lengthened and strengthened.
Si autem pungunt eum apud ortum suum: tunc constringe oculos eius cum uitta, ut non moueantur, donec nascantur.	But if they prick him at the root of his hair, then bind his eyes with a bandage, so that they may not be disturbed until new ones grow.
Cum ergo nascuntur et aequantur, tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo: deinde signa super Palpebram oculorum eius cum encaustro, signo quod sit secundum figuram folii myrti: et sit principium signi prope pilos.	When they have grown and become equal, then place the patient's head on your shoulder: afterwards mark above his eyelid with encaustic, making a sign that is like the shape of a myrtle leaf, and let the beginning of the sign be near the hairs.
Deinde pone cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum.	Then place the soaked poultice on white of egg: or on eyeball with psyllium mucus.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then a cauterization by fire, whose form is this.
Deinde cauteriza super figuram, quam signasti paulatim in uicibus multis, donec comburatur superficies cutis, quae est sicut figura folii myrti, totam apparentem proprie.	Then cauterize on the figure you marked gradually in many places, until the surface of the skin that is like the shape of a myrtle leaf appears fully and properly.
Et signum sanitatis operis tui est: ut si uideas Palpebram oculi iam contrahi, et pilos eleuari apud puncturam oculi.	And the sign of the success of your work is: if you see that the eyelid has already begun to contract and the hairs are lifted at the point of the eye.
Eleua ergo manum tuam tunc: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	So then lift up your hand, and let him go after three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur eschara.	Then place a poultice with butter on him until the scab is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for him with an ointment, until he is healed.
Quod si redeat aliquod ex pilis post horam, et mollificetur palpebra: tunc itera Cauterium super illum locum, sicut fecisti in primis.	And if some of the hairs return after an hour and the eyelid becomes soft: then repeat the cauterization on that same spot, just as you did at first.
Si autem pili sunt in inferiori: tunc cauteriza ipsam, donec eleuetur ad locum suum naturalem: et aequetur ut non pungant pili oculum.	If however hairs are on the lower part: then cauterize it, until it is elevated to its natural place: and it will be equal so that the hairs do not prick the eye.
¶ De modo cauterizandi cum medicina comburente in eodem casu.	On the manner of cauterizing with burning medicine in the same case.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter 18.
Est ut praecipias infirmo, ut dimittat pilos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	It is fitting to hasten the weak one, so that they may let go of their hair until it has grown out and become equal.
Fac ex charta de panno formam folii myrti.	Make a shape like a leaf from myrtle on cloth from linen.
Deinde accipe ex sapone cognito, et ex calce non imbibita ex unoquoque pondus uncia I aut quasi illud: deinde tere ea simul contritione bona, et fac illud cum festinatione, ut non infrigidetur.	Then take from known soap and from unimbibed lime one ounce or nearly that each separately. Then grind those simultaneously with good rubbing and make it quickly so that it does not grow cold.
Deinde ex pande ex eo super chartam quam fecisti sicut formam folii myrti, et pone ipsum super palpebram oculi unius, aut duorum.	Then spread it over the cloth which you made in the shape of a leaf from myrtle, and place it on the eyelid of one eye, or two.
Et pone sub oculo cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: et caput infirmi sit in sinu tuo.	And put it under the eye covered with egg white: and the head of the weak one be in your bosom.
Et pone digitum tuum indicem super medicinam, et preme ipsum parumper.	And place your index finger on the medicine and press it slightly.
Et tu moueas ipsum quotiens sentit infirmus mordicationem medicinae: quoniam inuenit eius mordicatio sicut ignis.	And you move it whenever the weak one feels the biting of the medicine, for his biting is like fire.
Dum ergo perseuerat hoc quod ipse inuenit mordicatio, tunc dimitte medicinam, et moue ipsam cum digito tuo.	While therefore he persists in this that he has found the biting, then let go of the medicine and move it with your finger.
Cum ergo quiescit mordicatio, tunc remoue medicinam, et ablue oculum cum aqua.	When therefore the biting ceases, then remove the medicine and wash the eye with water.
Et considera tunc, si uides palpebram eleuari, sicut eleuatur apud contractionem cum igne, aut cum incisione, est bene: et si non, tunc itera super ipsam ex medicina super locum, in quo non imprimit medicina, et non denigrat, donec aequetur operatio tua, et contrahatur oculus.	And consider then, if you see the eyelid elevate like it is elevated in contraction with fire or incision, it is well: and if not, then repeat over it from the medicine on the spot where the medicine does not imprint and does not grow worse, until your operation is equalized and the eye is contracted.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur cutis adustionis.	Then place butter over it, until the burned skin is eradicated.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento diaphinicon, aut alio, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with a balm of diaphanousness, or another, until it heals.
Et necesse est tibi apud operationem, ut custodias ultima custodia, ne in oculum cadat aliquid ex medicina.	And it is necessary for you to keep guard during the operation, so that nothing from the medicine falls into the eye.
Quod si mollificatur palpebra post dies, et pugnat ex capillis aliquid in oculo, tunc itera medicinam super illum locum, qui mollificatur ex palpebra proprie, sicut fecisti in primis.	What if the eyelid becomes soft after a day and something from the hair gets into the eye, then apply medicine to that spot which becomes soft from the eyelid itself, just as you did at first.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals.
Et haec est forma folii myrti.	And this is the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Et scias, quod oculi hominum diuersificantur in magnitudine, et paruitate.	And know that human eyes differ in size and smallness.
Ergo secundum illud sit consideratio tua: et non occultatur uia rectitudinis illi, cui est studium de hac arte.	Therefore your consideration should be according to this: and the way of rectitude is not hidden from him who has a study in this art.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Fistula lachrymali.	About the method of cauterizing in the tear duct.
Caput XIX.	Chapter XIX.
Quando curas Fistulam, cum eo quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc, oportet ut cauterizes ipsam secundum hunc modum.	When you cure the tear duct as we said in the divisions of illnesses, and your treatment does not take effect: then it is necessary for you to cauterize it according to this method.
Praecipe infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo, et teneat caput eius minister inter manus suas taliter, ut non moueatur, neque agitetur cum capite suo.	Order the patient to put his head in your lap, and have a servant hold his head between your hands in such a way that it does not move or be moved with his head.
Deinde pone Cotum infusum in albugine oui, aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum eius: deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then place the medicated poultice on the white of the eye, or on the psyllium mucus over his eye: then apply the cauterizing fire, which has this shape.
Sit concauum, sicut forma cannae pennae uulturis ab extremitate una, cum qua fit Cauterium: et si uis sit penetrans usque ad extremitatem aliam, et si uis sit sursum sic tenta.	Let it be concave, like the shape of a vulture's feather at one end, with which the cauterizing is done: and if you wish, make it penetrating up to the other end, and if you wish, test it upwards.
Verumtamen hoc concauum est melius ad opus tuum.	However this concavity is better for your purpose.
Deinde exprime fistulam, si est aperta, et extrahe ex ea saniem, et exicca ipsam: et si non est aperta, tunc aperi eam, et extrahe pus eius.	Then express the fistula, if it is open, and remove from it its discharge, and dry it out; and if it is not open, then open it and extract its pus.
Deinde pone tunc super eam Cauterium, quod fit ignitum ualde.	Then place the cautery on it, which becomes very hot.
Et tene cum eo manum tuam parumper apud Cauterium ab oculo, ad partem nasi, ut non erret manus tua, aut inquietetur infirmus: et ponas Cauterium in adipe oculi, et corrumpas ipsum.	And hold your hand near the cautery with your eye on it, by the nose, so that your hand does not wander or disturb the patient; and place the cautery on the fat of the eye and corrupt it.
Si ergo peruenis in principio Cauterii tui usque ad os, erit bene.	If you then reach from the beginning of your cautery to the mouth, it will be well.
Et si non: tunc itera Cauterium semel, aut bis, si indiges illo: et dimitte illud tribus diebus.	And if not: then reiterate the cautery once or twice, as needed; and let that be for three days.
Deinde pone Cotum cum butyro, et cura ipsum cum unguento exiccatiuo, donec sanetur.	Then place a poultice with butter, and care for it with an ointment of the drying kind, until it heals.
Quod si praeterierint ei quadraginta dies, et non sanatur: tunc pone super ipsum medicinam acutam corrosiuam, donec detegatur os: et rade ipsum secundum quod uenit in capitulo suo.	And if forty days pass and it does not heal: then place a sharp, corrosive medicine on top of it, until the mouth is exposed; and scrape it off as it comes in its own chapter.
Et est modus alius Cauterii fistulae, quem quidam primi dixerunt.	And there is another method for a cautery abscess, which some of the first ones said.
Intende ad locum fistulae, et finde ipsum: deinde pone in ipsam fissuram camahan subtile, id est, Cannulam subtilem, cuius forma haec est.	Direct yourself to the location of the abscess, and find it; then place into that same opening a thin camel's hair, that is, a thin cannula, which has this form.
Et funde in ipsum quantitatem drachmae ex plumbo liquefacto, et tene manum tuam cum Canna retentione bona, et non moueatur infirmus omnino, ut non currat, uel perueniat plumbum liquefactum ad oculum eius.	And pour into it a quantity of a drachma's worth of liquid lead; and hold your hand with the cannula retention good, so that the patient does not move at all, nor run or bring the liquid lead to his eye.
Et oportet ut ponas super oculum infirmi cotum infusum in albumine oui, aut in aqua.	And it is necessary that you place on top of the patient's eye a poultice infused in egg white or water.
Plumbum enim comburit locum fistulae, et sanat ipsam sanatione mirabili.	For lead burns the location of the abscess and cures it with a miraculous healing.
Quod si sanatur fistula, cum eo quod diximus ex Cauterio, et curatione, est bonum.	And if the abscess is healed, as we said from the cautery, and with the cure, it is good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est administrare foramen nasi, et reducere fistulam ad cursum nasi, secundum quod ueniet in loco suo sibi proprio.	And if not, then it is necessary to administer the nostril, and reduce the abscess to its natural course through the nose, as it will come into its own proper place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fissuris Labiorum.	Here is the translation:
Caput XX.	Here's the translation:
Multotiens accidunt in Labio fissurae, quae nominantur Pili, et praecipue in labiis puerorum.	Many times occurrences happen on the lip fractures which are called Pili, and especially on the lips of boys.
Cum ergo tu curas has fissuras, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio, tunc igni cauterium paruum cultellare, secundum hanc formam.	When therefore you treat the fractures with fire cautery, as we have said in the division of diseases, and the cure does not conduce, then make a small incision with a small knife, according to this form.
Et sit concauitas eius secundum subtilitatem cultelli.	And let the depth be according to the fineness of the knife.
Deinde pone ipsum ignitum festinanter in ipsis fissuris, donec perueniat cauterium ad profundum fissurarum.	Then place the hot instrument hastily into the fractures themselves, until the cautery reaches the depth of the fractures.
Deinde cura ipsum cum caeroto, donec sanetur.	Then cure it with cerate, until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fistula Oris.	On the manner of cauterizing in a mouth ulcer.
Caput XXI.	Chapter 21.
Quando accidit apostema in radice gingiuae, aut in palato, aut in radicibus dentium: deinde facit pus, et rumpitur: postea antiquatur, et currit pus, et fit fistula: deinde curas ipsam, et non confert in ea curatio, tunc oportet ut ignias cauterium secundum quantitatem, quod capiat in fistula.	When an abscess occurs at the root of a tooth or on the palate or at the roots of the teeth: then it makes pus and bursts open: afterwards it suppurates and runs and forms a fistula: then you should treat the fistula, and if the cure does not conduce in it, then you must use fire cauterization according to its size, as much as it will fit into the fistula.
Deinde intromitte ipsum ignitum in foramine fistulae, et tene manum tuam, donec perueniat ferrum ignitum ad profundum eius, et ultimum eius: fac illud semel, aut duabus uicibus.	Then insert the hot instrument into the opening of the fistula and hold your hand, until the burning iron reaches to the depth of it and its end: do that once or twice.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud, cum eo quod diximus de curatione usquequo curetur.	Then treat it afterwards with what we said about treatment until it is cured.
Si ergo abscinditur sanies, et sanatur, erit bonum.	If the pus therefore is lanced and healed, it will be good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est detegere locum, et auferre os corrupum secundum quod ueniet in capite suo.	And if not, then it is necessary to uncover the place and remove the corrupt bone according to what will come to its head.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Gingiuis, et Dentibus mollificatis.	On the manner of cauterizing in Gums and softened Teeth.
Caput XXII.	Chapter 22.
Quando mollificatur gingiua propter humiditates, et mouentur dentes, et curas eam cum medicinis, et non confert: tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	When the gum becomes softened due to humidity and the teeth move and you treat it with medicines, but it does not conduce: then place the head of the patient on your shoulder.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma ueniet post haec, ita ut ponas Cannulam super dentem: et intromitte in ea Cauterium ignitum festinanter: et tene manum tuam parumper, donec sentiat infirmus calorem ignis iam peruenisse ad radicem dentis.	Then apply the burning cautery, which will come after this, so that you place a cannula over the tooth: and insert into it the lit cauterary quickly: and hold your hand for a little while, until the patient feels the heat of the fire has already reached the root of the tooth.
Et eleua manum tuam: deinde itera Cauterium aliquotiens, secundum quod uis.	And lift up your hand: then repeat the cauterization a few times, as you wish.
Deinde impleat infirmus os suum aqua salis, et teneat ipsam hora una: et exspuat ipsam.	Then have the patient fill their mouth with salt water and hold it for one hour: and spit it out.
Dens enim motus firmatur, et gingiua mollificata stringitur, et siccatur humiditas corrupta.	For the tooth is strengthened by motion, and the softened gum is tightened and dried, and the corrupted moisture dries up.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Dentium.	Chapter on the manner of cauterizing teeth in pain.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter 23.
Quando dolor dentis est propter frigiditatem, aut in ipso est frigus, aut uermis, et non confert curatio cum medicinis: tunc Cauterium in ipso est secundum duos modos: aut Cauterium cum butyro: aut cauterium cum igne.	When the toothache is due to coldness, or there is a worm, and treatment does not bring relief with medicines: then the cautery is done in this way, according to two methods: either with butter, or with fire.
Cauterium autem eius cum butyro est, ut accipias butyrum uaccinum, et bullias ipsum in cochleari ferreo, aut in uenera.	The cautery of this sort with butter is, that you take whey butter and boil it in an iron kettle or a cauldron.
Deinde accipe cotum, et inuolue ipsum super extremitatem tentae.	Then take a cloth, and wrap it around the end of the tented area.
Deinde submerge ipsum in butyro bullito: et pone ipsum super dentem dolorosum festinanter, et tene ipsum donec infrigidet: deinde itera ipsum aliquotiens, donec perueniat uirtus ignis ad radicem dentis.	Then submerge the cloth in the boiling butter: and place it quickly over the painful tooth: and hold it until it cools: then repeat it a few times, until the power of fire reaches the root of the tooth.
Et si uis, submerge lanam, aut cotum in butyro frigido, et pone ipsum super dentem dolentem: et pone super ipsum ferrum ignitum, donec perueniat ignis ad profundum concauitatis dentis.	And if you wish, submerge a wool cloth or a piece of cloth in cold butter, and place it over the painful tooth: and place a hot iron on top of it, until the fire reaches the depth of the cavity of the tooth.
Cauterizatio autem eius cum igne est, ut intendas ad cannulam aeris, aut cannulam ferri.	The cautery with fire is, that you attend to a metal or air cannula.
Et sit in corpore eius quiddam grossitudinis, ut non perueniat acuitas ignis ad os infirmi.	And let there be some thickness in the body of it, so that the sharpness of the fire does not reach the mouth of the patient.
Deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma ueniet: et pone ipsum super illum dentem: et tene manum tuam, donec infrigidetur Cauterium.	Then take the cautery, which will have this shape; and place it on that tooth; and hold your hand until the cautery becomes cool.
Fac illud aliquotiens, nam dolor remouebitur, aut in illo eodem die, aut die alio.	Do that several times, for pain is removed, either on the same day or on another day.
Et oportet in impressione illius Cauterii, ut impleat infirmus os suum buyro bono, et teneat ipsum hora una: deinde exspuat ipsum.	And it is necessary when the impression of that cautery is made, for the sick person to fill his mouth with good butter and hold it for one hour; then he should spit it out.
Et haec est forma Cauterii.	And this is the shape of the cautery.
Cauteriza cum quacumque extremitate uis secundum quod est possibile: et haec est forma Cannulae.	Cauterize with any instrument you can get, as much as possible; and this is the shape of the cannula.

Caput XXIIII.	Chapter 28.
Quando Strophulae sunt a phlegmate, et ab humiditatibus frigidis, et non sunt obedientes digestioni per mecicinas, et uis digestionem earum uelociter: tunc igni Cauterium concauum, cuius forma est haec.	When strophules are caused by phlegm and cold moisture, and do not obey the natural process of digestion through medicines, and you want to hasten their digestion: then take a hollow cautery fire, which has this shape.
Habens duas extremitates apertas, ut egrediatur fumus apud Cauterium ab extremitate altera: et pone ipsum ignitum super ipsum apostema semel, et secundo, si indiges illo, donec perueniat ad profundum apostematis.	Having two open ends, so that the smoke may come out at the cautery from one end; and place it lit on that swelling once, and again if you need to, until it reaches the depth of the swelling.
Quod si apostema est paruum: tunc pone Cauterium secundum quantitatem apostematis.	What if the swelling is small: then place the cautery according to the size of the swelling.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super ipsum cotum infusum in butyro, donec remoueatur quod combussit ignis.	Then leave it for three days, and place on top of it a poultice infused in butter, until what the fire burned is removed.

When humors overwhelm the trachea of the lungs, and especially when it is accompanied by a cold complexion, then it is necessary for the sick person to evacuate first with dissolvent medicines.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum in nocrati apud radicem gutturis in loce depresso: et caue, ne peruenias cum Cauterio ad guttur, neque in cute, nisi quiddam eius.	Then cauterize it at the back of the neck near the root of the throat in a depressed place; and beware, lest you reach the throat or skin with the cautery, except for a little bit of it.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cauterio alio apud iuncturam colli in ultimo spondili eius ultimando: et sit Cauterium clauile secundum modum, qui praecessit.	Then cauterize it with another cautery at the junction of the neck at the last vertebra of that same part; and let the cautery be locked in place according to the method that came before.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with what came before until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in aegritudinibus Pulmonis, et Tussi.	On the method of cauterizing for afflictions of the Lungs and Cough.
Caput XXVI.	Head 26.
Quando Tussis et aegritudo Pulmonis sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, et infirmus non habet febrem, neque phthisim, et aegritudo antiqua: tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis supra furculam in locis depressis, lenibus, uacuis.	When Cough and affliction of the Lungs are caused by cold humidities, and the patient does not have fever or phthisis, nor an old affliction: then cauterize it with two cauterizers above the armpit in depressed, smooth, empty places.
Et cauterio alio in medio pectoris inter duas mammillas: et sit cauterium cannulae secundum formam quae praecessit.	And cauterize with another one in the middle of the chest between two breasts; and let the cautery be shaped like what came before.
Et si uis sit cauterizatio tua punctando cum cauterio, quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma praecessit in punctatione doloris aurium: et sint puncta ex triginta punctis usque quasi ad alia.	And if you wish, your cautery should be done by piercing with a cautery called the Punctum, whose form has been described for piercing pain of the ears; and let the points be from thirty points almost to another.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with what came before until it is healed.
Et iam sit cauterium habens tres ramos: secundum hanc formam.	And now let the cautery be one having three branches: according to this shape.
Quare alleuiatur cum eo cauterizatio, quando tu facis cum eo uice una tria Cauteria.	Why is it alleviated with that when you do it with him in a single vice of three cauterizers.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Titillico, in dislocatione Humeri.	On the method of cauterizing for Titillics, in dislocation of the Shoulder.
Caput XXVII.	Head 27.
Quando dislocatur caput adiutorii caussa humiditatum, et nonfigitur in hora reditus sui a dislocatione sua, donec sit illud ei consuetudo reditionis, deinde dislocatur a paruo motu, qui accidit sicut nos iam testificauimus illud, tunc oportet ut reducas dislocationem in primis.	When the head of the assistant is dislocated due to humidities and does not fit into its hour of return from its dislocation until it has become accustomed to returning, then afterwards it is dislocated by a small motion which happens like what we have already testified about; then it is necessary that you reduce the dislocation first.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, aut super latus sanum.	Then let the patient be placed upon his back, or upon a healthy side.
Deinde eleua cutim, quae est in interiori Titillici ad superiora cum digitis manus tuae sinistrae: et si iunctura dislocatur ad interiora.	Then lift the skin which is inside the navel to the upper parts with your left hand fingers. And if the joint becomes dislocated inwardly.
Deinde igni Cauterium habens duo uerua.	Then having a cauterizer with two bristles.
Cuius forma est haec.	Whose form is this.
Deinde cauteriza cutim, donec penetret eam usque ad latus aliud, et ueniet figura cauterizationis cum quatuor cauteriis.	Then cauterize the skin until it penetrates to the other side and comes out with a figure of cauterization with four cauteries.
Et quandoque fit cauterizatio cum cauterio habente tria uerua, quare fit figura cauterizationis tunc sex cauteriorum: et sunt uerua secundum subtilitatem tentae.	And sometimes a cauterization is done with a cauterizer having three bristles, and then the figure of cauterization comes out with six cauteries; and the bristles are according to the subtlety of the thread.
Et haec est forma cauterii habentis tria uerua.	And this is the form of a cauterizer having three bristles.
Et quandoque additur super hunc modum unum, quare sunt cauteria octo.	And sometimes one more is added to this method, and there are then eight cauteries.
Deinde pone super cauterium porros contritos cum sale.	Then place crushed cloves with salt on top of the cauterizer.
Deinde fac adhaerere infirmum tranquillitati, ut non moueatur membrum tempore aliquo, donec confortetur.	Then make the patient remain still in tranquility, so that no part is moved at any time, until they are comforted.
Et si dislocatio est ad superiora, et raro fit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super humerum cauterio clauili, aut cauteriis multis punctando.	And if the dislocation is above, and this rarely happens, then cauterize it on the shoulder with a nail-shaped cauterizer, or with many punctures by multiple cauteries.
Nam iunctura firmatur, et remouetur humiditas: et sanatur infirmus.	For the joint is strengthened, and humidity is removed; and the patient is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Stomachum.	Chapter on the method of cauterizing the Stomach.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter 28.
Quando accidunt in Stomacho frigus et humiditates multae, donec extrahant ipsum a complexione sua, et multiplicentur catarri ad ipsum, et assiduas modos curationis, et non confert: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat crura sua, et manus suas.	When coldness and moistures many occur in the Stomach, until they expel the patient from his own body, and multiply catarrhs to him, and insist on constant methods of cure, but do not help: then it is necessary for the patient to be placed upon his back, and to stretch out his legs and arms.
Deinde cauteriza cum tribus cauteriis, cauterio sub cochleari pectoris quantitate digiti unius cum cauterio clauili, et duobus cauteriis inferius a duobus lateribus cauterii unius, donec ueniat figura cauteriorum triangulata.	Then cauterize with three bristles, using a cauterizer shaped like the undercurve of the pectoral bone, as long as one finger, and having a nail-shaped cauterizer; and two bristles below from the two sides of one cauterizer, until the figure of the cauteries becomes triangular.
Et elonga inter utraque ut non coniungantur, quando facient pus.	And stretch between each one so that they may not join together when they make pus.
Et sit profunditas cauterii quantitas duarum tertiarum grossitudinis cutis.	And let the depth of the cautery be the quantity of two thirds of the thickness of the skin.
Et sit figura cauteriorum secundum hanc formam sine additione: et si uis cauteriza cauterio magno in medio stomachi secundum hanc formam: et sit cauterium quo fit hoc cauterium unum secundum figuram circuli secundum hanc formam.	And let the shape of the cauteries be according to this figure without addition: and if you wish to cauterize, cauterize with a great cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this figure: and let the cautery which makes this cautery be one according to the shape of a circle according to this figure.
Et cauterizatur stomachus punctando ei qui terretur ab hoc cauterio: et est, ut signes super stomachum punctum secundum quantitatem, quam uis cum encaustro: deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio puncti: deinde cura ipsum cum curatione, quae praecessit donec sanetur.	And the stomach is cauterized by piercing it with a needle which is frightened by this cautery: and it is, as signs are made above the stomach at the point according to the quantity you wish with an encaustic: then cauterize it with the puncture cautery: then care for it with the cure that preceded until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Epar frigidum.	About the manner of cauterizing a cold liver.
Caput XXIX.	Book XXIX.
Quando accidit in Epate dolor ex frigiditate et humiditate, aut ex uentositate grossa, donec egrediatur a complexione sua naturali egressione superflua, et curatur infirmus, cum eo quod diximus, et non proficit in illo: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam, et signes cum encaustro tria cauteria secundum hanc figuram, et hanc quantitatem eandem super Epar inferius ab hypocundriis, ubi peruenit cubitus hominis: et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium secundum grossitudinem digiti: et sit cauterium secundum longitudinem corporis rectum: et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio multum.	When it happens that the liver hurts from cold and moisture, or from a thick flatulence, until it discharges its natural excess through excessive excretion, and the patient is cured with what we have said, but does not benefit in that: then it is necessary to have the patient lift up his head onto his neck, and mark three cauteries with an encaustic according to this figure, and of the same quantity on the liver below the navel, where the man's elbow reaches: and let there be a space between each cautery according to the thickness of a finger: and let the cautery be straight according to the length of the body: and do not press your hand with the cautery too much.
Et sit quantitas eius quod aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, quantitas medietatis eius non additum: et sit infirmus stans super pedes suos.	And let the quantity of what is burned be the thickness of the skin, the middle part not added to: and let the patient stand on his feet.
Si autem non est stans, tunc sit iacens, qui iam extendit crura sua, et eleuauit brachia sua.	If however he is not standing, then let him be lying down, who has already extended his legs and lifted up his arms.
Haec est forma cauterii.	This is the form of a cautery.
Et tibi quidem possibile est, ut cauterizes ista cauteria cum cauterio cultellari, quando tecum est subtilitas et prudentia in arte.	And it is indeed possible for you to use this cautery with a surgical knife when you have subtlety and prudence in the art.
Et custodi te, ut non ultime procedas in cauterizatione, et aduratur spissitudo cutis totius, quare aduratur corpus totum, et perueniat ad intestina: quoniam cutis illic est subtilis, scias ergo illud.	And take care that you do not proceed too far in cauterization, and the thickness of the skin is burned all over, so that the body is entirely burned and reaches the intestines; for the skin is thin there, therefore know this.

Quando accidit exitura, et uis scire, si illud apostema est in carne Epatis, aut in tunica eius: tunc si est in carne Epatis, inuadit infirmum dolor, et grauitas absque acuitate: et si est in tunica Epatis, cum dolore est acuitas uehemens: et uides iam, quia fatigauit medicos eius curatio.	When it happens that an exitus occurs and you wish to know whether the apostema is in the flesh of the hip or in its membrane: then if it is in the flesh of the hip, a painful and severe illness attacks the patient without sharpness; and if it is in the membrane of the hip, with pain there is sharp distress: and you see now that his cure has exhausted the doctors.
Oportet ergo ut resupinet infirmus super ceruicem suam.	Therefore, the patient should lean back on his own neck.
Deinde figura locum apostematis cum encaustro: deinde ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	Then place the figure of the abscess with encaustic; then apply fire to the cautery, which is like a ray.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et cauteriza cum eo cauterium unum, donec comburatur cutis tota, et perueniat ad siphac, donec egrediatur sanies tota: deinde cura ipsum curatione exiturarum, donec sanetur.	And cauterize with this cautery one, until the skin is completely burned and reaches the siphac, until all the pus comes out; then cure him with the cure of abscesses, until he is healed.
Et non oportet ut hac cauterii specie utatur, nisi cuius studium in arte medicinae prolongatur: et per cuius manus concurrunt aegritudines istae cum experimento aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super huiusmodi operationem.	And it is not proper for someone to use this type of cautery unless they have prolonged study in the art of medicine, and through whose hands these illnesses converge with some experimentation: then indeed he may dare to perform such an operation.
At uero dimittere ipsam, apud me est melius.	But actually, it is better for me to let it go.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Pleuresi.	On the manner of cauterizing in pleurisy.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 31.
Dixerunt antiqui, cauterium cum radicibus aristolochiae ad Pleuresim frigidam secundum hunc modum.	The ancients have said that a cautery with the roots of Aristolochia should be used for cold pleurisy in this manner.
Et est, ut recipias ex radicibus aristolochiae siccae longae, radicem unam longiorem, quae ex ea inuenitur, et sit sicut grossitudo digiti.	And you should take from the dried roots of Aristolochia, one root that is longer than the others found in it, and let it be as thick as a finger.
Deinde submerge eam in oleo: et accende ipsam in igne.	Then immerse it in oil: and burn it over fire.
Deinde cauteriza cauterio uno in eo quod est inter continuationem furculae cum collo, et duobus cauteriis paruis sub guidezi parum decliuibus ad partem, quae est sub barba.	Then cauterize it with a cautery in the spot between the fork of the jawbone and the neck, and two small cauterizations slightly declined under the guide to the side that is below the beard.
Et duobus cauteriis etiam in eo, quod est inter costam quintam et sextam decliuibus ad posteriora parumper: et cauterio alio in medio pectoris, et alio supra stomachum.	And also two cauterizations in the spot between the fifth and sixth ribs slightly declined towards the back a little; and another cautery in the middle of the chest, and one above the stomach.
Et tribus cauteriis a posterioribus: uno in eo quod est inter duas spatulas: et duobus cauteriis a duobus lateribus pectoris, inferius cauterio quod est inter duas spatulas.	And three cauterizations from behind: one in the spot between two spatulas; and two cauterizations from the two sides of the chest, with the lower one being that which is between two spatulas.
Et non oportet ut comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit in manifesto cutis odorando.	And it's not necessary for you to press your hand onto the cautery, but rather let it be held out openly, smelling of the skin.
Et iam dixerunt quidam antiqui, quod ex hominibus sunt qui utuntur cauterio ex ferro simili radio: et igniunt, et intus mittunt ipsum in eo quod est inter costas, donec perueniatur cum eo ad ipsum apostema, et egrediatur sanies: sicut diximus in apostemate Epatis.	And some ancient people have said that there are certain individuals who use a cauterizing iron similar to a radiating rod; they burn and insert it inside the person in the spot between the ribs until it reaches the abscess, and pus will then flow out: just as we said in the case of Epatis.
Sed in hac perforatione cum cauterio est ex timore, quod aut moritur infirmus statim, aut accidit in loco fistula, cui non est sanatio.	But in this perforation with a cauterizing iron there is fear that the sick person will die immediately, or that an abscess will form in the place, which does not have a cure.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Splenem Caput XXXII.	Chapter 32: On the Method of Cauterizing the Spleen.
Quando tu curas aegritudinem splenis, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua, tunc cauterium in ea est secundum tres modos, qui omnes sunt recti.	When you treat the ailment of the spleen, according to what we said about treating ailments by division, and your treatment does not bring relief, then you should use a cauterizing iron in three ways, all of which are correct.
Quorum unus est, ut facias tria cauteria, aut quatuor lineando secundum longitudinem splenis secundum figuram cauteriorum Epatis, quorum praecessit figura.	One of which is to make three or four cauterizations, lining them up according to the length of the spleen, following the figure of the cauterizations described by Epatis, whose preceding figure precedes.
Et sit inter omne cauterium quantitas grossitudinis digiti, aut plus parum.	And let there be among all cauterizers the quantity of a finger's thickness, or a little more.
Et sit modus cauterii, quem diximus in cauterio epatis aequaliter.	And let the method of cauterizing be equal to what we have said for cauterizing the liver.
Et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio: et sit infirmus resupinus super dorsum suum.	And do not press your hand with the cauterizer, and let the patient be lying on his back weakly.
Et modus alius de cauterizatione est: ut ignias cauterium habens duo uerua, quod diximus in capitulo dislocationis humeri: et eleua cutem, quae est in directo splenis, ubi peruenit cubitus infirmi sinister: et sit eleuatio tua qua eleuas cutem secundum latitudinem corporis, ut cadant cauteria secundum longitudinem corporis.	And another method of cauterizing is this: take a cauterizer with two prongs, as we have said in the chapter on dislocation of the shoulder; and lift the skin which is on the direct splenic area, where the patient's left arm reaches; and let your elevation be according to the width of the body, so that the cauterizers fall along the length of the body.
Deinde intromitte duo uerua ignita ualde, donec cum eis penetres cutem a parte altera: deinde extrahe cauterium: fiunt ergo cauteria quatuor.	Then insert two burning prongs deeply, until they penetrate the skin from the other side; then withdraw the cauterizer; thus four cauterizers are made.
Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.	And if you wish to cauterize with a cauterizer that has three prongs.
Deinde cura cauterium postquam dimittis ipsum emittere pus diebus multis: est enim magis conferens quamque reliqua quae praecesserunt ex curatione.	Then care for the cauterized area after you have released it to discharge pus over many days; for it is more beneficial than the rest of what has preceded in terms of healing.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Hydropisi.	Of the method of cauterizing in Hydrophobia.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33.
Cauterium non cadit in Hydropisi, nisi ascliti proprie.	A cauterizer does not fall in hydrophobia, unless it is applied properly.
Quando tu curas Hydropicum cum modis curationis, quos diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, et cauterio uno super stomachum, et cauterio alio super epar, et cauterio super splenem, et cauteriis duobus post dorsum inter spondiles, et uno in directo pectoris, et alio in directo stomachi: et sit quantitas profunditatis cauterii propinqua spissitudini cutis.	When you treat a hydrophobic patient with the methods of treatment that we have said in the division, and the treatment does not take effect, then it is necessary to cauterize him four times around the navel, and one cauterizer above the stomach, and another above the liver, and one on the spleen, and two behind the back between the vertebrae, and one directly on the chest, and another directly on the stomach: and let the depth of the cauterization be close to the thickness of the skin.
Deinde dimitte cauterium apertum, ut emittat pus tempore longo.	Then release the cauterizer open so that it may discharge pus over a long period.
Et non euacues infirmum a curatione post cauterium cum eo: quod oportet ut aggregentur ei duae intentiones: et festinabit ad ipsum sanatio cum auxilio Dei.	And do not remove the patient from treatment after cauterization until with him, because it is necessary that two intentions congregate to him; and he will hasten towards his cure with God's assistance.
Forma uero cauterii cum quo cauterizatur uenter, sit clauilis: secundum quod praecessit forma eius: et illius cum quo cauterizatur dorsum, sit oliuaris secundum quod praecessit eius forma.	The shape of the cauterizer with which the belly is cauterized should be a key; according to its form preceding it. And that with which the back is cauterized, should be olive-shaped, according to its form preceding it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et Crura.	Of the manner of cauterizing Feet and Legs.
Caput XXXIIII.	Head 44.
Quando apostemantur in Hydropico, et replentur aqua citrina: oportet ut cauterizes super dorsum Pedis in nocrati, quae est inter auricularem et anularem: et eleua manum tuam cum cauterio, et non torqueas ipsum: deinde eleua manum tuam: et non iteres ipsum omnino.	When they apostemate in hydropico and are filled with citrine water: it is necessary that you cauterize on the dorsum of the foot at nocturnal, which is between auricular and annular; and lift up your hand with the cauterizer, and do not twist it: then lift up your hand again: and do not touch it entirely.
Resudet enim aqua citrina, et sit cauterium secundum hanc formam.	For the water citrine will ooze out, and let the cauterizer be according to this shape.
Deinde fac super duo crura duo cauteria in omni crure, et fiat cauterium cum extremitate cultellari cauterii: et fiat cauterium secundum longitudinem cruris, unum sub genu, et alterum inferius eo, circiter medium cruris: et super omnem coxam cauteria duo: et dimitte cauterium apertum absque curatione tempore longo: ut resudet ex eo aliquod aquae: deinde cura ipsum cum reliquis quae diximus.	Then make two cauterizers on each leg, one in every leg, and let the cauterizer be with the edge of a cutting cauterizer; and let it be according to the length of the leg, one under the knee, and another lower down by about the middle of the leg: and over all the hip make two cauterizers: and leave the cauterizer open without treatment for a long time, so that something may ooze out from it; then cure it with the others which we have said.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in solutione Ventris.	Of the manner of cauterizing in the dissolution of the Belly.
Caput XXXV.	Head 35.
Quando est solutio uentris ex frigore et humiditatibus, donec debilitet uirtutes retentiuam et digestiuam, quae sunt in stomacho et intestinis: et curatur illud cum modis curationis, et non sanatur: et uides infirmum tolerantem cauterium exuberantis uirtutis, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio magno super stomachum suum, secundum quod praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi cum cauterio circuli, et quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici subtilibus, cum cauterio clauili subtili: et cauterio super alcatin supra alhosos magno, aut duobus cauteriis.	When there is a dissolution of the belly due to cold and humidity, until the powers of retention and digestion, which are in the stomach and intestines, become weakened: and that thing is cured with modes of treatment, but is not healed; and you see the patient bearing cauterization with excessive vigor, then cauterize him with a great cauterizer over his stomach, according to what preceded in the cauterization of the stomach with the circular cauterizer, and four small cauterizers in the circumference of the navel, with a subtle key-shaped cauterizer: and a large cauterizer on the gallbladder above the gallstones.
Et si uides humiditates exuberantes, et infirmum tolerantem illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio super pectinem, et cauterio super omne ilium: et fortasse addes duo cauteria parua super stomachum prope magnum.	And if you see excessive moistures and the patient endures that, then cauterize him with a cauter on his chest and with another one on all of his hip: and perhaps add two small cauterizers near the navel.
Est enim curatio proficiens, cuius iuuamentum non errat.	For it is a successful treatment whose benefit does not fail.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Hemorroidas.	Chapter on the manner of cauterizing hemorrhoids.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter 36.
Quando in ano sunt Hemorroides antiquae multae, aut una, et sunt ex humoribus grossis, frigidis, aut humiditatibus corruptis, et curantur cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: tunc cauteriza tribus cauteriis super inferiorem spondilem dorsi sub almeidati parumper triangulatim, et cauterio sub umbilico quasi duobus digitis.	When there are old and many hemorrhoids in the anus, or one, which are formed from thick, cold, or corrupted humors, and they are treated as we said in our division, but do not yield to treatment: then cauterize with three cauterizers on the lower part of the back of the spine, a little triangularly shaped, and one under the navel, almost two fingers deep.
Et si cogitas, quod stomachus eius infrigidatus sit, et cibus eius non digeratur, et faciem eius uides apostemari, tunc cauteriza eum super stomachum cauterio magno, secundum quod praecessit: et cauterio super Epar eius, et alio super Splenem ipsius, cum cauterio clauili: et dimitte cauterium apertum tempore aliquo: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if you think that his stomach is chilled, and his food is not digested, and you see his face breaking out in acne, then cauterize him on the stomach with a large cauterizer, as before: and one on his liver, and another on his spleen, with a small cauterizer: and leave the open cauterizer for some time: afterwards take care of him until he is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi althelul post abscisionem eorum.	Chapter on the manner of cauterizing altchill after their resection.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter 37.
Quando tu abscindis althelul, tunc ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	When you excise the altchill, then take a cauterizer that is like a beam of fire.
Deinde intromittite ipsum ignitum in ipsum althelul abscisum: et ultima manum tuam, donec perueniat cauterium ad orificium uenae, ex qua currit sanguis: fac illud semel, aut bis.	Then insert the burning one into the excised altchill: and with your last hand, until the cauterizer reaches the opening of the vein from which blood flows: do that once or twice.
Si ergo althelul fuerint multa, tunc cauteriza unumquodque cauterio secundum quod narrauimus.	If therefore there are many altchill, then cauterize each one with a cauterizer as we have narrated.
Deinde cura ea, cum eo quod confert eis ex unguentis, donec sanentur.	Then take care of them by applying to them what is beneficial for them from ointments, until they are healed.
Et si cauterizas eum cauterio magno super alcatin, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if you cauterize him with a large cautery on alum, it is more beneficial for his recovery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Fistulam in ano.	On the manner of cauterizing an anal fistula.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter 38.
Quando non obedit infirmus sectioni et operi quod narrauimus in loco suo, et terretur ab illo, fortasse sanatur cum cauterio.	When an invalid does not submit to the cutting and operation as we described in its place, and is terrified by it, perhaps it will be cured with a cautery.
Cum ergo accidit alicui Fistula, et antiquatur, currit pus ex ea, et humiditates corruptae.	When therefore an abscess occurs to someone, and becomes old, pus runs out of it, and corrupted humors flow.
Dignius ergo quod oportet est, ut probes eam cum tenta subtili.	Therefore it is more noble as needed, that you probe it with a fine tent.
Deinde cognosce quantitatem profunditatis eius cum tenta.	Then know the quantity of its depth with a tent.
Deinde ignias cauterium, quod est simile radio.	Then apply hot coals or a cautery, which is similar to a red-hot iron.
Deinde intromit te ipsum ignitum in ipsam Fistulam et quantitatem in qua intrauit clauus.	Then insert yourself, ignited, into the abscess and as far as the plug has gone inside.
Et itera super eam cauterium, donec comburantur illa omnia corpora corrupta, semel, aut bis, aut ter, secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	And apply the cautery to her repeatedly, until all those corrupted bodily parts are burned away, once, or twice, or thrice, according to your own necessity.
Et custodi te ab adustione nerui, si est illic, aut uenae magnae: aut si Fistula uadit ad corpus uesicae, aut ad corpus intestini, tunc custodi te ab istis locis omnibus.	And guard yourself from burning the nerve, if it is there, or a great vein; or if the abscess goes to the bladder or intestine, then guard yourself from all those places.
Et non facias illud, nisi quando fistula est in loco carnoso: et cogitas, quia non est penetrans.	And do not do that unless the abscess is in a fleshy place; and consider, because it is not piercing.
Deinde cura locum usquequo sanetur.	Then care for the place until it heals.
Si autem sigillatur locus, et abscinduntur ab eo materiae, et remanet sic tempore longo: tunc scias, quia iam sanatus est integre.	But if the location is sealed and the materials are removed from it, and it remains thus for a long time; then you will know that it has already healed completely.
Et si non abscindunt ab eo materiae, tunc scias quia est penetrans, aut in profundo eius est os corruptum, aut quasi illud ex illis: quorum rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And if the materials are not removed from it, then you will know that it is piercing, or that there is a corrupted bone deep within it, or something similar: whose memory will come to its place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Renes.	On the manner of cauterizing the kidneys.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter 39.
Quando accidit in Renibus dolor ex frigore, aut ex uentositate grossa, et minuitur propter illud coius infirmi, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum super almethenem super ipsos renes, cauterio super omnem renem cum cauterio clauili, cuius praecessit rememoratio.	When it happens that in the kidneys there is pain from cold or from gross swelling, and this weakness decreases because of the patient's infirmity, then it is necessary to cauterize him above the flesh over the kidneys with a cautery on both kidneys with a clavicular cautery, whose preexistence has been remembered.
Et fortasse cauterizamus ipsum secundo in ipso almeidatu.	And perhaps we will cauterize him again in the same place at almeidatum.
Quare uenient tria lineata.	Therefore three lines are needed.
Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento.	So they will be more useful for soothing.
¶ De modo cauteritzandi Vesicam.	On the method of cauterizing the Bladder.
Caput XL.	Chapter 40.
Quando accidunt in Vesica debilitas, et mollificatio a frigo re et humiditatibus, donec non retineat infirmus urinam, tunc cauteriza ipsum in inferiori parte suminis super Vesicam, ubi incipiunt pili pectinis, et cauterio a dextra suminis, et alio a sinistra illius: et sit longitudo illius cauterizationis lateris secundum quantitatem nodi pollicis: et cauteriza ipsum cauterio inferiori dorsi, aut duobus cauteriis, si indiges illo: et sit secundum quod praecessit cauterium clauile.	When debility and softening occur in the Bladder due to cold and moisture, until the infirm person no longer retains urine, then cauterize him on the lower part of the back above the Bladder, where the pubic hair begins, with a cautery from the right side of the back and another from the left: and let the length of this cauterization be according to the size of the knuckle joint: and cauterize him with a lower dorsal cautery, or two cauteries if needed: and let it be as the clavicular cautery preceded.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Matricem.	On the method of cauterizing the Womb.
Caput XLI.	Chapter 41.
Quando accidunt in Matrice frigus et humiditates, et prohibetur per illud ab impregnatione, et corrumpuntur menstrua eius, et tardatur prouocatio eorum, et accidit ei apud aduentum eorum dolor, tunc oportet ut cauterizetur tribus cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, sicut diximus in cauterizatione uesicae, et cauterio super alcatim inferius dorso, aut duobus cauteriis: et sit cauterium clauile.	When cold and moisture occur in the Womb, and it is prevented from conception by that, and its menses are corrupted, and their production is delayed, and pain occurs to her at their coming, then it is necessary that she be cauterized with three cauteries around the navel, as we said in the cauterization of the Bladder, and a lower dorsal cautery, or two cauteries: and let it be as the clavicular cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Ancham in dislocatione.	On the method of cauterizing the Shoulder in Dislocation.
Caput XLII.	Chapter 42.
Quando effunduntur humiditates mucosae ad pixidem Anchae, et fiunt caussa exitus eius a loco suo: et signum illius est, quod prolongatur crus super alterum, quando comparantur adinuicem: et inuenitur locus dislocationis in eo uacuus.	When the mucus' moisture flows to the shoulder's joint, and becomes the cause of its departure from its place: and the sign of this is that the leg stretches over another when they are brought together; and a vacant space is found in the location of dislocation.
Oportet ergo ut cauterizes infirmum super pixidem Anchae ipsius cauterio simili circulo: postquam tu signas cum encaustro in circumitu pixidis, sicut reuoluitur: et ut cadat ipsa pixis in medio circuli.	Therefore it is necessary that you cauterize the ailing part over the wax on the anchor of its own cauterio similar to a circle: after you mark with encaustic around the wax, as it rolls off; and so the wax falls in the middle of the circle.
Et sit cauterium cuius forma praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi.	And let the cauter be like one that has preceded in cauterizing the stomach.
Quod si tibi non est praesens hoc cauterium, tunc cauteriza ipsum tribus cauteriis, cum cauterio oliuari magno: et fiat cauterio profunditas secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis totius.	But if you do not have this cauter at hand, then cauterize it with three cauterizers, using a large olive oil cauterizer; and make the depth of the cauterization according to the thickness of the skin in its entirety.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Sciatica.	About the way of cauterizing in Sciatica.
Caput XLIII.	Chapter 43.
Quando accidit dolor in pixide anchae, et sunt caussa illius frigus et humiditates: et curatur infirmus cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, et antiquatur illud: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum ab humoribus grossis cum pillulis foetidis, aut cum pillulis artificialibus, et similibus.	When the pain occurs in the wax on the anchor and it is caused by cold and moisture; and the patient is treated with that which we said in the division, and the cure does not take effect, and it becomes old: then it is necessary to loosen the patient from gross humors with stinking pills, or with artificial pills, and similar things.
Deinde cauteriza eum.	Then cauterize him.
Et modus cauterii in ea est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, aut cauterium cum igne.	And the method of the cauterization in that is according to two modes: either a cauter with burning medicines or a cauter with fire.
Cauterium cum igne, est secundum multos modos.	The cauter with fire is according to many modes.
Quorum unus est, ut cauterizes super pixidem anchae ipsius tribus cauteriis triangulatis, secundum hanc formam.	One of which is that you cauterize over the wax on the anchor's own three triangular cauterizers, according to this shape.
Et fac eis profunditatem bonam, uel malam.	And make their depth good or bad.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium quantitatis grossitudinis digiti: sitque cauterium oliuare.	And let the space that is between all the cauterizers be as much as the thickness of a finger; and let the cauterizer be olive-like.
Quandoque autem fit cauterium in medio super caput anchae ipsius.	Sometimes however, the cauterization is made in the middle over the head of its own anchor.
Quare sunt quatuor cauteria.	Therefore there are four cauterizers.
Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.	And if you wish to cauterize with a circle, whose form has preceded in the cauterization of an anchor's displacement, one by one; so that the circle contains the entire anchor.
Et combure spissitudinem cutis totius.	And burn the thickness of the skin entirely.
Iste est modus cauterii in Sciatica, quando dolor est adhaerens anchae ipsi, et non extenditur usque ad coxam et crus.	This is the method of cauterizing in sciatica, when the pain adheres to the anchor itself and does not extend as far as the hip and leg.
Si autem extenditur usque ad coxam et crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis super coxam, super locum ad quem innuit illic infirmus, in quo est dolor, et cauterio tuo super cauillam quatuor digitis ad partem syluestrem parumper: et sit cauterium cultellare.	But if it extends as far as the hip and leg, then you should cauterize that part with two cauterizations on the hip, over the place where the patient feels pain, and your own cauterization on the hollow four fingers to the left a little bit: and let the cauter be a knife-like one.
Et sit profunditas cauterii secundum profunditatem spissitudinis cutis.	And let the depth of the cauterization be according to the thickness of the skin.
Quod si infirmus innuit quod dolor extenditur usque prope digitos pedis, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic ubi innuit cum cauterio puncti, tribus, aut quatuor, aut pluribus, si indiget illo.	But if the patient says that the pain extends as far as the toes of the foot, then you should cauterize there where he indicates with a small point, three or four or more times, if necessary.
Et si innuit dolorem esse sub genu uersus crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic cauterio uno cultellari.	And if the patient says that the pain is beneath the knee towards the leg, then you should cauterize there with one knife-like cauterization.
Et caue tibi in omni cauterizatione tua, ut non ultimes cum cauterio ad hoc ut comburas neruum, aut arteriam magnam, et attrahas per illud super infirmum nocumentum malum, aut contractionem.	And beware of yourself in every cauterization of yours, lest you should not be careful and burn the nerve or a great artery, and bring harm or contraction upon the patient through that.
Et ego quidem iam uidi unum et alium, ex eis qui cauterizauerunt supra cauillam, et ultimauerunt in cauterizatione, et inflatum est crus, donec tumor consecutus est pedem, et perforatus est totus, et corruptus est totus pes: deinde accidit solutio uentris, et mors post illud.	And I myself have indeed seen one and another of those who cauterized above the hollow, and left off in the cauterization, and the leg has been swollen until a tumor has followed the foot, and it has been pierced through and the whole foot has been corrupted: then afterwards there occurred dissolution of the bowels, and death after that.
Quod si dolor est in duabus partibus simul, cauteriza utramque secundum hunc modum.	But if the pain is in both parts at once, cauterize both in this way.
Et sapientes quidam dixerunt in cauterizatione anchae, cuius cauterii iste est modus.	And certain wise people have said that in the cauterization of the anchor, this is the method.
Fac simile samio ex ferro, cuius diametrus sit medietas palmi: et sit apud orificium suum secundum grossitudinem nuclei dactyli, aut minus parumper: et intra illud samium sit samium tertium.	Make a similar one from iron, the diameter of which is half a palm: and let it be at its opening according to the thickness of the knuckle of a finger, or slightly less: and inside that iron let there be another iron.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne samium per quantitatem nodi pollicis: et sint samia aperta a duabus partibus: et sit altitudo eorum quasi nodus, aut duo nodi: et fac eis manubrium ex ferro decenter aptatum in samiis.	And let there be space which is between all the bones by the quantity of the knuckle's joint: and let the bones be open from two sides: and let their height be as a knot, or two knots: and make for them a handle of iron, decently adapted to the bones.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its shape.
Deinde igniatur in igne, donec rubeat, et proiiciat scintillas: deinde ponatur super pixidem anchae infirmo accubitato super latus sanum.	Then burn it in the fire until it reddens and sends sparks: then place it on the anchor over an invalid's bed set up against a healthy side.
Cauteriza ergo eum tribus cauteriis rotundis in uice una.	Therefore, cauterize him with three rounded cauters in one direction.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then let it be for three days.
Postea emplastra cum butyro: et dimitte uulnus apertum diebus multis.	Afterwards, apply ointments with butter: and let the wound remain open for many days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for him with an ointment until he is healed.
Inquit Albucasis, hac specie cauterii o filii, parum usi sumus, propter terrorem aspectus eius: et propterea, quod paucos inuenimus qui expectent super ipsum.	Albucasis says that this kind of cauterization is rarely used by sons, on account of the fear of its appearance: and therefore, because we find few who will wait upon it.
Verumtamen est ex bonis cauteriis ei qui suffert, et inuenit cum eo locum eius.	However, it is one of the good cauterizations for him who suffers, and finds a place with it.
Cauterium autem cum medicinis adurentibus est, ut tu facias duo samia habentia perforatam armillam, in quam descendit cardo portae eius ex aere, aut ferro, longitudo parietis: quorum in altitudinem eorum sint duo nodi, aut quasi ipsi.	However, the cauterium with burning medicines is, that you make two bones having a perforated armband, into which the hinge of its door descends from air or iron, long enough to reach the height of them, whose in their height are two knots, or as if they themselves were.
Et sit spacium quod est inter utraque quantitas grossitudinis digiti, et sint aperta inferius et superius: et sit quod contineant se adinuicem, secundum hanc formam.	And let there be space which is between each one by the quantity of the thickness of a finger, and let them be open below and above: and let what contains them together, according to this shape.
Deinde depone eam super pixidem anchae, infirmo iacente super latus sanum.	Then place it on the anchor over an invalid's bed set up against a healthy side.
Et comprime manum tuam super pixidem anchae multum.	And press your hand firmly onto the anchor over an invalid's bed very much.
Deinde funde inter duos circulos ex aqua calida, quae sit calefacta cum igne parumper, et tene eam quantitate horae temporalis: et toleret infirmus mordicationem eius, et ipsius adustionem, nam ipse inuenit mordicationem sicut ignis, donec quiescat mordicatio.	Then pour between the two circles of hot water that has been warmed with fire for a little while, and hold it for as long as an hour: and let the invalid endure its burning and charring, for he will find the burning to be like fire, until the burning subsides.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento, et absterge aquam calidam ab ancha tota cum aqua dulci: deinde dimitte illud tribus diebus.	Then elevate your hand with the instrument, and wash away hot water from all around with sweet water; then let it be for three days.
Et pone super illud butyrum, donec remoueatur nigredo adustionis: et dimitte illud diebus aliquot, et curret ex eo pus.	And put honey on top of it, until the blackening of burning goes away; and let it be for several days, and an abscess will develop from it.
Est enim ultimum in iuuamento.	For this is the last resort in healing.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointments until it heals.
Quod si extendatur dolor usque ad coxam, aut crus: fac ei statuam in eo quod continet aquam, secundum quod fecisti in ancha aequaliter.	But if the pain extends to the hip or leg, make a poultice on it as contains water, just as you did on the anus evenly.
Et iste est modus aquae calidae: et ego iam scripsi eam in tractatu rectificationis medicinarum.	And this is the method of hot water; and I have already written it in the treatise on the correction of medicines.
Sume alcali, et calcis non extinctae amborum ana partem unam: tere utraque, et pone ea in ollam nouam, cuius inferior pars sit perforata foramine uno paruo, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum radius: et pone sub fundo ollae ollam aliam uitreatam: et proiice super alcali et calcem ex aqua dulci, quod submergat utraque per digitum: post quam tu comprimas ea manu tua compressione bona: et dimite ollam, donec descendat aqua acuta inferiori parte ollae uitreatae.	Take alkali and unextinguished lime, each one-fourth part of a whole: grind both together and put them in a new jug, the lower part of which is perforated with a small hole, according to the size that the radius will go into; and put another jug filled with vinegar beneath the bottom of the first jug; and pour the alkali and lime over it with sweet water, so that both are submerged by about an inch: after which you press them down with your hand using good pressure; and leave the jug until the sharp water has flowed down to the lower part of the vinegar-filled jug.
Deinde aggrega illam aquam totam, et proiice eam super aliam calcem: et cola, donec renouetur.	Then collect all that water and pour it over the other lime; and let it sit until it is renewed.
Ipsa enim erit tunc fortis acuitatis ualde, quae administratur in multis operationibus medicinae, et in cauterizatione reliquorum membrorum.	For it will then be very strong and sharp, which is administered in many operations of medicine, and in cauterizing other limbs.
Quoniam efficit operationem ignis ipsius.	Because it causes the operation of fire itself.
Et ex medicinis sunt, cum quibus cauterizantur ancha, etiam sicut tesisie, et mel anacardi, et calx cum sapone, ita quod utraque sint permixta. ¶	And from medicines are those with which the anus is cauterized, also like tissoe, and honey of the anacardium tree, and lime with soap, so that both are mixed together.
Et Galenus quidem narrando retulit, cuiusdam uiri ex antiquis curationem, qua curatus est dolor anchae et uenae sciaticae: et magnificauit esse eius ualde.	And Galen indeed reported, telling the story of some man from ancient times who was cured through treatment for the pain in his anus and sciatic vein: and he greatly praised its effectiveness.
Et dixit, quia non indiguit alia curatione, et quia sanatus est ex uice una, donec retulit, quia ipse fortasse intrauit balneum delatus, et exiuit ex eo iam sanus.	And he said that the patient did not need another treatment and that he was cured from one application, until he returned, because himself perhaps had gone into the bath carried away and came out already cured.
Et est, ut accipiatur ex seitaragi uiridi: et si non inuenitur uiride, sumatur siccum, recens: et teratur multum cum aliquanto adipe, et ponatur super ancham, ubi est dolor, aut crus, aut in coxa: et ligetur, et dimittatur quantitate trium horarum, aut per quantitatem quod sentiat infirmus sedationem adustionis.	And it should be taken from the green soapwort: and if not found green, a new dry one is to be taken, and it is to be pounded much with some fat, and placed on the part where there is pain, or knee, or in the hip: and it is to be bound and left for three hours, or for as long as the patient feels relief from burning.
Deinde intromitte eum in balneum.	Then introduce him into a bath.
Cum ergo roridum fit corpus eius, intromitte ipsum in solium.	When his body becomes sweaty, introduce him to the sun.
Nam dolor recedit, et sanatur.	For the pain subsides and he is healed.
Et scias, quia non oportet ut utatur aliquis cauterio cum istis medicinis, nisi post euacuationem corporis.	And know that it is not right for someone to use a cauterizer with these medicines, unless after the body has been purged.
Et Dioscorides qui dem dixit, quod stercus caprarum, quando cum eo cauterizatur uena sciatica, confert ei: et fit cauterium secundum hunc modum.	And Dioscorides who said that goat dung, when it is used to cauterize the sciatic vein with him, brings relief to him: and a cauterization is done in this manner.
Sumatur lana, et imbibatur oleo antiquo, et ponatur super locum profundum, qui est inter pollicem pedis, et inter focile, et est propinquior focili.	Take wool and soak it in old oil, and place it on the deep spot which is between the big toe and the ankle bone, and is closer to the ankle.
Deinde accipe stercus caprarum siccum, et inflamma ipsum in igne, donec fiat carbo.	Then take dry goat dung and burn it in fire until it becomes charcoal.
Deinde pone ipsum super lanam, et dimitte ipsum, donec extinguatur.	Then place the charcoal on the wool and leave it until it is extinguished.
Deinde itera illud.	Then repeat that.
Non cesses ergo facere illud, usquequo perueniat sensus super mediatione usque ad ancham, et quiescat dolor.	Do not cease to do this until the sensation reaches as far as the hip and the pain subsides.
Et iste modus cauterii nominatur cauterium Vaccinum.	And this method of cauterization is called the "Vaccinium" cauterization.
¶ De cauterizatione doloris Dorsi.	Of the Cauterization of the Back Pain.
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter 44.
Quandoque accidit dolor in Dorso ex caussis multis, aut a casu, aut a percussione, aut euacuatione superflua, et illis similibus, ex infusione materiei frigidae, et humidae: et cauterium quidem non cadit, nisi in hac specie sola, quae fit ex infusione materiei frigidae.	Sometimes it happens that pain occurs on the back due to many causes, or by chance, or through a blow, or excessive evacuation, and similar things, through the infusion of cold and moist matter: and indeed cauterization does not fall, unless in this single species which is made from the infusion of cold matter.
Oportet ergo post euacuationem infirmi cum pillulis foetidis, et eis similibus, ut fiant super Dorsum, ubi est dolor, tres lineae secundum latitudinem almeidati ipsius, postquam signas cum encaustro in omni linea quinque cauteria, aut plura secundum quantitatem quae uenit ex tolerantia infirmi uirtute eius: et fiat cauterizatio cum cauteriopuncti.	Therefore, after the patient's evacuation with fetid pills and similar ones, to make them on the back where there is pain, three lines according to the measure of the afflicted one's body, after which signs are marked with encaustic in each line five or more cauterizations, depending on the quantity that comes from the patient's endurance by virtue of his/her strength: and let the cauterization be done with a cauteriopuncti.
Et si uis, cauteriza tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor, cum cauterio clauili mediali, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, cauterize three times or four with a middle clavicle cauterizer, in this way.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in incaeptine Gibbositatis.	About the method of cauterizing in cases of Gibbons' swelling.
Caput XLV.	Chapter 45.
Multotiens accidit haec aegritudo infantibus paruis.	This affliction often occurs in small infants.
Et signum incaeptionis eius in pueris est: quod accidit super eum strictura in anhelitu apud eleuationem, et motum: et inuenis in ultima spondilium Dorsi et nodorum eius, quod iam incaepit eminere super reliquos spondiles.	And the sign of its inception is this in children: that it happens to him a constriction in breathing at elevation, and movement; and one finds in the last vertebrae of the back and its knots, which already begins to protrude above the other vertebrae.
Cum ergo uides illud, et uis facere illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio quod sit circulus secundum hanc formam.	When therefore you see that and wish to do that, then cauterize it with a cauterizer that is a circle in this shape.
Et capiat cauterium super omnem partem spondilis aequaliter: et si uis cauteriza in circumitu spondilis cum cauterio puncti duas lineas, aut tres: et sint puncta propinqua adinuicem.	And take the cauterizer over all parts of the vertebra equally: and if you wish, cauterize on the circumference of the vertebra with a pointed cauterizer two lines or three: and let them be close to each other.
Deinde cura locum, donec sanetur cum eo quod diximus.	Then take care of the place until it is healed as we said.
Et caue, ne administres cauterium in gibbositate, quae fit in spasmo nerui.	And beware, lest you administer a cauterization on a gibbosity that occurs in muscle spasm.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Podagra, et doloribus iuncturarum.	About the method of cauterizing in Gout and pains in joints.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter 46.
Quando dolores iuncturarum sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, quae effunduntur ad cuiuslibet membra corporis, tunc quando accidunt dolores in pedibus, de consuetudine medicorum est, ut nominent illud Podagram proprie.	When pains occur in joints due to cold humidities that flow into any part of the body, then when they happen in feet, according to the custom of physicians, it is proper to call that Gout.
Cum ergo curatur Podagra frigidae caussae cum modis curationis, et non remouentur dolores, tune cauterium remouet eos.	When, therefore, podagra is cured by cold causes with modes of cure and pains are not removed, then the cautery removes them.
Et est, ut cauterizes eum post euacuationem in circumitu iuncturae pedum, cauteriis multis: et sit cauterium Oliuare.	And it is necessary to cauterize him after evacuation at the joint of the foot, with many cauteries; and let the cauter be olive-based.
Cuius haec est forma.	This is its form.
Et si indiges ut punctes super faciem pedis, tunc fac cum cauterio puncti.	And if you need to make small holes on the surface of the foot, then do so with a cauter.
Quod si ascendunt dolores usque ad genua, aut reliquas iuncturas, et multotiens accidit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super omne genu tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor ab omni parte, cum hoc eodem cauterio Clauili.	What if the pains ascend to the knees or other joints, and this often happens, then cauterize him on all of his knee with three or four cauteries from every part, using the same olive-based cauter.
Si autem necessaria sunt tibi plura hoc cauterio, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	But if you need more of this cauter, then cauterize him again.
Et non submergas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit circiter spissitudinem cutis tantum.	And do not immerse your hand with the cauter, rather let it be around the thickness of skin only.
Si autem ascendunt dolores ad genua, et dorsum: tunc administra quod diximus ex cauterio in capitulo suo.	But if the pains ascend to the knees and back: then administer what we said in its chapter.
Quod si dolores sunt in manibus tantum, tunc puncta in circumitu focilium, sicut reuoluuntur duae lineae.	What if the pains are only in the hands: then make holes around the knuckles, as two lines turn back.
Si autem remanet ex doloribus in digitis, tunc puncta eos, super omnem nodum punctum, et super pectinem manus.	But if there remains pain in the fingers: then make holes in them, above every knuckle and on the palm of the hand.
Si autem ascendunt dolores post dies ad cubitos, aut ad humeros, tunc cauteriza utrosque ab omni parte.	But if the pains ascend after a day to the hips or shoulders: then cauterize both sides from every part.
Et non euacues infirmum ex regimine bono, ex recaeptione medicinarum.	And do not evacuate the patient from good treatment, or from receiving medicines.
Nam si bonum fiat regimen, et euacuetur phlegma, sanabitur auxilio Dei cum isto cauterio.	For if a good regimen is observed, and the phlegm is evacuated, it will be healed with the help of God through this cauter.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Rupturis.	Of the manner of cauterizing in Ruptures.
Caput XLVII.	Chapter 47.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, et descendit intestinum, aut zirbum ad testiculum, et est illud incipiens propinquum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo dimittere comestionem in die suo.	When a rupture occurs in the groin and the intestine descends or the vermiform appendix comes close to the testicle, and it begins to be proximate: then it is necessary that you hasten to have the patient give up eating on his own day.
Et utatur ex lenientibus, quo descendat stercus a uentre suo.	And he will make use of mild things, whereby dung descends from his belly.
Deinde sedeat inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et praecipe ei, ut teneat anhelitum suum, donec egrediatur, uel appareat zirbum, aut intestinum.	Then sit him between your hands on his back: and tell him to hold his breath until it comes out, or appears as a stool, or intestine.
Deinde reduc ipsum digitis tuis, et signa cum encaustro sub Ruptura super os pectinis, cum signo cuius extremitas sit similis medietati circuli ad superiora corporis.	Then lead him with your fingers and mark with an enema under the rupture above the pubic bone, marking where the end is like the middle of a circle to the upper part of the body.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma, donec ueniat album, et proiiciat seintillas.	Then apply a caustic fire whose shape is this, until white pus comes out and casts off scabs.
Deinde reduc intestinum, aut zirbum ad concauitatem suam.	Then lead the intestine or stool back to his concavity.
Deinde ponat minister manum suam super locum, ut non exeat intestinum: et tu iam aperuisti inter crura infirmi, et posuisti sub eo puluinar, et seruiens alius super crura eius, et alius super pectus eius qui tenet manus.	Then have the servant place his hand on the spot so that the intestine does not come out: and you already opened up between the legs of the infirm person, and placed a poultice beneath him, and another servant is standing above his legs, and another above his chest which holds hands.
Deinde depone cauterium super ipsum signum, manu tua cum cauterio stante recta.	Then place the caustic on top of it with your hand holding the caustic steady upright.
Et tene ipsum, donec cum eo consequaris os: aut itera cum eo uice alia, si non consecutus fueris cum eo in prima usque ad os.	And hold him until you reach his mouth: or proceed with him otherwise, if you are not successful with him up to the mouth.
Et prudenter obserua ab exitu intestini in hora cauterizationis tuae, ne comburas ipsum, et eueniat per illud super infirmum aut mors, aut malicia magna.	And prudently observe from the exit of the intestine during your cauterizing hour, lest you burn him and something bad happens to the infirm person, or death, or great evil.
Et scias, quod quando tu non consequeris cum cauterio os, non confert operatio tua.	And know that when you do not succeed in reaching his mouth with the caustic, your operation is of no use.
Et oportet ut sit cauterium infantium subtile, secundum mensuram eorum.	And it should be a caustic for children, subtle according to their measure.
Deinde cura cum reliquis unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then take care with the other ointments until he is healed.
Et sit infirmus iacens super dorsum suum quadraginta diebus, donec sigilletur uulnus.	And let the infirm person lie on his back for forty days, until the wound is sealed.
Et oportet, ut ponas nutrimentum eius longitudine temporis curationis eius, quod leniat uentrem eius: ut non exeat intestinum apud conamen et egestionem.	And it is necessary to place his nourishment in proportion to the length of time needed for his cure, which will soothe his belly: so that his intestine does not come out during digestion and evacuation.
Deinde quando uult surgere post quadraginta dies, tunc administra ligamentum decenter factum, et teneat ipsum quadraginta diebus aliis.	Then when he wants to operate after forty days, then administer a well-made ligament and hold it for forty other days.
Et minoretur a labore, et repletione cibi et potus, et uocibus uehementibus.	And let him be relieved of labor, and from eating and drinking, and from loud voices.
Nam quando utitur hoc regimine, ita sanatur sanatione integra.	For when he uses this regimen, he is restored to a complete recovery.
Et ego dicam curationem Rupturarum cum incisione in capitulo suo.	And I will speak about the cure of ruptures with an incision in its chapter.
Quando autem Rupturae accidunt in reliquo uentre, et sunt incipientes, et uis ut non addantur, tunc cauteriza Rupturam eius cauterio rotundo secundum quantitatem eius: et sit illud quod aduritur ex tunc sicut tertia eius.	When, however, ruptures occur in the remaining part of the abdomen and are beginning to form, and it is necessary that they not increase, then cauterize the rupture with a rounded caustic according to its size: and let what is burned be as its third part.
Deinde cura ipsum, cum eo quod diximus: et non addetur.	Then treat it as we have said, and it will not increase further.
Et iam dixerunt quidam primi: ut cauterizetur Ruptura cum cauterio triangulato, secundum hanc formam.	And certain people have said that the rupture should be cauterized with a triangular caustic, according to this shape.
Postquam signatur cum encaustro, et ponitur linea quae est per latitudinem in latere superiori Rupturae, et linea altera ad inferius.	After it has been marked with encaustum, and a line is placed which is for the breadth on the upper side of the rupture, and another line below.
Et depone manum tuam in medio cum cauterio clauili.	And place your hand in the middle with a small caustic.
Sed cauterium primum est facilius et melius.	But the first caustic is easier and better.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in doloribus propter casum, aut percussionem.	On the method of cauterizing in cases of pain due to fall or percussion.
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter 48.
Quando accidit in quibusdam membris a casu, aut percussione dolor: et perseuerat ille dolor tempore longo, et non confert in eo curatio cum medicinis: tunc oportet ut cauterizetur cum cauterio Puncti.	When it happens to certain members due to a fall or percussion and there is pain, and that pain persists for a long time, and treatment with medicines does not help: then it is necessary that it be cauterized with the puncture caustic.
Et sit cauterium omnis membri cauterium secundum magnitudinem eius, et ipsius paruitatem, et debilitatem eius, et ipsius uirtutem, et locationem torsionis, et doloris ex eo.	And let the caustic be a puncture caustic for every member according to its size, and its weakness, and its debility, and its strength, and the twisting motion, and the pain that comes from it.
Si ergo sanatur ex cauterio primo, est bene.	If then he is healed by the first caustic, it is good.
Si non: tunc itera super ipsum cauterium.	If not: then apply a cautery over it.
Quoniam de consuetudine horum dolorum est, ut permutentur ex membro ad illud quod appropinquat ei.	Since it is customary for pains of this kind to be transferred from one member to another which approaches it.
Quare oportet ut consequaris eos cum cauterio, donec sanetur infirmus.	Wherefore you should follow them with a cautery until the patient recovers.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lepra.	About the method of cauterizing leprosy.
Caput XLIX.	Chapter 49.
Leprosi autem quandoque iuuantur cauterio iuuamento maximo.	But some lepers are greatly benefited by a cautery.
Et praecipue species Leprae, quae fit propter putrefactionem phlegmatis et melancholiae: cum ergo uis cauterizare ipsam considera.	And especially the kind of leprosy that occurs due to the putrefaction of phlegm and black bile; therefore, when you wish to cauterize it, take heed.
Si ergo Lepra est ineipiciens, et curasti eam cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non descendit, neque stat: et times super infirmum, quod comprehendat corruptio super totam complexionem eius: tunc cauteriza eum super caput quinque cauteriis: uno in medio capitis noto, et secundo inferius eo uersus frontem apud finem capillorum, et duobus super duo cornua, et uno posterius super nucea ceruicis.	If therefore the leprosy is ineipiciens and you have treated it as we said in its division, and it does not descend or stay: and you are afraid for the patient, because corruption may affect his entire complexion; then cauterize him over the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the head, marked, and a second lower down towards the forehead at the end of the hair, and two above each horn, and one behind on the nape of the neck.
Et ultima manum tuam cum cauterio parumper, donec imprimat in os impressionem paruam, et dislocentur ex eo cortices: ut alleuietur expiratio uaporum grossorum ex eo, et cauteriza cauterio etiam super ipsum splenem, secundum quod praecessit.	And with the last of your fingers and the cautery a little while, until it leaves on his mouth a small impression, and the membranes are dislocated from him: so that the expulsion of gross vapors may be alleviated from him, and cauterize also over the spleen with the same cautery, according to what has preceded.
Sin autem Lepra iam sparsa est super infirmum, et apparet manifeste: tunc oportet ut cauterizes cum istis cauteriis, quae diximus in capite, et cauterio super extremitatem nasi, et duobus cauteriis super duas maxillas, et duobus cauteriis super spondiles colli, et sex super spondiles dorsi, et uno magno super alhahosos apud gran caudae et uno supra ipsum, in ipso almeidati: et duobus super anchas: scilicet super omnem ancham uno, et duobus super genua: uno super omne genu, et duobus super humeros, et duobus super cubitos, et duobus super teneritudines pectoris sui: et cauteriza ipsum super omnem iuncturam, ex iuncturis digitorum manuum suarum, et pedum suorum: et cauteriza super omnem calcaneum pedum suorum, et focilia manuum suarum.	But if the leprosy has already spread over the patient and is manifestly apparent: then it is necessary that you cauterize with those cauteries which we said in the chapter, and also with a cautery over the tip of the nose, and two over both cheekbones, and two over the vertebrae of the neck, and six over the vertebrae of the back, and one large over the heels at the end of the tailbone, and one above it, in the same almeidat: and two over the armpits: namely, one over every armpit, and two over both knees, and two over both shoulders, and two over both elbows, and two over the tendernesses of his own breast: and cauterize him over every joint, from the joints of his own fingers, hands, and feet: and cauterize also over every heel of his own feet, and underarm regions of his hands.
Et caue tibi a neruis qui sunt super postremum calcanei, ut non comburas eos.	And beware of the nerves that are above the last bone of the heel, lest you burn them.
Et quandoque cauterizatur cauterio super os pectinis, et alio super os stomachi, et alio super epar.	And sometimes it is cauterized with a cautery over the bone of the hip, and another over the bone of the stomach, and another over the liver.
Et scias, quod quanto plus addis cauterium, est magis iuuamentum, et magis conferens.	And know that as much as you add to the cautery, it is more beneficial and more effective.
Et scias, quod infirmus non inuenit in cauterio dolorem, sicut inueniunt ipsum sani: propterea, quod corpus eius iam stupefactum est.	And know that the weak do not find pain in cauterization, as the healthy do: therefore, because his body is already numbed.
Et oportet ut sint cauteria ex magnitudine, et paruitate secundum membra et iuncturas: secundum quod praecessit ex speciebus ferramentorum.	And it should be that the cauteries are of great size and smallness according to members and joints: according to which they preceded from the types of instruments.
Deinde cura cauterium ex farina herbi cum melle, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then cure the cautery with flour of herb mixed with honey, and the rest of the treatment, until he is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Stupore.	On the manner of cauterizing in a stupor.
Caput L.	Chapter 35.
Quando stupet aliquod membrum, et curatur cum medicinis, et oleis, et emplastris, et non sanatur, tunc cauteriza ipsum membrum stupefactum cauteriis, secundum quod meretur magnitudo membri, aut paruitas eius.	When some member is stuporized and is treated with medicines, oils, and plasters, and it does not heal, then cauterize that stuporous member with cauteries, according to the magnitude of the member or its smallness.
Et sit cauterium tuum intrans in spissitudinem cutis parumper.	And let your cautery be inserted into the thickness of the skin for a moment.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then cure it with ointment, until it is healed.
Et quandoque cauterizatur ad quiddam stuporis, qui accidit manui, et pedi, in spondilibus dorsi apud exitum neruorum, qui mouent illud membrum: et remouetur stupor.	And sometimes it is cauterized for some kind of numbness that occurs in the hand and foot at the joints of the back near the outlet of the nerves which move that member: and the numbness is removed.
Verum non praesumat super illud, nisi qui est sapiens in anatomia membrorum, et egressione neruorum mouentium corpus.	But do not presume to do so unless one is wise in the anatomy of members and the exit of nerves that move the body.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Albaras.	On the manner of cauterizing in ulcers.
Caput LI.	Chapter 51.
Quando antiquatur Albaras, et non confert in eo aliquid ex ingeniis medicinae: tunc cauteriza super ipsam cauterio profundo parumper, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis, donec remoueatur albedo, et mutetur color eius.	When an ulcer becomes old and nothing from the powers of medicine is applied to it: then cauterize over it with a deep cautery for a moment, according to the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness is removed and its color changes.
Deinde cura ipsum cum farina herbi, et lentis cum oleo rosa, et foliis arnoglossae, et sanguine columbae, et sanguine hyrundinis: de unoquoque sit pars una: misceantur haec omnia, et liniantur super pannum, et adhaereant loco, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it with barley flour and lentils mixed with rose oil, and leaves of arnoglossa, and dove's blood, and swallow's blood: each one should be a single part; mix all these together, and apply them to the cloth, and let them adhere to the place until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Cancro.	On the manner of cauterizing in Cancer.
Caput LII.	Chapter 52.
Quando Cancer est incipiens, et uis ipsum sistere: tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio circuli in circuitu eius, sicuti reuoluitur.	When Cancer begins and you wish to stop it: then cauterize it with a circular cautery around its circumference, as it rotates.
Sapientes autem dixerunt, ut cauterizetur cauterio ultimo in medio.	However, wise men have said that the last cauterization should be made in the middle.
Mihi autem non uidetur illud: quoniam timeo quod ulceretur: et ego iam uidi illud aliquotiens.	But to me it does not seem so, for I fear that it may cause ulcers; and I have already seen this happen on several occasions.
Et rectius est, ut cauterizetur in circumitu eius cum circulo, sicut diximus: aut cauteriis multis.	And it is better to cauterize around its circumference with a circle, as we said, or by multiple cauteries.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Adubelati.	On the manner of cauterizing in Adubenalti.
Caput LIII.	Chapter 53.
Quando aliquis habet Adubelati, et tardatur in maturatione, aut propter superfluitatem facientem eam, aut propter aetatem infirmi, quando est decrepitus pauci sanguinis, aut propter tempus, et uis festinare in maturatione Adubelati, tunc cauteriza in circumitu eius cum cauteriis paruis multis punctando.	When someone has Adubenalti and it is delayed in its maturity, either due to excessive bleeding or due to the age of the weak person, when he is decrepit with little blood, or due to time, and you wish to hasten the maturation of Adubenalti, then cauterize around its circumference with small multiple punctures.
Deinde dimitte eam.	Then leave it alone.
Nam ipsa festinabit cum maturatione.	For she will hasten with maturity itself.
Si autem uis perforationem eius cum cauterio, tunc igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma.	But if you wish to puncture it with a cautery, then set fire to the cautery, of which this is the shape.
Et depone ipsum in medio Adubelati, donec penetret cutem: et sit cauterium ab eo quod sequitur infirmus, ut alleuietur cursus puris.	And place it in the middle of Adubenalti, until it penetrates the skin; and let the cautery be from that which follows the weak one, so that the flow of pus may be alleviated.
Deinde cura ipsum donec sanetur.	Then take care of it until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in malo corrodente.	On the manner of cauterizing in a corrupting sore.
Caput LIIII.	Here is the translation:
Corrodens non est nisi corruptio in membro ambulans, et corrodit ipsum: sicut ignis comedit ligna sicca.	Corroding is not except corruption in a walking limb and it corrupts it; like fire consumes dry wood.
Si ergo uides corrodentem in loco qui toleret cauterium cum igne, tunc igni cauteria multa, clauilia parua et magna, secundum quod conueniet illi loco in quo est corrodens.	If then you see the corroder in a place that bears a caustic with fire, then many cauteries, small and great, fit according to the place where the corroder is.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum ab omni parte donec eradices corruptionem totam, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid penitus.	Then cauterize it entirely from all parts until you eradicate the entire corruption, and nothing remains of it at all.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio.	Then leave it for three days, and put powdered sulfur with oil on the cauterized areas, until all scabs are removed and all corruption is eradicated.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis generantibus carnem.	Then care for it with ointments producing flesh.
Si ergo uides, quod post tres dies caro nascitur natiuitate sana, in qua non est corruptio, est bonum.	If then you see that after three days healthy new flesh is born, in which there is no corruption, it is good.
Et si non: tunc itera cauterium super illud quod remansit ex locis corruptis.	And if not: then repeat the caustic on what remains of the corrupted areas.
Et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.	And the corroder is cured sometimes with sharp medicine.
Ipsa namque surgit loco cauterii.	Itself rises in the place of the caustic.
Verumtamen cauterium cum igne est uelocioris iuuamenti: et ego quidem iam dixi cauterizationem eius cum medicina acuta in diuisione: accipe ergo eam illic quando ea indiges.	However, the caustic with fire is more effective for quick relief; and I myself have already said that it should be done with sharp medicine in division: so take it there when you need it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Clauis, et Verucis.	Paragraph about the manner of cauterizing in Claws and Warts.
Caput LV.	Chapter 55.
Multotiens accidit in inferioribus partibus pedum haec aegritudo: et est res grossa, filtrata, quae laedit pedem.	This affliction often occurs in the lower parts of the feet: and it is a rough, filtered thing that injures the foot.
Et cauterium quidem in eis est secundum duos modos: cauterium cum igne, et cauterium cum aqua calida.	And the caustic indeed is used in them in two ways: a caustic with fire, and a caustic with hot water.
Quantum autem cum igne est, ut ignias cauterium concauum simile pennae uulturis: quod fiat ex ferro, secundum quantitatem quod contineat clauum ab omni parte: et sit subtilium marginum.	However, when it is done with fire, let the ignias cauterium be hollow and concave, like a vulture's feather, made of iron, according to the size that contains a claw from all sides: and have a thin rim.
Deinde depone ipsum ignitum super clauum.	Then place the ignited thing upon the nail.
Deinde reuolue manum cum cauterio in circumitu claui, donec perueniat cauterium ad profunditatem claui: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, donec incipiat emittere pus.	Then revolve the hand with the cauterier around the nail, until the cauterier reaches the depth of the nail: and let it be for three days, until it begins to emit pus.
Deinde emplastra ipsum cum maluis syluestribus, contritis cum sale: et dimitte emplastrum super ipsum in nocte.	Then apply poultices to it with the leaves of wild mallows, crushed with salt: and let the poultice be on it at night.
Ipse enim eradicabitur ex radicibus suis.	For it will be uprooted from its roots.
Deinde cura locum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then care for the place with a unguent of generated flesh, until it is healed.
Quod si sunt non conuersi, et multotiens accidunt in superficie corporis, praecipue in manibus et pedibus: tunc administres in eis cauterium cum aqua calida: et est, ut accipias cannulam ex aere, aut ferro, aut ex penna uulturis: et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul.	But if they are not converted and frequently occur on the surface of the body, especially in hands and feet: then apply cauterization to them with hot water: and this is, as you take a tube made from air, or iron, or from the quill of a bird: and place it over the nail, or some other point.
Deinde proiice in cannulam ex aqua calida quantitatem paucam: retine manum tuam, et tu reuolue eam cum compressione manus tuae parumper, ut imprimatur margo cannulae in radice claui, et inueniat aqua calida uiam ad profundum, ad radicem claui: et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una.	Then pour a small amount of hot water into the tube: hold your hand firmly and turn it with gentle pressure from your hand for a short time, so that the rim of the tube imprints on the root of the nail, and the hot water finds its way to the depth, to the root of the nail: and let the patient wait for a short while after the burning of the hot water for one hour.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, nam clauus eradicatur cum radicibus suis.	Then let it go, for the nail is uprooted with its roots.
Ita fac cum eis uno post unum, donec uenias super omnes qui ex eis sunt in corpore.	So do this to each one after another, until you come across all those that are in the body.
Deinde cura eos postquam eradicantur, cum eo quod generat carnem ex unguentis.	Then care for them after they have been uprooted, with that which generates flesh from ointments.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tremore.	About the manner of cauterizing in Tremor.
Caput LVI.	Chapter 56.
Quando accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in neruo, aut ex febre quartana, aut alio: tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis, aut quinque super spondiles dorsi, et inter omnem spondilem cauterio, et in pectore eius cauterio, et super stomachum eius cauterio.	When a tremor occurs to someone from chilliness of the nerve, or from quartan fever, or another cause: then it is necessary that you cauterize him with four or five cauterizations, above the vertebrae of the back, and between every vertebra cauterize, and in his chest cauterize, and above his stomach cauterize.
Tremor enim quiescit cum cauterio oliuari, et festinat sanitas aegritudinis frigidae.	Shaking settles with olive oil cauterization, and speedily health recovers from cold illness.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Albathir.	On the manner of cauterizing by Albatir.
Caput LVII.	Chapter 57.
Quandoque expelluntur in corpore Albathir foedae, id est, pustulae, quae fiunt a materiis grossis corruptis.	Sometimes Albatir's impurities are expelled from the body, that is, boils which occur due to corrupted gross matter.
Oportet ergo in primis cum apparent, ut cauterizentur super omne caput pustulae cauterio subtili cum ligno myrti, cuius extremitas accensa est cum igne.	It is therefore necessary at first to cauterize all boils on the head with a subtle cauterization using the wood of myrtle, whose extremity has been burned with fire.
Aut cum radice aristolochiae longae.	Or with the root of long aristolochia.
Aut cum cauterio lenticulari.	Or with a lentil-shaped cauterizer.
Et quandoque cauterizantur ademenul, in principio expulsionis suae secundum hunc modum: et non augentur: et disrumpitur superfluitas faciens eos, et sanatur ex eis.	And sometimes they are cauterized at the beginning of their expulsion, according to this method, and they do not increase; and excess is broken off, making them well again.
Verumtamen oportet ut fiat illud post euacuationem cum phlebotomia.	However, it is necessary for that to be done after evacuation with bloodletting.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arteria in uulnere.	On the manner of cauterizing in a flow of blood from an artery in a wound.
Caput LVIII.	Chapter 58.
Multotiens accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, quae incisa est apud uulnus, quod accidit extrinsecus, aut apud incisionem apostematis, aut cauterium membri, et similia eis: et fit difficile abscindere eum.	It often happens that a flow of blood occurs from an artery which has been cut at the wound, either externally or at the incision of an apostema, or cauterization of a member, and similar to these; and it becomes difficult to stop it.
Cum ergo accidit alicui illud, tunc propera cum manu tua ad orificium arteriae, et pone super ipsum digitum tuum indicem: et stringe eum multum, donec obsessus sit sanguis sub digito tuo, et non egrediatur ex eo aliquid.	So when it happens to anyone, then hasten with your hand to the orifice of the artery, and place your index finger on top of it: and press it tightly until the blood is trapped under your finger and does not escape from there.
Deinde pone in ignem cauteria oliuaria parua, et magna numero plura: et suffla super ea, donec fiant ignita ualde.	Then place a small and many large olive oil cauterizers into the fire, and blow on them until they become very hot.
Deinde accipe ex eis unum, aut paruum, aut magnum, secundum uulnus et locum, in quo disrupta est arteria, et depone cauterium super ipsam uenam, post quam tu remoues digitum tuum festinanter: et tene cauterium, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then take one of them, small or large, according to the wound and place where the artery is disrupted, and place the cauterizer on top of the vein after you quickly remove your finger; and hold the cauterizer until the blood stops.
Quod si expellatur cum eleuas digitum ab orificio arteriae, et extinguis cauterium, tunc accipe cauterium aliud festinanter, ex cauteriis quae in igne sunt praeparata.	If the artery is expelled when you lift your finger from the artery opening, and you extinguish the cautery, then quickly take another cautery prepared from those that are ready in the fire.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum uno post aliud, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Therefore do not stop doing it with one after the other, until the blood is cut off.
Et caue, ne comburas neruum qui est illic, et accidat super infirmum malicia alia.	And beware that you do not burn the nerve that is there, and another evil occur over the patient.
Et scias, quod quando ex arteria fluit sanguis, tunc non est possibile abscindere ipsum: praecipue quaudo arteria est magna, nisi cum uno quatuor modorum.	And know that when blood flows from the artery, then it is not possible to cut it off: especially if the artery is great, unless with one of four methods.
Aut cum cauterio, sicut diximus.	Or with a cautery, as we said.
Aut cum extractione, quando non est extracta.	Or with extraction, when it is not extracted.
Nam quando extrahitur, contrahuntur extremitates eius, et abscinditur sanguis.	For when it is drawn out, its ends are contracted, and the blood is cut off.
Aut ligetur cum filo ligatione forti.	Or it may be tied with a strong tying thread.
Aut ponantur super ipsum medicinae de proprietate, quarum est abscindere sanguinem, et stringatur cum puluinari constrictione decenti.	Or put on top of it medicines of property which cut off blood, and tighten with a suitable constriction.
Qui autem administrat abscisionem eius cum ligamento, et strictura cum panno, aut positione rerum comburentium, et similium, non confert ei penitus, nisi raro.	However, he who administers its cutting off with a bandage and tightening with cloth, or positioning of things that are burning, and similar things, does not bring it complete benefit, unless rarely.
Si autem accidat alicui illud, et non sit ei praesens medicus, neque medicina: tunc incipiat cum positione digiti indicis super orificium uenae ipsius, sicut narrauimus, et constrictione eius ualde, donec obsessus sit sanguis a superiori parte uulneris, et super arteriam.	If however that happens to someone and there is no doctor present nor medicine: then he will begin with the positioning of his index finger over the opening of the vein of that person, as we have narrated, and its constriction very much, until the blood is occupied from the upper part of the wound and above the artery.
Et digitus non remoueatur, desuper ipsum cum aqua frigida uehementis frigoris semper, donec congeletur sanguis, et ingrossetur, et abscindatur.	And the finger should not be removed from above it with cold water of very great coldness always, until the blood congeals and thickens and is cut off.
Et interim consideret in eo, quid indiget ex cauterio, aut ex medicina.	And meanwhile he should consider what remedy is needed from the cautery or medicine.

¶ De Incisione, Perforatione, et Phlebotomia in uulneribus, et his similibus.	About incision, perforation, and phlebotomy in wounds and similar things.
Iam Diximus in Capitulo Primo, omnem aegritudinem in qua conueniens est cum igne cauterium et medicina comburente, et occasiones eius, ipsius caussas, et instrumenta eius, et formas cauteriorum.	We have already spoken in the first chapter about every illness where it is fitting to use a cauterizing iron and burning medicine, and its occasions, causes, instruments, and forms of cauterizations.
Et posui illic capitula a uertice usque ad pedem.	And I have placed the chapters from top to bottom in that place.
Et ego procedam in hoc capitulo illa eadem uia: ut alleuietur super quaerentem quaesitum eius.	And I will proceed in this chapter by following the same path, so that the sought thing may be found for one seeking it.
Et antequam incipiam illud, oportet ut addiscatis o filii, quod in hoc capitulo est ex terrore illud quod est in capitulo primo de cauterizatione.	And before I begin to speak of it, O children, you must learn what is in this chapter, which is a terror that is in the first chapter on cauterizations.
Et propter illud oportet, ut sit cautela in eo uehementior, quoniam in operatione quae est in hoc capitulo, multotiens cadit euacuatio cum sanguine, cum quo stat uita apud apertionem uenae, aut incisionem super apostema, aut apertionem exiturae, aut curationem uulneris, aut extractionem sagittae, aut incisionem super lapidem, et illis similia: ex quibus omnibus associatur tremor, et timor, et cadit in pluribus eorum mors.	And therefore it is necessary to be all the more cautious because in the operation that is in this chapter, evacuation often occurs with blood, along with which life stands at the opening of a vein, or incision over an apostema, or opening of an exit, or curing of a wound, or extracting of an arrow, or incision over a stone, and similar things: from all of which fear, terror, and death fall upon many of them.
Et ego moneo uos, ne cadat super uos illud in quo est haesitatio, nam quandoque cadunt ad uos in hac arte modi hominum cum modis infirmitatum.	And I warn you not to fall into that which is a hesitation, for sometimes such men with such kinds of infirmities fall upon you in this art.
Ex eis enim est qui irascitur cum aegritudine sua, et est leuis apud eum mors: propter uehementiam eius quod inuenit ex infirmitate sua et longitudine eius maliciei.	For from them is one who is angry at his own affliction, and is light-minded about death; on account of the vehemence of his own infirmity and the length of his wickedness.
Et cum aegritudine est ex timore quod significat mortem.	And with affliction he is from fear that signifies death.
Et ex eis est, qui dat tibicensum suum, et ditat te cum eo, sperans sanitatem, et aegritudo eius est perniciosa.	And from them is one who gives his physician to you and enriches you with him, hoping for healing, and his affliction is deadly.
Non ergo oportet ut consentiatis ei qui uenit ad uos ex eis, cuius modus est talis.	Therefore it is not fitting that you should assent to one who comes to you from them, whose manner is such.
Et sit cautela uestra uehementior, quam cupiditas et uestra rapacitas.	And let your caution be greater than your greed and avarice.
Et non praesumatis super aliquid ex illo, nisi post scientiam certam, quae uerificat apud uos illud ad quod peruenit successio laudabilis.	And do not presume to take anything from that, unless after certain knowledge has verified it before you, which confirms the thing to which a praiseworthy outcome leads.
Et utimini in curatione omnium infirmorum uestrorum, prognosticatione et indicatione de eo ad quod conuenienter sit salus.	And use prognosis and indication for the treatment of all your patients, so that their recovery may be suitably ensured.
In illo namque est uobis adiutorium super acquisitionem famae et gloriae, et memoriae et laudis.	For in that there is help to you for the acquisition of fame and glory, and memory and praise.
Inspiret uobis Deus o filii, intellectum suum, et non auferat uobis directionem et inspirationem: quoniam illud est in manu eius.	May God inspire you, his children, with His understanding, and not take away from you guidance and inspiration, for it is in His hand.
Et ego quidem ordinaui hoc Capitulum distinguendo per capitula, secundum quod praecessit in capitulo Cauterii, a ceruice usque ad pedes: ut alleuietur uobis quaesitum quod uultis ex eo, et quo indigetis.	And I myself have arranged this chapter by dividing it into chapters, just as it preceded in the chapter on Cauterization, from head to feet: so that what you seek may be alleviated for you, and what you need.
¶ De curatione Aquae quae aggregatur in capitibus puerorum.	On the cure of Water that accumulates on the heads of boys.
Caput I.	Chapter I.
Scias, quod haec infirmitas multotiens accidit pueris apud partum: aut quando stringit obstetrix caput pueri absque leuitate.	You should know that this affliction often occurs in boys at birth: or when the afterbirth tightens the boy's head without ease.
Et quandeque accidit etiam ex caussa occulta quae non scitur.	And sometimes it happens also due to a hidden cause that is not known.
Et ego quidem non uidi hanc aegritudinem in aliis quam in pueris: et ad omnem quem ex eis uidi properauit mors: propter illud ergo uisum est mihi dimittere operationem in ea.	And I myself have not seen this sickness in anyone except children, and it has hastened death in every one of them that I have seen. Therefore it seemed best to me to abandon treatment for it.
Et ego quidem uidi ex eis puerum, cuius caput impletum erat aqua, et caput magnificabatur in omni die, donec non poterat sedere super seipsum, propter magnitudinem capitis sui: et humiditas augmentata fuit, donec mortuus est.	And I myself have seen a boy from them whose head was filled with water, and his head swelled up every day, until he could no longer sit upright because of the greatness of his own head; and the moisture increased until he died.
Et haec quidem humiditas, aut aggregatur inter cutem et os: aut aggregatur sub osse super sifac.	And this moisture either accumulates between the skin and the mouth: or it accumulates beneath the bone above the forehead.
Et operatio in illo, si est humiditas inter cutem et os, et apostema est paruum, tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis fissura una in latitudine: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo nodi, donec currat humiditas.	And the operation is this, if there is moisture between the skin and bone, and an abscess is small, then it is necessary to make a single incision in the middle of the head's fissure, one that is as wide as two knots, until the moisture flows.
Et haec est forma spatumilis.	And this is the shape of a spatula.
Si ergo humiditas est magis augmentata, et apostema est maius, tunc pone eas duas fissuras, secundum formam hanc.	So if the moisture is more increased and the abscess is greater, then make two incisions, according to this shape.
Et si humiditas est sub osse, et signum eius est, quod uides commissuras capitis apertas ab omni parte: et aqua deprimitur quando comprimis eam manu tua ad interiora, et non occultatur tibi illud: tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis tribus fissuris, secundum hunc modum.	And if the moisture is under the bone, and its sign is that you see the corners of the head open on every side: and water flows when you press it with your hand to the inside, and it does not hide from you: then it is necessary to make three incisions in the middle of the head, according to this manner.
Et post incisionem extrahe humiditatem totam.	And after making the incision, remove the moisture entirely.
Deinde stringe fissuras cum pannis et puluillis.	Then sew up the incisions with cloth and wool.
Deinde embroca illud desuper cum uino et oleo usque ad diem quintum.	Then dress it above with wine and oil until the fifth day.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et cura uulnus cum tentis, et unguentis.	Then loosen the sutures and care for the wound with tents and ointments.
Et non dimittas stringere caput cum aequalitate.	And do not stop binding the head evenly.
Et ciba infirmum omni cibo sicco paucae humiditatis, usquequo confortetur membrum, et sanetur.	And feed the sick person all dry food with a little moisture until the member is comforted and healed.
Et modus alius incisionis est, ut consideres ubi apparet magnitudo apostematis, et collectio aquae.	And another method of incision is, to consider where the magnitude of the abscess appears, and the collection of water.
Quoniam quandoque est in occipitio plus, aut in sincipite, aut in dextra, aut in sinistra.	For sometimes it is more in the back of the head, or in the forehead, or on the right side, or on the left side.
Ascende ergo cum incisione ubi apparet tibi apostema et impletio aquae: et scinde illud secundum quod tibi possibile est.	So climb up with an incision where you see the abscess and the filling of water: and cut it according to what is possible for you.
Et obserua, ne incidas arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis, et moriatur infirmus ex illo fluxu cum euacuatione humiditatis.	And observe, lest you cut an artery and a flow of blood occurs, and the patient dies from that flow with evacuation of moisture.
¶ De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.	Of the Incision of Arteries which are behind the Ears.
Caput II.	Here is the translation:
Quando accidunt alicui catarri ad oculos, aut ad pectus, et antiquatur illud, et non confert curatio medicinarum: tunc magis ultima curatio est in illo, incisio harum duarum arteriarum.	When cataracts occur to someone's eyes or breast and it becomes old and medical treatment does not help: then the final cure is in that case cutting of these two arteries.
Oportet ergo quando uis incidere eas, ut radat infirmus caput suum.	Therefore, when you want to cut them, the patient should be positioned so that his head is facing downwards.
Deinde frica locum cum panno aspero, ut appareant arteriae.	Then make a small incision with a rough cloth, so that the arteries appear.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum, cum quolibet panno suo.	Then the patient should bind his neck with any of his own cloths.
Deinde considera, ubi pulset uena.	Then examine where the vein pulsates.
Et loca utriusque sunt loca quae sunt post aures depressa: et raro occultatur, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	And the places of both are the places that are below the ears, depressed; and it is rarely hidden, unless in certain people.
Deinde signa cum encaustro super utraque: et incide utramque cum spatumili utrimque acuro, incisione perueniente ad os: et fiat illud per latitudinem capitis.	Then mark with encaustum above each one; and cut both with a sharp instrument, making the cut reach from ear to ear and across the width of the head.
Et si uis, intromitte spatumile sub arteria, et incide eam ad superiora cum incisione.	And if you wish, insert the spatumile under the artery, and cut it at the top with the same incision.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quasi duo digiti iuncti.	And let the length of the incision be about as long as two joined fingers.
Nam quando inciditur uena, egreditur sanguis egressione pulsatili, qui salit ad interiora saltu frequenti.	For when the vein is cut, blood flows out with a pulsating flow, which jumps into the interior in rapid succession.
Si autem arteria non apparet sensui, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aure quantitatem spacii trium digitorum.	But if the artery does not appear to the sense, then it is necessary to measure from the ear a space of three fingers.
Deinde signa cum encaustro, et finde usque ad os.	Then mark with encaustum, and make the incision up to the mouth.
Et illud quod oportet emittere ex sanguine, est VI uncia et fortasse emittis ex eo plus, aut minus.	And what needs to be emitted from the blood is six ounces, and perhaps you may emit more or less from it.
Totum illud secundum quantitatem quae apparet tibi ex uirute infirmi et repletione arteriae eius.	The entire amount according to the quantity that appears to you from the strength of the patient and the filling of his artery.
Deinde considera ad uulnus.	Then examine the wound.
Tunc si remanet ad os ex sifac aliquid, tunc incide illud, ut non accidat apostema calidum: tunc stringe uulnus cum liciniis ex panno lini.	Then if something remains at the mouth from the blood, then cut it off so that a warm abscess does not occur; then bind the wound with linen cloths.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointment until it heals.
¶ De extractione arteriarum, quae sunt in timporibus.	About the extraction of arteries that are in time.
Caput III.	Chapter III.
Quando accidit homini hemicranea antiqua, aut catarri acuti propter humiditates acrimoniales, et caliditate in lacertis timporum, aut soda antiqua, uehemens, et similia illis: et medicatur cum modis curationis medicinae, et non confert illud: tunc experti sumus in his aegritudinibus extractionem arteriarum ex timporibus, aut cauterizationem earum, sicut narrauimus.	When an old hemicrania or acute catarra occurs in a person due to acrimonious moistures and heat in the temporal arteries, or an old, thick, and similar condition: and one medicates with modes of medical treatment, but does not apply that; then we are experienced in these afflictions by extracting arteries from the temples or cauterizing them, as we have narrated.
Et modus operationis in extractione earum, est, ut radat infirmus pilos qui sunt in timporibus, et intendat ad arteriam apparentem in timpore.	And the method of operation for extracting those is, that the patient should shave off the hair that are on the temples, and direct his attention to the appearing artery in the temple.
Ipsa namque ostenditur tibi ex pulsu suo, et raro occultatur nisi in paucis hominibus, aut uehementia frigoris.	For it is itself revealed to you by its pulse, and is rarely hidden except in a few people or in dementia due to cold.
Quod si occultatur tibi, tunc stringat infirmus caput suum cum quolibet panno suo: deinde frica locum cum panno aspero.	If it is hidden from you, then the patient should bind his head with any cloth of his own; afterwards, he should rub the place with a rough cloth.
Aut uapora locum cum aqua calida, donec appareat tibi apparitione manifesta.	Or sprinkle the place with hot water, until it appears to you in a manifest manifestation.
Deinde accipe spatumile, quod paulo ante formaui.	Then take the spatula which I formed a little while ago.
Deinde excoria cum eo cutem cum facilitate, donec peruenias ad arteriam.	Then scrape with it the skin with ease, until you reach the artery.
Deinde proiice in eam uncinum, et extrahe eam ad superiora, donec extrahas eam ex cute, et facias eam euadere ex tunicis quae sunt sub ea ab omni parte.	Then throw a needle into it and draw it out upwards until you have drawn it out from the skin and made it to go forth from the tunics that are beneath it on all sides.
Si autem arteria est subtilis: tunc inuolue eam cum extremitate uncini.	If however the artery is thin, then wrap it around with the tip of the needle.
Deinde incide ex ea partem secundum quantitatem qua elongentur extremitates eius, et contrahantur, et non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Then cut from it a portion according to the length by which its ends are stretched and contracted, and that there may not be a flow of blood.
Nam si non inciditur, et si non abscinditur, non ascendit sanguis penitus.	For if it is not cut, and if it is not divided, the blood will not ascend completely.
Deinde euacua ex sanguine ana VI unci, usque ad .III.	Then take out from the blood six inches of needle up to three.
Quod si arteria est magna: tunc oportet ut liges eam in duobus locis ex filo duplo, forti, ex serico: aut ex chordis alhohod, ut non properet ad ipsam putrefactio ante consolidationem uulneris, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If the artery is large: then it is necessary that you tie it in two places with a double strand of strong silk or seric thread, or with the strings of the alhohod, so that it does not become prone to putrefaction before the wound has consolidated and bleeding occurs.
Deinde incide superfluitatem, quae est inter duo ligamenta.	Then cut away the excess which is between the two ligatures.
Fac illud in illa hora, aut post horam aliam.	Do that at that hour, or after another hour.
Et si uis, cauteriza eam cauterio usque ad os, cum cauterio cultellari: donec incidantur extremitates eius, et stabit loco eiusdem operis.	And if you wish, cauterize it with a cauterizing instrument, up to the edge, using a cutlery cauterizer, until its ends are severed and it remains in place as part of the same work.
Et est melius opus, nisi si infirmus habet febrem, autest calefactae complexionis.	And it is a better outcome, unless the patient has a fever or a warm complexion.
Quoniam cauterium est ex eis, quae iuuant ad finiendas humiditates.	Because the cauterizer is one of those things that help to dry out humidity.
Ergo est melius iuuamentum.	Therefore it is a better remedy.
Et oportet post extractionem arteriarum, ut impleatur locus cotto antiquo: et ponantur super ipsum puluilli decenter facti.	And after the removal of arteries, the place should be filled with old dressings and small cloths made decently.
Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.	And after the wound has closed, it should be treated with dry medicines that cause flesh to grow and with lint cloths until it is healed.
Quod si interim dum operaris accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, tunc propera ad abscindendum eum cum cauterio, aut ut impleas locum cum zegi: et stringe manum tuam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If in the meantime while you are operating a hemorrhage occurs from the artery, then hasten to stop it with a cauterizer or by filling the place with sawdust, and tie your hand tight until the bleeding stops.
Quod si nihil ex illis est tibi praesens, tunc pone super locum digitum tuum, donec congeletur sanguis.	If none of those things are available to you, then place your finger on top of the wound until the blood coagulates.
Et embroca locum cum aqua uehementis frigoris, donec quiescat acuitas, et stringatur secundum quod oportet.	And apply the place with water of very cold temperature, until the sharpness subsides and it is tightened as needed.
Et ex eo quod est leuius et facilius extractione arteriae, est, ut cauterizes uenam cum hoc cauterio habente duos cultellos: sitque acuitas duorum cultellorum similis almagdatem.	And because it is easier and less troublesome to remove the artery, it is that you cauterize the vein with this cauterizer having two knives, so that the sharpness of the two knives is like a well-known instrument.
Verumtamen sunt multo minoris acuitatis, quam duo cultelli.	However they are much duller than two knives.
Quoniam si sunt acutae, sicut duo cultelli, properat utrisque frigus: et non incidunt carnem cum uelocitate.	For if they are sharp, like two knives, both will cool down quickly; and they will not cut the flesh with swiftness.
Cum ergo in eis est aliquantulum grossitudinis, tenetur in eis calor ignis, et abscinditur caro uelociter: cum hoc ergo opus est melius omni opere, et leuius, et facilius.	And so when there is a slight thickness in them, the heat of fire remains in them, and flesh is cut quickly; therefore this work is better than any other, easier, and more easily done.
Et sit spacium quod est inter duos cultellos quantitas grossitudinis digiti, postquam tu signas duo loca cum encaustro: et depone utrosque ignitos ualde, donec perueniant ad os, et incidant uenam in duobus locis: ut elongetur quod est inter extremitates eius.	And let there be a space between the two knives of the thickness of a finger, after you mark two places with encaustic: and put both out very well, until they reach the mouth, and cut the vein in two places: so that what is between its extremities may be lengthened.
Nam non consolidantur cum hoc cauterio penitus.	For they are not thoroughly sealed with this cautery.
Et haec est forma cauterii.	And this is the form of the cautery.
¶ De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.	Of the treatment for frequent and sharp tears flowing from the eyes.
Caput IIII.	Chapter IV.
Quando sunt lachrymae assiduae, et est cursus earum ex uenis, quae sunt super craneum capitis exterius: et non confert in eis aliquid curationis medicinae cum medicinis, et uides faciem infirmi iam rubere, et sentit in fronte sua deambulationem, sicut est deambulatio formicarum: et oculi eius sunt extenuati, humidi, ita quod iam corrosi sunt pili eorum cum corrosione: et calefactae sunt palpebrae eius ex acuitate lachrymarum: tunc antiqui indiguerunt in curatione earum hac operatione, et denominauerunt eam curationem, cum Ense.	When there are frequent tears and their flow is from the veins that are above the outer part of the head: and no medicine can be applied to them with medicines, and you see the face of the sick person already red, and feels a walking sensation in his forehead, just like the walking of ants; and his eyes are worn out, humid, so much so that their hairs have been corroded along with the corrosion: and his eyelids are heated from the sharpness of the tears: then the ancients were in need of curing them by this operation, and they called it a cure with an Ense.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere pilos qui sunt in fronte sua.	And it is as if you are telling the sick person to shave off the hairs that are on his forehead.
Deinde incide in fronte tres fissuras aequedistantes secundum longitudinem frontis: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo digiti, et fissura una sit aequedistans longitudini nasi in medio frontis, et secunda secundum longitudinem parumper a motu lacertorum, et tertia a parte altera: et caue ab incisione arteriarum quae sunt in duobus lateribus: et elonga manum tuam a continuatione duarum mandibularum, et sit spacium omnis incisionis quantitas trium digitorum coniunctorum: et sit tibi frustum spongiae praeparatum, aut panni siccati multi, cum quibus exsicces sanguinem.	Then cut three incisions in the forehead at equal distances according to the length of the forehead: and let the length of each incision be about two fingers, and one incision should be equidistant from the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second should follow the length a little beyond the movement of the arms, and the third on the other side: and beware of cutting into arteries that are on both sides: and stretch out your hand from the continuation of two jawbones, and let the space of all incision be equal to three fingers joined together: and have a prepared sponge or many pieces of dry cloth with which you will absorb blood.
Deinde intromitte spatumile duarum acutarum extremitatum, cuius mox sequens est forma.	Then introduce a spatula with two sharp edges at its ends, whose shape follows.
Ab incisione quae est a parte timporis, usque ad incisionem secundam: et excoria cum eo totam cutem, quae est inter duas incisiones, cum sifac, quod est super os.	From the incision that is on the part of the temple, up to the second incision; and scrape away with it all the skin that is between the two incisions, along with the siphon that is above the bone.
Deinde fac illud etiam ab incisione media usque ad incisionem secundam.	Then do the same thing from the middle incision up to the second incision.
Deinde extrahe hoc spatumile, et intromitte in incisionem primam iterum instrumentum aliud, quod nominatur cultellare acutum, ab una parte lene, non acutum ab altera parte.	Then extract this spatula and insert into the first incision again another instrument, which is called a sharp curved knife, with one side blunt and not sharp on the other.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its shape.
Et pone latus eius acutum uersus carnem annexam cum cute, et latus eius lene uersus os: et impelle ipsum, donec perueniat ad fissuram mediam: et abscinde cum eo omnia uasa, quae descendunt a capite ad oculos: praeter quod continuetur incisio usque ad illud quod apparet de cute.	And place the sharp side of it towards the attached flesh with the skin, and the blunt side towards the bone; and push it in until it reaches the middle fissure; and cut away with it all the sinewy parts that descend from the head to the eyes: except for what is contained within the incision up to what appears on the surface of the skin.
Deinde fac illud in fissura media usque ad fissuram aliam.	Then do the same thing in the middle fissure up to another fissure.
Et postquam currit ex sanguine quantitas aequalis, exprime loca ex frustis sanguinis coagulati.	And after an equal amount of blood has flowed out, express the places from the clot of congealed blood.
Deinde pone in omnem fissuram licinium ex cotto ueteri, et pone super eos puluillos imbibitos in uino, et oleo, aut aceto.	Then place linen cloth from old pottery into every fissure and place above them poultices soaked in wine, oil, or vinegar.
Et uide ut non accidat apostema calidum.	And see that a warm abscess does not occur.
Et in die tertia solue ligamentum, et administra infusionem multam cum aqua tepida.	And on the third day dissolve the ligament and administer an infusion with hot water.
Deinde cura illud ex unguento basilicon, et reliquis quibus curantur uulnera: usquequo sanetur.	Then care for that with balsam ointment and other things by which wounds are healed, until it is sound.
¶ De cura lachrymarum acutarum et catarrorum ad oculos ex interioribus capitis.	A treatise on the cure of sharp tears and catarrhs in the eyes from internal head conditions.
Caput V.	V.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri acuti, acres, assidui: et uides oculos eius extenuatos, paruos, et iam debilitatus est aspectus eorum: et palpebrae ulceratae, et cadunt pili ex eis, et in profundo capitis est dolor acutus, laedens, et sternutatio consequens: tunc sume ex istis accidentibus, quod illae materiae, et catarri non ueniunt, nisi ex uenis multis.	When sharp catarrhs occur in someone, and they are frequent, intense, and persistent; and you see their eyes emaciated, small, and already weakened in appearance; and the eyelids are ulcerated, and hair falls out of them, and there is a sharp, piercing pain deep in the head, which causes damage and coughing follows: then take from these afflictions what is proper to those materials, and catarrhs do not come forth except through many veins.
Et melior curatio in eis est haec.	And the better cure for them is this.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere frontem suam.	And it is, that you cause the sick person to shave his forehead.
Deinde incide in eam fissuram unam in medio frontis, aut alterius parumper per latitudinem, et incipe cum fissura a timpore sinistro ad timpus dextrum: et sit incisio usque ad os: et elonga manum tuam a lacertis timporum, qui mouentur apud masticationem: donec quando detegitur os: et exsiccabis totum sanguinem cum spongia.	Then cut one slit in the middle of the forehead, or another a little to one side, and start with the slit from the left temple to the right: and make the incision up to the bone; and stretch out your hand away from the temples which move during mastication: until when the bone is laid bare: and dry all the blood with a sponge.
Tunc separa inter duo labia fissurae cum cotto ueteri, aut cum liciniis ex lino.	Then separate the two lips of the incision with an old piece of cloth or linen strips.
Deinde stringe desuper cum puluillis: et imbibe puluillos cum uino et oleo, ut non accidat apostema calidum.	Then tie over it with bandages: and soak the bandages in wine and oil, so that a hot abscess does not occur.
Et quando soluis illud, et uides quod apostema calidum iam imminuitur: tunc oportet ut frices os, donec incipiat in eo nasci caro.	And when you dissolve it and see that the hot abscess is already subsiding: then it is necessary to burn the bone until flesh begins to grow on it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum regimine exiccatiuo quod facit nasci carnem: sicut si accipias ex farina tritici partes duas, et ex colophonia quatuor partes: et praepares ex eis emplastrum, et administretur ad natiuitatem carnis in istis uulneribus.	Then care for it with a regimen of emollients that cause flesh to grow: such as if you take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony: and prepare an ointment from them, and apply it to the birth of flesh in these wounds.
¶ De cura eius quod cadit in Aurem.	About the cure for what falls on the Ear.
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Omne Quod in Aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.	All that falls into the Ear is one of four kinds: either a mineral stone, or like one, such as iron and glass: or it is from a plant, such as chickpeas and beans: or it is a flowing substance, such as water and vinegar, and things similar to these: or some animal.
Quando ergo cadit in aurem lapis, aut genus lapidis ex eis quae non adduntur, neque crescunt in aure, expone Aurem soli: si ergo uides lapidem, tunc distilla in Aurem aliquid ex oleo uiolato, aut sisamino.	When therefore a stone falls into the ear, or some kind of stone that does not add anything nor grows in the ear, expose the Ear to the sun: if however you see the stone, then dilute something from violet oil or sassafras in the Ear.
Deinde administra extractionem eius, et fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares apud aduentum sternutationis, postquam tu ponis in circumitu auris frusta ex pannis, aut lana, et extendis aurem ad superiora.	Then administer the extraction of it and make him sneeze with you, and close his nostrils at the advent of sneezing, after you put strips of cloth or wool around his ear, and stretch the ear upwards.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum hac cura.	For this treatment often goes out many times.
Si autem non egreditur, tunc administra extractionem eius cum Gesti, id est, Pizigarolis subtilibus: cuius forma est haec.	But if it does not go out, then administer the extraction of it with gestures, that is, gentle pizzicatos: whose form is this.
Si ergo egreditur cum gesti, est bonum.	If therefore it goes out with gestures, it is good.
Et si non, tunc administra extractionem eius cum uncino caeco subtili paucae duplicationis.	And if not, then administer the extraction of it with a subtle, small, blind hook.
Si ergo non egreditur per illud, tunc fac cannulam ex aere, et intromitte extremitatem cannulae in foramen auris multum, et opila quod est in circumitu cannulae cum caera mollificata cum oleo, ut non sit uento uia nisi cannulae: deinde extrahe cum uento tuo attractione forti.	If therefore it does not go out through that, then make a tube of air, and insert the end of the tube into the ear canal very much, and close what is in the circle of the tube with a soft wax mixture with oil, so that there will be no way except for the tube: then draw it out with your strong breath attraction.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus.	For this often goes out as we have told.
Si autem non egreditur hoc modo: tunc accipe ex helkalimbat, aut ex uisco, id est, gluten praeparato, cum quo capiuntur aues, rem modicam: et pone ipsum in extremitate radii postquam tu inuoluis super eam cotum decenter positum: deinde intromitte ipsum in foramen auris cum facilitate, postquam tu exiccas aurem ab humiditate.	But if it does not go out this way: then take a small amount of glue prepared from egg white or bird's gut, with which birds are caught, and place it at the end of the radius after you have wrapped around it a well-positioned cord: then insert it into the ear canal easily, after you have dried the ear from moisture.
Si ergo non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc propera ad scindendum, antequam accidat apostema calidum, aut spasmus.	But if it does not go out with all that we have told: then hasten to cut, before a hot abscess or convulsion occurs.
Et modus fissurae est, ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis in cephalica: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum mensuram uirtutis eius.	And the method of incision is, to make a wound first in the cephalic region on an invalid: and draw out from his blood according to the measure of his strength.
Deinde fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et conuerte aurem eius ad superiora, et finde fissuram paruam in radice auris apud adipem eius in loco depresso ipsi: et sit fissura lunaris figurae, donec peruenias ad lapidem: deinde aufer eum cum eo, quod est tibi possibile ex instrumentis.	Then make the invalid sit between your hands, and turn his ear upwards, and find a small wound in the root of the ear at the fatty part of him in a depressed place on himself: and let the wound have the shape of a crescent, until you reach the bone: then remove it with what is possible for you from instruments.
Deinde sue fissuram ab hora tua cum uelocitate, et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then apply a poultice to your wound with speed and care, until it heals.
Quod si res cadens in aurem est ex uno granorum, quae crescunt, et inflantur: tunc administra extractionem eius.	But if something is growing in the ear that causes a swelling and inflammation, then perform its extraction.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc accipe spatumile tenue, subtile, secundum hanc formam.	But if it does not obey you for exit, then take a thin, subtle spatula, in this shape.
Et administra cum eo abscisionem illius speciei ex granis, quae cadunt in aurem, et non facias illud, quando tu cogitas, quod illud granum iam humectatum est per uaporem auris, donec ponis ipsum frusta multa: deinde extrahe ea cum uncinis, aut cum gesti subtili, aut cum suctione, sicut diximus, nam extractio eius alleuiatur.	And administer with it the removal of that type of grain from the ear canal, and do not do so when you think that grain is already moistened by the vapor of the ear, until you place many plugs: then take them out with a hook or a thin instrument or suction, as we said, for its extraction is facilitated.
In aqua autem quae ingreditur in aurem, oportet ut utatur infirmus sternutatione cum condisi in primis: et iam impleuit aurem suam cum aliquanto cotto ueteri: et est iacens super illam aurem, in qua est aqua.	However, when the water enters the ear, it is necessary for the patient to use a nose-dropper at first: and then he has filled his ear with some old boiled liquid: and he lies on top of that ear where there is water.
Si ergo egreditur per illud, est bonum.	If it comes out through that, it's good.
Et si non: tunc accipe lapides multos, secundum longitudinem digiti, tenues, lenes, et calefac eos cum igne parumper, et intromittat infirmus ex eis unum in foramen auris suae: et saliat super pedem suum unum ex illa parte, et percutiat cum lapide alio super lapidem qui est in aure.	And if not: then take many small stones, as long as a finger, thin and soft, and warm them with fire for a little while, and the patient should insert one of them into his ear canal: and he should sit on one foot from that side, and strike another stone on the stone that is in the ear.
Non ergo cesset facere illud cum lapide et lapide, donec egrediatur tota aqua.	Therefore do not stop doing that with stones until all the water comes out.
Et iam egreditur aqua ita, ut accipias ex parpyro, aut ex iunco unum, et intromittas extremitatem eius unam in aurem: et accendas extremitatem alteram cum igne, donec comburatur plurimum eius.	And when the water has come out like that, take a feather or a reed, and insert one end of it into the ear: and burn the other end with fire until most of it is consumed.
Deinde itera iuncum alium, et fac illud multotiens, donec egrediatur tota aqua: et extrahe ipsam cum cannula secundum quod praemissum est in lapide.	Then take another reed and do that many times until all the water has come out: and draw it out with a syringe as previously stated in the stone.
In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.	In the extraction of an animal entering into it, if it is a small body, such as a flea, and similar to that, care for it as I said in the division.
Sed si est corporis magni, quod appareat sensui: tunc administra extractionem eius cum gesti, et uncinis: et res eius est facilior omnibus, quae tenentur in aure.	But if it is a large tumor that appears to the sense: then administer its removal with gauze and forceps: and its outcome is easier for all those that are held in gold.
In extractione autem uermis generati in aure, quando curas eum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et in tractatu distilationum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut aspicias aurem in sole.	However, in the extraction of a worm born in the ear, when you care for it with what we said in the division and treatment of distillations, and your cure does not agree: then it is necessary to look at the ear in the sun.
Si ergo apparet illic aliquid ex uermibus, tunc extrahe illud cum gesti, aut cum uncinis subtilibus.	Therefore, if something appears there from worms, then remove it with forceps or with fine forceps.
Si autem non apparet illic aliquid, tunc accipe cannulam, cuius haec est forma, stricta inferius, ampla superius: et intromitte extremitatem subtilem in aurem secundum quantitatem quod tolerat eam infirmus: deinde suge cum ea suctione forti.	But if nothing appears there, then take a cannula, of this form: tight below, broad above; and insert the slender end into the ear according to what an invalid can tolerate: then suck with it using strong suction.
Fac illud multotiens, donec egrediantur omnes uermes.	Do that many times until all the worms depart.
Si autem non obediunt tibi ad exitum, tunc opila circumitum cannulae cum caera, sicut dixi in lapide.	But if they do not obey you at exit, then apply wax to the surrounding area of the cannula with cerate, as I said in stone.
Quod si non egrediuntur cum eo quod diximus: tunc administra distillationes quas iam experti sunt antiqui in interfectione uermium: et inuenies illud in tractatu distillationum.	And if they do not depart with what we said, then administer the distillations which ancient people have already experienced in the destruction of worms; and you will find that in the treatise on distillations.
Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicta est hic.	And let your flow be as when you pour oil and medicines into the ear with this instrument, whose form is depicted here.
Sicut uides fac ipsum ex argento, aut aere, inferius strictum, in quo sit foramen paruum, amplum superius.	As you see, make it of silver or air, lower part tight, with a small hole below, broad above.
Sit ergo ut impellens quod est in concauitate cannulae, sit ex aere decenter factum.	So let the propeller that is in the concavity of the cannula be made of air, decently fashioned.
Et si uis, accipe radium, et inuolue in extremitate eius cottum inuolutione decenti: deinde proiice oleum, aut succum, aut quod uis ex istis medicinis in cannulam: et ipsa sit in aure: deinde intromitte radium cum cotto desuper, et exprime ipsum manu tua compressione temperata, donec impellatur oleum in concauitate auditus, et sentiat ipsum infirmus interius: et illud quod infunditur in aurem, sit iam calefactum cum igne parumper: et caue ne sit res quae distillatur in eam frigida ualde: medicinae enim non tolerant illud.	And if you wish, take a wick and wrap it around the end of it with a decent wrapping: then pour oil, or sap, or whatever you like from these medicines into the cannula: and let it be in the ear: then insert the wick with the wrapping on top and express it by hand compression tempered until the oil is forced into the concavity to be heard, and let the invalid feel it inside: and what is poured into the ear should already be warmed with fire for a little while: and beware that what distills into it is not very cold: for medicines do not tolerate that.
¶ De cura opilationis accidentis Auri.	On the treatment of accidental gold swelling.
Caput VII.	Chapter Seven.
Quandoque egrediuntur quidam infantes ex uentribus matrum suarum non perforati.	At times, some infants depart from their mothers' wombs unperforated.
Et iam accidit etiam quibusdam hominibus opilatio in meatu Auris a uulnere, aut carne nata in ea.	And it also happens to certain people that swelling occurs on the ear as a result of a wound or flesh growing there.
Et haec opilatio quandoque fit in profundo foraminis Auris, quam non consequitur uisus: et quandoque accidit ad exteriora foraminis parum, et consequitur eam uisus.	And this swelling sometimes occurs in the deep cavity of the ear, which does not follow sight; and sometimes it happens to the outer parts of the ear's opening, and follows sight.
Illa ergo quae accidit in profundo Auris, et quam non comprehendit aspectus, est in pluribus dispositionibus difficilis sanationis.	Therefore, that which occurs in the deep ear and does not follow sight is difficult to heal in many cases.
Et in illa quam consequitur uisus, oportet ut ponas Aurem infirmi in sole, et aspicias in ea: tunc si uides opilationem apparentem, aperi eam cum spatumili subtili, cuius forma est haec quae sequitur, sit extremitas eius in qua sit quaedam latitudo parua, cuius quaedam pars sit acuta: et reliquum spatumile sit duarum laterum lenium: ut non laedat aurem.	And as for that which follows sight, it is necessary to place the ear of the afflicted person in the sun and look at it; then if you see swelling appearing, open it with a thin spatula, whose shape is as follows: let its end be where there is a small flat area, with a sharp part: and the rest of the spatula should be smooth on both sides, so that it does not hurt the ear.
Si ergo opilatio est a carne nata in meatu auris: tunc tene eam cum uncino subtili, et incide eam cum facilitate uehementi, donec auferatur tota caro.	If the swelling is from flesh growing in the ear canal, then take it with a thin scalpel and cut it away with great ease, until all the flesh is removed.
Quod si opilatio est in profundo auris: tunc accipe radium subtilem, lenem, et calefac ipsum cum igne parumper: deinde mitte ipsum in meatum auris.	What if the swelling is in the deep ear? Then take a thin, gentle rod and warm it with fire for a little while; then put it into the ear canal.
Si ergo senseris opilationem cum eo, quod inuenit infirmus cum grauitate auditus, conare apertionem eius cum facilitate: et caue, ne uulneres neruos auris.	If then you feel the swelling with what the afflicted person feels with heaviness of hearing, try to open it gently; and beware lest you wound the nerves of the ear.
Deinde pone in aurem licinium secundum quantitatem amplitudinis foraminis, quod inuoluisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud aliquot diebus, donec sis securus de consolidatione uulneris.	Then put a liniment into the ear according to the size of the opening that you wrapped with Egyptian ointment; do this for several days until you are sure of the wound's consolidation.
Aut accipe licinium, et infunde ipsum in aqua rosata, et pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, et utere ipso.	Or take a liniment and mix it with rose water, and powder zeig thrice over it, and use it.
Quod si uides aurem iam apostemari: tunc oportet ut extrahas licinium, et permittas ipsum cum licinio alio, quod inuolues in caeroto quod sit factum cum oleo rosato, donec sedetur apostema calidum: deinde cura ipsum usquequo sanetur.	If you see the ear already suppurating: then it is necessary to remove the ligature, and permit another ligature to be tied on, which will be wrapped in a cloth that has been prepared with rose oil, until the warm abscess subsides: afterwards care for it until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis: tunc submerge spongiam, aut pannos in aqua frigida, et pone super eam aurem: et utere reliqua curatione, quae abscindit fluxum sanguinis praedicta in tractatu distillationum.	But if bleeding occurs: then submerge a sponge or cloths in cold water and place them over the ear: and use the remaining treatment that is described in the chapter on distillations, which stops the flow of blood predicted above.
¶ De cura Altheli palpebrarum.	Of the cure for Althele's eyelids.
Caput VIII.	Chapter 8.
Isti Althelil qui accidunt in Palpebris oculi, quandoque sunt humidi, et sunt sicci.	These are the Altheles which occur on the eyelids of the eye, sometimes they are wet and sometimes dry.
Oportet ergo ut teneas eos cum tenaliis: aut cum uncino, et incidas eos cum spatumili a radicibus suis.	Therefore you should keep them with tweezers or forceps, and cut them off at the roots with a spatula.
Deinde pone super loca zegi tritum.	Then place powdered zei over the places.
Si autem ex eis fluat sanguis, tunc cauteriza eos cum cauterio lenticulari subtili.	But if blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a fine glass cauterizer.
Et cauterizare eos, est melius post incisionem.	And it is better to cauterize them after the incision.
Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid.	For many times they return when something remains from their roots.
Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.	And when they are cauterized with fire, the roots are burned and do not return.
¶ De cura Grandinum palpebrarum oculi.	Of the cure for Eyebrow Hives of the eye.
Caput IX.	Chapter 9.
Multotiens accidit in palpebris aliquid quod assimilatur Crandini in fortitudine sua, et sua duricie, et propter illud nominatur Grando: et est aggregatio humiditatis grossae in palpebra superiore, et palpebra inferiore.	Many times something happens on the eyelids which is similar to a Grandin in its firmness and durability, and for that reason it is called a Grandin: and it is a thickening of moisture in the upper eyelid and lower eyelid.
Operatio ergo in eis est, ut consideres tunc, si est Grando procedens in eo, quod apparet de palpebra, et mouentur ad omnem partem, et res eius est facilis.	Therefore the operation on them is that you should consider then if it is a Grandin proceeding from within, which appears on the eyelid and moves to every part, and its nature is easy.
Finde ergo super eam fissura per latitudinem.	Find therefore a fissure above it by breadth.
Deinde excoria eam ab omni parte cum facilitate, donec euadat.	Then remove the skin from it completely with ease, until it is stripped away.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncino, et abscinde ipsam.	Then suspend it with a hook and cut it off.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi abscisio eius, nisi postquam tu penetras palpebram cum incisione parumper, tunc nocet infirmo illud in aliquo.	But if the cutting off of it is not prepared for you, unless after you pierce the eyelid with a small incision, then that can harm the sick person somehow.
Quod si fissura est magna: tunc aggrega ipsam cum sutura: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	But if it is a large wound: then gather it together with stitches and care for it until it heals.
Et si est parua, non superueniet tibi malum ex ea.	And if it is small, no harm will come to you from it.
Vnguentum enim restaurat ipsam, et incarnat eam.	For ointment restores it and fleshes it out.
Et si grando est decliuis ad interiora auris uersus superficiem intrinsecam, tunc inuersa palpebram, et suspende grandinem cum uncino: praeter quod indigeas incisione, et preme eam ab omni parte.	And if the discharge is flowing downward from the inner parts of the ear towards the internal surface, then turn back the eyelid and suspend the discharge with a hook: besides which you will need an incision, and press it from all sides.
Quod si elongatur palpebra per incisionem, non nocet illud in aliquo.	But if the eyelid is lengthened by the incision, it does not harm anything in any way.
Deinde ablue oculum post incisionem grandinis, cum aqua salsa: et cura locum cum eo quod incarnat, donec sanetur infirmus.	Then wash the eye after the incision of the discharge, with salt water: and care for the place with what fleshens it out, until the sick person heals.
¶ De cura Axirnath palpebrarum.	Of the cure of Eye-Sores of the Eyelids.
Caput X.	Chapter X.
Axirnath est adeps qui generatur in tunicis palpebrae superioris: et plurimum quidem accidit illud pueris: et ipsum grauat oculos eorum, et accidunt eis catarri in matutinis, et non possunt intueri lumen solis, propterea, quod lachrymae properant ad eos, et propter illud uides eos discumbere super facies suas semper, et super eas dormiunt, et sunt palpebrae eorum sub superciliis humidae, quas iam cooperuit inflatio: et eminentia quidem Axirnath apparens est oculo, et quando tu premis locum cum digitis tuis, sentis Axirnath inter eos.	Axirnath is a fatness that is generated on the upper lid of the eyelid: and it happens most to boys: and it weighs upon their eyes, and causes them to have cataracts in the mornings, and they are unable to look at the light of the sun, therefore because tears flow towards them, and for this reason you see them lying down on their faces always, and sleeping on them, and their eyelids are moist under the eyebrows, which is already swelled up with inflation: and indeed Axirnath appears as a lump to the eye, and when you press the place with your fingers, you feel Axirnath between them.
Et modus operationis eius est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the method of operating on it is, that the sick person places his head in your arm.
Deinde accipe pannum lini, et praepara in eo licinia, et fac ex illo licinio circulum secundum quantitatem quod continet Axirnath ab omni parte.	Then receive a linen cloth and prepare linseed in it, and make from it a linseed circle according to the quantity that contains Axirnath from all parts.
Deinde pone eum super eam, et preme cum digitis tuis ab omni parte, ut aggregetur Axirnath in medio circuli.	Then place it on top and press with your fingers all around, so that Axirnath gathers together in the middle of the circle.
Deinde finde in medio illius humiditatis cum spatumili incidente fissuras per latitudinem, et non sit fissura maior illa quae fit in phlebotomia in profundo.	Then find in the middle of that moisture with a spatula, making incisions by length, and let no incision be deeper than that made in phlebotomy.
Aut oportet ut findas cutem totam, donec peruenias ad Axirnath in pluribus enim dispositionibus procedit Axirnath ex fissura secundum formam frusti pinguedinis albae.	Or it is necessary to make a cut all the way through until you reach Axirnath, because Axirnath proceeds from the incision in various forms according to the shape of white fatty residue.
Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.	Therefore, extract it with the cloth you infiltrated between your fingers to the outside: and then turn your hand to the right and left until it spreads out: and beware, lest you add to the incision, so that you do not reach with a spatula to the eye and hurt it.
Si autem non appareat tibi Axirnath in principio fissurae, tu addas in fissura parum cum facilitate, donec procedat Axirnath.	But if Axirnath does not appear to you at the beginning of the incision, you should add a little to the incision with ease until Axirnath proceeds.
Deinde extrahe eam, sicut diximus.	Then extract it as we said.
Deinde submerge pannos in aceto et aqua, et pone eos super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis.	Then immerse the cloths in vinegar and water, and place them on the spot, and bind it with stitches.
Et ex hominibus sunt qui terunt salem, et ponunt ipsum in concauitate fissurae, ut liquefiat quod remansit ex illa humiditate.	And from people there are who sprinkle salt, and place it in the hollow of the incision, so that what remains of that moisture may dissolve.
Deinde cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it until it heals.
Si autem accidat in loco apostema calidum, tune cura ipsum cum emplastris sedatiuis, donec sanetur.	If however an abscess arises warm at the place, then treat it with soothing poultices until it heals.
¶ De modis Ataxmir oculi, id est, cum palpebra mollificatur oculi, unde fit ut rugetur sicut non debet.	Of the modes of Ataxmir for the eye, that is, when the eyelid becomes soft and the eye blinks, which should not happen.
Caput XI.	Head XI.
Quando nascuntur in palpebris oculi pili additi praeter cursum sub pilis naturalibus, et antiquantur: tunc ipsi nocent oculo, et faciunt accidere modos aegritudinum, sicut lachrymas assiduas, et mollificationem palpebrarum, et albuginem, donec fit illud caussa destructionis oculi.	When hairs grow on the eyelids of the eye in addition to their natural course and become old: then they harm the eye and cause various forms of sickness, such as constant tears, softening of the eyelids, and whitening, until it becomes a cause for the destruction of the eye.
Et Ataxmir quidem oculi curatur secundum quatuor modos.	And the eye of Ataxmir is cured according to four modes.
Aut per cauterium cum igne.	Or by cauterization with fire.
Aut cum medicina acuta, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo cauterii.	Or with sharp medicine, according to what has been mentioned previously in the chapter on cauterizing.
Aut curatur Ataxmir per incisionem et suturam.	Or Ataxmir is cured by incision and stitching.
Aut per cannas, secundum quod ego dicam.	Or with reeds, according to what I shall say.
Oportet ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	It is necessary that you place the head of the sick person on your shoulder.
Deinde conuerte palpebram oculi manu tua sinistra.	Then turn the eyelid with your left hand.
Si ergo conuertitur, bonum est.	If it is turned, it is good.
Et si non: intromitte acum in eam, in qua sit filum ab inferiori parte palpebrae, et fac penetrare acum cum filo desuper, et sit illud prope pilos ipsos, id est, prope marginem palpebrae, in quo nascuntur pili: et trahe filum ad superiora cum palpebra, et conuerte eam cum radio.	And if not: introduce a needle into it, in which the thread is from the lower part of the eyelid, and make the needle penetrate with the thread above, and let that be near the hairs themselves, that is, near the margin of the eyelid where the hairs grow: and draw the thread up to the upper part with the eyelid, and turn it with a rod.
Deinde finde in interiori parte palpebrae sub pilis additis cum spatumili incidente a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus.	Then find in the inner part of the eyelid, under the added hairs, with a spatula coming from the larger tear duct to the smaller one.
Deinde extrahe filum, et pone sub palpebra puluillum paruum ex cotto, aut panno: deinde signa super palpebram cum encaustro, quod sit sicut figura folii myrti.	Then draw out the thread and place a small poultice of bread or cloth under the eyelid; then mark above the eyelid with wax, so that it is like the figure of a myrtle leaf.
Verumtamen oportet, ut fit figura secundum quantitatem et eleuationem palpebrae: quoniam iam diuersificatur illud in hominibus.	However, it is necessary that the figure be made according to the size and elevation of the eyelid; for that already varies among people.
Ex eis enim est, qui indiget ut incidatur ex palpebra quantitas magna, secundum quantitatem quae mollificatur a palpebra.	For some of these people are in need of having the eyelid incised to remove a large quantity, according to the softness that comes from the eyelid.
Deinde cum spatumili finde super duas lineas quas signasti, et incipe a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus, et sit fissura una prope pilos naturales, sicut est grossitudo radii.	Then with the spatula find above the two lines you marked, and begin from the larger tear duct to the smaller one, and let the incision be one near the natural hairs, just like the thickness of a rod.
Deinde intromitte uncinum in uno duorum angulorum cutis.	Then introduce a hook into one of the two corners of the skin.
Deinde excoria ipsam totam.	Then strip off the whole skin.
Deinde aggrega cum sutura duo labia, cum acu et filo lana subtili: et absterge sanguinem, et fac adhaerere quod superfluit ex filis super duo supercilia, cum quibusdam rebus inuiscantibus, si uis facere illud: et si non, non cures.	Then gather together two flaps with a suture, using a needle and fine wool thread. And wipe away the blood, and make what overflows stick to the threads on top of the two eyebrows; if you want to do that; and if not, don't bother.
Deinde dimitte suturam et fila usque ad tres dies, aut quatuor: postea cura illud.	Then leave the suture and threads for three days or four: afterwards care for it.
Et si uis, dimitte uulnus absque sutura, et cura ipsum cum eo, quod exsiccat et constringit.	And if you wish, leave the wound without a suture and take care of it in such a way that it dries out and tightens.
Nam palpebra eleuatur apud sigillationem uulneris et aggregationem eius: sed futura est melior.	For the eyelid is elevated above the wound's suturing and its accumulation; but it will be better.
Hunc modum curandi Ataxmir docuerunt antiqui.	The ancient ones taught this method of healing to Azemar.
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.	However, there is concern for the weak person, and it comes from good practice, and there is no fear in that.
Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est, ut signes super palpebram figuram, quae sit sicut figura folii myrti, sicut narrauimus.	And another method is also in Azemar, and it is to make signs on the eyelid like the shape of a myrtle leaf, as we have narrated.
Deinde eleua palpebram cum tribus uncinis separatis, aut aggregatis, secundum formam hanc quae sequitur, deinde incide quod superfluit cum forficibus paruis, secundum hanc formam, cum aequalitate incisionis.	Then lift the eyelid with three separate or connected hooks, according to this following shape, then cut off what overflows with small scissors, according to this shape, with equal incision.
Si autem non est tibi possibile tenere uncinum, et non aequatur illud: tunc accipe acum in qua sit filum, et intromitte ipsum in medio figurae: et intromitte filum aliud prope lachrymale maius, et filum secundum prope lachrymale minus: et aggrega inter digitos tuos fila cum aequalitate.	But if it is not possible for you to hold the hook and it does not match up: then take a needle with thread and insert it into the middle of the shape; and insert another thread near the larger tear duct, and another thread near the smaller tear duct: and tie the threads together between your fingers with equality.
Deinde eleua manum tuam eleuatione aequali: et eleua cutem super quam est signatum cotum, sicut narrauimus.	Then lift up your hand with equal elevation; and lift up the skin above which is marked out, as we have narrated.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then gather together the two flaps of the wound with a suture; and care for it until it heals.
Si uero accidat apostema apud incisionem tuam, aut fissuram tuam: seda illud apostema cum caeroto, et his similibus, ex unguentis sedantibus.	If however an abscess occurs at your incision or cut, but treat it with a poultice and similar remedies from ointments that soothe.
Et quandoque accidit palpebrae etiam, ut conuertantur pili eius.	And when it happens that the eyelashes even turn around its hairs.
Oportet ergo ut utaris in ea quod diximus in incisione: sed sutura utrisque magis est artificialis.	Therefore, you should use what we said for incising, but for sewing both parts together, it is more artificial.
¶ De cura Ataxmir cum cannis.	On the treatment of Ataxmir with a reed.
ET Est, ut conuertas palpebram, et scindas fissuram quae est deintus, secundum quod narraui.	And you should turn the eyelid and cut the cleft that is inside, as I have described.
Deinde arte fac duas cannas, aut duo ligna subtilia: quarum longitudo sit secundum longitudinem palpebrae, et latitudo earum sit minor latitudine spatumilis: et tu iam incidisti in extremitatibus utriusque ab utrisque partibus ubi tenes fila.	Then make two reeds or two thin sticks, whose length is according to the length of the eyelid, and their width is less than the width of a small splinter: and you have already incised at the ends of each one on both sides where you hold the threads.
Deinde aggrega utramque cum subtilitate super illud quod superfluit ex palpebra oculi, et stringe duas cannas ab utrisque partibus strictura forti, et dimitte eam diebus aliquot.	Then gather both of them together with delicacy over the excess that protrudes from the eyelid of the eye, and bind the two reeds tightly on both sides with strong stitching, and leave it for several days.
Cutis enim stricta morietur, et denigrabitur, et putrefiet, donec cadet per se.	For a tight skin will die, become blackened, and putrid until it falls away by itself.
Si ergo tardatur, tunc incide eam cum forficibus.	If then it is delayed, then cut it with forceps.
Deinde cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals.
Cum ergo consolidatur, eleuatur palpebra: et non pungunt pili.	When then it is consolidated, the eyelid will lift up: and the hairs will not sting.
Et haec est forma duarum cannarum, quas facies secundum hanc figuram, et quantitatem in longitudinem et latitudinem.	And this is the form of two reeds which you should make according to this figure and size in length and width.
¶ De eleuatione pilorum pungentium in oculo cum acu.	On the elevation of stinging hairs in the eye with a needle.
Caput XII.	Chapter XII.
Operatio in illo est, ut accipias acum subtilem, et intromittas in eam filum ex serico subtile, lene.	The operation is this: you should take a fine needle and insert into it a thread of silk that is fine and soft.
Deinde aggreges extremitates eius, et nodes utramque nodo subtili ualde: et sit longitudo filorum palmus unus.	Then gather up the ends of it and tie each one with a knot very thin: and let the length of the threads be one palm.
Deinde compone in Alinxotati filum aliud subtile sub eo in breui, et noda extremitates eius si uis.	Then place another fine thread beneath it in a short space, and tie up its ends if you wish.
Deinde ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo, et sit prope solem ut declaretur operatio: quoniam est operatio subtilis, uel minuta.	Then let the patient place his head on your shoulder and be near the sun as the operation is performed: for it is a subtle or minute operation.
Deinde intromitte acum cum alinxotati in radicem palpebrae, et fac eam penetrare in palpebram festinanter, donec extrahas eam desuper pilum naturalem.	Then introduce the point with the spatula into the root of the eyelid, and make it penetrate quickly into the eyelid until you withdraw it from above the natural hair.
Deinde trahe pilum usque supra alinxotati: et intromitte in alinxotati illum pilum: si est unus, aut duo, aut tres, non plures.	Then pull out the hair up to the spatula: and introduce into the spatula that hair: if it is one, or two, or three, not more.
Deinde trahe manum tuam cum eo, donec egrediatur pilus cum alinxotati in palpebra cum pilo naturali.	Then pull your hand with him until the hair goes out with the spatula into the eyelid with the natural hair.
Si autem trahatur alinxotati, et non egrediatur pilus cum ea: trahes alinxotati ad inferiora, cum filo quod tu composuisti in ea, donec egrediatur alinxotati ex foramine superiori, et uideas eam uisione oculi: tunc enim trahes alinxotati, et filum: et extrahe utraque, et claude oculum: et dimitte ipsum clausum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec adhaereat pilus loco suo, et nascatur super ipsum caro.	But if the spatula is pulled and the hair does not come out with it: pull the spatula downwards, along with the thread that you have tied in it, until the spatula comes out from the upper opening, and you see it with the vision of your eye: then indeed pull the spatula and the thread: and draw both out, and shut the eye: and let it be closed for two days, or three, until the hair adheres to its place, and flesh grows over it.
Quod si pilus est breuis, tunc aut associa ei pilum longum ex pilis naturalibus, et eleuatur cum eo: aut dimitte ipsum, donec elongetur post spacium, et tunc eleua ipsum.	But if the hair is short, then either join to it a long hair from the natural hairs, and raise it with it: or let it go, until it grows longer after some time, and then raise it.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae accidit in palpebra superiori.	Of the care of Alxatratia that occurs on the upper eyelid.
Caput XIII.	Chapter 13.
Quando accidit oculo haec Alxatrati, nominatur Leporina.	When this Alxatratia occurs in the eye, it is called Leporina.
Et haec Alxatrati est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And this Alxatratia is either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis ergo fit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et similium illis.	Therefore the accidental one occurs from the consolidation of a wound, or incision, or cauterization, and similar things.
Et modus operationis in ea est, ut tu findas illam consolidationem, et ut separes labia eius, et ponas in eo quod est inter ea licinium ex lino, et liges eam, donec sanetur.	And the method of treatment for it is, that you open up the consolidation, and separate its edges, and place a linen thread in between them, and bind it, until it heals.
Et non oportet, ut utaris in curatione eius rebus quae exiccant et constringunt: nam si tu facis illud, redit Alxatrati deterior quam fuit: imo utere in ea rebus quae mollificant, sicut foenumgraecum: et embroca cum aqua, in qua cocta sit althea, semen lini: et unguento dyaquilon, quod liquefactum sit cum aliquo ex oleis: et inuolue cum eo licinium, et cura cum eo.	And it is not necessary to use things that dry and constrict in the treatment of him, for if you do that, Al-Khatri will return worse than he was. Instead, use things that soften, such as Greek hay: and smear with water in which althea has been cooked, flax seed; and anoint with dyaquilon ointment, which is mixed with some oil; and wrap him up with it and care for him with it.
Et thesaurus curationis tuae est, ut coneris omni ingenio, ut non consolidetur, secundum formam quae fuit in primis.	And your treasury of cure is to strive with all skill so that nothing may harden, according to the shape it had at first.
Et haec quidem operatio quam diximus, non est nisi quaedam rectificatio Alxatrati, ut non redeat forma loci secundum quod fuit omnino.	And this operation we mentioned is nothing other than a correction of Al-Khatri so that he does not return to his former form.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae fit in palpebra inferiori, et est rugatio uel contractio sursum ad dextrum et sinistrum.	On the cure of Al-Khatri which is done on the lower eyelid, and it is a wrinkling or contracting upwards to the right and left.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter XIV.
Haec Alxatrati quae fit inferius, est quae uere nominatur Alxatrati.	This which is done below is truly called Al-Khatri.
Et est naturalis, et est accidentalis.	And it is natural and accidental.
Et accidentalis fit ex uulnere, aut fissura, aut cauterio, et illis similibus.	And the accidental one arises from a wound, or incision, or cauterization, and similar things.
Et uia operationis in ea est, ut accipias acum, in qua sit filum duplum, et tingas eam in carnem, et facias eam penetrare a lachrymali sinistro usque ad lachrymale dextrum, donec perueniat filum in duabus extremitatibus carnis.	And the method of operation in this case is to take a needle with a double thread, and dye it in flesh, and make it pass from the left tear duct to the right tear duct, until the thread reaches both ends of the skin.
Deinde extende carnem ad superiora cum acu, et incide eam cum spatumili lato.	Then stretch the skin upwards with the needle, and cut it with a broad spatula.
Si ergo redit figura palpebrae secundum quod oportet, est bonum.	If then the shape of the eyelid returns as it should be, it is good.
Et si non, accipe radium, et pone ipsum in fissuram, et conuerte cum eo palpebram: et finde duas fissuras in latere interiore palpebrae, et sint extremitates duarum fissurarum ex duobus angulis incisionis, donec concurrant et fiat ex eis angulus: donec quando aggregantur fiat figura earum haec figura, et est litera lauda graeca.	And if not, take a radius and place it in the incision, and turn with it the eyelid; and make two incisions on the inner side of the eyelid, and they should be at the ends of two fissures from the two angles of the incision, until they meet and form an angle: until when they are gathered together this figure is formed, and it is the Greek letter lambda.
Deinde aufer illam carnem per quantitatem, quod est latus eius acutum inferius, ab eo quod sequitur palpebram.	Then remove that flesh by the quantity of what is its sharp side below, from what follows the eyebrow.
Deinde aggrega partes separatas: sue eam cum filo lanae.	Then gather up the separated parts; or bind it with a thread of wool.
Deinde cura eas cum eo quod diximus, de medicinis mollificantibus, et liciniis, donec sanentur.	Then care for them with what we mentioned, soothing medicines and lotions, until they heal.
Et si Alxatrati accidat ex fissura, et sutura, aut cauterio: tunc oportet ut findas fissura plana sub pilis palpebrarum, etiam secundum quod praecessit.	And if a cut or incision occurs from a laceration, or suture, or cauterization: then it is necessary to open up the flat area under the eyelashes, even according to what has gone before.
Deinde separa inter duo labia cum licinio, secundum quod diximus.	Then separate the two lips with a lotion, according to what we said.
Et summa sermonis de cura Alxatrati, quando est desuper, aut inferius, est, ut currat in ea operatio, secundum quod praeparatur ex forma Alxatrati.	And the summary of the discourse on curing an Alxatra, whether it is above or below, is that the operation should proceed according to how it was prepared from the form of an Alxatra.
Ipsa namque est multarum diuersitatum in forma: et artifex prudens praeparat ingenium cum quocunque modo est possibile ei, donec redire faciat figuram ad formam naturalem, aut prope eam, et ipsemet infirmus, secundum quod conuenit ei ex operatione et instrumentis in plurimis dispositionibus.	For it is indeed a multiple variety of forms: and the skilled artist prepares his mind with whatever means are possible to him, until he makes return the figure to its natural form, or nearly so, and even the infirm person, according to what suits him from the operation and instruments in many dispositions.
¶ De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.	About adhering eyelids with conjunctiva or cornea.
Caput XV.	Chapter 15.
Quandoque accidit haec consolidatio multis hominibus, ita ut consolidetur palpebra superior cum albedine oculi, et prohibeat ipsum ab operationibus suis naturalibus.	Sometimes this consolidation occurs in many people, so that the upper eyelid becomes consolidated with the white of the eye and prevents it from performing its natural functions.
Oportet ergo quod intromittas extremitatem radii sub palpebra, et eleues eam sursum: aut extendas eam cum uncino: deinde incide adhaerentiam cum spatumili subtili, quod non sit cum acuitate incisionis spatumilium, imo sit obtusum parumper: ut non inquietetur infirmus apud operationem, et remoueatur spatumile, et laedat oculum cum acuitate sua: et sit incisio tua quasi tu excories illam adhaerentiam cum facilitate, donec quando redit palpebra secundum formam suam naturalem, et sanetur adhaerentia tota.	Therefore it is necessary to insert the end of the radius under the eyelid and lift it up; or stretch it with a hook: then cut through the adhesion with a thin spatula, which should not be sharp with an acute incision, but rather blunt for a moment: so that the infirm person does not become disturbed during the operation, and the spatula is removed, and the eye is hurt by its sharpness: and your incision should be as if you were removing that adhesion with ease, until when the eyelid returns to its natural form, and the adhesion is healed entirely.
Funde tunc in oculum aquam salsam, cum aqua ablue ipsum: aut distilla in ipsum ex sief facto, ex ziniar dissoluto cum aqua.	Apply then salted water to the eye, washing it clean with water. Or let it drip into it from a sieve made from something like this, after dissolving zinc with water.
Deinde separa inter palpebram et oculum cum licinio lini: et pone super oculum lanam infusam cum albugine oui: et post diem tertium utere sief, et cum solidatiuis, donec sanetur.	Then separate the eyelid from the eye with a linen cloth: and place a woolen cloth infused with egg whites over the eye: and after three days, use a poultice, and with solidified matters, until it heals.
¶ De incisione ungulae et eminentiae carnis lachrymarum.	On the cutting of the nail and the excrescence of tear-producing flesh.
Caput XVI.	Chapter 16.
Scias, quod ungula est secundum duos modos.	Know that a nail is according to two modes.
Aut est neruosa: et est similis sifac duro, subtili.	Or it is nerve-like and is similar to silk, hard and fine.
Aut est non neruosa, similis humiditati congelatae albae: quae quando tangit cam ferrum, aut conaris capere eam cum uncino, abscinditur, et non figitur in ea uncinus.	Or it is not nerve-like, similar to frozen white moisture: which when touched with iron or is taken up with forceps, it is cut off and does not stick to the forceps.
Et utraeque species non incipiunt, nisi a lachrymali maiore, usquequo uadit paulatim, donec cooperit uisum, et prohibet lumen, et motum oculi.	And both kinds do not begin to grow unless from the major tear-producing flesh, until it gradually spreads and covers the visible part, and prevents light and movement of the eye.
Et modus operandi in incisione eius est: ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the method for cutting it is: that the patient places his head in your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et eleua palpebram manu tua.	Then open his eyes and lift up his eyelid with your hand.
Deinde collige ungulam cum uncino paucae duplationis, et extende eam ad superiora.	Then take the nail with forceps of a few foldings, and stretch it upwards.
Deinde accipe acum, et intromitte in eam pilum ex pilis equi, et bouis, aut uaccae: et sit filum forte, et duplica extremitatem acus parumper, et fige eam in medio ungulae: et penetra eam cum acu, et liga cum filo ungulam, et extende eam ad superiora: et excoria cum pilo latus ungulae quod sequitur pupillam, ac si tu serres eam cum pilo usque ad postreimnum eius.	Then take a needle and insert it into the nail with a horse's or cow's hair, and make the thread strong and double the end of the needle for a little bit, and fix it in the middle of the nail: and pierce it with the needle and tie the nail with the thread, and stretch it upwards: and scrape off with the hair the side of the nail that follows the pupil, as if you were to gather it up with the hair until its end.
Deinde incide residuum in radice lachrymalis cum spatumili subtili, aut cum forficibus paruis: et dimitte carnem lachrymalis naturalem, ut non accidat ex incisione eius cursus lachrymarum assiduus.	Then cut off the remaining part at the root of the tear-producing flesh with a thin spatula or small forceps: and leave the natural tear-producing flesh, so that there is no risk of an unending flow of tears from the incision.
Et quandoque extenditur ungula cum uncino solo: aut cum filo, sicut diximus.	And when the claw is stretched with a single hook alone; or with a thread, as we said.
Deinde excoriatur cum spatumili leni, cuius haec est forma.	Then it should be peeled with a gentle file, whose shape this is.
Et caue, ne tangat spatumile tunicam corneam, et accidat in ea ruptura, et perforetur pupilla.	And beware, lest the file touch the horned coat and a tear occur in it, and the pupil be pierced.
Deinde post incisionem, proice in oculum aliquid salis contriti, aut ex sief facto ex ziniar, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then after making an incision, pour something crushed salt into the eye or make it from zinar, and let it remain until another day.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur.	Then take care of it with what is necessary until it heals.
Quod si ungula est non neruosa, et non potes intromittere in eam acum, neque figitur in ea uncinus, tunc multotiens curatur haec species ungulae cum medicinis, et sanatur sicut narraui in diuisione.	But if the claw is not inflamed and you cannot insert a needle into it, nor can a hook be fixed to it, then this type of claw is often treated with medicines and heals as I described in the division.
Quod si uis incidere eam, tunc aperi oculum infirmi, et accipe spatumile subtile, lene, debilis acuitatis, secundum hanc formam.	But if you wish to cut it, then open the patient's eye and take a gentle, soft, weak file with fine sharpness, in this shape.
Et rade ungulam desuper rasione cum subtilitate.	And gently scrape the claw above with subtlety.
Quod si uides quod ipsa rarificatur et confringitur, et imprimit in eam rasio, tunc distilla ex hora tua in oculum ex sief facto ex ziniar, aut ex sief rubeo, aut sale trito: et opila oculum usque ad diem alium.	And if you see that it is becoming thinner and breaking apart, and a file is impressed on it, then pour from your hour-glass into the eye made from zinar, or red powder, or crushed salt: and cover the eye until another day.
Deinde itera super ipsam operationem, donec remoueatur totum eius.	Then repeat this same operation over it, until all of it is removed.
Nisi contrarium sit tibi in oculo apostema calidum: tunc enim dimitte ipsam, et cura apostema, donec sanetur.	Unless there is a contrary swelling in the eye, a warm one; then leave it alone and cure the swelling until it heals.
Deinde itera operationem super ipsam cum rasione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the operation over it with a file, until it heals.
Eminentia autem carnis lachrymalis, si nocet in oculo nocumento magno, suspendatur cum uncino, et incide ex ea partem eius: et non ultimes incisionem, ut non accidat cursus lachrymarum.	However, the excess of the tear duct flesh, if it causes great harm in the eye, should be suspended with a hook and cut off from that part; and do not stop cutting until no more tears flow.
Deinde stilla in lachrymale sief rubeum, aut factum ex ziniari, donec sanetur.	Then pour into the tear duct red powder or made from zinar, until it heals.
¶ De incisione Alguardenic, et carne nata in oculo.	About the incision of Alguardenic, and flesh born in the eye.
Caput XVII.	Chapter Seventeen.
Nascitur quandoque in quibusdam oculis hominum caro rubea composita, uel superposita, donec cooperit pupillam, aut appropinquat, aut stringit super palpebras, et fortasse conuertit palpebras ad exteriora: et assimilatur rosae balaustinae.	Sometimes in certain human eyes, a red flesh is formed, either composed or superimposed, until it covers the pupil, approaches it, or stretches over the eyelids, and perhaps turns the eyelids outward: and it resembles a rose hedge.
Et operatio in ea etiam est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the operation in that case is also to place the patient's head on your shoulder.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et collige illam carnem totam cum uncinis conuenientibus ad illud: et tene illud cum forcipe uno, aut gesti.	Then open his eyes and collect all that flesh with suitable forceps for it; and hold it with one forceps or gesture.
Deinde incide carnem in primis, donec finiatur totum eius cum incisorio.	Then cut the flesh first, until you have completed the entire thing with a cutting instrument.
Et caue ab oculo, ut non laedas ipsum apud operationem: et sit incisio tua qua ipsam incidis, aut cum spatumili, quod narrauimus in incisione ungulae: aut cum forficibus paruis, cum quibus colligitur asebel, secundum quod ueniet forma eius post hoc capitulum.	And beware of the eye during the operation, lest you harm it; and let your incision be such as you make it with or with a spatula, which we described in the incision of the toenail: or with small forceps, with which the flesh is collected, according to its shape after this chapter.
Cum ergo completur incisio tua, et remouetur tota alguardenici, tunc imple oculum ex sale contrito: aut distilla in eum puluerem rubeum, et similia illi ex medicinis corrosiuis: et pone super oculum deforis cottum cum albugine oui: ut securetur ab apostemate calido.	When your incision is complete and the entire Alguardenic is removed, then fill the eye with crushed salt: or distill red powder into it, and similar substances from corrosive medicines: and place a poultice with egg white outside the eye to secure it against warm aposthema.
Quod si remanet ex alguardenici aliquid, et dominatur tibi sanguis calidus, et times apostema calidum: tunc dimitte oculum, et cura ipsum cum eo quod sedat apostema.	If anything remains of the Alguardenic and a warm blood dominates over you, and you fear a warm aposthema: then leave the eye alone and care for it with that which settles apostema.
Deinde itera super ipsum cum operatione, donec sanetur.	Then go back to it with an operation until it heals.
Et similiter fac cum carne addita quae accidit in oculo ex hac specie.	And do the same for the additional flesh that occurs in the eye of this kind.
Verumtamen oportet, ut alienes curationem omnis oculi debilis ex uia naturali, aut ex uia accidentali, operando cum ferro: et non intromittas manum tuam in aliqua harum operationum, donec uideas, quod illud membrum est tolerans illam operationem.	However, it is necessary that you cure all weak eyes by way of nature or accident, operating with iron: and do not insert your hand into any of these operations until you see that the member is bearing with that operation.
¶ De collectione Sebel ex oculo.	Concerning the collection of pus from an eye.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter 18.
Sebel sunt uenae rubeae quae texuntur super oculum, et prohibent uisui operationem suam: et debilitant oculum cum longitudine dierum.	Pus is a red vein which forms over the eye and prevents its natural function; and it weakens the eye with the passing of days.
Necesse est ergo tibi in primis, ut consideres, si oculus in quo est Sebel, est fortis, et non est in eo aegritudo aliqua, praeter Sebel: tunc collige Sebel eius.	Therefore it is necessary for you to consider first whether the eye in which there is pus is strong and there is no other disease in it except the pus; then collect its pus.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo.	And that you should instruct the weak person to place their head on your shoulder.
Deinde suspende illas uenas cum uncino uno, aut duobus secundum prudentiam tuam: et sit uncinus subtilis duplationis, secundum hanc formam, aut sint duo uncini gradat in corpore uno, secundum hanc formam.	Then suspend those veins with a single hook or two, according to your prudence; and the hook should be fine and doubled, like this, or there should be two hooks placed one on top of the other in the same body, like this.
Deinde collige cum forficibus subtilibus illas uenas cum subtilitate, et absterge sanguinem hora post horam, donec uideas illas uenas remoueri ex oculo, et resoluuntur: et caue ne laedas oculum cum extremitatibus spatumilis.	Then collect those veins with fine forceps, with subtlety, and wipe away the blood an hour after the hour, until you see those veins being removed from the eye, and resolving; and beware that you do not hurt the eye with the outer edges of the forceps.
Et sit operatio tua in meridie coram sole, et sis firmus in operatione tua ualde: ut non incidas nisi illas uenas.	And let your operation be at midday before the sun, and be very firm in your operation; so that you do not cut except those veins.
Et cum tu expleueris, tunc distilla in oculum sief uiride, aut rubeum: ut sua acuitate corrodat quod remansit ex sebel.	And when you have finished, then distill into the eye whether green or red; so that its sharpness eats away what remains of the pus.
Si autem non est tibi possibile colligere illud totum in illa hora, tunc emplastra oculum cum eo, quod sedat dolorem oculi: et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur dolor eius: et securetur ab apostemate calido: deinde itera super ipsum secundum modum eundem, donec sanetur.	But if it is not possible for you to collect all of it in that hour, then apply a poultice to the eye with what soothes the pain of the eye; and leave it for several days until the pain subsides: and secure it from hot aposteme: then return to it in the same manner until it heals.
Et haec est forma forficis.	And this is the form of forceps.
¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.	Concerning the reduction of a swollen eyelid to the nose.
Caput XIX.	Chapter 19.
Nominant medici Arissati Fistulam, quam curas cum cauterio, aut cum medicina acuta comburente, secundum quod praecessit eius narratio.	Physicians call the swelling Arissatis a Fistula, which they treat with caustic or burning medicine, as their narrative preceded.
Et si non sanatur, tunc non est ingenium in ea: nisi ut findas super apostema apud natiuitatem eius, et extrahas totam humiditatem quae est in eo et pus, donec detegatur os.	And if it does not heal, then there is no skill in it: unless you make an incision over the abscess at its birth and remove all the moisture that is in it and the pus, until the bone is laid bare.
Cum ergo detegitur os, et uides in eo corruptionem, aut nigredinem, tunc rade ipsum cum instrumento, cuius forma est haec.	When therefore the bone is laid bare, and you see corruption or blackening in it, then scrape it off with an instrument whose shape is this.
Et nominatur Asperi capitis.	And it is called a "scalpel" of the head.
Fiat ex ferro indo, et sit caput eius rotundum sicut azir, quod sit punctatum punctatione limae, aut punctatione aliskilferi punctatione subtili: et pone ipsum super locum corruptum ossis.	Make it from tempered steel, and let the head of it be rounded like a razor, which should be marked with a shaving or an Aliskiferian point, that is, a fine point: and place it over the corrupted bone.
Deinde reuolue ipsum inter digitos tuos, et tu preme manum tuam parumper, donec scias quod illa corruptio iam rasa est: et fac illud aliquotiens.	Then turn it back between your fingers and press your hand on it for a little while, until you know that the corruption is now scraped away; and do this several times.
Deinde restaura locum cum medicinis exiccatiuis stipticis.	Then restore the place with medicinal applications of drying and stinging substances.
Si ergo consolidatur locus, et nascitur in eo caro, et abscinditur cursus saniei: et remanet quadraginta diebus, et non renouatur, et non apostematur, et non accidit in eo accidens: tunc scias quia iam sanatus est.	If therefore the place is consolidated, and flesh grows in it, and the course of healing proceeds smoothly: and it remains for forty days, and does not renew itself, nor does it apostemate, nor does any accident happen to it: then you will know that it has already been healed.
Et si non, tunc non est in eo ingenium, nisi reducere fistulam ad foramen nasi, secundum hanc formam.	And if not, then there is no skill in it, unless you reduce the abscess to a nostril's opening, according to this shape.
Et est, ut detegas ab osse secundo cum ferro, aut cum medicina acuta: et cum detectum est os, tunc accipe terebrum secundum hanc formam, sit extremitas ferrea, triangulata: et lignum eius sit pyramis extenuata usque ad extremitatem, sicut uides.	And it is, as you uncover the bone with a second iron or sharp medicine: and when the bone is uncovered, then take the drill according to this shape, having an iron tip, triangular: and the wood of it should be tapered like a pyramid down to the extremity, just as you see.
Deinde pone illud super os ipsum: et sit illud prope lachrymale: et elonga manum tuam ab oculo parum.	Then place that over the bone itself: and let it be near the lacrimal [tear duct]: and stretch your hand a little away from the eye.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum terebro, donec penetret os, et sentiat illud infirmus: per hoc quod inuenit uentum exire ex eo, quando tenet manum suam super nasum suum.	Then turn your hand with the drill, until it penetrates the bone and feels weak to him: because of this that he finds air coming out from it, when he holds his hand over his nose.
Ergo tunc restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis exiccantibus, sicut docui te.	So then restore the place with drying medicines, as I taught you.
Cum ergo nascitur caro, et induratur locus: tunc materia quae effundebatur ad exteriora, redit ad nasum: est ergo leuius illud super infirmum.	When therefore the flesh is formed and the place becomes hardened: then the material that was flowing outward returns to the nose: it is therefore lighter above the weak person.
¶ De reductione eminentiae Oculi.	The Reduction of a Swelling of the Eye.
Caput XX.	Chapter 20.
Quando eminet Oculus cum totalitate sua, et non accidit in uisu nocumentum, neque diminutio: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum: deinde phlebotomes eum: postea ponas uentosas in ceruice absque scarificatione, sed cum suctione.	When the eye swells up with its entire contents and does not cause harm to vision or diminution: then you should let the patient rest: afterwards bleed him: then apply poultices on the neck without scarifying, but with suction.
Deinde pone super Oculum linimentum quod fit ex acacia, et aloe, et olibano, et sarcocolla.	Then place over the eye an ointment made from acacia, and aloe, and aloes, and sarsaparilla.
Deinde stringe Oculum desuper super emplastrum cum puluillis multis.	Then bind the eye with many poultices above the plaster.
Et modus puluillorum est: ut accipias pannos lenes, multos, et duplicetur omnis pannus ex eis super quatuor: fac ex eis multos: deinde pone eos unum super alium, secundum quantitatem qua indiget Oculus: deinde stringe super ipsos cum panno duro strictura forti.	And the method of poultices is: take soft cloths, many, and double each cloth from them over four. Make many of these. Then place one on top of another, according to the quantity that the eye needs. Then bind above them with a strong and tight bandage.
Et itera uentosas cum suctione sine scarificatione.	And repeat poultices with suction without scarifying.
Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.	Then remove the poultices and leave the eye bound tight day and night.
Si autem ligamentum iterum mollificatur, tunc oportet ut stringatur multum: deinde aufer ligamentum post diem et noctem, sicut diximus.	But if the bandage becomes soft again, then you should rebind it tightly. Then remove the bandage after a day and night, as we said.
Si ergo uides oculum iam redisse uuae tunicae, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam, et uentosas, donec sanetur.	If then you see the eye has returned to its natural state, that's good. And if not, then repeat the plaster, poultices, binding, and poultices until it heals.
¶ De incisionie Vuae tunicae.	The Incision of the Eyelid Tunic.
Caput XXI.	Chapter 21.
Quando accidit disruptio in tunica Vuea, deinde eminet et procedit extra palpebras sicut granum Vuae, et foedatur forma hominis propter illud, et uis incidere illud: tunc operatio in eo est, secundum quod narro: et est, ut intromittas acum in radice Vuae ab inferiori ad superiorem partem.	When a disruption occurs in the eyelid tunic, and then it swells up and progresses outside the eyelids like a grain of sand, and disfigures the face of man because of it, and sight threatens to be affected by it: then the operation in this case is as I shall tell you, and it is, that you should introduce an instrument into the root of the eyelid from the lower to the upper part.
Deinde intromitte acum aliam in qua sit filum duplum a parte lachrymalis, et fac eam penetrare: et dimitte acum primam secundum dispositionem suam.	Then insert another needle into which is a thread double from the part of the tear-duct, and make it penetrate. And let the first needle follow its own arrangement.
Deinde incide locum fili dupli, et liga cum eo partem Vuae in circumitu acus: et stringe eam multum.	Then cut the place of the double thread, and tie with it the part of the Vuve (or pouch) around the circumference of the needle, and pull it tight.
Deinde extrahe acum, et pone super oculum lanam infusam in albugine oui: et dimitte eum, donec cadat filum cum Vua.	Then draw out the needle, and place a soaked wool thread above the eye on the white of the eyelid: and let it go until the thread falls with the pouch.
Deinde cura oculum cum eo, quod confortat ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then care for the eye with that which comforts it, until the wound is healed.
Et quandoque stringitur Vua ab omni parte cum circulo ex panno, donec addat oculus eminentiam magnam.	And when the pouch becomes bound with a cloth circle from all parts, until the eye adds a great prominence.
Deinde perforetur cum spatumili subtili, quod perueniat ad profundum oculi, et currat humiditas albuginea, et descendat oculus, et ingrediatur statim: deinde stringe eum, donec sanetur.	Then pierce with a fine spatula that reaches to the depth of the eye, and let the moisture flow through the white, and let the eye descend, and enter immediately: then tie it up until it is healed.
¶ De curatione Alcomnati.	A treatment for Alconmay (presumably a type of eye inflammation or disease).
Caput XXII.	Chapter 22.
Haec Aegritudo quae nominatur Alcomnati, non, est nisi sanies, quae aggregatur in oculo, similis aquae descendenti, et non est ipsa.	This affliction which is called Alconmay is nothing but a discharge that accumulates in the eye, similar to water flowing down, and it is not itself.
Et modus operandi in ea est, ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem praeparatum, uel directum.	And the method of operation in this case is that you make the patient sit on a prepared or straight chair.
Deinde accipe caput eius manibus tuis a partibus duabus, et moue ipsum, donec uideas saniem peruenire ad inferiora oculis tuis.	Then take hold of his head with your hands on both sides, and move him until you see the discharge reach the lower parts of your eyes.
Deinde figatur, et non descendat, et absoluatur lumen: et uideat infirmus res sicut uidebat: et si non descendit inferius, scias quia est aqua.	Then it is fixed and does not flow down, and the light is blocked: and the patient sees things as he used to see them; and if it does not flow below, you will know that it is water.
Si autem non praeparatur descensus saniei cum eo quod diximus, tunc fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas.	If however the discharge does not prepare to flow with what we said, then make the patient sit between your hands.
Deinde accipe spatumile subtile, et finde cum eo supra panniculum corneum parumper apud continuationem coniunctiuae cum tunica cornea in corona, donec egrediatur sanies.	Then take a fine spatula and find it with him above the keratinous cloth for a short time at the junction of the conjunctiva with the cornea on the crown, until the discharge goes out.
Cum ergo egreditur, tunc distilla in oculum aquam calidam in qua miscuisti mel: aut aquam in qua iam bullisti foenumgraecum et mel: deinde curetur cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When it emerges, then pour a warm water mixture of honey into the eye. Alternatively, use water in which you have already boiled Greek chamomile and honey. Then treat it with the remaining treatment until it heals.
¶ De cura aquae, quae descendit in oculo, uel cataracta.	On the cure of the water that descends into the eye, or cataract.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter 23.
Iam Diximus species aquae in diuisione, et quae conuenit ad perforandum sermone declarante et exponente, tunc accipe illud idem secundum sanitatem.	We have already spoken of the kinds of water in division and which is suitable for cutting, as explained and demonstrated by speech. Then receive the same thing according to health.
Tunc ergo oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas quadratum, oppositum lumini, prope solem: et liga oculum eius sanum, et stringe eum ualde: deinde palpebram oculi eius manu tua dextra, si oculus in quo est aqua, est oculus sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then you should make the patient sit between your two hands, opposite the light, near the sun; and bind his good eye with a bandage, and tighten it well. Then grasp the eyelid of his eye with your right hand if the eye with water is the left one: or with your left hand if the right eye has water.
Deinde accipe manu tua dextra almagda, si oculus est sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then take a small piece of amalagma in your right hand if the eye is left: or in your left hand if the eye is right.
Deinde pone extremitatem almagda prope coronam per grossitudinem radii in ipsa albedine oculi apparente lachrymalis minoris: deinde impelle almagda cum uirtute: et tu reuoluis cum eo manum tuam, donec penetret in albuginem oculi: et sentias, quod almagda iam peruenit ad rem uacuam.	Then place the end of the amalagma near the crown of the eye, by the thickness of the apparent white of the smaller tear gland. Then push the amalagma with force and you revolve with it your hand until it penetrates into the cornea of the eye: and feel that the amalagma has already reached the empty space.
Et oportet, ut sit mensura itineris almagda ad profundum, mensura spacii quod est a pupilla usque ad finem nigredinis: et est corona oculi.	And it is necessary that the measure of the distance of the amalagma to the depth be the measure of the space from the pupil to the end of the blackness: and this is the crown of the eye.
Uidebis enim ea in ipsa pupilla uisione oculi, propter claritatem tunicae corneae.	For you will see it in the very center of the pupil's vision, because of the clarity of the corneal membrane.
Deinde pone almagda usque ad locum in quo est aqua.	Then place the amalagma up to the spot where there is water.
Deinde preme ipsum inferius uice una post aliam.	Then press it downward with one stroke after another.
Si ergo descendit aqua statim, tunc infirmus uidet illud super quod aperit uisum suum statim, et almagda in oculo suo.	If then the water descends immediately, then the patient will see that which is above as soon as he opens his sight and the amalagma is in his eye.
Deinde quiescas paululum.	Then pause for a moment.
Si ergo descendat aqua, tunc depone eam secundo, praeter quod egrediatur almagda.	So if water should flow down, then remove it secondly, in addition to which the poultice will issue forth.
Quando ergo figitur, et non ascendit: tunc extrahe almagda cum facilitate: et tu reuoluis manum tuam paulatim.	When therefore it is fixed and does not rise, then remove the poultice with ease, and turn your hand slowly.
Deinde dissolue in aqua aliquid ex sale claro gemmae: et ablue cum eo oculum deintus.	Then dissolve something from clear salt crystals in water, and wash the eye with it afterwards.
Deinde pone extra oculum totum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, et albugine oui: et liga cum eo oculum sanum.	Then place the whole poultice or wool soaked in rose oil on the outside of the eye, and cover it with a thin layer of wax; and bind with that a healthy eye.
Nos autem, et illi qui sunt nostri temporis, ponimus super eum ciminum tritum cum albumine oui.	However, we and those who are of our time put powdered vermilion on top of it with egg white.
Quod si non obedit tibi almagda ad introitum in oculum propter duriciem suam, quoniam ex hominibus est, cuius oculus est durus ualde: tunc oportet ut accipias spatumile, quod nominatur Alberid, cuius haec est forma.	But if the poultice does not obey you and enter the eye because of its hardness, since it is from humans whose eyes are very hard: then it is necessary to take a spatula called Alberid, which has this shape.
Pefora ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctiuam tantum, et non ultimes manum tuam in foramine: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagda locum subtilem.	Therefore use it with the same connection and do not let your hand go into the hole: and there is nothing except that you make a way for the poultice to reach its subtle place.
Deinde intromitte almagda, secundum quod diximus.	Then insert the poultice, according to what we said.
Et apud complementum operis tui, praeparetur infirmo dormitorium decenter factum, in quo dormiat super dorsum suum in domo tenebrosa: et prohibeatur ab omnibus motibus, et a tussi: et pone cibum eius illud quo lenitur natura eius: et non moueat caput suum dextra, neque sinistra omnino.	And as part of the completion of your work, prepare a comfortable bed for the patient in a well-made room, where he will sleep on his back at home; and forbid all movements and coughing from him: and give him food that soothes his nature; and do not let him move his head to the right or left whatsoever.
Et sit ligamentum secundum dispositionem suam usque ad diem tertium.	And let the bandage remain according to its arrangement until the third day.
Deinde solue illud in illa domo tenebrosa, et experire uisum eius: et fac eum uidere res.	Then dissolve it in that dark house and test his sight; and make him see things.
Deinde reduc ligamentum usque ad diem septimum.	Then reduce the bandage to its original state by the seventh day.
Et non oportet ut faciat illud in hora curationis, aut post incisionem statim: imo oportet, ut alienes illud: propterea quod aqua ascendit uelociter per aspectum uehementem.	And it is not necessary to do that during the hour of healing or immediately after the incision: rather, let others do it because water ascends quickly due to a strong and intense vision.
Si autem accidit apostema calidum: tunc oportet ut soluas oculum ante septimum: et rectifica illud cum eo quod sedat apostema, donec sedatur: tunc absolue ipsius uisum, et pone super faciem eius orale quo regatur uisus eius sub eo diebus aliquot, ipso existente in illa domo tenebrosa.	If however a hot abscess occurs: then it is necessary to open the eye before the seventh day: and straighten that with what calms the abscess, until it is calmed: then release his sight, and place over his face an oral medication which will govern his sight under those days for a few, while he exists in that dark house.
Deinde egrediatur a domo gradatim, et conuersetur in casis suis.	Then let him gradually go out of the house and live in his usual quarters.
Et scias, quod in zaltea non excusatur discipulus a uisione aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super operationem.	And know that in seven days not a disciple is exempt from vision sometimes: then he may dare to attempt the operation.
Et iam quidem peruenit ad nos quidam ex illis qui sunt de Alayrach, qui dixit, quod factum fuit in Alayrach magdan perforatum, quo sugitur aqua.	And already it has reached us that someone from those who are from Alayrach said, that in Alayrach a madman had his belly pierced, where water is drawn.
Verum ergo non uidi aliquem in terra uostra, qui fecerit illud: neque legi illud in aliquo ex libris antiquorum: et est possibile, ut sit illud nouum.	Therefore I did not see anyone on your earth who has done that: nor have I read it in any of the ancient books: and it is possible that it is new.
Et istae sunt formae specierum ex magda, ut stet super ea qui ea ignorat.	And these are forms of remedies from madga, so that they may stand over him who does not know them.
Fiant ex aere proprie: et sint extremitates eorum cum hac eadem subtilitate triangulatae, et extremitas acuta.	Let them be made from pure air: and let their extremities be like this same fine triangle, with an acute edge.
Formae magda.	Madga forms.
¶ De cura Carnis natae in naso.	Of the cure of a born flesh on the nose.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter 24.
Quandoque nascuntur in naso Carnes diuersae additae, ex quibus est aliquid quod assimilatur scorpioni multorum pedum: et ex ea est caro cancerosa, lapidea, fusci coloris: et ex ea est quae est caro lenis, non fusci coloris.	Sometimes flesh is born on the nose of diverse kinds, some of which resemble a scorpion with many feet: and from it there is rough skin, stony-like, of a dull color: and from it there is soft flesh, not of a dull color.
In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.	Therefore, since the flesh which is from these kinds of flesh is soft and not deceitful nor cancerous, it is necessary that you make the patient sit between your hands opposite to the sun, and open his nostrils, and insert a needle into those fleshy parts: then pull them outwards, and cut what you have grasped with a fine, sharp instrument from one side, until you know that all the flesh has been removed.
Quod si remaneret aliquid ex ea cuius abscisio non est possibilis: tunc rade illud cum uno instrumentorum subtilium cum facilitate, donec non remaneat ex eo aliquid.	If anything remains from that which is not possible to cut off: then scrape that with one of the subtle instruments with ease, until nothing remains from it.
Si autem sanguis tibi dominatur, aut accidat apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei per id quod oportet: aut est ex apostematibus malignis, tunc propera cauterizando eum, donec abscindatur sanguis, et auferantur omnes carnes.	But if blood dominates you, or a warm abscess occurs: then apply to it what is necessary: or if it's from wicked ulcers, then hasten by cauterizing it, until the blood is cut off and all flesh is removed.
Deinde proiiciatur in nasum post incisionem acetum, et aqua, aut uinum.	Then pour vinegar, water, or wine into the nose after the incision.
Si autem aperitur nasus, et procedat ex eo humiditas usque ad palatum, tunc scias quia iam sanus est.	But if the nose is opened and moisture proceeds from it as far as the palate, then you will know that he is already well.
Si uero non penetrat humiditas, secundum quod oportet, tunc scias quod intra ipsum est caro nata in superioribus ossibus naris, ad quae non peruenit cum incisione instrumentum.	But if moisture does not penetrate as it should, then you will know that inside him is flesh born in the upper bones of the nose, to which the instrument with the incision cannot reach.
Tunc ergo oportet, ut intromittas filum lini cui sit quaedam grossitudo, et noda in eo nodos multos: et pone inter omnem nodum quantitatem digiti, aut minus: et ingeniet infirmus, ut mittat extremitatem unam fili in nasum cum radio, aut cum quo possibile est ei postquam fecerit ipsum simile azer: et trahat odoratum suum, donec perueniat usque ad caassum, et egrediatur super guttur suum.	Then it is necessary that you insert a linen thread with some thickness and knot it in many places: and put between each knot the amount of a finger or less. The weak person should make himself like a worm by sending one end of the thread into the nose with a rod, or with whatever means he can after he has made it similar to an earthworm: and draw out his mucus until it reaches the cavity and flows over his throat.
Et multotiens quidem faciunt simile huic Attomi pueri in scholis: et est res facilis ei, qui uult.	And many times they do this kind of thing to an atom-like child in schools: and it is a easy thing for one who wills.
Deinde pone duas extremitates fili, extremitatem unam quae egreditur super nasum, et alteram quae remansit in naso.	Then place the two ends of the thread, one end which is coming out over the nose and the other end which remains inside the nose.
Deinde ac ministra serraturam carnis cum nodis qui sunt in filo.	Then and finally, apply a knife or saw to the flesh with the knots that are on the thread.
Fac illud donec scias quod carnes iam sunt cum nodis fili.	Do this until you know that the flesh is already cut along with the knots of the thread.
Deinde extrahe filum: et pone in nasum post abstersionem sanguinis licinium quod imbibisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud tribus diebus, aut plus, donec unguentum corrodat totum quod remansit ex carnibus.	Then draw out the thread and put it into the nose after wiping away the blood with the licorish that you have mixed in Egyptian ointment. Do this for three days or more until the ointment has softened all that remains of the flesh.
Deinde pone in fine rei in nasum cannulam de plumbo, diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	Then place a lead tube at the end of the thing into the nose for several days until it heals.
Si autem indiget curatione quae exiccet, utere illa.	But if it needs a treatment that dries, use that one.
Ad caputpurgium faciendum, cum quo distillantur olea, et aliae medicinae in nasum, fac illud ex argento, aut aere: quod sit simile lampadi paruae, apertum sicut conchula: et meatus eius similiter.	To make a head-pot for distilling oils and other medicines into the nose, make one from silver or bronze, similar to a small lamp, with an opening like a shell, and its channel similarly.
Et si uis fac cannulam clausam, sicut canna.	And if you want to make a closed tube, like a reed.
Et conchula instrumenti ad caputpurgium faciendum, sit plena, detecta: cui sit manubrium in postremo eius, cum quo teneas ipsam, quando calefacis in ea oleum, aut quod uis ex succis, et rebus fluxibilibus.	And the shell-shaped instrument for making a head-pot should be full and open: to which there is a handle at its end, by means of which you will hold it when you warm it with oil or whatever you want from the juice and flowing things.
Et haec est forma instrumenti.	And this is the shape of the instrument.
¶ De cura Thelul nasi.	Chapter on the treatment of a nose boil.
Caput XXV.	Book XXV.
Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius.	A boil called Thelul often grows at the end of the nose and becomes swollen and larger with days until its appearance becomes foul.
Et propter illud oportet, ut in cidas illud in principio apparitionis eius, et eradices totum eius.	And because of this, it is necessary to cut off that boil at the very beginning of its appearance and to uproot the whole thing.
Deinde pone super locum, aut cauterium, aut medicinam comburentem quae stat loco eius.	Then place something over the place, or a cautery, or a burning medicine that takes its place.
Si ergo tardatur incisio eius, donec magnificetur, tunc considera, si est lapideum, durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro: quoniam apostema est cancerosum.	So if the cutting is delayed until it grows and becomes large, then consider whether it is hard, rough, and of a dull color, with few sensations: then do not touch it with iron, for it is a cancerous sore.
Multotiens enim uidi, qui incidit hmoni apostema, et accidit ex eo malicia magna super illum qui ipsum habebat.	For I have often seen someone who cut open a cancerous sore and as a result suffered great harm to the one who had it.
Et si apostema est lenis tactus, non fusci coloris, et uides quod incisio possibilis est in toto eius, tunc euacua infirmum, et incide ipsum sine timore, absque pauore: et cura locum cum eo quod exiccat et constringit, donec sanetur.	And if the sore is soft to the touch, not of a dull color, and you see that it can be cut open entirely, then evacuate the patient, and cut it open without fear or trembling: and care for the place with what dries and constricts until it heals.
¶ De sutura nasi, et labii, et auris.	On the suture of the nose, and lip, and ear.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter Twenty-Six.
Scias Quia quando accidit solutio continuitatis in una harum cartilaginum, parum confert in ea operatio, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	You should know that when a separation of continuity occurs in one of these cartilages, it is not very helpful to perform this operation on that person, except in certain individuals.
Oportet ergo quando accidit alicui aliquid ex illo, ut consideres, si est uulnus recens cum sanguine suo: et tunc aggrega duolabia uulneris cum sutura: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Therefore, when something happens to someone from that, you should consider whether it is a recent wound with its own blood; and then gather the edges of the wound together with a suture: afterwards, take care of it until it heals.
Et si solutionis continuitatis labia iam separata sunt, et facta est unaquaeque pars sana: tunc oportet ut excories omnem partem a cute sua apparente, donec sanguinetur.	And if the separation of continuity has already caused the lips to be separated and each part is healed: then it is necessary that you remove all the parts from their apparent skin until they are bled.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cum sutura, et stringe ea, et pulueriza super ipsum sanguinem draconis, et olibanum trita: et pone supra pulueres frustum emplastri diafinicon, et alicuius alterius ex emplastris consolidatiuis: et dimitte ipsum ligatum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then gather the two lips together with a suture and tie them tightly, and powder the top of it with dragon's blood and ground galangal: and place on top of the powders a piece of diafinic plaster and another consolidating plaster: and leave it bound for two or three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et permuta medicinam: et dimitte ipsum, donec abscindantur fila per se.	Then release it, and change the medicine: and leave it until the threads cut themselves free.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointment, until it heals.
Modus autem suturae est, ut aggreges solutionem continuitatis, aut cum acubus, sicut narrauimus in sutura uentris: aut aggrega solutionem cum filo, sicut feci te scire.	The method of suturing is to gather the separation of continuity either with needles, as we explained in the suturing of the belly: or gather the separation together with a thread, as I have taught you.
¶ De extractione nodorum labiorum.	On the removal of lip knots.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter Twenty-Seven.
Multis Quidem hominibus accidunt plaerumque in interioribus labiorum suorum apostemata dura similia granis herbi: et quaedam eorum minora, et maiora.	Indeed many people experience swellings mostly inside their lips, similar to plant seeds, and some are smaller, others larger.
Ergo oportet ut conuertas labium, et findas super omnem nodum eius, et suspendas ipsum cum uncino, et incidas ipsum ab omni parte.	Therefore, you should turn the lip inside out, and scrape over all the knot on it, and hang it up with a hook, and cut it off from every part.
Deinde impleas locum post incisionem zegi trito, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then fill the place after the incision with powdered zygium, until the blood is stopped.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto, et curetur locus cum eo, in quo est stipticitas, usquequo sanentur uulnera.	Then it should be treated with vinegar, and the spot where there is suppuration should be cured with it, until the wounds are healed.
¶ De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.	On the incision of a growth on the gum.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter 28.
Multotiens nascitur super gingiuam caro addiat, quam antiqui nominant abuluss.	A flesh grows many times on the gum, which the ancients call an abuluss.
Oportet ergo ut suspendas eam cum uncino: aut teneas eam cum forcipibus, et incidas eam apud radicem suam, et dimittas saniem currere, aut sanguinem.	Therefore you must hang it with a hook; or hold it with forceps and cut it at its root, and let the pus flow, or blood.
Deinde pone super locum zegi tritum, aut alios pulueres stipticos, exiccatiuos.	Then place powdered vermilion or other stinging powders on top of the place.
Quod si redit illa caro post curationem, nam multotiens redit, tunc incide eam secundo, et cauteriza ipsam: ipsa namque non redit post cauterium.	For if that flesh returns after the cure, and it often returns, then cut it again and cauterize it: for it does not return after cauterization.
¶ De rasione Dentium cum ferro.	On the trimming of teeth with iron.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter 29.
Quandoque aggregantur in superficiebus Dentium ab interiori et extetiori parte, et inter gingiuas cortices asperi, turpes, et quandoque denigrantur, et citrini fiunt, et uirides, donec peruenit ex illo corruptio ad gingiuam, et foedi fiunt dentes per illud.	Sometimes they accumulate on the surfaces of teeth from both inside and outside parts, and between the gums rough, foul, and sometimes yellowish or greenish scales form, until the decay reaches the gum and the teeth become foul through that.
Oportet ergo ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et caput eius in sinu tuo, et rade molam et dentem, in quo apparent tibi cortices, et res similis arenae: donec non remaneat ex eis aliquid, et similiter fac de nigredine, et uiriditate, et citrinitate, et aliis donec mundentur.	Therefore you should make the patient sit in your hands and his head rest on your shoulder, and scrape away with a file or tooth, where the scales appear to you like sand: until nothing remains of them, and similarly do the same for the blackness, greenishness, and yellowness, and other defects until they are cleaned.
Si ergo auferatur quod in eis est a principio rasionis, bonum est: et si non, tunc itera super eos rasionem die alio, secundo, et tertio, donec ad ultimum perueniat studium in eo quod uis.	Therefore if what is in them is removed from the beginning of the operation, it is good: and if not, then repeat the operation on them another day, a second time, and a third time, until finally the effort reaches its goal as you desire.
Et scias, quod dens indiget rasoriis diuersarum formarum, multarum figurarum: secundum quod praeparatur operationi tuae: proptera, quod rasorium quo raditur dens ab inferiori parte, est aliud a rasorio quo raditur inter dentes, secundum formas alias.	And know that each tooth needs to be trimmed with different forms and shapes of files, many figures, according to how you prepare your operation: therefore, the file with which you trim the tooth from the lower part is different from the one with which you trim between teeth, in other shapes.
Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.	And those forms of razors should be prepared by you that you see.
¶ De extractione doloris Dentium.	Of the removal of toothache pain.
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.
Oportet ut cures Dentem a dolore suo cum omni ingenio, et tardes in eradicatione eius.	It is necessary to cure a tooth from its own pain with all your skill and not delay in eradicating it.
Non est enim quod uicem eius suppleat quando eradicatur: quoniam est substantia sublimis: donec quando non est excusatio de eradicatione eius, tunc oportet quando cogitur infirmus eradicare ipsum, ut firmetur, et certificetur apud te dens dolens.	For it is not the case that its place should be supplied when it is eradicated: since it is a substance of high quality. Therefore, until there is no excuse for eradicating it, then it is necessary to eradicate it when one is compelled by weakness, so that it may be strengthened and certified in your presence, the tooth which pains.
Multotiens enim decipit infirmum dolor, et putat quia est in dente saha et eradicat ipsum: deinde non recedit dolor, donec eradicetur dens infirmus.	For many times pain deceives the weak and makes him think that there is a cavity in the tooth and he eradicates it; then pain does not cease until the patient's tooth is eradicated.
Nos enim iam uidimus illud ex operatione phlebotomatorum.	For we have already seen that from the practice of bloodletters.
Cum ergo certificatur apud te dens dolens ipsemet, tunc oportet ut scarifices in circumitu dentis cum spatumili, in quo sit quiddam uirtutis, donec soluatur gingiua ab omni parte: deinde moue ipsum digitis tuis, aut cum forcipibus subtilibus in primis paulatim, donec concutias ipsum.	When therefore the aching tooth itself is certified to you, then it is necessary that you scarify around the tooth with a sharp instrument, in which there is something of virtue, until the gum is loosened from every part. Then move it with your fingers or with fine forceps little by little, until it is dislodged.
Deinde loca tunc in eo forcipes magnos locatione bona, et caput infirmi inter genua tua: quod iam bene tenuisti, ita quod non moueatur: deinde trahe dentem secundum rectitudinem, ut non frangas ipsum.	Then place the large forceps in a good location on him and his head between your knees: which you have already held so well that it does not move. Then pull out the tooth according to its proper straightness, lest you break it.
Si ergo non egreditur, tunc accipe aliquod illorum instrumentorum, et intromitte ipsum sub eo ab omni parte cum facilitate, et conare motionem eius, sicut fecisti in primis.	If it does not come out, then take one of those instruments and insert it under him from every part with ease, and try to move it, just as you did at first.
Si autem dens est perforatus, aut corrosus: tunc oportet ut impleas illud foramen panno: et stringas ipsum cum extremitate radii subtilis, ut non frangatur in hora constrictionis tuae super ipsum cum forcipibus.	If however the tooth is perforated or corroded, then it is necessary that you fill that hole with cloth and tie it up with a fine thread at its end, so that it does not break during your constriction on it with forceps.
Et oportet, ut exquisite agas cum scarificatione in circumitu gingiuae ab omni parte multum.	And you should take great care to work finely with a scalpel around the gum from every part.
Et custodi fortitudinem tuam, ut non frangas ipsum, et remaneat pars eius, et redeat super infirmum ex ea malicia quae sit maior dolore eius primo.	And preserve your strength so that you do not break it, and a part of it remains, and it returns over the sick person from the very evil that is greater in their initial pain.
Et caue, ne facias illud quod ignorantes faciunt phlebotomatores in festinatione sua, et audacia ipsorum super eradicationem eius, praeter quod administrent illud quod narrauimus.	And beware, lest you do what ignorant bloodletters do in their haste and the boldness of their removal, beyond what we have narrated.
Multotiens enim faciunt euenire super homines infirmitates magnas, quarum difficiliores sunt ut frangantur, et remaneant radices eius omnes, aut quaedam earum: aut ut extrahant ipsum cum quibusdam ossibus mandibulae: sicut testificati sumus multotiens illud.	For they often bring about severe illnesses in men, which are more difficult to break and remain all their roots or some of them, or that they extract the very bone along with certain jawbones, just as we have testified many times to this effect.
Deinde colluatur post eradicationem eius cum uino, aut cum aceto et sale.	Then it should be washed after removal with wine, or vinegar and salt.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis ex locis (multotiens enim accidit) tunc tere aliquid ex zegi, et imple cum eo locum: et si non, cauteriza ipsum si non confert tibi zegi.	But if bleeding occurs from the wound (which often happens), then take something from zeera and fill the place with it; and if not, cauterize it if zeera is not available to you.
Formae forcipum subtilium quibus mouetur dens in primis, sint longarum extremitatum, breuis manubrii, grossi, ut non duplicentur quando cum eis premitur super dentem: sint sicut uides grossorum manubriorum, donec quando stringis cum eis, non dent seipsas, neque duplicentur: breuium extremitatum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut ex faled decenter facti, directarum extremitatum: et in eorum extremitatibus sint dentes, quorum quidam ingrediantur in quosdam, et stringant constrictione decenti, forti.	The forms of fine forceps by which the tooth is moved first should be long at their tips, short at their handles, thick, so that they do not bend when pressed upon a tooth: let them be like what you see in the handles of heavy tools, until when you tighten them with them, they will not open themselves or bend; short at their tips and made from iron well finished, or well-made copper, directed at their tips: and on those tips should be teeth, some of which enter into others, and bind by a decent constriction, strong.
Et quandoque fiunt extremitates sicut forma oris auis quae nominatur ciconia, et sunt fortis constrictionis.	And sometimes the tips are shaped like the beak of a bird called a stork, and they have strong constriction.
¶ De eradicatione Dentium, et extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.	Chapter on the removal of teeth and the extraction of fractured jawbones.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 31.
Quando remanet apud eradicationem Dentis qui frangitur aliquid, tunc oportet ut ponas super locum cotum cum butyro die uno, aut duobus diebus, donec mollificetur locus: deinde intromitte ad ipsum algasti, aut forcipes: quorum extremitates assimilantur ori auis quae nominatur ciconia.	When something remains at the site of a tooth that is breaking off, then it is necessary to put butter on the area for one or two days until the place becomes soft: then introduce into it algast, or forceps, whose tips are shaped like the beak of a bird called a stork.
Forma autem haec est forcipum.	The form of this is forceps.
Sint extremitates eorum factae sicut lima deintus: aut sicut aliskilfegi.	Let their ends be made like a file inside: or like scalpel feathers.
Si ergo non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.	So if it does not obey you at the exit with these forceps, then you must, as it were, cave in above the root, and remove all the flesh, and introduce a small instrument called Palanca, whose form is this.
Sit breuis extremitatis, grossae parumper: et non sit imbibitum, ut non frangatur.	Let the short end be rough and slightly thick: and not let it be soaked so as not to break.
Si ergo egreditur radix per illud, est bonum: et si non, iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis aliis quorum formae sunt istae.	So if the root goes out through that, it is good; and if not, you should help with these other instruments whose forms are these.
Forma primi triangulatae extremitatis, in qua est quaedam grossitudo.	The form of the first instrument is triangular, with a certain thickness.
Forma triangulatae extremitatis subtilis.	The form of the triangular end is fine.
Etiam iuuatur cum hoc instrumento habente duos ramos, cuius haec est forma.	And it should also be helped with this instrument having two branches, whose form is this.
Et cum aliis instrumentis et ferramentis quae praecesserunt in rasione dentium.	And with other instruments and tools that came before for shaping teeth.
Etiam sit iuuamentum cum hoc instrumento quod assimilatur uncino magno, huius formae, triangulatae extremitatis tortae, in qua est quiddam grossitudinis, ut non frangatur: et sit non imbibitum.	And it should also be helped with this instrument that is similar to a large hook, having the form of a triangular end twisted, which has some thickness so as not to break; and let it not be soaked.
Et scias, quod instrumenta dentium sunt multa: et similiter reliqua instrumenta non computantur, et artifex prudens, subtilis in arte sua inuenit per se ipsum instrumentum, secundum quod significant ei operatio et aegritudines ipsae.	And know that instruments for teeth are many: and similarly other instruments are not counted; and a skilled artisan, subtle in his art, finds for himself an instrument, according to what the operation and ailments themselves signify.
Quoniam ex agritudinibus sunt ad quas non dixerunt antiqui instrumentum, propter diuersitatem specierum earum.	Because from ailments there are some to which ancient instruments did not speak, on account of the diversity of their kinds.
Si autem frangatur os ex mandibula, aut ex aliis ossibus oris, aut putrefit: tunc perscrutare super ipsum in loco suo cum eo quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis et forcipibus quae dixi in extractione radicum, et iuuare cum gesti, cuius forma est haec.	But if the bone is broken from the jawbone or from other bones of the mouth, or putrefies: then search for it in its place with what suits it from the instruments and forceps that I said for extracting roots, and help with gestures, whose form is this.
Sit in eo quiddam grossitudinis paulatim, ut stringatur, uel teneatur cum eo os, et non fugiat et uadat, donec egrediatur os: et restaura locum cum medicinis conuenientibus ad illud.	Let there be some thickness in it gradually, so that it may bind or hold with the bone, and not flee and go, until the bone goes out; and restore the place with medicines suitable for it.
Si autem in osse est putredo parua, tunc rade ipsum a putredine sua, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	If however there is small rot in the bone, then scrape it off from its own rot and care for it until it heals.
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.	On the Excision of Prominent Teeth above Others.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter Thirty-Two.
Quando Dentes eminent non secundum cursum suum naturalem, foeda fit per illud forma: et praecipue quando accidit illud in mulieribus, et puellis, scilicet uenalibus.	When prominent teeth do not follow their natural course and become distorted in shape; and especially when this occurs in women and girls, that is to say, in those with a venereal condition.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	Therefore one must consider.
Nam si dens est natus post dentem alium, et non locatur, uel est possibilis eius serratura, neque limatura ipsius: tunc eradica ipsum: et si est annexus cum dente alio, tunc incide ipsum cum isto instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	For if a tooth is born after another tooth and does not sit properly, or its excision or sharpening is possible, then remove it; and if it is connected to another tooth, then cut it off with this tool, which has this shape.
Est simile rostro paruo, et fit ex ferro indo, acutae extremitatis ualde.	It is similar to a small file, and is made from tempered steel, very sharp at the end.
Et sit incisio tua qua ipsum incidis in diebus multis, et propter duriciem dentis, et ut non commoueatur alius ex dentibus.	And let your incision be such that you cut it on many days, and because of the hardness of the tooth, and so as not to disturb another tooth.
Si autem est eminens expositus limaturae suae: tunc lima ipsum cum lima ex indo, cuius forma est haec.	If however it is prominent and exposed to sharpening: then sharpen it with a file made of tempered steel, which has this shape.
Sit totum ex indo, et manubrium eius minutorum punctorum ualdae, sicut lima cum qua fiunt acus: cum quo limetur dens paulatim in diebus multis cum facilitate, ut non commoueatur dens, et cadat: deinde leni ipsum, in fine rade ipsum cum quibusdam rasoriis.	Let it be all of one piece with the tempered steel, and let its handle be short and have a strong pointed tip, like a file with which needles are made: by which the tooth is slowly sharpened over many days with ease, so that the tooth does not become dislodged and falls; then smooth it out, and finally scrape it off with certain rasps.
Quod si est dens, ex quo frangatur pars, et laedit linguam: tunc oportet ut limes eum etiam, donec auferatur asperitas illius fractionis, et aequetur: et applanetur, et non laedat linguam, neque corrumpat sermonem.	And if there is a tooth from which a piece breaks off and injures the tongue: then it is necessary to sharpen it also, until the roughness of that breakage is removed and it is made even; and smoothed out, so that it does not injure the tongue, nor corrupt the speech.
¶ De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.	On the Rounding Off of Teeth with Gold Threads.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter Thirty-Three.
Quando accidit Dentibus anterioribus concussio et commotio a percussione, aut casu: et non potest infirmus stringere super illud quod comedit ut non cadat: et curasti eos cum medicinis stipticis, et non ualuit curatio: tunc ingenium in eis est, ut stringantur cum filo auri: quoniam argentum fit uiride, et putrefit post dies: sed aurum nunquam mutatur.	When it happens that anterior teeth are shaken and disturbed by percussion or fall, and the weak person cannot bind them securely so they do not fall; and you have treated them with stiptic medicines, but the treatment did not help: then there is a natural inclination in them to be bound with gold thread: because silver becomes greenish and putrid after a few days: but gold is never changed.
Et sit filum medium in subtilitate et grossicie secundum quantitatem quod capiat inter Dentes.	And let the middle thread be in subtlety and coarseness according to its quantity as it lies between the teeth.
Et forma quidem retationis est, ut accipias filum, et intromittas duplum eius inter duos dentes sanos: deinde texeas cum duabus extremitatibus fili inter dentes motos, siue unus sit, aut plures, donec peruenias cum tela usque ad dentem sanum alterius partis.	And indeed the form of the suture is this: you take a thread and insert double its length between two healthy teeth; then sew with both ends of the thread between the moving teeth, whether one or more, until you reach the healthy tooth on the other side with the thread.
Deinde itera texturam usque ad partem a qua incaepisti: et stringe manum tuam cum subtilitate et sapientia, donec non remoueatur prorsus: et sit constrictio tua qua stringis filum, apud radices dentium, ut non euadat.	Then repeat the suture up to the part from which you began; and bind your hand with subtlety and wisdom, until it is not at all loosened: and let your constriction be such as binds the thread around the roots of the teeth, so that it does not come loose.
Deinde incide extremitates fili superfluentes cum forficibus: et aggrega utrumque, et conuerte eas cum gesti: et occulta ipsas inter dentem sanum et dentem motum, ut non laedat linguam: deinde dimittatur ita strictum dum remanet.	Then cut off the excess ends of the thread with scissors; and gather both together, and turn them with your hand; and hide them between the healthy tooth and the moving tooth, so that they do not hurt the tongue: then let it be left in this tightened state until it remains.
Si autem soluitur, aut inciditur, stringe eos cum filo alio, et stabit cum eo taliter tempore toto.	But if it should come undone or be cut, tie them again with another thread, and so they will remain for the whole time.
Et haec est forma Dentium, et figura retationis duorum dentium sanorum, et duorum dentium motorum, sicut uides.	And this is the form of teeth, and the figure of the suture of two healthy teeth, and two moving teeth, as you see.
Et quandoque fit, ut redeat dens unus, aut duo post casum urriusque in locis suis, et retentur sicut narrauimus, et remaneant: et non facit illud nisi artifex, prudens, et expertus.	And sometimes it happens that one or two teeth return after a fall, to their places, and are retained as we narrated, and remain; and this is done only by an artist, who is prudent and experienced.
Et quandoque aptatur aliquod ex ossibus uaccinis: et fit ex eo sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in loco, ex quo munitur dens et stringitur, sicut diximus: et remanet, et seruitur cum eo tempore longo.	And sometimes a bone from the shin is fitted: and it becomes like the form of a tooth, and is placed in its place, where the tooth is anchored and tied, as we said: and it remains, and serves with it for a long time.
¶ De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et prohibet loquelam.	Of the cutting of the ligament that occurs under the tongue, and prevents speech.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter 44.
Quandoque ligamentum hoc quod accidit sub lingua, est aut naturale, cum quo nascitur homo, aut accidentale, a uulnere quod iam consolidatum est.	Sometimes this ligament that occurs under the tongue is natural, with which man is born, or accidental, caused by a wound that has already been consolidated.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi in capite eius in sinu tuo, et eleua linguam eius: deinde incide illud ligamentum neruosum per latitudinem, donec soluatur lingua a retentione sua.	And the operation is to open the patient's mouth on the top of his head in your armpit, and lift up his tongue. Then cut that nerve-like ligament across its width until the tongue is released from its retention.
Quod si in eo fuerit quiddam duriciei et nodationis, et fuerit illud ex consolidatione uulneris: tunc proiice in illud uncinum, et finde illud per latitudinem, donec incidas ligamentum, et soluatur nodatio.	But if there is something hard and knotty in him, and it is due to the consolidation of the wound: then put a hook into it, and drive it through its width until you cut the ligament, and the knotting will be released.
Et caue, ne sit fissura in profundo carnis, et incidas arteriam illic, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And beware that there is no gap in the depth of the flesh, lest you cut an artery there and a flow of blood occurs.
Deinde colluatur in uestigio incisionis cum aqua rosata, aut cum aceto, aut aqua frigida.	Then apply to the incision with rose water, or vinegar, or cold water.
Deinde pone sub lingua licinium ex lino, quod teneat infirmus in omni nocte: ut non consolidetur secundo.	Then place a linen cloth under the tongue which the patient should keep every night: so that it may not consolidate again.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc pone super locum zegi tritum.	But if there is a flow of blood, then place powdered eggshell over the spot.
Si uero uincit te sanguis, tunc cauteriza locum cum cauterio lentiginoso, quod conuenit ad illud: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	But if the blood flows too much, then cauterize the spot with a caustic, which is suitable for that; and then care for it with the rest of the cure until it heals.
¶ De extractione Ranulae quae fit sub lingua.	About the removal of a ranula that occurs under the tongue.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter 35.
Quandoque accidit sub lingua apostema quod assimilatur Ranae paruae, prohibens linguam ab operatione sua naturali: et fortasse magnificatur adeo, donec implet os.	Sometimes an abscess occurs under the tongue, similar to that of a small frog, which prevents the tongue from performing its natural function, and perhaps swells so much that it fills the mouth.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi coram sole: et considera apostema.	And the operation is to open the patient's mouth before the sun: and observe the abscess.
Si ergo uides ipsum fusci coloris, aut nigri, durum, cui non inuenit infirmus sensum: tunc non tangas ipsum, quoniam est cancer.	If therefore you see it of a dark or black color, hard and insensitive to the touch, which the patient does not feel: then do not touch it, because it is a cancer.
Et si est decliue ad albedinem, in quo est humiditas, tunc proiice in ipsum uncinum, et incide ipsum cum spatumili subtili, et libera ipsum ab omni parte.	And if it is inclined towards whiteness, where there is moisture, then put a hook into it and cut it with a thin silver instrument, and free it from all parts.
Quod si uincit te sanguis in hora tuae operationis, tunc pone super ipsum zegi tritum, donec abscindatur sanguis: deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec extrahas ipsum cum complemento eius.	If blood overflows upon you during your operation, then place powdered alum above it until the bleeding stops. Then return to your operation and remove it with its complement.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto et sale: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then dress it with vinegar and salt, and care for the rest of the treatment suitable for that, until it heals.
¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.	On the cure of an apostema of two Pectoral Glands.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter 36.
Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.	Sometimes an affliction occurs between the gullet and godad, that is, glands which are similar to those that occur externally and are called two Amigdalae: which when you treat as we have said in division, and they do not heal, then consider.
Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.	If it is a hard apostema of dull red color, with little sensation: then do not touch it with iron.
Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.	And if it is of red color and the root of it is thick: then do not touch it with iron, fearing a flow of blood, rather let it be left alone until it matures.
Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.	And then either you will pierce it or it will break open by itself.
Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.	And if it is of white color, rounded, and the root of it is fine: then you should cut into it.
Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	And the operation is, that you consider before your operation, if the apostema has cooled down quietly and completely or diminished by some reduction: then therefore make the patient sit before the sun, and his head be in your bosom; and open his mouth, and have a servant standing between your hands, and press down his tongue with an instrument of this shape.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.	Make it of silver or air, so that it is as thin as a knife.
Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.	When therefore you press with it the tongue, and the apostema is shown to you, and falls upon it according to your sight: then take a forceps and insert it into the amigdala, and pull out as much of it as you can to the exterior, except that you take something away from the garments.
Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.	Then cut it with an instrument whose form is as follows:
Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.	It is assimilated to forceps; yet its extremities should be curved, so that the opening of each is on a straight edge of the other's point. Therefore, take care that it is made of iron tempered, or else it is well-filled with lead.
Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.	But if this instrument is not present, then cut it with a spoon-shaped instrument, whose form follows:
Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.	Be sharp on one side, not sharp on the other.
Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.	And after you have cut out one almond, cut out another in the same manner of incision.
Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.	Then after the incision, the patient should gargle with cold water or with vinegar and water.
Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	But if bleeding occurs to him, let him gargle with water in which the rinds of pomegranates have been boiled; or myrtle leaves and similar things from the stypsis, until the bleeding ceases: then care for it, until he is healed.
Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.	And sometimes other apostemes are born in the throat, besides the two tonsils.
Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.	Cut it therefore in accordance with what I said for the cutting of the two tonsils equally.
Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.	And indeed I myself was once cured a woman from an aposteme that had developed between her throat, which was pulling towards suffocation, and almost all sensation had ceased because the throat was already closing: and the woman was breathing through a narrow opening, and already she had forbidden food and drink to herself; and if this state had persisted for one day or two days, she would have died.
Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.	And the aposteme had risen so far that it had discharged two branches, until they protruded above the two openings of the nose.
Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.	I therefore hastened and fixed one of its hooks.
Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.	Then I pulled it out, and a large portion was extracted from it.
Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.	Then I cut it where it is grasped from the nasal opening.
Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.	Then I did to him what had come forth from the other nostril.
Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.	Then I opened his mouth and pressed his tongue; and afterwards I fixed the instrument into the abscess. Then I cut off from it a part of him, and only a little blood flowed out from it: thus the woman's throat was closed, and she began to drink water immediately, then received food again.
Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.	Therefore I did not cease to cut into that abscess many times over a long period of time; and the abscess succeeded in its place as I was cutting, until it became too long and with it.
Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.	I therefore cauterized the abscess between the throat.
Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.	It therefore remained uninfected: then I walked away from it, and did not know what God had done with her after me.
¶ De incisione apostematis uuulae.	Paragraph on the cutting of a quinsy.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter 37.
Quando descendit catarrus ad uuulam, et apostematur, et est long: tunc ipsa nominatur perpendicularis: et si est in inferiori parte grossa, rotunda, tunc ipsa nominatur uua.	When the catarrh descends to the uvula and becomes inflamed, and is long: then it is called a quinsy; and if it is in the lower part thick, rounded, then it is called a tonsil.
Quando curatur cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: et uides quod apostema calidum quieuit ab ea, et est subtilis: tunc oportet ut incidas eam.	When it is cured with what we said in the division, and the cure does not agree; and you see that the abscess has cooled down from it, and is thin: then it is necessary for you to cut it.
Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.	And that which is joined to it, rounded, and has no length, and is bloody, or of a reddish-brown, or black color, and feels no sense: then it is necessary for you to make the incision on it.
In ea enim est timor super infirmum.	For in it there is fear above the patient.
Oportet ergo quando uides eam secundum modum quem dixi ex albedine, et longitudine sua, ut facias sedere infirmum coram sole: et premas linguam eius cum instrumento, cuius praecessit narratio: deinde fige uncinum in uuam, et trahe eam inferius: et incide eam cum uno duorum instrumentorum quae dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum.	Therefore when you see it according to the manner I said from its whiteness and length, you should make the patient sit before the sun; and press his tongue with the instrument of which the narrative preceded: then insert the forceps into the uvula, and pull it downwards; and cut it with one of the two instruments that I said for cutting the two tonsils.
Et oportet ut non incidas ex ea, nisi illud quod additur super naturalem terminum sine additione.	And it is necessary that you do not cut from it unless what is added above the natural term without addition.
Nam si tu incidis ex ea plus, laedes uocem et sermonem.	For if you cut from it more, you will wound the voice and speech.
Deinde post incisionem utere eo quod narrauimus in incisione duarum amigdalarum: et cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then after the incision, use what we have described for the incision of two adrenal glands; and care for it until it is healed.
Si autem terretur infirmus ab incisione: tunc oportet ut utaris ingenio in cauterizatione eius absque timore et pauore.	But if the patient is terrified of the incision, then it is necessary that you use your skill in cauterizing him without fear and trembling.
Et modus cauterii in ea non est, nisi cum aqua acuta: et est, ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	And the method of cauterization there is not, except with sharp water; and it is, that you put the head of the patient on your shoulder.
Deinde preme linguam eius cum instrumento quod diximus.	Then press his tongue with the instrument we mentioned.
Deinde accipe ex aqua quam dixi tibi in capitulo cauterizandi, et confice cum ea calcem non extinctam, et pone eam non spissam, neque subtilem, et imple ex ea concauitatem huius instrumenti, cuius haec est forma.	Then take the water which I told you in the chapter on cauterizing, and fill with it a shoe that is not extinguished, and place it not thick, nor thin, and fill into this concavity of the instrument, whose form is this.
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.	Let the end of it be at the spot where medicine is placed in the concavity, just like the concavity of a ear-shaped radius.
Et pone instrumentum cum medicina super uuulam ipsam: et infirmus sit iacens super latus suum, ut currat saliua ex ore eius ex intrinseca medicina, ut non descendat ex ea ad guttur ipsius aliquid, et laedat ipsum.	And place the instrument with medicine on the roof of his mouth: and let the patient lie on his side as he breathes, so that saliva may flow from his mouth from the inner medicine, lest anything from it descend to his throat and harm him.
Deinde tene manum tuam cum medicina.	Then hold your hand with the medicine.
Et tu ex primas eam super uuulam quantitate medietatis horae, donec uideas eam iam denigratam, et sedatam mordicationem medicinae.	And you should put it on top of the mouth by a quantity of the first half hour, until you see that it has already begun to whiten and calm down the pungency of the medicine.
Et si uis ut accipias cotum, et inuoluas ipsum super extremitatem radii, et infundas cotum cum medicina, et intromittas radium cum coto in cannulam desuper, donec adhaereat cotum super uuulam.	And if you wish to take a plug, and wrap it around the end of the radius, and pour the plug with medicine, and insert the radius with the plug into the tube above, until the plug adheres to the roof of the mouth.
Fac illud multotiens, donec consequaris quod uis de cauterizatione uuae.	Do that many times, until you achieve what you desire from the cauterization of the uvula.
Deinde dimitte eam: ipsa namque arescit et cadit post tres dies, aut quatuor.	Then let it go: indeed it dries out and falls after three days, or four.
Quod si indiges ut iteres medicinam, itera ipsam: et post cauterizationem absterge in circumitu uuae cum coto imbibito in butyro, et mundifica cum eo quod est in circumitu eius ex medicina: et colluatur cum aqua frigida.	But if you need to repeat the medicine, apply it again: and after cauterization, wash it with a poultice made from the rind of an apple, mixed with butter that has been soaked in it, and cleanse it with what is found on its surface from medicine: and wrap it with cold water.
Et curetur extrinsecus cum embrocis, et deintus cum gargarismis, donec sanetur.	And treat it externally with ointments, and internally with gargles, until it is healed.
Haec ergo species curationis est salubrior incisione et longinquior a timore.	Therefore this method of treatment is more conducive to health through incision and less fearful because of its length.
Et quandoque curatur uuula etiam cum eo quod est subtilius quam cauterium et incisio: curatur enim cum suffumigatione, secundum hunc modum.	And sometimes the wound is also cured with something that is finer than caustic and cutting: it is cured with fumigation, in this way.
Sume calamentum, et hyssopum, et origanum, et rutam, et sseah, et chamomillam, et abrotanum, et similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia, aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.	Take calamus, hyssop, origanum, rue, sseah, chamomile, abrotanum, and similar herbs from among those that grow: and gather them all together, or some of them in a pot, and immerse them with vinegar, and let them boil: and the pot should be smeared with clay decently: and there should be a hole in the middle of the pot, on which an instrument shall be placed according to this method.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere: et intromittatur extremitas, in qua est granatum, in os infirmi, donec ascendat uapor ad uuulam super cannulam, donec obscuretur uuula multum.	Make it from silver or bronze: and insert the end with the pomegranate into the mouth of the sick person, until the vapor ascends to the wound above the tube, until the wound is greatly obscured.
Deinde itera super ipsam multotiens, donec arescat.	Then repeat this over it many times, until it dries out.
Et caue, ne facias hanc curationem in principio aduentus apostematis.	And beware, lest you perform this treatment at the beginning of an aposteme.
Plaerumque enim addit in apostemate: et non oportet ut facias illud nisi apud declinationem apostematis eius calidi.	For often it adds to the aposteme; and it is not fitting for you to do that unless at the decline of the aposteme's heat.
Si autem non est praesens tibi hoc instrumentum, tunc accipe cannam, et compone in extremitate eius corticem oui: ut non comburatur os infirmi: quoniam cortex oui prohibet uaporem comburere os: et haec est ex bona curatione cum salute.	But if this instrument is not present to you, then take a reed and compose at its end the rind of an apple: so that the sick person's mouth does not burn: for the rind of an apple prevents vapor from burning the mouth: and this is a good treatment with salvation.
¶ De extractione spinarum, et ossium de gula.	On the extraction of thorns and bones from the throat.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter Thirty-eight.
Multotiens adhaeret in gutture os, aut spina piscis, aut aliud.	A bone or a fish spine or something else often sticks in the throat.
Oportet ergo ut extrahas quod ex eis est apparens super quod cadit uisus, postquam premis linguam cum instrumento apud solem, et declaratur tibi quod est in gutture.	It is therefore necessary to remove what appears above the surface and falls into view, after you have pressed your tongue with an instrument in the sun, and it is declared to you that it is in the throat.
Et quod non apparet tibi et occultatur in gutture, oportet ut facias uomere infirmum antequam digeratur cibus in stomacho.	And what does not appear to you and is hidden in the throat, it is necessary that you make a weak vomit before food is digested in the stomach.
Fortasse enim egredietur res annexa per uomitum.	Perhaps indeed something will emerge attached through vomiting.
Aut deglutiat infirmus frustum napi, aut radicem lactucae, aut deglutiat buccellam panis sicci: aut accipiat frustum spongiae marinae siccae lenis: et liga ipsum in filo, deinde deglutiat ipsum.	Or a weak person swallows a piece of a leek, or the root of a lettuce, or swallows a dry biscuit: or receives a piece of dried sea sponge and binds it with thread, then swallows it.
Cum ergo peruenit ad locum ubi sunt spinae, aut os, et extrahitur, tunc egreditur.	When therefore it arrives at the place where the spines or bones are, and is removed, then it emerges.
Si ergo non egreditur cum eo quod diximus: tunc utere instrumento ex plumbo secundum hanc formam.	If however it does not emerge with what we said: then use a leaden instrument according to this shape.
Sit grossius quam Radius parumper, et in extremitate eius sit curuitas, quam intromittat in guttur suum cum facilitate: et ipse habeat caput suum eleuatum sursum.	Let it be thicker than a radius, and at the end of it let there be a curvature, which insert into his throat with ease: and he should have his head raised upwards.
Et caueat a tactu suae epiglotis, ut non accidat ei tussis, et impellat cum eo os, aut spinam, aut intromittat ipsum medicus manu sua.	And beware of touching his epiglottis, lest he coughs, and push with him the bone or spine, or insert it himself by hand.
Verum quod infirmus intromittat, hoc est melius: propter scientiam suam de loco rei annexae: et impellat inferius, aut trahat manum suam cum instrumento sursum, totum illud secundum quantitatem quae praeparatur ei, donec egrediatur.	But what the sick person inserts is better: on account of his knowledge of the place where the attached thing is; and push it down below, or draw his hand up with the instrument, all that according to the quantity prepared for him, until it emerges.
¶ De extractione Sanguisugae.	On the Extraction of Leeches.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter Thirty-nine.
Quando medicatur sanguisuga cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex curatione cum medicinis, et non confert, tunc considera in gutture infirmi coram sole, siue apud solem postquam premis linguam eius cum instrumento quod narraui tibi.	When a leech is being cured with what I said in the division of treatment with medicines, and does not yield, then examine the patient's throat before the sun or after the sun, after you have pressed his tongue with an instrument as I told you.
Si ergo cadit uisus tuus super sanguisugam, extrahe eam cum uncino paruo, aut cum gesti subtilibus decenter.	If then your patient falls on a bloodsucker, remove it with a small hook or with fine forceps.
Quod si non est possibile cum eis: tunc accipe cannulam concauam, et intromitte eam in guttur infirmi usque prope guttur: deinde intromitte in concauitatem cannulae ferrum ignitum cum igne.	But if it is not possible with them, then take a hollow tube and insert it into the patient's throat up to the throat; then insert into the cavity of the tube a burning iron with fire.
Fac illud multotiens: et abstineat infirmus ab aqua tota die.	Do that many times, and let the patient refrain from water all day.
Deinde accipiat uitreatam plenam aqua frigida, et aperiat os eius in ea: et colluat os suum cum ea, et non deglutiat ex ea aliquid: et moueat aquam una hora post aliam cum manu sua.	Then let him take a wet compress filled with cold water, and open his mouth into it; and let him hold his mouth in it, and not swallow anything from it: and move the water one hour after another with his own hand.
Sanguisuga enim ilico cum sentit aquam cadit.	For the bloodsucker indeed falls when it feels the water.
Si autem non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc suffumiga infirmum cum cimicibus, aut cum asa cum instrumento quod narraui in suffumigatione uuulae.	But if it does not come out with what we have described, then fumigate the patient with cimices, or with a feather and an instrument that I have described for fumigating the uvula.
Fac illud multotiens, quoniam ipsa cadet.	Do this many times, because it will fall.
Et modus operationis in suffumigatione est, ut accipias ollam, in qua sint prunae uiuae cum igne: et olla sit cooperta cum coopertorio, in cuius medio sit foramen: et componatur in illo foramine extremitas instrumenti.	And the method of operation in fumigation is, that you take a pot in which are living prune pits with fire; and let the pot be covered with a lid, in whose middle is a hole; and arrange the extremity of the instrument within that hole.
Deinde proiice suffumigationem, et ponat infirmus os suum in extremitate cannulae, et claudat os suum, ut non egrediatur suffumigatio, donec scias quod suffumigatio iam peruenit ad sanguisugam.	Then pour the fumigation, and let the patient put his mouth to the end of the tube, and close his mouth so that the fumigation does not escape, until you know that the fumigation has reached the bloodsucker.
Nam sanguisuga statim cadet.	For the bloodsucker will immediately fall.
Quod si non cadit, tunc itera suffumigationem multotiens.	But if it does not fall, then repeat the fumigation many times.
Et toleret infirmus sitim, et comedat salsa, et allia, et non bibat aquam.	And let the patient be thirsty, and eat salted foods, and other things, and not drink water.
Necesse est ergo ut egrediatur cum hoc regimine.	It is necessary therefore that it come out with this regimen.
Et haec est forma instrumenti cum quo extrahitur sanguisuga ex gutture, quando cadit super ipsam uisus.	And this is the form of the instrument with which the bloodsucker is drawn out of the throat when it falls onto it.
Est simile forcipibus, sicut uides: nisi quia est ei haee curuitas quae intromittitur ad guttur.	It is similar to forceps, as you see: except that it has this curvature which enters into the throat.
Et extremitas eius similis ori auis quae nominatur ciconia, in quo est asperitas limae: quando comprehendit aliquid, non dimittit ipsum omnino.	And its extremity is similar to the beak of a bird called a stork, in which there is roughness like a file: when it grasps something, it does not release it completely.
¶ De apertione Apostematum, et eorum sectione, et cura in genere.	About the opening of apostumes, and their cutting out, and care in general.
Caput XL.	Chapter 40.
Apostematum species sunt multae, multorum modorum, secundum quod uenit rememoratio eorum, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et sunt diuersae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.	The species of apostumes are many, of various kinds, according to the recollection of them, namely one and one only in this book: and they are different in their perforation and cutting out, in two ways.
Quorum unus est ex specie apostematis in seipso, et eo quod comprehendit ex humiditatibus.	One of which is a species of apostema within itself, and because it contains moisture.
Et modus secundus est propter loca, in quibus accidit ex corpore.	And the second method is due to the places in which it occurs from the body.
Quoniam apostema accidens in capite, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in ano: et apostema accidens in loco carnoso, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in iuncturis: et unicuique eorum est iudicium suum ex operatione.	Because the apostema occurring on the head is another thing from the apostema occurring at the anus: and the apostema occurring on a fleshy part is another thing from the apostema occurring at a joint: and each of them has its own judgment based on its treatment.
Et ex apostematibus sunt quae non oportet ut perforentur, nisi post maturationem saniei in eis, et complementum eius: et ex eis sunt, quae oportet ut perforentur, dum sunt cruda, et non maturantur secundum complementum.	And from the apostemas are those which should not be perforated unless after maturation of the flesh within them and its completion: and from these are those which must be perforated while they are raw and do not mature according to their completion.
Sicut apostemata quae sunt propinqua iuncturis.	Such as apostemas that are near joints.
Quoniam apostema quando accidit prope iuncturam, et prolongatur esse eius, donec putrefit quod est in circumitu eius fortasse corrumpuntur ligamenta, aut nerui illius iuncturae: quare est caussa propior contractionis illius membri.	Because when an apostema occurs near a joint and prolongs itself until the flesh surrounding it perhaps corrupts the ligaments or nerves of that joint; therefore it is a more immediate cause of constriction in that member.
Aut est apostema apud membrum principale: quoniam si tu tardas perforationem eius, donec maturetur, nocebit uel illi, uel per illud membro principali.	Or it is an apostema in the main member: because if you delay its perforation until it matures, it will harm either that one or through that main member.
Aut est prope anum, perfora ergo ipsum immaturum: et non oportet, ut perfores, apostema crudum, non completae digestionis, nisi quod est prope anum, ut non putrefiat profundum, et longetur ad interiora ani, et fiat fistula, aut fiat in termino eius quod non sanatur.	Or it is near the anus, therefore perforate it unripe: and it's not necessary to perforate a raw and incomplete apostema, except when it is near the anus, so that it doesn't putrefy deeply and prolong itself to the interior of the anus, and become a fistula, or remain at its end which will not heal.
Oportet ut scias horam perforationis apostematis, quod maturatum est secundum complementum: et est apud sedationem doloris, recessionem febris, et diminutionem rubedinis, et pulsationis, et acuitatem capitis apostematis: et reliqua signa.	It is necessary that you know the hour of perforation of an apostema, which has matured according to its complement; and it is in sedation of pain, recession of fever, diminution of redness, pulsation, and acuteness of the apostema's head: and other signs.
Et oportet, ut facias eandem perforationem in inferiori loco apostematis, et uehementioris eminentiae: et sit perforatio uadens in longitudine corporis, si apostemata sunt in partibus manuum et pedum, et locis lacertorum, et chordarum, et neruorum, et arteriarum, et ad ultimum in omnibus locis aequalibus, quibus non est reflexio.	And it is necessary that you make the same perforation in the lower part of the apostema and more prominent prominence: and let the perforation go along the length of the body, if apostemas are in the parts of hands and feet, and places of arms, and tendons, and nerves, and arteries, and finally in all equal places where there is no reflexion.
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.	But in those that are reflected, proceed with the perforation according to that member.
Quando uero apostema est in locis carnosis: tunc melius est ut dimittas perforationem eius, donec confirmetur eius digestio, sicut diximus secundum complementum.	When however the apostema is in fleshy places: then it is better to leave off its perforation until its digestion is confirmed, just as we said according to its complement.
Quoniam si tu perforas ipsum ante illud, prolongatur cursus uirus ex eo, et est multae sordis et sordiciei, et fortasse indurantur labia eius, et profunditas eius.	Because if you pierce it before that, the course of the virus is prolonged from it, and there are many impurities and corruption, and perhaps its lips become hardened, and its depth.
Et quaedam apostemata perforantur secundum latitudinem corporis apud necessitatem: aut secundum illud quo indiget membrum.	And some apostemas are pierced according to the width of the body in necessity, or according to that which the member needs.
Et oportet, ut administres in apostematibus paruis perforationem paruam, et in apostematibus magnis perforationem amplam: aut sectiones multas per similitudinem magnitudinis apostematis.	And it is necessary that you administer a small perforation to small apostemas, and a large perforation to great ones: or multiple sections according to the similarity of the size of the apostema.
Et sunt ex apostematibus, in quibus oportet ut concauetur cutis: et incidatur quando iam facta est sicut pannus, et facta est in termino, quod iam mortua est: sicut illud quod accidit in multis, ut dubelet, et bubonibus.	And there are apostemas from which the skin must be cleansed: and it must be cut when it has become like a cloth, and it has reached its term, that is already dead: just as what happens to many, such as boils, and bubos.
Et ex eis sunt quae secantur sectione habente tres angulos.	And there are some which are cut with a section having three angles.
Et ex eis est, ex quo inciditur sicut figura folii myrti.	And there is one from which it is cut like the figure of a myrtle leaf.
Sicut apostema inguinum.	As an inguinal abscess.
Et ex eis sunt in quibus administratur sectio rotunda, et sectio lunaris: et similes eis ex sectionibus.	And from these are those in which the circular incision and the crescent-shaped incision are performed; and similar ones among the sections.
Illud uero cui non est caput, sicut sunt apostemata lenia superficialia, oportet ut perfores ipsum perforatione superficiali, uel plana tantum.	However, that which does not have a head, such as mild and superficial abscesses, should be punctured with a superficial incision or merely flattened.
Et oportet, quando apostema est grossum, et iam collegit saniem multam, et perforas ipsum, ut non properes et extrahas pus totum in illa hora: imo extrahe ex ipso partem eius.	And it is necessary when the abscess is large and has collected a great deal of pus, and you pierce it, so that you do not hasten to remove all the pus at once from that moment; rather, take some of it out from there.
Deinde opila apostema usque ad diem alium.	Then dress the abscess with an ointment up to another day.
Deinde extrahe quiddam ex pus iterum.	Then draw out something from the pus again.
Fac illud multotiens secundum gradationem, donec egrediatur: praecipue si infirmus est debilis uirtutis, aut mulier praegnans, aut puer paruus, aur senex decrepitus: spiritus enim animalis ab animali multotiens resoluitur cum egressione saniei: et fortasse moritur infirmus, et tu non percipis.	Do that many times according to the progression, until it goes out: especially if the patient is weak in strength, or a pregnant woman, or a young child, or an old decrepit person: for the spirit of the animal often dissolves with the evacuation of pus: and perhaps the sick person dies, and you do not perceive.
Caue ergo hoc capitulum cautela magna.	Be therefore cautious in this chapter with great caution.
Et post perforationem tuam, qua ista perforas apostemata, oportet ut abstergas uulnus: et considera.	And after your incision, by which you make the incisions on abscesses, it is necessary to wash the wound and observe.
Si ergo est uulnus apostematis paruum, aut est sectio plana, tunc administra licinia ex lino, aut coto antiquo.	If therefore the wound of an abscess is small or it is a flat incision, then apply linen from flax or old cotton.
Et si est apostema magnum, et fissurae perforationis multae sunt, oportet tunc ut intromittas in omnem fissuram licinium, donec perueniant adinuicem.	And if the abscess is great and there are many openings of the incision, then it is necessary to insert linen into every opening until they all reach each other.
Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.	And if in the abscess you have cut away a part of the skin, or hollowed out the surrounding area: then it is necessary to fill it with old cotton, or as when a cloth is stitched together, or by filling it with flax without moisture: and bind it tightly for three days.
Deinde proiice ipsum, et cura illud cum eo quod oportet ex unguento, donec sanetur.	Then throw away the dressing, and take care of that which is necessary with ointment until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis in hora tuae operationis, tunc administra aquam frigidam, et acetum, postquam imbibitur in eis pannus: et ponis ipsum super locum fluxus sanguinis multotiens.	If however a bleeding occurs during your operation hour, then administer cold water and vinegar, after the cloth has been soaked in them: and place it on the site of the bleeding many times.
Si autem perseuerat fluxus sanguinis, tunc oportet ut administres regimen, et curationem, et pulueres, quae narraui in locis multis huius nostri libri, et ex diuisione.	But if the bleeding persists, then you should administer a remedy, and treatment, and powders, which I have narrated in many places of this our book, and from division.
Si autem est in tempore hyemis, et locus apostematis est multorum neruorum: tunc oportet ut infundas puluillos cum uino, et oleo calidis: et ponas eos super loca.	But if it is winter time, and the location of the abscess is among many nerves: then you should pour poultices with wine and hot oil: and place them on the areas.
Et si fuerit in aestate, et loca sunt carnosa: tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos imbibitos in aqua, et oleo, aut eum uino et oleo, et totum illud frigidum.	And if it is summer, and the areas are fleshy: then you should place poultices soaked in water and oil, or with wine and oil, and the whole thing will be cold.
Donec quando erit dies tertius, sicut diximus, tunc oportet ut soluas apostema, et abstergas ipsum, et administres in curatione eius quod ei conuenit, donec sanetur.	Until the third day, as we said, then you should open the abscess, and wash it, and administer to its cure what is fitting for it, until it heals.
Hoc est ergo quod necessarium est ex cognitione curationis apostematum uniuersaliter.	This is therefore what is necessary from knowing the universal cure of abscesses.
Secundum semitam uero distinctionis, iam dixi de omni apostemate, qualiter est uia ad curationem eius capitulatim singulariter.	According to the manner of true division, I have already said about every abscess, how is the way to its cure separately by chapter.
¶ De sectione apostematum quae accidunt in cute capitis.	About the section on abscesses that occur on the scalp of the head.
Caput XLI.	Chapter 41.
Accidunt in cute capitis apostemata parua, et sunt ex speciebus Nodorum, quos continent tunicae, quae sunt eis sacci: quasi ipsa sint hausolati gallinae.	Abscesses occur on the scalp of the head, small ones, and they are of the species called Nodi, which are contained in the tunics that surround them, as if they were hatched from a hen.
Et ipsorum species sunt multae.	And their species are many.
Ex eis sunt pingues: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditatem similem limo: et ex eis quae continent humiditatem similem frisatis et pultibus: et eis similibus, et ex eis sunt, quae sunt lapidea dura.	From these there are fat ones: and from these there are those that contain moisture similar to mud: and from these there are those that contain moisture similar to moss and poultices: and others like them, and from these there are hard and rocky ones.
Et in sectione omnium, et ipsorum extractione non est timor, dum apud ipsorum sectionem non facit contrarietatem arteria.	And in the section of all of them, and their extraction is not feared, as long as it does not make opposition to an artery.
Et operatio in sectione eorum est, ut experiaris ea cum instrumento, cuius forma uenit post haec, quod nominatur Intromissum, donec scias quid contineat.	And the operation on their section is that you try them out with an instrument whose shape comes after these things, which is called an Intromissum, until you know what it contains.
Nam si est illud quod continet humiditas, tunc seca ipsum sectione secundum longitudinem sectione superficiali: secundum hanc formam.	For if that which contains humidity is present, then cut off the section according to the length of the superficial section: in this manner.
Et incipe cum sectione ex linea b. ad lineam, g. Cum ergo euacuatur humiditas, tunc excoria kistin quae continet illam humiditatem, et non dimittas ex ea aliquid penitus.	And begin with the section from line b to line g. When the humidity is evacuated, then scrape off the crust that contains that humidity, and do not leave anything at all from it.
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.	For many times it will return if something remains of it.
Deinde submerge cotum in unguento aegyptio, si est praesens: et si non, in aqua et sale: et imple cum eo uulnus, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then immerse the wound in Egyptian ointment if it is present; and if not, in water and salt: and fill it with that until another day.
Ipsum enim corrodet quod remansit ex kisti.	For it eats away what remains of the crust.
Deinde itera super ipsum cotum cum aegyptio secundo, et tertio, et si indiges illo, donec confidas quia non remanserit ex kisti aliquid, tunc enim cura uulnus cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the application of Egyptian ointment over the wound a second and third time, and if you need it, continue until you are confident that nothing remains of the crust; then indeed care for the wound with ointment until it heals.
Quod si apostema continet nodum pinguem: tunc seca ipsum secundum hanc formam, sectione habente formam crucis: et proiice uncinos inter duolabia sectionis, et excoria ipsum ab omni parte: et conare uirtutem tuam in extractione tunicae quae continet ipsum.	But if the apostema contains a fatty knot: then cut it off according to this shape, with a section having the form of a cross: and place thorns between the two lobes of the section, and scrape it off from all parts; and try your skill in extracting the cloth that contains it.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi arteria, tunc fac illud quod narrabo tibi post.	But if an artery makes opposition to you, then do what I will tell you afterwards.
Et similiter fac in apostemate, si est lapideum, ex sectione, et curatione eadem, secundum quod diximus.	And similarly act on the apostema if it is stony, from the section and same cure, according to what we said.
Et sectio super apostema lapideum est facilior: quoniam est pauci sanguinis et humiditatis.	And the section over a stony apostema is easier: since it has little blood and moisture.
Et quandoque sunt quaedam horum apostematum quae sunt in capite in quibusdam hominibus, cum quibus penitus non est humiditas.	And sometimes there are certain of these apostemas that are on the head of some people, with which there is no moisture at all.
Quod est: quia ego secui super apostema in capite mulieris uetulae, et inueni apostema sicut lapis solidus et durus, asper, albus, qui non poterat frangi: et si percuteretur cum eo aliquis proiiciendo, uulnerat ipsum.	What is this? Because I saw a boil on the head of an old woman, and I found it like a solid, hard, rough, white stone that could not be broken; and if someone struck it with force, throwing something at it, he would wound himself.
In aliis uero apostematibus accidentibus in capite, praeter haec scilicet apostemata quae accidunt in capitibus puerorum, et apud radices aurium, sectio eorum omnium sit sectio superficialis.	However, in other boils that occur on the head, except for those that occur on the heads of boys and at the roots of the ears, all their section should be a superficial one.
Vel pone perforationem eorum semper ab inferiori parte eorum, ut alleuietur cursus saniei ad inferiora.	Or make an incision in them always from the lower part of them, so that the flow of pus may be relieved to below.
Deinde cura ea cum eo quod conuenit eis ex curatione.	Then care for it as is fitting with regard to its cure.
¶ De sectione Strophularum in collo.	Of the Section of Abscesses on the Neck.
Caput XLII.	Chapter 42.
Multotiens acccidunt ista apostemata in collo, et sub assellis, et inguinibus: et quandoque accidunt in reliquo corpore.	These boils often occur on the neck and under the armpits and in the groin; and sometimes they occur in other parts of the body.
Et super illa quae ex eis accidunt in collo, sunt unum, et multa: et generantur ab inuicem: et omnis Strophula ex eis est intra tunicam propriam ei, sicut est in nodis et apostematibus capitis, sicut narrauimus.	And as for those that occur on the neck, there is one kind and many kinds, and they are generated from each other; and every abscess among them is within its own natural envelope, just like those of the head, as we have described.
Et species harum Strophularum sunt multae.	And the types of these abscesses are many.
Et ex eis enim sunt lapideae: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates: et ex eis sunt malignae, quae non obediunt curationi.	And among them there are stone-like ones; and some that contain humors; and some that are malignant, which do not obey treatment.
In illa ergo quam ex eis uides bonae dispositionis in tactu, cuius manifestum est propinquum colori cutis, et mouetur ad omnem partem, et non est annexa cum neruis colli, neque cum guidegi, neque cum arteria, neque est profunda: oportet ut seces eam sectione superficiali a superiori parte ad inferiorem partem corporis ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. et excoria eam ab omni parte: et extende duo labia cutis cum uncino, aut cum uncinis multis, si indiges illo, sicut diximus in apostematibus capitis, et extrahe eam paulatim.	Therefore, if you see one of good condition among them, which is evident by its proximity to the color of the skin, and it moves in every direction, and is not attached to the nerves of the neck, nor to the muscles, nor to the artery, nor is it deep: it is necessary to cut it with a superficial incision from the upper part of the body down to the lower part, along the line b. up to the line g., and scrape it off from every part; and stretch two flaps of skin with a hook or many hooks, if you need to, just as we said about boils on the head, and extract it gradually.
Et est super cautelam, ut non incidatur uena, aut neruus.	And it is said regarding caution, that one should not cut a vein, or a nerve.
Et sit spatumile non acutum ualde: ut non addat tibi manum tuam cum incisione, aut inquietet infirmum, et incidas quod non est necesse.	And let it not be a sharp splinter very much: so that you do not put your hand to the cutting with the incision, or disturb the patient, and cut what is not necessary.
Si autem incidis uenam, aut arteriam, aut prohibet te ab operatione, tunc pone in uulnus zegi tritum, aut quosdam pulueres qui abscindunt sanguinem, et stringe uulnus, et dimitte ipsum, donec quiescat acuitas apostematis, et mollificetur uulnus: uel incipit et uult putrefieri.	But if you cut a vein or artery, then forbade from the operation, then place in the wound some powdered alum, or certain powders that stop bleeding, and bind up the wound, and let it alone until the sharpness of the abscess subsides, and the wound softens; or it will begin to putrefy.
Nam sanguis abscinditur tuncia Redi ergo ad operationem tuam, donec compleas.	For blood is stopped by tunica. Therefore, return to your operation until you complete it.
Deinde inquire digito tuo indice, si remansit aliquid ex Strophulis aliis paruis: ergo incide eas, et munda eas.	Then inspect with your finger, if anything remains of other small stumps; therefore cut them and cleanse them.
Quod si est in radice Strophulae uena magna: tunc oportet ut non incidas illam Strophulam ex radice sua: imo oportet ut liges eam cum filo duplato forti, et dimittas eam donec cadat per se absque nocumento.	But if it is in the root of a stump a great vein; then you must not cut that stump from its own root: rather you must bind it with a doubled strong thread and let it go until it falls off by itself without harm.
Deinde imple uulnus coto ueteri, quod iam submersisti in unguento aegyptio.	Then fill the wound with old lint that you have already dipped in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum.	Then take care of it.
Si inciditur Strophula tota, tunc oportet ut aggreges labia duo uulneris: et suas ipsum statim, postquam uides quia prorsus non remansit superfluitas.	If a stump is cut entirely, then you must gather up the two lips of the wound and set it straight away as soon as you see that there is no excess remaining.
Si autem uides quod remansit superfluitas propter magnitudinem Strophulae, tunc oportet ut intendas ad incidendam radicem eius, et extrahendam eam: et administra suturam quam diximus.	But if you see that there is excess remaining due to the size of the stump, then you must turn your attention to cutting at the root of it and pulling it out; and apply the suture as we have said.
Et quae ex Strophulis continet humiditates, perfora illam perforatione superficiali: ut appareat tibi locus maturitatis eius: et pone perforationem ab eo quod sequitur inferius corporis, sicut diximus.	And what contains moisture from the stumps, pierce it with a superficial piercing, so that you may see the location of its maturity; and place the piercing below that which follows lower in the body, as we have said.
Deinde administra post perforationem licinia cum unguento, et similia eis, ut corrodat quod remansit ex corruptione, donec quando uides uulnus iam mundatum esse: tunc cura ipsum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then administer licinia after perforation with ointment and similar things to cover what remains from the corruption, until you see the wound is now cleansed. Then cure it with ointment generated by the flesh, until it heals.
¶ De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.	¶ On the section of the epiglottis from an abscess occurring within the throat.
Caput XLIII.	Chapter 43.
Dixerunt antiqui hanc sectionem in Epigloti, et non uidi aliquem in terra nostra, qui eam fecerit: et haec est scriptura sermonis eorum.	The ancients said that this section is done on the epiglottis, and I have not seen anyone in our land who has done it; and this is the writing of their speech.
In habentibus autem synanchiam, oportet ut deuitetur sectio Epiglotis: cum non fiat iuuamentum per illud: propterea, quod omnes uenae et pulmo sunt infirmi.	However, in those having synciesis, it is necessary to avoid section of the epiglottis: since no benefit would come from it, because all veins and lung are weak.
In illis uero qui habent apostema calidum in ore, aut gutture, aut duabus amigdalis, quando non est aegritudo in cannali, oportet uti sectione Epiglotis, ad fugiendum ex perditione quae fit ex praefocatione.	In those who have a warm abscess in the mouth or throat or both tonsils, when there is no distress in the canal, it is necessary to use the section of the epiglottis to avoid the destruction that occurs from obstruction.
Oportet ergo quando uolumus illud, ut secemus Epiglotim sub tribus circulis Epiglotis, aut quatuor, sectione parua per latitudinem, in eo quod est inter duos circulos per quantitatem, quod sit sectio in sifac, non in cartilagine: et iste quidem locus est conueniens sectioni, quoniam est priuatus carne, et uasa sanguinis ab eo sunt longinqua.	Therefore, when we want to do it, we must cut the epiglottis under three or four circles of the epiglottis, with a small section by breadth, in that which is between two circles according to quantity, so that the section is in the sifac not in cartilage: and this place indeed is suitable for the section, since it is deprived of flesh, and the vessels of blood are distant from it.
Quod si medicator est timidus, tunc oportet ut extendat cutem gutturis cum uncino.	But if the surgeon is timid, then it is necessary that he stretches the throat with a hook.
Deinde findat cutem, donec quando peruenit ad cannalem: deuitet uas sanguinis, si uidet ex eis aliquid.	Then he should probe the cut, until he reaches the canal; and if he sees anything from the vessels of blood, he should avoid it.
Deinde secet sifac quod narrauimus: et significatur super sectionem cannalis ex phlegmate quod egreditur ex ea, cum eo quod disrumpitur, et abscisione uocis.	Then he should cut the sifac as we have described; and it signifies above the section of the canal from the phlegm that issues forth from it, when it is ruptured, and the separation of the voice.
Et dimitte uulnus apertum tempore aliquo.	And let go an open wound in due time.
Cum ergo remouetur hora in qua timetur praefocatio, aggrega duo labia uulneris cutis, et sue ipsam solam absque cartilagine.	When then the hour comes that one fears inflammation, gather together the two lips of the wound skin, and alone without cartilage.
Deinde administra medicinas quae faciunt nasci carnem, usquequo sanetur.	Then administer medicines which make flesh grow, until it heals.
Inquit Albucasis.	Albucasis says.
Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: uadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.	The sum of this discourse which we have narrated is not an exposition, unless when they see that some of these abscesses has already obstructed the patient's throat: and the patient is lifted up above death, and wants to be cut open for his breath: they go to incise the Epiglottis, so that the patient may breathe over the wound in a certain respiration, and be saved from death: and on account of this they have commanded to leave an open wound, until the malice of the sickness is consumed, and it is three days old, and almost itself: then therefore they have commanded to sew up the wound, and cure it, until it heals.
Et illud quod uidi per me ipsum est, quod una ancilla accaepit cultellum, et misit cum in guttur suum, et incidit cum eo partem cannalis pulmonis.	And what I saw by myself is, that one servant girl received a knife, and sent it with into her own throat, and cut with it part of the windpipe.
Et uocatus sum ad curationem eius, et inueni eam mugire, sicut est mugitus mortui.	And I was called to cure her, and I found her groaning like a dead person's death rattle.
Detexi ergo a uulnere, et inueni sanguinem qui egressus fuerat ex uulnere paruum.	I therefore removed the stitch from the wound, and I found a little blood that had flowed out of the wound.
Confisus ergo sum, quod ipsa non absciderat uenam, neque guidegi: et uentus egrediebatur ex uulnere.	I therefore trusted that she had not cut the vein nor guided it: and the wind was issuing forth from the wound.
Properaui ergo, et sui uulnus, et curaui ipsum, donec sanum est: et non accidit ancillae aliquid, nisi raucedo in uoce: et rediit post dies ad meliorem dispositionum suarum.	I therefore hastened and attended to her wound, and cured it until she was healthy: and nothing befell the servant girl except a slight hoarseness of voice: and she returned after days to better state of her affairs.
Hinc ergo dico: quod in sectione Epiglotis non est timor.	Therefore I say: that there is no fear in cutting the Epiglottis.
¶ De sectione Herniae gutturis.	Concerning the cutting of a hernia of the throat.
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter 44.
Hoc Apostema nominatum Hernia gutturis, est apostema magnum, secundum colorem corporis: et est in mulieribus multum.	This is called a throat hernia or apostema, a great swelling according to the complexion of the body; and it is very common in women.
Et est secundum duos modos: aut enim est naturale: aut est accidentale.	And it occurs in two ways: either it is natural: or it is accidental.
In naturali certe non est ingenium.	In the natural one, certainly not a defect.
Accidentale uero est secundum duos modos: quorum unus est similis nodis pinguibus.	The accidental one however is in two ways: of which one is similar to fatty knots.
Et modus alter, est similis apostemati quod fit ex nodatione arteriae.	And the other method is similar to the swelling that occurs from arterial constriction.
Et in ipso est timor, et non oportet ut praesumptio fiat ad ipsum cum ferro, nisi in eo quod est paruum: et tu proba ipsum, et inuestiga ipsum cum Intromisso.	And there is fear; and one should not make a presumption about it with iron, unless it is small; and you should test it and investigate it with an instrument.
Si ergo inuenis ipsum simile nodo pingui, et non est suspensum cum aliqua uenarum: tunc seca ipsum, sicut secantur nodi: et extrahe ipsum cum eo quod continet ex kisti, si est in kisti: et si non, tunc perscrutare totum eius.	So if you find it similar to a fatty knot, and it is not suspended with any veins; then cut it, just as knots are cut: and remove it along with what contains it from the chest, if it is in the chest; and if not, then examine the whole of it.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod oportet ex curatione, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the place with that which is necessary for healing, until it is healed.
¶ De sectione super species Nodorum.	Concerning the cutting above the appearance of knots.
Caput XLV.	Chapter 45.
Nodorum multae sunt species, et ego iam dixi omnes species eorum in diuisione: et oportet ut narrem hic differentiam inter Nodum, et Exituram: cum sit dubitationem faciens.	There are many kinds of knots, and I have already mentioned all their kinds in division; and it is necessary for me to relate here the difference between a knot and an exitura: since it causes doubt.
Dico ergo, quod cum Exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolores uehementes, donec sedatur ebullitio superfluitatis, et completur putrefactio: tunc enim quiescunt febris et calor.	I say therefore that when an exitura is heat, and fever, and severe pains, until the effusion of superfluity subsides and putrefaction is completed: then indeed the fevers and heat cease.
Cum Nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis saccus proprius, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaeptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.	When a knot is indeed not heat, nor fever, nor pains, and contains the contents of the chest which is a sac proper to it, and is according to the complexion of the body: and is an incision of them like cress, and becomes like a boil, and greater or less.
Et sunt secundum duas species: aut pingues: aut continent humiditatem.	And they are according to two species: either fatty: or containing moisture.
Et colores humiditatis sunt multi, secundum quod dixi in diuisione.	And the colors of moisture are many, as I said in division.
Oportet ergo, quando peruenis ad curationem Nodi, ut experiaris eum, et inquiras ipsum in primis cum instrumento quod nominatur Intromissum, secundum quod ueniet forma eius in capitulo quod est post hoc.	Therefore, when you come to the treatment of a Knot, you should test it and inquire into its nature with the instrument that is called the Intromissive, according to what its form will be in the chapter that follows this.
Et modus inquisitionis apostematum, et Nodorum omnium est, ut accipias hoc instrumentum, et intromittas ipsum in humidiorem locum, quem inuenis in apostemate: et tu reuolue digitos tuos cum eo paulatim, donec scias quod instrumentum iam penetrauit cutem.	And the method of inquiry into all apostems and knots is, to take this instrument and introduce it into a moister place which you find in the apostem: and then turn back your fingers with it gradually, until you know that the instrument has pierced the skin.
Deinde ultima manum tuam secundum mensuram magnitudinis apostematis.	Then use your last finger according to the measurement of the size of the apostem.
Deinde extrahe Intromissum, et considera illud quod egrediur in uestigio eius.	Then withdraw the Intromissive and observe what comes out in its wake.
Si ergo egreditur humiditas currens, quicunque color sit: tunc seca ipsum sectione superficiali, secundum quod dixi in reliquis apostematibus.	If then fluidity flowing with any color comes out, then cut it off with a superficial incision, as I said in the other apostems.
Et si non egreditur humiditas in uestigio Intromissi, tunc scias quia est pinguis: seca ergo super ipsum sectione habente formam crucis, secundum formam hanc, sicut docui te: et suspende ipsum cum uncinis, et excoria cutem ab omni parte cum facilitate: et custodi kistin si potes super illud, ut extrahas ipsam sanam cum Nodo.	And if no fluidity comes out in the wake of the Intromissive, then you will know that it is fatty: cut off therefore above it with an incision having the shape of a cross, according to this form as I taught you: and suspend it with sutures, and remove the skin from all around with ease: and preserve the cistern if you can over it, in order to extract the healthy part along with the Knot.
Si autem disrumpitur kistis apud operationem, et non est possibile extrahere ipsam sanam, multotiens enim accidit illud, tunc extrahe ipsam frustatim, donec non remaneat ex ea aliquid.	But if the cistern is torn apart during the operation, and it is not possible to extract the healthy part, for often that happens, then cut out the healthy part in small pieces, until nothing remains of it.
Nam si remanet ex ea aliquid parum, aut multum, redit Nodus secundum plurimum.	For if anything at all remains, a little or much, the Knot returns according to most cases.
Quod si uincit te, et remanet ex eo parum: tunc imple uulnus apud completionem tuam, quibusdam pulueribus corrosiuis acutis: et stringe uulnus, et pone supra ipsum quod sedet apostema calidum, et cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	And if it prevails over you, and a little remains: then fill the wound at your completion with certain corroding powders: and bind up the wound, and place above it what lies apostematic, hot, and cure it with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
Si ergo est Nodus magnus, tunc sue duo labia eius, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat.	If then there is a great knot, then two lips of it and care for it with what encircles.
Si autem est tibi contraria uena pulsatilis, aut non pulsatilis: tunc propera, et imple locum zegi trito, et dimitte ipsum strictum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec putrefiat uulnus, et quiescat ebullitio sanguinis: deinde redi ad incidendum illud quod remansit ex Nodo.	But if there is a vein to you that pulsates or does not pulsate: then hasten, and fill the place with ground pumice, and let it be tight for two days, or three, until the wound becomes putrid and the bubbling of blood subsides: then return to cutting what remains from the knot.
¶ De foris instrumentorum pro sectione et perforatione.	About the instruments of the outside for incision and piercing.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter 46.
EX Eis sunt formae Intromissorum, et sunt trium specierum.	There are three forms of introducers, and they are of three kinds.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et ex eis est medium, et ex eis est paruum.	Of these there is a large one, and of these there is a middle-sized one, and of these there is a small one.
Fiant ex ferro alfulud quadratarum extremitatum decenter, ut festinent introitum in apostemate.	Let them be made from iron with four-sided ends, having been shaped at the edges, so that they may facilitate entrance into an abscess.
Et istae sunt formae Experientium, et no, id est, perforantia: et unum eorum nominatur beris, idest, peforans: et sunt trium specierum.	And these are the forms of Probing instruments, and no, that is, piercing ones: and one of them is called Beris, that is, piercing one: and there are three kinds.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et medium, et paruum.	Of these there is a large one, and a middle-sized one, and a small one.
Conueniunt, ut inuestigentur per ea apostemata, et exiturae, et fistulae, et bubones ab eo quod inter ea est ex ossibus.	They concur so that through them abscesses, and exits, and fistulas, and boils may be investigated as to what is between the bones.
Et aliis fiunt rotunda, tersa, lenia, sicut acus magnae quibus subsellia suuntur, ex citrino scilicet, aut ex aere, aut ferro, aut argento.	And others are made round, smooth, and soft, like large needles with which seats are upholstered, from citron wood, or from bronze, or iron, or silver.
Et meliora eorum sunt quae fiunt ex citrino.	And the better ones of these are those that are made from citron.
Et fiunt Experientia etiam de plumbo nigro, quae conueniunt ut per ea experiantur fistulae, quarum concauitate sunt reflexiones, ut reflectantur cum lenitate sua cum illis reflexionibus.	And they are also made from black lead, which concur so that through them one may experiment with fistulas, the concavities of which are reflections, in order to be reflected with their own softness against those reflections.
Et sunt iterum trium specierum.	And there are again three kinds.
Quoniam ex eis sunt longa, ex eis media, et ex eis breuia, secundum quantitatem amplitudinis fistulae et stricturae eius.	Because from these there are long ones, from these middle-sized ones, and from these short ones, according to the quantity of the width of the fistula and its constriction.
Forma Vncinorum, et sunt multarum specierum.	The form of bandages, and there are many species.
Quoniam ex eis sunt simplices, scilicet quibus est curuitas una: et sunt trium specierum sicut uides, Magni, Medii, et Parui.	Because from these [bandages] there are simple ones, namely those with one curve: and there are three species, as you see, Great, Middle, and Small.
Et ex eis sunt Vncini caeci: et sunt trium specierum.	And from these [bandages] there are blind bandages: and there are three species.
Et ex eis sunt uncini habentes duas curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et ex eis sunt uncini habentes tres curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et omnes isti sunt necessarii in loco suo.	And from these [bandages] there are bandages having two curves, and there are three species: and from these there are bandages having three curves, and there are three species: and all of these are necessary in their place.
Et istae sunt formae Scalpellorum, quibus secantur et excoriantur Nodi, et apostemata: et sunt trium specierum: quoniam ex eis est magnum, medium, et paruum.	And these are the forms of scalpels, with which one cuts and removes knots, and apostemes: and there are three species: because from them is great, middle, and small.
Eorum extremitates quibus fit sectio sunt acutae, extremitates aliae sunt non acutae: et non ponuntur taliter, nisi ut cum eis fiat iuuamentum in excoriatione Nodorum apud timorem incisionis uenae, aut nerui: et ut sanetur per ea infirmus, et inueniat tranquillitatem parumper ex adustione quam inuenit apud excoriationem apostematis.	Their ends with which the cutting is done are sharp, other ends are not sharp: and they are not placed thus, unless it be that with them there may be advantage in removing knots at the fear of incising a vein or nerve: and that the one who is sick may be healed by them, and find tranquility for a brief time after burning which he finds at the removal of an aposteme.
Istae sunt Magda, et sunt specierum trium.	These are Madges, and there are three species.
Fiunt ex aere, et sunt similia Radio, cum quo fit alcohol: et in extremitate lata est puncta Spatumilis occultata: et in ea currit ad interiora, et ad exteriora quando uis, sicut uides.	They are made of bronze, and they are similar to Radii, with which one makes an alloy: and at the wide end there is a hidden point of Spatumilis: and it flows inwardly and outwardly when you will, as you see.
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magnum, medium, et paruum.	The form of Spatumilis which are hidden between the fingers at the perforation of apostemes: and the sick do not perceive them: and there are three species, great, middle, and small.
Fomae Ventosarum cum quibus abscinditur fluxus sanguinis: et sunt trium specierum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.	The forms of Ventosars with which the flow of blood is stopped: and there are three species, great, middle, and small.
Fiant ex aere, aut citrino, rotundae, ad longitudinem parumper, sicut uides: et sint ad subtilitatem.	They should be made of bronze or citrine, rounded, for a length somewhat, as you see: and they should be to subtlety.
Et oportet ut sint istae species Ventosarum apud te magnae, et paruae: ut abscindas per eas sanguinem cum uelocitate apud necessitatem, et tunc quando non est tibi praesens medicina.	And it is necessary that these kinds of poultices be with you both great and small: so that you may cut away blood quickly in need, and then when medicine is not present to you.
Verumtamen non utaris eis in abscisione sanguinis in omni loco corporis, et non utaris nisi in locis carnosis: sicut lacertis cruris, et coxae, et lacertis brachiorum, et mammillarum, et uentris, et inguinum, et similibus eis, ex lacertis carnosis, humidis.	However, you should not use them for the lancing of blood in every part of the body, and you should only use them on fleshy parts: such as the arms, thighs, shoulders, breasts, belly, groin, and similar areas from fleshy, moist places.
Et quandoque fiunt ex eis instrumenta parua alia similia corticibus fisticorum, secundum suam formam: quibus abscinditur sanguis quando fluit ex loco phlebotomiae, aut apud incisionem uenae, aut arteriae: et quandoque fiunt ex eis rotundae secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes instruments are made from them that are small and similar to the rinds of pomegranates, according to their shape; with which blood is cut away when it flows from a phlebotomy, or at the incision of a vein, or artery: and sometimes they are rounded in this shape.
¶ De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.	About the care of men's breasts which resemble those of women.
Caput XLVII.	Chapter 47.
Quandoque inflantur Mammillae quorundam hominum apud complementum somni (id est, cum incipiunt pollui in somno) donec similantur mammillis mulierum: et remanent apostemosae foede.	Sometimes the breasts of certain men are inflated during sleep (that is, when they start to emit emissions while sleeping) until they resemble those of women; and remain foul and swollen.
Qui ergo abhorret illud, oportet ut secet super mammillas sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Deinde excoria pinguedinem totam.	Therefore, whoever is disgusted by this, should cut on the breasts in a lunar fashion, according to this shape from line b to line g. Then scrape off all the fatness.
Postea imple uulnus ex medicamine incarnatiuo.	Then fill the wound with medicinal ointment.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then gather together the two edges of the wound with a suture, and care for it until it is healed.
Si autem declinat mammilla ad inferiora, et mollificatur propter magnitudinem suam, sicut accidit mulieribus: tunc oportet ut findatur in duobus lateribus suis superioribus duabus sectionibus similibus figurae lunari, quarum unaquaeque continetur cum altera apud fines utriusque, donec sit linea maior continens minorem, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Postea excoria cutem quae est inter duo labia, et aufer pinguedinem, et administra quod diximus de sutura et pulueribus, quod est necessarium ex curatione, donec sanetur.	But if the breast should sag downwards and soften due to its size, as happens with women: then it is necessary to cut along both upper sides of the breast in two sections similar to a lunar shape, each containing the other at their ends, until there is a larger line containing a smaller one, according to this shape from line b to line g. Then scrape off the skin which is between the two edges, and remove the fatness, and administer what we said about suturing and powdering, which is necessary for healing, until it is healed.
Si autem non comples incisionem eius quod oportet te incidere, propter inquietudinem infirmi, aut propter fluxum sanguinis: tunc oportet ut impleas uulnus coto submerso unguento corrosiuo, et dimitte ipsum, donec corrodat illud quod remansit ex pinguedine.	If however you do not make the incision that is necessary for you to make it, because of the patient's unrest or because of bleeding: then you must fill the wound with a poultice submerged in corrosive ointment, and let it be until what remains from fatness is consumed.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of him until he recovers.
¶ De perforatione apostematis, quod accidit sub Titillico.	About the puncturing of an abscess that occurs under Titillo.
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter 48.
Ista apostemata quae accidunt sub Titillico, sunt ex speciebus Strophularum dura, quae continet kistis, et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates.	These abscesses which occur under Titillo are of the type of hard Strophulae, which contain pus, and from these are those which contain humidity.
Quae ergo sunt ex eis quae continent humiditates, oportet ut secentur sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam, ex linea b. ad lineam, g. cum ergo euacuatur totum quod est in apostemate ex sanie, tunc imple ipsum coto ueteri, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Those which are from them that contain humidity, ought to be drained by a lunar incision, according to this form, from line b. to line g., and when all that is in the abscess has been evacuated with pus, then fill it with old poultice, and let it remain until another day.
Deinde auferatur cotum, et curetur cum unguento conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then remove the poultice and treat it with a suitable ointment until he recovers.
Quod si apostema fuerit ex specie nodorum Strophularum, tunc scinde super ipsum, sicut diximus in sectione super Strophulas aequaliter.	And if the abscess is of the type of hard Strophulae with knots, then cut above it as we said in the section on equal Strophulae.
Si autem extenditur uulnus in hoc ut emittat pus, tunc administra in eo cauterium, secundum quod diximus in eo quod praemissum est.	But if the wound extends so far that it emits pus, then apply a cautery to it, according to what was said above.
¶ De sectione apostematis quod accidit propter Arteriam et Venam.	About the incision of an abscess that occurs due to the Artery and Vein.
Caput XLIX.	Chapter 49.
Quando disrumpitur Arteria, et consolidatur cutis quae est supra eam, tuno multotiens accidit inde apostema: et similiter accidit Venae etiam, ut accidat in ea apostema et inflatio.	When the artery is ruptured and the skin above it becomes consolidated, then very often an abscess occurs from this; and similarly with a vein, so that an abscess and inflammation occur in it.
Et signa quibus cognoscitur, quod apostema et inflatio sint propter Arteriam et Venam, sunt: quoniam, quando apostema est propter arteriam, est longum, aggregatum in profundo corporis: et quando impellis apostema digits tuis, sentis quasi sit ei stridor.	And the signs by which one recognizes that an abscess and inflammation are caused by the Artery and Vein, are: because when the abscess is caused by the artery, it is long and aggregated in the depth of the body; and when you press the abscess with your fingers, you feel as if there is a hissing sound.
Et illud quod est propter Venam, est rotundum in manifesto corporis.	And that which is beside the vein is round in manifest body.
Et sectio super hoc apostema est error, et praecipue quod est sub ascellis, et inguinibus, et collo, et in locis multis corporis: et est magnum ualde.	And the section above this abscess is an error, and especially that which is under the armpits, and groin, and neck, and in many places of the body: and it is very great indeed.
Oportet ergo ut deuitetur eius cura cum ferro, et quod ex eis etiam est in extremitatibus, aut in capite, oportet ut deuitetur.	Therefore, the cure for this should be done with iron, and what is also found at the extremities or head, should also be removed.
Super illud ergo quod ex eis est ex inflatione orificii Arteriae, finde in cute sectione in longitudine.	Therefore, on that which comes from inflation of the artery's opening, find a section in the skin in length.
Deinde aperi sectionem cum uncinis, postea Arteriam: et libera eam ex tunicis, donec detegatur.	Then open the section with a hook, afterwards the artery; and free it from the tunics until it is uncovered.
Deinde intromitte sub ea acum, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, et stringe Arteriam cum filo duplo in duobus locis, secundum quod docui te in extractione duarum Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then introduce the awl beneath it, and make it penetrate until another side, and tie the artery with a double thread in two places, as I have taught you in the extraction of the two arteries that are in time.
Deinde punge locum, qui est inter duo ligamenta cum spatumili, donec egrediatur sanguis qui est in eo totus, et soluatur apostema.	Then puncture the place which is between two ligaments with a spatula, until all the blood that is in it goes out and the abscess is dissolved.
Deinde administra curationem quae generat pus, donec cadant ligamenta: postea cura illud cum unguentis conuenientibus ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then administer a treatment that produces pus, until the ligaments fall off; afterwards care for it with ointments suitable for it, until it heals.
Quod si fuerit apostema propter sectionem Venae, tunc oportet ut teneas manu tua quod tibi possibile est ex apostemate cum cute.	If the abscess is due to a vein section, then you should hold in your hand as much of the abscess with the skin as possible.
Deinde intromitte acum sub loco quem tenuisti manu tua, et fac eam penetrare: et sit in ea filum duplum, donec extrahas ipsum ex latere altero.	Then introduce the awl under the place you held with your hand, and make it penetrate; and let there be a double thread in it, until you pull it out from the other side.
Deinde liga cum ipso apostema ligamento bono: secundum quod dixi tibi in ligamento uuae, a duabus partibus cum duabus extremitatibus fili.	Then tie with the same abscess good ligament; according to what I told you about the ligament of the grape, from two sides with two ends of the thread.
Si autem times quod extrahatur filum, tunc intromitte acum aliam cum filo alio sub apostemate toto apud incisionem acus: preme, et stringe fila tua in quatuor locis.	But if you fear that the thread will be pulled out, then introduce another awl with another thread under the entire abscess at the cut of the awl; press, and tie your threads in four places.
Deinde seca apostema in medio sui, donec quando egreditur quod in eo est: tunc incide superfluitatem cutis, et dimitte quod ligatum est ex ea.	Then cut away the abscess from its middle until what is inside it comes out. Next, cut off any excess skin and let go of what is tied to it.
Deinde pone super ipsum puluillum quem submersisti in uino, et oleo.	Then place over it a poultice that you had soaked in wine and oil.
Deinde administra curationem, quae fit cum liciniis et unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then administer the treatment, which is done with liniments and ointments, until it heals.
¶ De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.	On the abscess that occurs from a twisting of the Nerves.
Caput L.	Chapter 31.
Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.	Just as an abscess occurs in the Artery and Vein, so too does an abscess occur in the Nerve: which occurs through a blow or excessive labor, and similar causes: and it happens most frequently to those in places of assistance, or heel, and in every place where joints move: and it is a grave abscess.
Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.	Its color resembles that of the rest of the body, and it is often found without pain, but when it is constricted with madness, the weak one feels like being struck with a numbness.
Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.	And it is not an abscess that forms deep within the body, but rather one that is situated under the skin, and it moves to every part, and does not go towards the front or before, nor behind to the back.
Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportet ut inuadatur cum ferro.	What is located among them in joints should not be cut into with iron.
Fortasse enim accidet contractio.	Perhaps even a contraction may occur.
In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.	But in the one that is located in the head or in the forehead, find the skin with a spatula-like tool.
Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.	If therefore it is a small abscess, then grasp it with forceps and cut it off at the root.
Et si est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uulnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if it is large, then suspend it with a hook, and scrape it off: afterwards remove it, and cover the wound with a suture: and care for it until it heals.
¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.	On the cutting of an abscess that occurs in the belly.
Caput LI.	Chapter 51.
Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.	Some people have many times in their entrails and in other parts of their bodies a condition that is called Fungalia, which is similar to mushrooms.
Quorum radix est subtilis, et ipsorum caput est grossum, et conuersa sunt labia eorum.	The root of these is fine, and the head of them is thick, and their lips are turned inward.
Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.	And it is small among them, and it is something that is greatly magnified among them.
Et ego quidem iam uidi uirum, et in uentre eius erant duo thelil, quae erant magis quam rebus aliis similia fungis: non erat differentia inter ea, alba, minutae radicis, et inuersabantur labia eorum, et findebantur, et humiditas currebat ex eis semper.	And I myself have already seen a man, and in his belly there were two Fungalia that were more like to other things than to mushrooms: there was no difference between them, white and fine roots, and their lips turned inward and ended, and moisture always flowed from them.
Incidi ergo ea, et inueni in pondere unius quasi X et VIII uncia et in altero quasi VI uncia Et operatio in incisione eorum est, ut consideres tunc, si infirmus est humidus, et color thelil est albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili lato, et sint in praesentia tua cauteria in igne.	I therefore cut into them and found one to weigh about 10 and 8 ounces, and the other about 6 ounces. The operation in cutting into them is this: that you then consider if the patient is damp, and the color of the Fungalia is white, damp, fine roots; then cut into it with a broad spatula, and have cauteries ready to be applied to them in fire.
Multotiens enim expellitur apud sectionem eius sanguis multus: propera ergo si te uincit sanguis, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	For often a great deal of blood is expelled during the section: therefore hurry if you are overcome by blood, then cauterize it.
Quod si uides infirmum pauidum et timidum ab incisione cum ferro, tunc accipe filum ex plumbo decenter factum, et stringe cum eo athelul: cuius modus est quem diximus, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	But if you see the patient pale and timid from incision with iron, then take a lead thread made of decent material, and tie it to him with athelum: whose method is what we said, and leave him for two days.
Deinde adde in strictura plumbi.	Then add the lead to the wound.
Non ergo cesses stringere plumbum, quotiens imprimit in thelil, donec abscindatur, et cadat per se absque labore.	Therefore do not stop tying on the lead as long as it causes trouble in the Fungalia, until it is cut off and falls apart of its own accord without effort.
Si autem thelil grossae fuerit radicis, tunc in incisione eius est quiddam timoris et pauoris: praecipue quod est in uentre.	But if the Fungalia has a thick root, then there is something to be feared and dreaded in its incision, especially since it is in the belly.
Verumtamen possibile est, ut incidas medietatem eius.	However, it is possible for you to cut through its middle.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum, ut non redeat.	Then he should cauterize it, so that it does not return.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then take care of it until the wound heals.
Et caue ne praesumas incidere thelil quod est fusci coloris, pauci sensus, foedi aspectus: ipsum enim est apostema cancerosum: et ego ueniam cum rememoratione Cancri post hoc.	And beware lest you presume to cut away that which is of a dull color, little sensation, foul appearance: for it is an apostematic cancer: and I come with the recollection of Cancer after this.
¶ De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.	On the treatment of a protruding Umbilicus.
Caput LII.	Chapter 52.
Fit eminentia Vmbilici ex caussis multis.	A protruding Umbilicus arises from many causes.
Aut ex fissuris sifac, quod super uentrem est: et exit ex eo althub, aut intestinum, secundum quod accidit in reliquis rupturis.	Or from fissures of the sheath, which is above the belly: and it comes out from there either the bladder or intestine, according to what happens in other ruptures.
Aut ex sanguine qui fluit ex Vena, aut ex Arteria, secundum quod praemissum est.	Or from blood flowing from a vein, or an artery, according to what has been mentioned before.
Aut ex uentositate coartata in eo.	Or from constriction of the belly in it.
Si autem est propter fissuram sifac, et exitum thirbi: tunc est color apostematis similis colori corporis: et est lene, absque dolore: et apparet diuersi situs.	But if it is due to a fissure of the sheath and a protrusion there: then it has the appearance of an apostematic color similar to the natural color of the body: and it is smooth, without pain: and appears in a different location.
Et si est propter egressionem intestini, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uehementioris diuersitatis.	And if it is due to the protrusion of the intestine, then its appearance is as we have described, with a more violent difference.
Cum ergo tu premis ipsum digitis tuis, occultatur: deinde redit, et fortasse est cum eo sonitus: et magnificatur multum apud introitum balnei, et laborem uehaementum.	When therefore you press it with your fingers, it becomes hidden: then it returns, and perhaps makes a sound: and it is greatly swollen at the entrance to the bath, and there is a violent effort.
Si uero est propter humiditatem, est lene, tunc non occultatur quando premis ipsum manu tua, neque constringium, neque additur.	If it is due to humidity, it is smooth: then it does not become hidden when you press it with your hand, nor is there constriction, nor is anything added.
Quod si est propter sanguinem, tunc cum istis signis apparet apostema ad nigredinem de cliue.	Which if it is due to blood, then with these signs an apostema appears as a blackening from the swelling.
Si autem est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.	But if it is due to natural flesh: then there is a grave, thick, hard apostema that fixes itself according to one quantity.
Si uero est propter uentositatem, tunc tactus eius est lenis.	If it is due to constriction, then the touch of it is smooth.
Et operatio in illo est, ut consideres tunc, si eminentia umbilici est propter sanguinem Arteriae, aut Venae, aut uentositatem: tunc oportet ut prohibearis a curatione eius.	And the operation is that you should then consider whether the prominence of the navel is due to blood from an artery, or vein, or swelling; then it is necessary to prevent its cure.
Nam in illo est timor et pauor, sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi apostemata propter arteriam et uenam.	For in that case there is fear and dread, just as I taught you in the chapter where I said that abscesses are due to an artery and a vein.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est propter intestinum, aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum, et stet stans extensus.	And if the prominence of the navel is due to the intestine or a tumor; then it is necessary for you to hasten the sick person's breathing and have him stand upright, stretched out.
Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.	Then mark with encaustum around the entire navel area.
Postea praecipe ei, ut resupinetur inter manus tuas super dorsum suum.	Then command him to be placed on his back between your hands.
Deinde circunda cum spatumili lato in circumitu umbilici super locum quem signasti cum encaustro.	Then encircle with a spatula, wide, around the navel area over the place you marked with encaustum.
Postea extende medium apostematis ad superiora, cum uncino magno.	Then extend the middle of the abscess upwards with a large hook.
Deinde liga eum in circumitu forti cum filo, aut cum chorda de serico ligamento firmo: et sit nodus ligamenti alenxotati.	Then bind him around firmly with a cord or with a strong silk binding; and let the knot of the binding be loose.
Deinde aperi medium apostematis extensum supra ligamentum.	Then open the middle of the abscess, extended above the binding.
Si ergo inueneris ipsum iam captum a ligamento: tunc extrahe alenxotati, et intromitte in ipsum digitum indicem, et impelle intestinum ad interiora uentris: et si inueneris zirbum, tunc accipe ipsum cum uncino, et incide superfluitatem eius.	If then you find the intestine caught by the binding; then extract the binding and insert your index finger and push the intestine into the interior of the belly; and if you find a tumor, then take it with a hook and cut off its superfluity.
Si autem contraria est tibi arteria, aut uena: tunc circunda ipsum multum.	But if on the other hand there is an artery or vein opposite to you; then surround it much.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam.	Then return to your operation.
Et accipe duas acus, et intromitte in eis duo fila fortia: et intromitte duas acus in circumitu quem fecisti circa apostema in modum crucis, quas facis penetrare.	And take two needles and insert into them two strong threads; and insert the two needles into the area around the abscess in the shape of a cross, which makes them penetrate.
Deinde stringe apostema in quatuor locis super acus: et si uis, aufer acus, et dimitte locum, donec putrefiat caro extensa: et cadat per se: aut incide ipsam quando subtiliatur et putrefit.	Then tie the abscess in four places over the needles; and if you wish, remove the needles and leave the place until the extended flesh rots and falls apart by itself; or cut it when it becomes softened and rotten.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it with him as is fitting from ointments, until it heals.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est ex carne nara in eo, aut ex humiditate: tunc oportet ut concaues apostema, sicut diximus.	But if the swelling of the navel is from flesh or from moisture: then it is necessary to hollow out the abscess as we said.
Et extrahas sanguinem, aut humiditatem, quam inuenis in eo.	And you should remove the blood or moisture that you find inside.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod solidat locum.	Then take care of it with him as is fitting to close up the place.
¶ De cura CANCRI.	Of the treatment of CRAB.
Caput LIII.	Chapter 53.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Cancri, et qualiter est uia ad curationem eius cum medicinis: et cauendum ab eo cum curatione eius cum ferro, ut non ulceretur: et diximus Cancrum generatum in matrice, et cautelam a curatione eius.	We have already spoken about the types of Crab and how to treat it with medicines; and we must beware of treating it with iron so that it does not become ulcerated; and we said that Crab is generated in the womb and caution must be taken when treating it.
Et dixerunt antiqui, quod quandoque Cancer est in loco, ubi possibilis est eius eradicatio: sicut Cancer qui est in mammillis, aut in coxa, et eis similibus, ex membris locatis ad extrahendum totum eius: praecipue quando est incipiens paruus.	And the ancients have said that sometimes Crab is in a place where its eradication is possible, such as Crab which is on the breasts or hip and similar to it, removed from the affected limb: especially when it is small and just beginning.
Quando uero antiquatur, et est magnus, non oportet ut appropinques ei.	When however it becomes old and large, one should not approach it.
Ego enim non potui sanare ex eo aliquem: neque uidi alium ante me qui peruenerit ad illud.	For I myself was unable to heal anyone from it, nor did I see another before me who had succeeded in treating it.
Et operatio in eo, quando est locatus sicut diximus, est, ut praecedas, et soluas infirmum ex cholera nigra aliquotiens.	And the operation for it, when it is located as we said, is to proceed and dissolve the patient from black cholera occasionally.
Deinde phlebotoma ipsum si inuenis cum repletione manifesta.	Then bleed it if you find it with a clear filling.
Deinde praepara infirmum praeparatione, in qua locetur cum operatione.	Then prepare the patient for preparation in which it will be placed with the operation.
Deinde proiice in Cancrum uncinos qui conueniunt ei.	Then pour into the Crab needles that fit it.
Postea concaua ipsum ab omni parte cum cute, secundum perscrutationem, donec non remaneat aliquid ex radicibus eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere, et non abscindas ipsum uelociter, imo exprime loca, et absterge sanguinem grossum totum manu tua, aut cum quo possibile est ibi ex instrumentis.	Then hollow out the inside of it from all sides with the skin, according to investigation, until nothing remains of its roots: and let the blood flow, and do not cut it quickly, rather press on the places, and wipe away the thick blood entirely with your hand or with whatever instruments are available there.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi fluxus sanguinis grossi ex incisione arteriae, aut uenae: tunc cauteriza uenam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If however a contrary flow of blood makes you feel, a thick stream from the cutting of an artery or vein: then cauterize the vein until the blood is stopped.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it with the remaining treatment until it heals.
¶ De cura Hydropisis.	The Cure of Hydrophobia.
Caput LIIII.	Chapter 54.
Iam narrauimus in diuisione species Hydropisis, et qualiter fit aggregatio aquae: et signa omnis speciei, et curationem eius cum medicinis.	Now we have described the kinds of Hydrophobia and how water accumulates; and the signs of every kind, and its cure with medicines.
Et illa quae curatur cum ferro, non est nisi species asclitis sola: et non approximatur cum ferro speciei timpanitis: neque speciei hyposarcae penitus: nam illud mortale est.	And what is cured with iron is not except for the sole kind of ascites alone; and it does not approach the kind of tympanic nor the kind of hypsarca at all: for that one is deadly.
Quando tu iam medicatus es hanc speciem Hydropisis timpanitis cum medicinis, et non contulit medicatio tua: tunc considera.	When you are already cured of this kind of Hydrophobia with medicines and your treatment has not brought relief: then consider.
Nam si infirmo iam consecuta est debilitas, aut est cum eo infirmitas alia praeter Hydropisim: sicut si sit cum eo tussis, aut uentris solutio, et similia illis: tunc caue ne mediceris ei cum ferro: quoniam est timor illud.	For if weakness has already ensued in the sick person, or there is another infirmity besides Hydrophobia, such as if cough, or bowel looseness, and similar things are present with it: then beware of treating him with iron, for fear of that.
Si autem uides infirmum exuberantis uirtutis, neque est cum eo aegritudo praeter Hydropisim solam: et non est puer, neque senex: tunc modus operationis in eo est, ut tu eleues infirmum stantem inter manus tuas, et minister post ipsum exprimat uentrem eius manu sua impellendo aquam ad inferiorem partem pectinis.	But if you see the sick person to be overflowing with strength, and there is no other sickness besides Hydrophobia alone, and he is not a child nor an old man: then the mode of operation in him is, that you lift up the sick person standing between your hands, and after him make someone else push his stomach with their hand, pushing water down to the lower part of the chest.
Deinde accipe spatumile spinosum, secundum hanc formam.	Then take a thorn-covered sponge, in this shape.
Sit duarum partium acutarum, longum, acutae extremitatis sicut Spatumile.	Be two sharp points, long and pointed at the end like a sponge.
Verumtamen in eo sit quiddam breuitatis paulatim, ut non pertranseas cum eo apud operationem usque ad intestinum, et laedas ipsum.	However, there should be something of brevity slowly present in it, so that you do not penetrate with it all the way to the intestine and cause harm.
Deinde considera.	Then consider.
Nam si est generatio Hydropisis ex parte intestinorum, tunc oportet ut elongeris cum sectione ab umbilico quantitate trium digitorum, ad inferiora in directo eius supra pectinem.	For if the Hydrophobia is generated from the part of the intestines, then it is necessary to stretch with a section from the navel to the lower part, directly above the chest, a length of three fingers.
Si uero generatio Hydropisis est propter aegritudinem epatis: tunc sit sectio tua sinistra ab umbilico tribus digitis.	If indeed the generation of Hydrocephalus is due to the illness of the spleen: then let your incision be on the left side from the navel, three fingers.
Et si generatio eius est propter splenem, tunc sit sectio in latere dextro: et non oportet etiam ut sit sectio in latere super quod uult iacere infirmus, ut non currant superfluitates ad illum locum debilem.	And if the generation of it is due to the spleen, then let the incision be on the right side: and it is not necessary for the incision to be also on the side where the patient wants to lie down, lest superfluities flow to that weak place.
Deinde perfora cum instrumento cutem totam.	Then pierce with an instrument the entire skin.
Deinde intromitte in illam sectionem, et eleua manum tuam cum Spatumili inter cutem, et sifac, quasi tu excories ipsum: et sit quantitas quae excoriatur quantitas unguis, aut circiter ilud.	Then insert your hand with a spatula into that incision and lift up the skin, and scrape, as if you were removing it, and let the amount that is removed be the length of a fingernail or about that.
Deinde perfora sifac, donec perueniat Spatumile ad locum uacuum: et est locus aquae.	Then pierce and scrape until the spatula reaches a hollow place: and it is the location of water.
Deinde extrahe ipsum, et intromitte in foramen instrumentum, cuius haec est forma.	Then draw it out and insert an instrument into the opening, which has this shape.
Et est simile cannulae: fit ex argento, aut aere, aut aurichalco, lene, tersum: cui in inferiori parte sui est foramen paruum, et in lateribus eius sunt tria foramina, duo ab una parte, et unum a parte altera: et facia est extremitas eius incisa, secundum modum incisionis calami, sicut uides: in extremitate eius superiore est armilla.	And it is similar to a cannula: made from silver, or copper, or gold, thin and smooth. It has a small opening at the lower part of itself, and three openings on its sides, two on one side and one on the other side: and its end is cut off, according to the shape of a reed, as you see: in the upper extremity of it there is a band.
Nam quando instrumentum peruenit ad aquam, tunc ipsa descendit statim super instrumentum, ergo euacua ex aqua in hora quantitatem mediam.	For when the instrument reaches the water, then immediately the water will flow down over the instrument, therefore evacuate from the water in an hour a moderate quantity.
Quoniam si tu euacuas ex ea plus quam oportet, in hora fortasse moritur infirmus per resolutionem spiritus sui animalis: aut accidit ei syncopis quae appropinquat morti.	For since if you evacuate from it more than is proper, perhaps the patient will die in an hour due to the resolution of their animal spirits: or a syncopes occurs that approaches death.
Verum euacua ex ea secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius, et secundum quod significant tibi dispositiones infirmi ex uirtute pulsus eius, et ex bonitate eius.	But evacuate from it according to the quantity of its virtue, and according to how the patient's condition signifies to you through the force of their pulse, and through its good quality.
Deinde extrahe instrumentum, et retine aquam.	Then draw out the instrument, and retain the water.
Quod est, quia retinetur statim propter cutem quae retinet foramen quod est super sifac: de quo narraui, ut perfores ipsum secundum illum modum.	What is it, because it will be retained immediately on account of the skin that retains the opening which is above the suture: about which I have spoken, so as to pierce it according to that manner.
Deinde itera instrumentum die altero, si uides infirmum tolerare illud: et extrahe etiam ex aqua quantitatem paruam.	Then iterate the instrument on the next day, if you see the patient is able to tolerate that; and extract also a small quantity from water.
Fac illud diebus aliquot sine timore, et custodi te ab errore: donec non remaneat ex aqua nisi parum.	Do this several days without fear, and guard yourself from error: until there remains no more than a little from the water.
Si autem times super infirmum, et dimittis ex aqua rem multam: tunc cura ipsum cum sepultura in harena calida, et sudore multo in balneo et sole, et expectet super sitim: et cura ipsum cum medicinis exiccatiuis, donec sanetur: et cauteriza super stomachum, et epar, et splenem, post extractionem aquae: secundum quod narraui in eo quod praecessit.	But if you fear for the patient and let out a great deal of water: then cure him with burial in hot sand, and much sweating in a bath and sun, and wait for his thirst to pass: and cure him with medicaments taken away, until he is healed: and cauterize above the stomach, and liver, and spleen, after the extraction of water: according to what I have spoken before.
¶ De cura infantium qui nascuntur locis urinae eorum non perforatis.	Concerning the care of infants born in places where their urethra is not perforated.
Caput LV.	Chapter 55.
Quando egreditur aliquis infantium ex uentre matris suae, et caput mutonis eius est non perforatum, aut est foramen strictum, aut in non suo loco.	When someone is born from his mother's womb, and the head of his monkey is not perforated, or is a narrow opening, or is in an unexpected place.
Oportet ergo succurrere cum perforatione eius statim cum nascitur cum Spatumili subtili ualde, secundum hanc formam.	Therefore it is necessary to help with the perforation immediately at birth with a very fine spatula, according to this shape.
Deinde pone in foramine clauum subtilem ex plumbo, et liga ipsum: et tene ipsum tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then place a small pin made of lead into the opening and tie it shut; and keep it tied for three or four days.
Quando ergo uult urinam emittere, remoueatur, et mingat.	When therefore he wishes to emit urine, it should be removed, and let him pass water.
Deinde reduc ipsum.	Then return it.
Et si tu non ponis plumbum, iam possibile est, ut urina quae incedit super locum, non permittat ipsum claudi.	And if you do not put the lead pin, it is already possible that the urine which flows over the place will prevent it from closing.
Ille autem cuius foramen est strictum, medicatur cum plumbo, sicut diximus, diebus multis, donec amplificetur.	But he whose opening is narrow is cured with lead, as we said, over many days, until it is widened.
Illi autem in quibus est foramen in non suo loco, laeduntur.	And those in whom the opening is in an unexpected place are hurt.
Quod est, quia ex eis qui nascitur, foramen est apud finem capitis uirgae: quare non potest mingere ad anteriora, donec eleuat uirgam manu sua ad superiora.	What is it? Because from those born with it, there is an opening at the end of the rod's head: wherefore it cannot urinate to the front, until it lifts up the rod with its own hand to the higher parts.
Neque est ei generatio, propterea, quod sperma non potest peruenire ad matricem secundum rectitudinem: et est aegritudo foeda ualde.	Nor is there generation in it because, since the sperm cannot reach the matrix according to straightness, and it is a very foul distress.
Et modus operationis in illo est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum.	And the method of treatment for that is, that the weak person should be supported on their back.
Deinde extende caput uirgae eius manu tua sinistra extensione uehementi, et incide caput capitis uirgae ex loco priapi, cum acumine, aut spatumili acuto: sicut est incisio calami, aut sicut tu radis aliquid, ut medium eius ueniat simile capiti uirgae: et ut cadat foramen in medio secundum quod oportet.	Then extend his head of the rod with your left hand, extending it vigorously, and cut off the head of the rod at the place of the priapus, with a point or sharp spathula, as is the cutting of a reed, or as you trim something, so that the middle part of it comes to resemble the head of the rod: and let the opening fall in the middle according to what is necessary.
Et caue tibi apud operationem tuam a fluxu sanguinis.	And beware for yourself during your operation from blood flow.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	For indeed it happens many times.
Oppone ergo ei cum eo quod abscindit sanguinem, et cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	So position something alongside him to stop the bleeding, and care for the wound until it heals.
¶ De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et capite uigae, et corruptione, nigredine, et adhaerentia.	About things that happen on the foreskin and head of the rod, and corruption, blackening, and sticking.
Caput LVI.	Chapter 56.
Multotiens accidunt istae Albather in uirga, et est eminentia carnis foedae.	Many such Albarthes occur on the rod, and it is a prominence of foul flesh.
Et ex ea alia est maligna, et alia non maligna.	And some of these are malignant, and some are not.
Non malignam ergo oportet ut suspendas cum uncino subtili, et abscindas eam, donec mundes eam totam.	So you should not suspend the non-malignant one with a thin hook, and cut it off until you have cleansed it entirely.
Deinde pone super eam cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio.	Then place a poultice immersed in Egyptian ointment over it.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud cum unguento dyafinicon, donec sanetur.	Then care for the same thing after that with diaphrenic ointment, until it heals.
Quod si Albather est maligna, foedi coloris, tunc oportet ut administres in ea cauterium post incisionem eius et ipsius rasionem.	What if the Albarth is malignant, of foul color, then you should administer a cautery to it after its incision and its burning.
Si autem Albather est in praeputio captiui, non circumcisi, et est pars Albather inter praeputium, et pars eius extra: tunc oportet ut auferas Albather, quae est intus in primis, donec quando consolidatur, tunc cura ipsum exterius: quoniam quando tu curas eam simul, non securatur praeputium quin preforetur.	If however the Albather is in the foreskin of an uncircumcised captive, and it is a part of the Albather between the foreskin and that which lies outside: then you should remove the Albather that is inside first, until it has consolidated, then cure it externally: for when you are healing it at the same time, the foreskin does not secure itself but rather protrudes.
Et iam accidunt etiam in testiculis, et praeputio nigredo et corruptio.	And also in the testicles and foreskin, blackness and corruption occur.
Oportet ergo, ut tu concaues totum quod iam denigratum est, et quod uult corrumpi, aut iam corruptum est.	Therefore, you should clean out entirely what is already blackened, and what wants to be corrupted, or is already corrupted.
Deinde line super ipsum post illud cum melle quod iam concussum est cum farina corticum granatorum, et herbi tritorum cribellatorum.	Then draw a line on top of it with honey that has been mixed with ground almond meal and the crushed leaves of plantain.
Deinde cura illud cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then cure that thing with the remaining treatment until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra cauterium cum cauterio lunari, secundum hanc formam.	If, however, bleeding occurs, then apply a cautery with lunar caustic, in this shape.
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.	A cautery is useful for two simultaneous dispositions, namely for bleeding and an ulcer when it becomes corrupted.
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.	If the tip of the penis becomes gangrenous and is destroyed within an hour: then you should insert a lead tube into the urethra of the penis so that the patient may urinate onto it.
In adhaerentia uero praeputii cum capite uirgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter uulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput uirgae ab omni parte.	In the sticking of the foreskin with the head of the penis, and this sticking indeed does not occur unless in one whose foreskin is healthy, and circumcision is not required over it: and sometimes sticking occurs due to a wound or abscess: therefore you should scrape it off with a blunt spatula until the ligament breaks and the head of the penis is freed from all parts.
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite uirgae, et ex praeputio.	What if it is difficult to discern these things exactly, then you should scrape off something from the head of the penis and from the foreskin.
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam uelociter.	Because the foreskin when it is thin may be pierced quickly due to its own subtlety.
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput uirgae cum panno lini subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.	Then separate the foreskin and the head of the penis with a fine linen cloth that has already been soaked in cold water, so that they do not stick together again.
Deinde curetur cum uino stiptico, donec consolidetur.	Then treat it with a tincture of wine until it is consolidated.
¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.	About the purification and cure of infants who have had something happen to them by mistake.
Caput LVII.	Chapter 57.
Circumcisio non est solutio continuitatis, sicut reliqua uulnera: uerumtamen cum sit ex operatione nostra, uoluntate nostra, et usus eius sit in pueris proprie, est necesse ut signemus in ea operationem meliorem, et uiam leuiorem perducentem ad salutem.	Circumcision is not the breaking of continuity, like other wounds: however, since it is our work, by our will, and its use is specifically for children, it is necessary that we mark in this operation a better sign and a way leading to salvation that is easier.
Dico ergo, quod antiqui non dixerunt circumcisionem in aliquo suorum librorum: quoniam non utuntur in legibus suis, et non est nisi quod acquisiuimus per experimentum.	Therefore I say that the ancients did not write about circumcision in any of their books, because they do not use it in their laws, and we have acquired it only through experience.
Quod est, quia ego inueni maiorem partem artificum, et phlebotomatorum uti mundificatione, circumcidendo cum nouacula, et cum forficibus: et utuntur alfecati, et ligaudo cum filo, et incisione cum ungula.	Because I have found that most surgeons and bloodletters use purification by circumcision with a lancet and forceps: and they use bandages tied with thread, and incisions made with a claw.
Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modos, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.	And I myself have already tested all these methods and have not found a better purification with forceps and binding with thread.
Quoniam in mundificatione cum nouacula, multotiens effugit cutis.	Because in the purification with a lancet, the skin often escapes.
Quoniam cutis praeputii duas habet tunicas: ergo forsitan inciditur cutis superior, et temanet tunica inferior: cogitur ergo ad incisionem ad incidendum alteram, et dolorem futurum.	Because the skin of the foreskin has two layers: therefore perhaps the upper layer is cut and the lower layer remains: it is compelled therefore to make an incision to cut through the other one, and to suffer future pain.
Et cum mundificatione quae fit per alfecati, id est, digitalis, quo utuntur sutores, non securatur incisio extremitatis uirilis membri: quoniam fortasse ingreditur in foramen eius.	And with the purification that is done by hand, namely, manual, which surgeons use, the cutting of the edge of the male member does not secure itself: because it may possibly enter into its orifice.
In mundificatione autem cum ungula, fortasse euadit ferrum, et corrumpit operationem tuam: et cutis quidem pueri est breuis natura, et multotiens nascuntur taliter, quod non indigent mundificatione: et iam uidi illud.	In the purification with a claw, perhaps the iron will slip and ruin your operation: and the skin of the child is naturally short-lived, and many are born in such a way that they do not need purification: and I have already seen this.
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.	The trial of mundification by scraping with forceps and ligating with a thread has shown me to be good: because the forceps are proportional to the incision: therefore, since the sharpness which is above is like the sharpness which is below.
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.	When therefore you place your hand, the two sharpnesses are proportioned, and they incise according to one operation at one time; and a compression is made similar in figure, containing the cutting of the beard from every part, with which there falls no error whatever.
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.	And the proper method of operation is, that you make him think, especially a boy, if he is one of those who understand a little, that you are not doing it, unless you tie the thread only in his beard; and then let him go until another day.
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.	Then make him rejoice and be glad in every possible way that you can, because he receives his understanding.
Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.	Then make him stand between your prepared hands, and let him not be sitting; and conceal the forceps in your sleeve, or under your foot, so that the boy may not see them at all, nor anything from the instruments.
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.	Then insert your hand into his beard, and blow into it, and pull it upwards until the head of the beard comes out.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.	Then clean off what has accumulated on it.
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.	Then tie the marked place with a doubled thread.
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum.	After that, tie a little lower down another knot in order.
Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.	Then hold with your index finger and thumb the place of the lower knot, retaining it well, and cut between the two knots.
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.	Then lift up the cut beard quickly and pull out the head of the beard.
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est uitellus oui decocti in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo ros. Recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then let the blood flow slowly (for it is better) and put powder on top: and above the powder, a cloth spread with the yolk of a rosy egg decocted in rose water, beaten with rose oil. Recent good: and let him be on it until another day: and care for it with the remaining cure, until he is healed.
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.	However, the form of a lancet for cleansing is this.
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.	Let the two edges be blunt, and let them converge: lest a branch of the handle protrude from them; and let the length of the two sharp parts be equal to the length of two equally matched arms.
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.	A mistake indeed falls in cleansing is this: because perhaps the inner skin altogether escapes, or part of it at the incision.
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.	Therefore, it is necessary for you to stretch it from your hour with your finger before the blistering of the place; and cut it according to equality.
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.	What if you are not able to hold it with your finger, then pull it out with a forceps and cut it.
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.	But if three days have passed and an inflamed swelling remains under the skin's fold, then let it be, until the apostema is cooled and excoriated with ease, and cut it according to how it is prepared for you; and beware of the top of the fold.
Non enim nocebit ei illud.	For it will not harm him.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.	Therefore, treat it with the powder that consolidates a wound from the powders we narrated in our treatise on powders; and if it is cut off above the skin's measure, and flows upwards, it will not harm him either.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.	Therefore, treat it with what we said, until he is healed.
¶ De extractione Vrinae retentae in uesica.	Of the Extraction of a retained Vein in the Wound.
Caput LVIII.	Chapter 58.
Urinae retentio in uesica, fit ab opilatione facta ex lapide, aut sanguine congelato, aut pus, aut carne nata, et similibus illis ex eis quae diximus ex modis curationis in diuisione.	The retention of a vein in the wound is caused by an obstruction made from stone, or congealed blood, or pus, or new flesh, and similar things to those which we mentioned in the division of modes of cure.
Et si non soluitur Vrina, et uides retentionem eius esse propter Lapidem, qui iam est in collo uesicae: tunc oportet ut sit infirmus super genua sua curuatus.	And if the vein is not loosened and you see the retention of it to be due to a stone which is already in the wound's throat; then it is necessary that he should lie weak on his knees, curved.
Deinde componantur pedes eius super dorsum eius, et extendat uentrem suum ex superiori parte dorsi eius, et stringat infirmus anhelitum suum quantum possibile est ei.	Then let his feet be placed on top of his back, and let him stretch out his belly from the upper part of his back, and let the sick person breathe as deeply as possible.
Cogitur ergo cum collo uesicae ad expulsionem Lapidis ad posteriora: quare absoluitur Vrina.	Therefore, it is necessary to squeeze the bladder with the help of a catheter for the removal of the stone at the backside: which is why the vesicle is emptied.
Quod si non soluitur cum eo quod diximus, et uehemens sit res super infirmum: tunc oportet ut administres extractionem eius cum instrumento, quod nominatur siringa, cuius haec est forma Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.	But if it does not pass with what we have said and the matter becomes pressing against the patient: then it is necessary to administer his extraction with an instrument called a syringe, whose shape is as follows. It should be made of silver, and be thin, smooth, concave, like the quill of a bird in subtlety of radius, long similar to the palm of one and a half hands: and its nozzle should be thin at its tip.
Et modus exitus Vrinae per ipsum est, ut accipias filum duplicatum, et liges in extremitate eius lanam, aut cotum, ligatura bona: et intromittas extremitatem fili in inferiori parte Siringae: et incide cum forficibus si superfluit aliquid ex lana, uerum intromitte in cannulam cum uehementia, sicut alzer.	And the method of exiting the vesicle through it is as follows. Take a doubled thread and tie a good knot at its end with wool or cotton; and then insert the end of the thread into the lower part of the syringe: and cut off any excess wool with scissors, but gently insert the thread into the nozzle with care, just like an arrow.
Deinde inunge siringam cum oleo, aut cum butyro, et albugine oui: et fac sedere infirmum super sedem, et embroca uesicam, et ipsius uirgam cum oleis humidis, et oleo oliuae, et aqua tepida.	Then grease the syringe with oil or butter and an egg white; and make the patient sit down on a seat, and have him catheterize, and himself hold the rod with oily moist things, and olive oil, and warm water.
Deinde intromitte siringam in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat ad radicem uirgae.	Then gently insert the syringe into the rod until it reaches the root of the rod.
Deinde dupla ipsam superius a parte umbilici.	Then double it back on itself above the navel.
Deinde impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad Vesicam, et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam: et non fit hoc secundum hunc ordinem, nisi quoniam meatus, in quo uadit, est in quo est tortuositas.	Then push the syringe into it until it reaches the Vesica, and let the patient feel that he has reached an empty space: and this is not done in this order unless the passage through which it goes is twisted.
Deinde extende filum cum lana paulatim.	Then extend the thread with wool gradually.
Vrina enim sequetur lanam.	For the vesicle will follow the wool.
Deinde extrahe eam, et fac currere Vrinam per uiam urinae: et itera siringam, et non cesses facere illud, donec euacuetur uesica, et inueniat infirmus alleuiationem.	Then take it out and make the urethra flow through the urinary canal. And repeat the syringe and do not stop doing that until the bladder is emptied and the patient finds relief.
¶ De qualitate clisterizationis uesicae cum Clepshydra.	On the quality of catheterizing the bladder with a Clepsydra.
Caput LIX.	Chapter 59.
Quando accidit in uesica ulcus, aut sanguis in ea congelatur, aut coartatur in ea pus, et uis distillare in eam aquas et medicinas: tunc fiat cum instrumento quod nominatur Clepshydra, et haec est forma eius.	When an ulcer occurs in the bladder, or blood freezes in it, or pus congeals within it, and you want to make waters and medicines flow into it: then do this with the instrument called Clepsydra, and this is its shape.
Est enim surda, id est, clausa.	For it is mute, that is, closed.
Et in eo sunt tria foramina, duo ex parte una, et unum ex parte altera, sicut uides.	And on this instrument there are three holes, two on one side and one on the other, as you see.
Et locus concauus, in quo est illud quod impellit, sit secundum quantitatem quod opilet ipsum sine additione, donec quando trahitur cum eo aliquid, ex humiditatibus attrahatur: et quando impellitur, cum eo expellatur ad longinquum: secundum quod facit clepshydra, qua proiicitur naphta, id est, ignis graecus in praeliis martis.	And the hollowed-out place where what drives it is located should be proportionate to the quantity that is needed without addition, until when something is drawn out with it from moist substances and attracted; and when driven, it should push out far away: just as a Clepsydra does, which pours forth Greek fire in war against Mars.
Cum ergo uis proiicere humiditates in uesicam, intromitte extremitatem clepshydrae in humiditatem, et trahe cum eo quod impellit ad superiora, humiditas enim trahitur in concauitatem clepshydrae.	So when you want to pour fluids into the bladder, insert the tip of the Clepsydra into the fluid and draw it out with what drives it upwards, for the fluid is drawn into the hollowed-out part of the Clepsydra.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem eius in uirgam, secundum quod narrauimus in siringa.	Then insert its tip into the urethra, according to what we have described in the syringe.
Deinde impelle humiditatem cum eo quod impellit illa namque humiditas peruenit ad uesicam statim, ita quod sentit eam infirmus.	Then drive the fluid with what drives it, and that fluid will immediately reach the bladder, so that the patient will feel it.
Forma clisteris subtilis quo clisterizatur uesica.	The shape of the catheter, subtle, through which the bladder is catheterized.
Fiat ex argento, aut auricalco: cuius caput altius sit simile alcama paruo, et sub eo sinus inter quem cadat ligamentum.	Make it from silver or golden metal: whose head should be higher and similar to a small almond, and beneath it a channel where a ligature will fall.
Deinde accipe uesicam arietis, et pone in ea humiditatem, qua uis clisterizare uesicam.	Then take the bladder of a ram and place within it the fluid with which you want to catheterize the bladder.
Deinde liga eam inter duos sinus ligatura forti cum filo duplo: et calefac illam humiditatem parumper super ignem.	Then bind it between two sinuses with a strong binding using double thread; and warm it slightly by placing it on the fire.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem clisteris in uirgam, postea stringe manum tuam super uesicam cum humiditate strictura decenti, donec sentiat infirmus, quod illa humiditas iam peruenit ad uesicam.	Then insert the end of the catheter into the penis; afterwards, tie your hand firmly over the urethra with a moistening bandage, until the patient feels that the moisture has already reached the urethra.
Si autem non est tibi praesens uesica, tunc accipe frustum pergameni, et fac ex eo circulum, et perfora ipsum ab omni rotunditate sua.	But if you do not have a present urethra, then take a fragment of parchment and make a circle from it, and puncture it all around its roundness.
Deinde intromitte filum forte in illis foraminibus, sicut reuoluuntur.	Then insert a strong thread into those perforations, as they are turned.
Deinde aggrega circulum, sicut aggregatur alsofratu: postquam tu ponis in eo illud quod uis ex humiditatibus, et oleis, et aquis.	Then gather the circle together like one gathers an alms-bag; after which you put into it what you wish from moist things, and oils, and waters.
Deinde liga ipsum in instrumento: et fac cum eo sicut fecisti cum uesica ex expressione cum manu tua, donec perueniat humiditas ad uesicam.	Then bind it in an instrument; and do with it as you did with the urethra using your hand, until the moisture reaches the urethra.
¶ De extractione Lapidis.	¶ On the Extraction of a Stone.
Caput LX.	Chapter 60.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Lapidis, et curationem eius cum medicinis: et dixi differentiam inter Lapidem generatum in renibus, et uesica, et signa illius totius: et dixi Lapidem in quo cadit operatio cum manu et sectio: et est Lapis generatus in uesica proprie: et ille qui figitur in uirga: et ego sum narrans illud cum expositione manifesta et abbreuiatione.	We have already spoken about the division of types of stones, and their cure with medicines; and I said the difference between a stone generated in the kidneys, and one in the bladder, and signs of all that: and I said about a stone where operation is done by hand and section: and it is truly a stone generated in the bladder: and one that is lodged in the penis: and I am telling this with clear exposition and abridgment.
Dico ergo, quod Lapis generatus in uesica, plurimum accidit pueris.	I say therefore, that a stone generated in the bladder, happens most often to boys.
Et ex signis eius est, quod urina egreditur ex uesica similis aquae in subtilitate sua: et apparet in ea harena alba, et fricat infirmus uirgam suam, et laborat cum ea, et multotiens pendet.	And from its signs is that the urine flows out of the bladder like water in its subtlety; and appears in it white sand, and the patient rubs his penis and labors with it, and hangs around often.
Deinde erigitur, et egreditur cum eo anus in multis eorum.	Then it is raised and flows out with him, along with diarrhea in many of them.
Et est facilis sanatio puerorum, ex eo usquequo consequuntur quatuordecim annos.	And it is easy healing of children, as long as they reach fourteen years.
Et est difficilis in senibus.	And it is difficult in the elderly.
In iuuenibus autem est media, in eo quod est inter illud: et eius cuius Lapis est maior, curatio facilior: et si paruus, est econuerso illius cura.	But in young men it is intermediate, in that it is between the two: and if the stone is larger, healing is easier; and if small, its cure is on the contrary.
Cum ergo peruenimus ad curationem, oportet in primis, ut mundificemus infirmum cum clisteri, quod extrahat totum stercus quod est in intestinis suis: ipsum enim quandoque prohibet inuentionem Lapidis apud inquisitionem.	Therefore, when we come to the healing, it is necessary at first that we cleanse the sick person with a purgative, which removes all the dung that is in his intestines: for it often prevents the discovery of the Stone during the investigation.
Deinde accipiatur infirmus cum pedibus suis, et concutiatur, et moueatur ad inferiora: ut descendat Lapis ad profundum uesicae, aut saliat de loco alto aliquotiens.	Then let the sick person be taken with his feet and shaken and moved towards the lower parts: so that the Stone may descend to the depth of the bladder or pass from a high place several times.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas praeparatum, et manus eius sint sub coxis ipsius, ut fiat uesica tota decliuis ad inferiora.	Then make him sit between your hands prepared, and his hands be under the buttocks of himself, so that the bladder may be entirely sloping towards the lower parts.
Deinde perquire eum, et tange eum extrinsecus.	Then search for him and touch him externally.
Si ergo sentis Lapidem in spacio, tunc propera statim cum sectione super ipsum.	If you then feel the Stone in place, hasten immediately with a cut above it.
Quod si non cadat sub tactu tuo omnino, tunc oportet ut abstergas digitum indicem cum oleo manus sinistrae, si infirmus est puer: aut digitum medium si est iuuenis completus: et intromittas ipsum in anum suum, et perquire de Lapide, donec stat sub digito tuo: et conuerte eum paulatim ad collum uesicae.	And if it does not fall entirely under your touch, then it is necessary that you wipe the pointing finger with oil from the left hand of yours, if the sick person is a child; or the middle finger if he is a complete young man: and insert it into his anus, and search for the Stone until it stays under your finger: and turn it gradually towards the neck of the bladder.
Deinde preme super ipsum cum digito tuo, et impelle ipsum ad exteriora aduersus locus, cuius sectionem uis: et praecipe ministro, ut premat uesicam manu sua, et praecipe alii ministro, ut extendat testiculos manu sua dextra ad superiora: et alia manu sua, ut remoueat cutem, quae est sub testiculis in parte a loco in quo est sectio.	Then press upon it with your finger and push it towards the outside against the place where you wish to make an incision; and instruct your assistant to press on the bladder with his hand, and instruct another assistant to stretch out the testicles with his right hand upwards: and with his other hand remove the skin that is under the testicles in the part near the place where the incision is.
Deinde intromitte Spatumile incidens, cuius forma haec est.	Then insert the spatula, which has this form.
Et finde in eo quod est inter anum et testiculos, et non in medio, ad latus natis sinistrae: et sit sectio super ipsum lapidem, et digitus tuus sit in ano: et fiat sectio transuersa, ut sit sectio exterius ampla, et interius stricta, secundum quantitatem quod sit possibile egressio Lapidis ex ea non maior.	And find in it what is between the anus and testicles, not in the middle, on the left side of the navel: and let the incision be above this stone, and your finger be in the anus: and make the incision transverse, so that it is wide outside and narrow inside, according to the possible egress of the stone from there not greater.
Fortasse enim comprimit digitus, qui est in ano Lapidem apud sectionem, et egreditur absque difficultate.	Perhaps indeed your finger, which is in the anus, compresses the Stone at the incision and it emerges without difficulty.
Et scias, quod ex Lapide est cui sunt anguli et margines, quare fit difficilis exitus eius propter illud.	And know that from the Stone there is one which has angles and edges, wherefore its egress becomes difficult because of that.
Et ex eo est lenis, similis glandulae, et rotundus: et fit facilis egressus eius.	And from it is a smooth one, similar to a gland, and round: and its egress is easy.
Ei ergo cui sunt anguli, et margines, adde in fissura.	Therefore, the one with angles and edges, add a notch to it.
Quod si non egreditur ita, tunc oportet ut ingenies super ipsum: aut stringas super eum cum gesti decenter, cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna, quae stringat super Lapidem, et non euadat ab ea: aut ut intromittas sub eo instrumentum subtile, curuatae extremitatis.	But if it does not emerge thus, then you should either shape it above, or bind it above with a cord, whose end is like the Moon which binds over the Stone and does not escape from it: or as you insert under it a thin instrument, curved at its extremity.
Si autem non potes super cum, tunc amplifica foramen parumper.	But if you cannot shape it above, then enlarge the hole a little bit.
Quod si uincit te aliquid ex sanguine, abscinde ipsum cum zegi.	That if something prevents you from proceeding because of blood, cut it off with a saw.
Si uero lapis est plus quam unus, tunc impelle in primis magnum ad os uesicae.	If however the Stone is more than one, then push the first large one to the mouth of the bladder.
Deinde incide super ipsum.	Then cut above it.
Postea impelle paruum post illud: et similiter fac si sunt plures duobus.	After that, push the small one behind it: and do similarly if there are more than two.
Quod si magnus est ualde, tunc ignorantia est ut seces super ipsum sectione magna.	That if it is very large, then ignorance is to cut above it with a great incision.
Quoniam accidit infirmo una duarum rerum, aut ut moriatur, aut accidit ei distillatio urinae assidua: proptera, quia non consolidatur locus omnino.	Because it happens to a weak person that one of two things occurs, either he will die or frequent dripping of urine befalls him: therefore, because the place is not consolidated at all.
Verum administra expulsionem eius, donec egrediatur: aut ingenia in fractura eius cum forficibus, donec extrahas eum frustatim.	But administer its expulsion until it goes out: or shape the fracture with forceps, until you extract it piece by piece.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc imple uulnus thure, et aloe, et sanguine draconis: et stringe ipsum, et pone super ipsum pannum infusum oleo et uino, aut oleo rosato, et aqua frigida: ut sedetur apostema calidum.	When you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with balm, and aloe, and dragon's blood; and bind it tightly, and place a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or rose oil, and cold water on top of it, that the hot apostema may be assuaged.
Deinde resupina infirmum super collum suum, et non soluas ligamentum, usque ad diem tertium.	Then prop the patient's weak person against his neck, and do not loosen the bandage until the third day.
Cum ergo solueris ipsum, embroca locum cum aqua, et oleo multo.	When you have loosened it, smear the place with water and much oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dyafinicon, et unguento basilicon, donec sanetur.	Then care for him with diaphanict ointment and basilic ointment until he is healed.
Si autem accidit in uulnere apostema calidum additum, et corrosi, et illi similia: sicut si congeletur sanguis in uesica, et prohibeatur ex eo urina: et cognoscitur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina.	But if it happens that a hot apostema is added to the wound, and one of corrosion, and similar things: just as if the blood should congeal in the stomach, and urine should be prevented from flowing therefrom; and this is known by the emission of blood with urine.
Intromitte ergo digitum tuum in uulnus, et extrahe illum sanguinem.	Therefore introduce your finger into the wound and extract that blood.
Nam si remanet, prouocat ad corruptionem uesicae, et putrefactionem eius.	For if it remains, it provokes the stomach to corruption and the putrefaction of its contents.
Deinde ablue uulnus cum aceto, et aqua, et sale: et oppone omni speciei cum eo quod conuenit ex curatione, usquequo sanetur.	Then wash the wound with vinegar, and water, and salt; and apply every kind of dressing that is suitable for healing until he is healed.
Et oportet in horis curationis totius, ut liges duas coxas, et aggreges, caussa medicinarum quae ponuntur super locum.	And it is necessary during the whole process of healing that you bind two bandages around the hips, and apply them together, as a cause for the medicines that are placed on the place.
Quod si lapis est paruus, et sit in meatu uirgae, et figitur in eo, et prohibetur urinae exitus: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod narro antequam peruenias ad sectionem.	For if the stone is small and is situated in the pathway of the urethra, and is fixed there, and prevents the flow of urine: then care for him with what I have mentioned before until you arrive at the point of cutting.
Multotiens enim a sectione excusaris per hanc curationem, iam enim probaui illud.	For many times you will be excused from cutting through this cure, for I myself have already tried it.
Et est, ut accipias Perforatorium ex ferro alferico, cuius haec est forma, triangulatae extremitatis, acutum, fixum in ligno.	And it is, that you take a perforator made of iron, which has this shape, namely a triangular point, sharp and fixed in wood.
Deinde accipe filum, et liga cum eo uirgam sub lapide ut non redeat ad uesicam.	Then take a thread and tie it with him to a staff under a stone so that he does not go back to his urine.
Deinde intromitte ferrum perforans in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat Perforatorium ad ipsum lapidem: et reuolue Perforatorium manu tua in ipso lapide paulatim: et coneris perforationem eius, donec facias ipsum penetrare a parte altera.	Then insert the piercing instrument into the staff with ease until it reaches the Perforator at the stone; and gradually turn the Perforator with your hand on the stone, and grind away its perforation until you make it penetrate from the other side.
Urina namque absoluitur statim.	The urine is immediately released.
Deinde preme manum tuam super illud quod remansit ex lapide ab exteriori parte uirgae.	Then press your hand on what remains of the stone from the outer part of the staff.
Ipse enim frangitur, et egreditur cum urina, et sanatur infirmus.	For it breaks apart and emerges with the urine, and the patient is healed.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi haec curatio, propter aliquid quod prohibet ab illo: tunc liga filum sub lapide, et filum aliud supra lapidem.	But if this cure is not prepared for you because of something that prevents it from happening with him: then tie a thread under the stone, and another thread above the stone.
Deinde seca super lapidem in ipsa uirga inter duas ligaturas.	Then cut on top of the stone in the staff between the two ties.
Deinde extrahe ipsum.	Then pull it out.
Postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.	After that, untie the knot and cleanse the frozen blood which forms in the wound.
Et non est necessarium ligamentum fili sub lapide, nisi ut non redeat ad uesicam: et ligamentum aliud desuper, nisi ut quando soluitur filum post egressionem lapidis, redeat cutis ad locum suum, et cooperiat uulnus: et propter illud necesse est tibi illud quando ligas filum superius, ut eleues cutem ad superiora, ut redeat apud complementum tuum, et cooperiat uulnus, sicut diximus.	And it is not necessary to tie the thread under the stone except that the skin does not go back to its original place and cover the wound: and the other thread above, except that when you untie the thread after the stone has come out, the skin returns to its place and covers the wound. And because of this, it is necessary for you to do so when you tie the thread above, to lift the skin upwards so that it returns to its complement and covers the wound, as we said.
¶ De extractione Lapidis mulierum.	On the Extraction of a Stone in Women.
Caput LXI.	Chapter 61.
Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus.	A Stone is formed in women to a small extent.
Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibetur propter modos multos.	But if a stone occurs in any of them, then the cure is difficult and is hindered by many causes.
Vnus eorum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo.	One of these is that perhaps the woman is a virgin.
Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos.	And the second is because you do not find a woman who will uncover herself to the doctor when she is chaste or has husbands.
Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu.	The third reason is that you do not find a woman well-versed in this art, especially an operation with hand.
Et quartus est longinquitas a loco lapidis: quare indiget sectione profunda, et in illo est timor.	And the fourth reason is the distance from the stone's place: wherefore it needs a deep incision, and there is fear.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.	But if necessity compels you to do that, then it is necessary for you to take a woman doctor, well-versed; and one is hard to find.
Si uero priuaris ea, tunc quaere medicum castum, subtilem, et praesenta mulierem obstetricem bene doctam in re mulierum, aut mulierem quae in hac arte innuit partem artis: fac ergo eam praesentem, et praecipue ei, ut faciat totum quod praecipis ei ex inquisitione super lapidem.	If you do not find those, then seek a chaste and subtle doctor, or a well-educated woman obstetrician knowledgeable about women's affairs, or a woman who is skilled in this art: so arrange for her to be present, and especially instruct her to do everything that you have ordered from her regarding the stone.
In primis quod est, ut aspiciat si mulier est uirgo: tunc oportet ut intromittat digitum in anum eius, et quaerat lapidem.	Firstly, that which is first, to see if the woman is a virgin: then it is necessary for her to insert her finger into his anus and search for the stone.
Si ergo inuenit ipsum, coartet eum sub digito suo, et tunc praecipe obstetrici, ut intromittat digitum suum in uuluam infirmae, et inquirat super lapidem, postquam ponit manum suam sinistram super uesicam, et comprimit eam compressione bona.	If then she finds it, she should grasp it under her finger and then instruct the obstetrician to insert her finger into the woman's vulva, and search for the stone after placing her left hand on the bladder and compressing it with a good compression.
Si ergo inuenit lapidem, tunc oportet ut gradatim moueat eum ab orificio uesicae ad inferiora cum summa uirtutis suae, donec perueniat cum eo ad radicem coxae.	If then she finds the stone, it is necessary for her to move it gradually from the bladder opening down to the lower parts with all her strength, until she reaches its root in the hip socket.
Deinde secet super eum apud oppositionem medietatis uuluae apud radicem coxae, ex quacunque parte praeparatur ei, et sentit lapidem in illa parte: et digitus eius non remoueatur a lapide, coartans sub eo: et sit sectio parua in primis.	Then she should cut above it at the opposite middle of the vulva at the root of the hip socket, from whatever side is prepared for her, and feel the stone in that part: and her finger should not be removed from the stone, grasping under it: and the incision should be small at first.
Deinde intromittat radium super illam sectionem.	Then she should insert a reed above that incision.
Si ergo sentit lapidem, tunc addat in sectionem secundum quantitatem proportionatam quod lapis egreditur ab ea.	If then she feels the stone, then she should add to the incision according to a proportionate measure of how much the stone protrudes from it.
Et scias, quod species lapidis sunt multae.	And know that the kinds of stones are many.
Ex his enim est paruus, et magnus, lenis et asper, longus, et rotundus habens ramos.	From these there is small and great, smooth and rough, long and rounded having branches.
Scias ergo species eius, ut significetur tibi per hoc super illud quod uis.	Therefore know its kinds, so that it may signify to you through this above what you wish.
Si ergo uincit te sanguis, tunc adde in loco zegi tritum, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.	So then if blood overcomes you, add to the place zegi pounded and hold it for one hour until the bleeding ceases.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis: et fac, ut praepares tecum ex instrumentis, quae dixi in extractione lapidis in uiris, ut adiuueris per ea in operatione tua.	Then return to your operation until the stone goes out; and do, so that you prepare with yourself from instruments which I said for extracting stones in men, to help through them in your operation.
Quod si uincit te fluxus sanguinis, et scis quod expulsio sanguinis est ex arteria quae incisa est: tunc pone puluerem super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis strictura decenti: et non mutes illud: et dimitte lapidem, et non extrahas ipsum.	What if the flow of blood overcomes you, and you know that the expulsion of blood is from an artery that has been cut: then put powder on the place, and bind it with a bandage decently tight: and do not move that, and let go the stone, and do not pull it out.
Fortasse enim morietur mulier infirma.	Perhaps indeed the weak woman will die.
Deinde cura uulnus.	Then care for the wound.
Cum ergo sedatur acuitas sanguinis post dies, et putrefit locus, tune redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis.	When then the sharpness of blood has subsided after days, and the place has putrified, then return to your operation until the stone goes out.
¶ De sectione suiper Herniam aquosam.	Of the cutting above a watery hernia.
Caput LXII.	Chapter 62.
Ramex aquosa non est, nisi aggregatio humiditatis in sifac albo, quod est sub cute testiculi continente ouum: et nominatur sifac.	A watery hernia is not, except for the gathering of moisture in the white scrotal sac, which is under the containing skin of the scrotum containing an egg: and it is called a scrotum.
Et quandoque est in panniculo proprio sibi, quem praeparauit ei natura in parte oui, donec putetur: quod est ouum aliud, et est cutis testiculi inter sifac album, quod diximus: et non fit illud nisi raro.	And sometimes it is in its own sac, which nature has prepared for itself in the part of the scrotum containing an egg, until it putrefies: which is another egg, and it is the skin of the scrotum between the white scrotal sac, which we said: and that does not happen except rarely.
Et generatio quidem huius ramicis, est ex debilitate quae accidit testiculis: quare effunditur ad eos haec materia.	And the generation of this hernia is from weakness which occurs in the testicles: wherefore this material flows down to them.
Et quandoque accidit ex percussione super testiculos.	And sometimes it happens that a blow falls upon the testicles.
Et haec humiditas est habens colores multos.	And this moisture has many colors.
Aut enim est color eius decliuis ad citrinitatem, aut est sanguineus rubeus, aut faeculentus, niger, aut est aquosus albus, et est illud quod est plus.	For either its color is inclined towards yellowish, or it is red from blood, or it is dark and filthy, or it is white and watery, and that which is more.
Et signa quibus scitur ubi sit aggregatio aquae, sunt ista.	And the signs by which you know where the accumulation of water is, are these.
Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figura oui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.	For if it is in the white phlegm which we mentioned, then the swelling is round and about as long as an egg figure: and the testicle does not appear, because the moisture surrounds it from all parts.
Et si est humiditas in panniculo proprio sibi, tunc apostema est rotundum cum parte oui, et propter hoc extimat homo quia est ouum aliud.	And if there is moisture in its own sheath, then the swelling is round with a part like an egg, and on account of this man supposes that it is another egg.
Et si humiditas est inter cutem testiculorum et sifac album, tunc cadit sub sensu.	And if there is moisture between the skin of the testicles and the white phlegm, then it falls under sensation.
Quando ergo uis cognitionem coloris humiditatis, tunc experire colorem humiditatis in apostemate cum Intromisso quadrato, cuius forma praecessit.	When therefore you wish to know the color of the moisture, then inspect the color of the moisture on the swelling with a square cloth, whose shape has preceded.
Secundum illud ergo quod egreditur in uestigio Intromissi, iudica de illo quod est inter ipsum.	Accordingly, then, judge about that which is between the two, according to what appears in the track of the square cloth.
Cum ergo uenimus ad curationem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, ut phlebotometur si possibile est ei illud, et uides corpus eius plenum.	When therefore we come to the treatment with iron, then it is necessary for you to warn the sick person that if possible it can be done on him, and you see his body full.
Deinde resupinetur super dorsum suum super rem altam parum, et pone sub eo pannos multos.	Then a brick or stone shall be placed upon his back over a high surface, and many cloths shall be put underneath it.
Deinde sede tu super sinistram eius, et praecipe ministro, ut sedeat a dextra eius, qui extendat uirgam eius ad unum duorum laterum cutis testiculorum, et ad partem mirach uentris.	Then sit you on the left side of him, and command your assistant to sit on his right side, who shall stretch out his rod to one or two sides of the skin of the testicles, and to the part of the navel.
Deinde accipe spatumile latum, et seca cutem testiculorum ex medio per longitudinem, usque prope pectinem: et fiat sectio secundum rectitudinem aequedistantis lineae quae diuidit cutem testiculorum, donec perueniat ad sifac album comprehendens: et excoria ipsum et obserua, uel caue ex hoc, ut seces ipsum: et sit excoriatio tua qua ipsum excorias, ex parte quae suspenditur cum ouo plus: et subtiliter scrutare cum excoriatione secundum quantitatem quod tibi possibile est.	Then take a broad cloth and cut the skin of the testicles from the middle to the length, until near the abdomen: and make a cut according to the straight line that divides the skin of the testicles, until it reaches the white phlegm surrounding; and scrape off the scab and observe whether there is any bleeding, lest you cut too deeply. And be careful with your excoriation on the part that hangs down like an egg more: and examine carefully with the excoriation according to the quantity that you can manage.
Deinde perfora sifac plenum aqua perforatione ampla, et extrahe totam aquam.	Then pierce the siphon full of water with a wide piercing and draw out all the water.
Deinde separa inter duo labia sectionis cum uncinis, et extende sifac ad superiora, et non tangas cutem testiculorum comprehendentem: et incide sifac qualitercunque est possibile tibi incidere ipsum, aut cum totalitate sua, aut frustatim, praecipue latus eius subtile.	Then separate the two lips of the incision with forceps, and stretch the siphon upwards, and do not touch the skin covering the testicles; and cut the siphon as is possible for you to cut it, either entirely or in fragments, especially its subtle side.
Nam si tu non exquisite perscrutaris, in incisione eius non fit securitas, quin aqua redeat.	For if you do not examine it carefully, there is no security in the incision, and the water will flow back.
Si autem procedit ouum exterius a cute sua in hora operationis tuae: tunc quando compleueris sectionem sifac, reduc ipsum.	But if the egg proceeds externally from its own skin during your operation: then when you have completed the incision of the siphon, put it back.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cutis testiculorum cum sutura.	Then bring together the two lips of the skin covering the testicles with a suture.
Deinde cura ipsum sicut reliqua uulnera, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it as you would other wounds, until it heals.
Quod si inuenis ouum corruptum ex nigredine alia, tunc oportet ut liges uasa, quae sunt suspensorium, timens fluxum sanguinis.	And if you find a corrupted egg from another blackness, then it is necessary that you tie the vessels, which are the suspensors, fearing a flow of blood.
Deinde abscinde testiculum cum suspensorio, et extrahe ouum: postea cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then cut off the testicle with its suspensor, and draw out the egg; afterwards take care of it as we have said.
Si uero aqua est aggregata in duabus partibus, tunc scias quia sunt duae ramices: seca ergo partem aliam secundum quod fecisti in altera aequaliter.	If however water is gathered in two parts, then you will know that there are two branches: therefore cut off the other part equally as you did with the first one.
Et si aequatur tibi, ut sit operatio una, tunc fac: deinde absterge sanguinem.	And if it seems good to you, that the operation be one, then do so; afterwards wipe away the blood.
Et intromitte in sectiones lanam submersam in oleo, aut in oleo rosato: et pone deforis lanam aliam quam submersisti in uino et oleo, et expande eam super duos testiculos, et mirach uentris: et pone desuper pannos duplicatos, et sunt puluilli: et liga eos desuper cum ligamento, quod est habens sex secundum hanc formam.	And insert into the incisions a linen cloth soaked in oil or rose oil; and put another cloth which you had submerged in wine and oil, and spread it over the two testicles and the navel: and place above pannus duplex, and they are poultices; and bind them above with a bandage, which has six by this form.
Deinde sumantur duo panni, et suantur, et impleantur la na carminata, secundum hanc similitudinem: et fiant extremitates quibus premitur ex coto, aut lana humida: et aggregentur cum strictura in lumbari bracharum: et una extremitatum accipiat super anum usque ad dorsum, et secunda accipiat ad partem pectinis: et duae extremitates super duas coxas inferius, et duae extremitates aliae super duo inguina, et aggregetur strictura tota in lumbari bracharum.	Then two cloths are taken, and anointed, and filled with the crimsoned linen, according to this likeness: and let the ends be those which press from the navel or damp wool; and let them be gathered together with a tight binding in the loins: and one end shall take up over the anus as far as the back, and the second shall take up to the part of the breast: and two other ends above two lower hipbones, and two other ends above two groin areas, and let the whole bandage be gathered together in the loins.
Et, quandoque artificialiter medicatur haec ramex cum cauterio loco sectionis cum ferro: et est, ut accipias cauterium cultellare subtile, et seces cum eo cutem testiculorum: et est ignitum, secundum quod narrauimus: donec quando detegitur sifac album continens aquam: tunc accipe cauterium, secundum hanc formam.	And when this vein is artificially treated with a cauterizer at the site of the section with iron: and it is, as you take a cauterizing knife, fine and subtle, and cut with it the skin of the testicles; and it is ignited, according to what we have narrated: until when the white scab containing water is uncovered: then take the cauterizer, in this form.
Assimilatur literae graecae.	Are assimilated Greek letters.
Deinde perfora cum eo illud sifac, et est ignitum, donec egrediatur humiditas tota.	Then pierce with it that scab and it is ignited until all moisture has gone out.
Deinde extende sifac cum uncinis, et excoria cum cauterio subtili ignito, et incide ipsum secundum quod possibile est tibi, donec eradices totum eius.	Then stretch the scab with a hook and scrape it off with a fine burning cauterizer, and cut into it as far as you can until you have removed all of it.
Et caue ex ouo, ne tangat ipsum ignis.	And beware that the fire does not touch it.
Et scias, quod haec operatio est saluior, et longinquior a fluxu sanguinis, et melior quam operatio cum sectione.	And know that this operation is more salubrious and longer-lasting from bleeding, and better than an operation with incision.
Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit in hora sectionis, aut in hora cauterii apostema calidum, aut fluxus sanguinis, aut aliquid aliud: tunc oportet ut cures quod contrarietatem tibi facit ex illo cum curatione quae conuenit ei, secundum quod praemissum est.	If, however, you encounter contrary symptoms in the hour of incision, or in the hour of cauterization, a warm abscess or bleeding, or something else: then it is necessary that you treat what causes contrariety to you from that with the cure that suits it, according to what has been mentioned beforehand.
Si autem infirmus est timidus, et non expectat super hanc operationem, propter horribilitatem suam: tunc administra perforationem secundum quod ego narro illud: et est.	If, however, the patient is timid and does not look forward to this operation because of his own fearfulness: then administer a perforation according to what I narrate it: and it is.
Quando certificatur tibi apud te per illud quod diximus de significationibus, quod ramex est aquosa: tunc oportet quod facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	When you are certain in yourself about what we have said concerning the signs, that this vein is watery: then it is necessary that you make the patient sit on a raised seat.
Deinde perfora apostema in inferiori parte sui cum spatumili lato: et pone perforationem secundum longitudinem corporis, et sit apertio ampla, donec currat aqua tota.	Then pierce the abscess at its lower part with a broad spatula: and place the perforation according to the length of the body, and make the opening wide enough until all the water flows out.
Deinde pone super locum cotum, et liga ipsum, et dimitte ipsum ut currat residuum aquae: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then place a poultice on the spot, and bind it tight, and let it be until the remaining water flows out: then care for it until the wound heals.
Si autem contrarietas sit egressioni aquae in hora qua perforas ipsam: et non sit illud nisi propterea, quia panniculus albus contrarietatem facit in orificio uulneris, et prohibet exitum aquae: tunc oportet ut intromittas pennam in uulnus, aut instrumentum cum quo extrahitur aqua hydropicorum, cuius forma praecessit: aut adde in operatione uulneris parumper.	If however contrariety is present as water flows out at the hour you perforate it; and this is not so unless because a white cloth makes contrariety in the orifice of the wound, and prevents the exit of water: then it is necessary to put in the wound either a feather or an instrument with which water is drawn off, whose shape has preceded: or add a little in the operation of the wound.
Et scias, quod aqua redit, et aggregatur post sex menses, aut circiter eos.	And know that the water returns and accumulates after six months, or around those times.
Cum ergo aggregatur, tunc pertoretur secundum eundem modum, et pertransibit infirmus dies suos.	When it accumulates, then it is pierced through in the same manner, and the sick person will pass their days.
¶ De cura Ramicis carnosae.	Of the treatment of fatty warts.
Caput LXIII.	Chapter 63.
Scias, quod in sectione super hanc Ramicem, est ex timore perducente ad perniciem in pluribus dispositionibus.	Know that in the operation on this fatty wart, there is fear leading to harm in many dispositions.
Quapropter uidetur mihi eius dimissio saluari ex ea.	Therefore it seems to me that its removal would be beneficial for healing from it.
Et ego sum rememorans operationem in ea, et species apostematis.	And I am recalling the operation on it and the appearance of a pustule.
Dico ergo, quod accidunt apostemata multa in corporibus, ex quibus componuntur testiculi: et fit illud ex caussis multis, scilicet.	I say therefore that many pustules occur in bodies from which testicles are composed; and this happens for many reasons, namely.
Aut ex superfluitate acuta, uel acri, quae effunditur ad testiculos.	Or from an acute or sharp surplus which flows to the testicles.
Aut ex percussione.	Or from striking.
Et est color apostematis secundum colorem corporis, et non inuenitur ei dolor: et est apostema graue.	And the appearance of the pustule is according to the complexion of the body, and there is no pain found in it; and it is a grave pustule.
Et fortasse est apostema lapideum, cuius color est fuscus, et non est sensus ei.	And perhaps it is a stone-like pustule, whose color is dark, and there is no sensation in it.
Et quandoque fit ex nodatione arteriarum, et inflatione earum: sicut iam praecessit eius rememoratio: aut ex inflatione uenarum.	And sometimes it happens from the constriction of arteries and their swelling; as has been recalled earlier; or from the swelling of veins.
Quod ergo est ex eis ex inflatione arteriarum, cognoscitur per dispositionem apostematis, quando comprimis ipsum digitis tuis.	What is caused by them from the constriction of arteries, is recognized by the appearance of the pustule, when you compress it with your fingers.
Et non oportet ut tangas ipsum prorsus.	And it's not necessary to touch it at all.
Illud uero quod fit ex inflatione uenarum, non dispergitur ex eo aliquid apud compressionem cum digitis.	What is done from inflating veins is not scattered by compression with fingers.
Et iam possibile est, quod super hanc speciem fiat sectio, et super reliquas carnes: et est, ut seces cutem testiculorum.	And it is also possible to make an incision on this type of case and on the remaining flesh; and it is, as one cuts the skin of testicles.
Deinde extende ouum ad sursum, et extrahe ipsum cum sifach albo: et libera suspensorium ex uasis, et liga uasa: et incide suspensorium postquam tu liberas ipsum ab omni parte ex partibus oui.	Then stretch the scrotum upwards and remove it with a white cloth: and free the suspensory ligament from the pubic bone, and tie the vas: and cut the suspensory ligament after you have freed it from all parts of the scrotum.
Si ergo ouum consolidatum est cum illis carnibus natis, tunc oportet ut attrahas ouum, et incidas ipsum.	If therefore the scrotum is consolidated with those natural flesh, then it is necessary that you remove the scrotum and cut it.
Et si adhaerentia est inter aliquid ex siphaket, aut in eo quod est inter uasa: tunc oportet ut liberes totam illam adhaerentiam, et incidas eam incisione rotunda.	And if there is an adhesion between something from the spermatic cord or in what is between the vas: then it is necessary that you free all that adhesion and cut it with a round incision.
Si autem est natiuitas carnis in loco adhaerentiae quae est retro: tunc oportet ut incidas totum eius, et extrahas ouum, sicut diximus.	But if there is a growth of flesh on the back of the adhesion: then it is necessary that you cut all of it and remove the scrotum, as we have said.
Cum ergo completur operatio tua, tnnc imple uulnus in lana infusa in oleo rosato, et uino: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When therefore your operation is completed, then fill the wound with wool dipped in rose oil and wine: afterwards take care of it with the rest of the treatment, until it heals.
¶ De cura Ramicis, quae est cum Vite.	Of the Care for Stones which are with Vitriol.
Caput LXIIII.	Chapter 64.
Uitis est apostema inuolutum quadam inuolutione, simile botro, cum mollificatione testiculorum: et fit difficilis super infirmum motus et exercitium, et deambulatio.	Vitiol is a sort of enveloping apostema resembling a boil, with the softening of the testicles; and it becomes difficult over an infirm person's movement and exercise, and walking.
Et in curatione huius aegritudinis est ex timore, propter illud cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And in the cure of this illness is from fear, because of what was mentioned before as a reminder.
Verum oportet, ut dicamus operationem in ea secundum quod fecerunt primi.	But it is necessary that we say how to operate on it according to what the first ones did.
Dico ergo, quod oportet ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	I say therefore, that you should make the infirm person sit on a raised seat.
Deinde impelle suspensorium testiculorum ad inferiora.	Then push the suspensory ligament of the testicles downwards.
Deinde tene cutem testiculorum cum digitis tuis, cum uasis quae sunt propinqua uirgae: et teneat ea minister alius, et extendat ea extensione uehementi.	Then grasp the skin of the testicles with your fingers and with the surrounding vessels that are near the penis: and let another attendant hold it and stretch it with a strong pull.
Deinde incide cum spatumili lato acuto sectione transuersa in directo uasorum, donec detegantur uasa.	Then cut with a sharp-bladed knife, making a cross-section in the direction of the vessels, until the vessels are exposed.
Deinde excoria ab omni parte, sicut diximus tibi in extractione Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then scrape away from all sides, just as we told you to do with the arteries that are in times.
Postea fige in eis acum in qua sit filum duplum, et liga ipsum in primo locorum quibus accidunt Vites: et liga ipsum iterum in ultimo eorum.	Then place a thread twice as long as the suture in them, and tie it at the first point where they occur, and tie it again at the last of them.
Deinde seca ea in media sectione recta secundum longitudinem corporis, et extrahe quod aggregatur ex humiditatibus faeculentis corruptis.	Then cut them in a straight section in the middle, following the length of the body, and remove what accumulates from corrupted purulent humors.
Deinde cura uulnus cum curatione reliquorum uulnerum, in quibus uis generari saniem, ut cadant uasa quae nutriunt unum testiculorum.	Then care for the wound with the treatment of other wounds in which pus is to be generated, so that the vessels which nourish one testicle may fall.
Non est enim malum per illud.	For it is not bad by that.
Si autem accidat Vitis omnibus uasis, tunc oportet ut extrahantur propter hoc testiculi cum uasis: ut non priuetur ouum nutrimento, propter incisionem, et tabescat, uel arescat, et non sit iuuamentum cum eis.	But if the ligature occurs in all the vessels, then it is necessary to remove the testicles with the vessels: so that the ovum may not be deprived of nutrition because of the incision, and waste away or become gangrenous, and may not be helpful along with them.
¶ De cura Ramicis intestinalis.	¶ On the care of Intestinal Strangulations.
Caput LXV.	Chapter 65.
Euentus huius Ramicis est ex sectione, quae accidit in sifach extenso super uentrem in parte inguinum ex mirach uentris.	The outcome of this strangulation is by a section that occurs on the siphacus extended above the belly in the part of the groin from the right side of the abdomen.
Quare descendunt intestina ex illa Ruptura ad unum testiculorum.	Therefore, the intestines descend from that rupture to one testicle.
Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.	And this rupture is either from the siphacus or its extension.
Et accidunt istae duae species ex caussis multis. Aut ex percussione. Aut saltu. Aut clamore. Aut eleuatione rei grauis, et similibus.	And these two kinds occur due to many causes. Or from a blow. Or by a fall. Or from noise. Or from the elevation of a heavy object and similar things.
Et signum, quando est ex extensione sifach.	And a sign is when it is from an extension of the spleen.
Est quod accidit paulatim in tempore longo, et non accidit subito: et est apostema aequale uersus profundum: propterea, quod sifach comprimit intestinum.	It occurs gradually over a long period of time, and does not occur suddenly: it is an equal apostema towards the deep parts: therefore, because the spleen compresses the intestine.
Et signum eius quando est ex sectione sifach, quia facit accidere ex principio sui dolorem uehementem subito: et est apostema diuersum, apparens sub cute propinque: et illud est propter exitum intestini, et cursus eius ad exteriora sifach.	And a sign of it is when it occurs from the section of the spleen, because it makes occur suddenly at its beginning a violent pain: and it is a different apostema, appearing near the skin: and that is due to the exit of the intestine and its course towards the exterior of the spleen.
Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zirbum: et nominatur haec Ramex intestinalis, et zirbia: et quandoque fit cum uentositate.	And sometimes it exits with the intestine wrapped around it: and this is called Intestinal Flesching and Wrapping: and sometimes it occurs with inflammation.
Et quandoque currit in intestinum stercus, et retinetur illic: et est cum eo pernicies infirmi: quoniam facit accidere dolorem prauum, et praecipue quando premitur.	And sometimes it runs into the intestine and retains excrement there: and it is with him a deathly affliction for the sick: because it makes occur a bad pain, and especially when it is pressed.
Et in curatione specierum aegritudinis huius cum ferro est timor: quare oportet ut caueatur casus in ea.	And in the treatment of this disease's symptoms with iron there is fear: wherefore it is necessary to beware of accidents in it.
Et modus operationis est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut reducat intestinum manu sua ad interiora concauitatis suae, si obedit reditui.	And the method of treatment is that you should tell the patient to reduce his intestine by hand into the inner recesses of his own swelling, if it obeys.
Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manus tuas: et eleua crura eius.	Then have him lie back on his back with his neck between your hands and elevate his legs.
Deinde extende cutem quae sequitur cutem ad superiora, et seca cutem testiculorum totam per longitudinem.	Then extend the skin that follows the skin to the top and cut off the skin of the testicles entirely along its length.
Deinde fige in duobus labiis sectionis uncinos, secundum quod indiges ad aperiendum sectionem cum eis: et sectio sit secundum quantitatem, quod sit possibile, ut egrediatur ex ea ouum.	Then place in the two lips of the incision two hooks, according to your need to open up the incision with them: and the incision should be so that it is possible for an egg to come out of it.
Deinde excoria siphak, et quae sunt sub cute testiculorum, donec quando detegitur sifach album, durum ab omni parte: tunc intromitte digitum tuum indicem in eo quod sequitur testiculum, in eo quod est inter siphach album, quod est sub cute oui, et inter sifach secundum, et absolue cum eo adhaerentiam quae est in posteriori parte oui.	Then remove the skin of the spleen and what is under the skin of the testicles, until when the white part of the spleen is uncovered, hard all around: then insert your index finger into it, between the testicle and the white part of the spleen, that which is under the skin of the belly and also with it the adhesion that is in the posterior part of the belly.
Deinde moue cum manu dextra ad interiora cutem testiculorum: et cum hoc extende sifach album ad sursum, cum manu sinistra: et eleua ouum cum sifach ad partem sectionis: et praecipe ministro, ut extendat ouum ad sursum: et tu solue adhaerentiam, quae est retro solutione completa.	Then move with your right hand to the interior of the skin of the testicles: and as you do this stretch a white cloth upwards with your left hand: and lift the egg with the cloth to the part of the incision: and instruct the assistant to lift the egg upwards: and you dissolve the adhesion that is behind when the solution is complete.
Et quaere digitis tuis, ut non sit aliquid illic ex intestino inuoluto in sifach albo duro.	And search with your fingers to see if nothing from the intestine is twisted into the white cloth hard.
Si autem inuenis ex eo aliquid: tunc impelle ipsum ad uentrem inferius.	But if you find something of that sort, then push it downwards into the lower belly.
Deinde accipe acum, in qua sit filum grossum, factum licinium ex decem filis: et intromitte ipsam apud postremum sifach, id est, tunicae, quod est sub cute testiculorum quae sequitur sectionem: deinde incide extremitates quae eminent ex filo, donec sint quatuor fila.	Then take a needle with a thick thread, made from ten threads, and insert it into the last part of the cloth, that is, the skin which follows the section, under the scrotal skin that follows the incision: then cut off the ends that project out of the thread until there are four threads.
Deinde compone quaedam eorum super quaedam cum figura quae sit in modo crucis: et liga cum eis alsifach, de quo diximus, quia est sub cute testiculorum ligamento uehementi, donec non possit aliquod ex uasis, quae nutriunt eos mittere ad eos aliquid: ut non accidat inde apostema calidum.	Then take some of them and place them on top of the others in a figure like a cross: and tie with them the white cloth, as we said, because it is under the scrotal skin tied strongly, until nothing from the vessels that nourish them can reach them: so that no hot abscess may occur.
Et pone iterum ligamentum secundum extra ligamentum primum, longinquum ab eo minus duobus digitis.	And put another ligature outside the first ligature, two fingers' breadth away from it.
Et post ista duo ligamenta dimitte ex sifach, quod est sub cute testiculorum, quantitatem magnitudinis digiti: et incide reliquum totum secundum rotunditatem, et aufer ex eo ouum.	And after these two ligatures let go from the white cloth, that is under the scrotal skin, as much as a finger's length: and cut off the rest all around in a circular shape, and remove the egg.
Deinde seca in inferiori parte cutis testiculorum sectione, ex qua currit sanguis, et sanies: sicut narrauimus in eo quod praemissum est.	Then cut off at the lower part of the skin of the testicles with a section, from which blood and pus flow out: just as we have previously described.
Deinde administra lanam submersam in oleo, et pone in uulnus: et administra ligamentum quod narrauimus.	Then apply a lint soaked in oil to the wound: and apply the ligature as we have described.
Et quandoque cauterizatur sifach album quod diximus, post incisionem eius timendo de fluxu sanguinis.	And sometimes the white cloth that we mentioned is cauterized after its incision, in fear of blood flow.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	That often happens.
Et dimitte ligamentum, donec cadat per se.	And let go of the ligament until it falls by itself.
Si autem tardatur casus eius, tunc embrocetur cum aqua calida: et pone super ipsum illud quod diximus, donec cadat.	But if its fall is delayed, then let it be fomented with warm water; and place over it what we mentioned, until it falls.
Deinde cura uulnus cum reliqua curatione uulnerum, donec curetur.	Then take care of the wound with the rest of the treatment for wounds, until it is healed.
¶ De Ramice uentosa.	About Abscesses.
Caput LXVI.	Chapter Sixty-Six.
IN Hac Ramice non uidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.	In this abscess I have not seen anyone attempt to treat it with iron.
Et primi quidem dixerunt, quod fit sicut narrauimus in Ramice quae est cum Vite.	And the first ones indeed said that it happens just as we narrated in the abscess that is with Vine.
Quod est, ut liges uasa post sectionem super ea cum facilitate inferius: deinde seca in medio, et cura postremo cum eo quod aperit ipsum, donec cadant uasa: et cura uulnus, secundum quod diximus, donec sanetur.	Which is to tie the vessels after cutting them above with ease below: then cut in the middle and cure it afterwards with what opens it up, until the vessels fall; and cure the wound, as we said, until it heals.
¶ De disruptione quae fit in inguinibus.	About the Disruption that occurs in Groins.
Caput LXVII.	Chapter Sixty-Seven.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, sicut diximus, et eminet locus, et non descendit ad testiculos aliquid ex intestinis: et si descendit, est illud parum, et redit in omnibus horis: uerum si prolongatur cum ea tempus, additur fissura in sifach, donec descendunt intestina in sifach.	When a rupture occurs in the groin, as we said, and the swelling appears and does not descend to the testicles; and if it does descend, it is little and returns in all hours: but if prolonged with time, an opening is added in the scrotum, until the intestines descend into the scrotum.
Et accidit illud ex extensione sifach, quod est in inguinibus, sicut diximus.	And this happens from the stretching of the scrotum, which is in the groin, as we said.
Quod est, quia extenditur sifach: deinde mollificatur, et apostematur locus, et eminet.	Which is because the scrotum stretches: then it becomes soft and an abscess forms, and swells.
Et cura eius est cum cauterio, sicut praecessit eius narratio.	And its cure is with a cautery, just as its preceding narrative said.
Et quandoque curatur cum ferro, secundum hunc modum: et est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum inter manus tuas.	And sometimes it is cured with iron, according to this method: and it is, that the patient lies on his back between your hands.
Deinde seca locum Rupturae apostematum et eminentem, sectione per latitudinem, secundum quantitatem trium digitorum.	Then cut the swollen abscess and swelling of the rupture, cutting through its width, according to the size of three fingers.
Deinde stringe alsifak et, quae sunt sub cute, donec quando detegitur sifach album, quod est sub cute quae sequitur ipsum.	Then bind the alsifak and that which is under the skin until what is under the skin is revealed, which follows the white alsifak.
Tunc accipe radium, et pone ipsum super locum eminentem ex sifach, et preme ipsum ad profundum uentris.	Then take a needle and place it on top of the prominent part from the alsifak, and press it deep into the belly.
Deinde sue duo loca eminentia super extremitatem radii ex sifach, et annecte cum sutura unum eorum cum altero: deinde extrahe extremitatem radii.	Then bind two prominent parts above the extremity of the needle from the alsifak, and sew one to another with a stitch: then pull out the extremity of the needle.
Et non incidas alsifach omnino, neque tendas ouum, neque aliud, sicut feci te scire in curatione ramicis intestinalis.	And do not cut the alsifak entirely, nor stretch out a wound, nor anything else, as I have instructed you to know in the cure of intestines.
Deinde cura illud curatione uulnerum.	Then care for that with wound treatment.
Cum ergo incidis fila, mundifica illud, et restaura uulnus, donec consolidetur.	When therefore you cut the threads, clean it up and restore the wound until it is consolidated.
Sisach enim contrahitur, et non additur eminentia Rupturae.	For sisach is contracted and does not have a prominent rupture.
Et cauterium est melius in hoc loco: quoniam est propinquius ad salutem.	And cauterization is better here: since it is closer to health.
¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.	§ On the softening of scrotal skin.
Caput LXVIII.	Chapter 68.
Multotiens mollificatur cutis testiculorum in quibusdam hominibus, propter quod mollificantur carnes quae sunt inter ea, et foedatur aspectus eius.	The skin of the scrotum is often softened in some people, because of which the flesh between them becomes soft and its appearance becomes foul.
Ergo necesse est ei qui rogatur in curatione eius, ut faciat iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et incidat totam cutem quae mollificata est super cutem naturalem.	Therefore it is necessary for the one who is asked to cure this, to make the sick person lie on his back and to cut off the entire softened skin over the natural skin.
Deinde aggreget duo labia cum sutura: et si uis, sue in primis superfluitatem cutis mollificatae tribus suturis, aut quatuor, et firma suturam.	Then gather two lips together with a stitch: and if you wish, either on the surface of the softened skin three stitches or four, and make it firm with a stitch.
Deinde incide inter sututuras.	Then cut between the stitches.
Deinde cura curatione reliquorum uulnerum, usquequo sanetur, et cadant fila.	Then care for the wound with wound treatment until it heals and the threads fall away.
¶ De Castratione.	§ On Castration.
Caput LXIX.	Chapter 69.
Scias, quod Castratio in lege nostra excommunicata est: et propter illud liceret mihi, ut non rememorarer eius in libro meo isto: et non est necessaria rememoratio eius, nisi propter duos modos.	Know that castration is excommunicated in our law and for that reason it would have been permitted to me not to remember it in my book, and it is not necessary to mention it except for two methods.
Quorum unus est, ut sit illud in scientia medici quando interrogatur de ea: et ut sciat curationem eius cui accidit.	One of them is that it should be so in medical science when asked about it: and to know its cure for him who suffered from it.
Et modus alter est, quod nos multotiens indigemus castratione quorundam animalium, propter iuuamenta nostra per illud, sicut arietum, hyrcorum, et gattorum, et similium ex animalibus.	And another method is that we often need the castration of certain animals for our own benefit through them, such as sheep, goats, and cats, and similar animals.
Dico ergo, quod Castratio fit secundum duos modos.	I say therefore that castration is done in two ways.
Aut per attritionem.	Or through cutting.
Aut per fissuram, et sectionem.	Or through splitting and cutting.
In illa autem quae fit per attritionem, uia operationis est: quod nos faciamus sedere animal in aqua calida, donec mollificentur testiculi eius, et leniantur, et pendeant: deinde attere eos manu tua, donec resoluantur et non appareant sub tactu.	In that which is done through cutting, the method of operation is: to make the animal sit in hot water until its testicles become soft and relaxed, and hang down; then cut them off with your hand until they dissolve and do not appear under touch.
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.	In castration by splitting and cutting, it is necessary to hold the animal and press the skin of its testicles with your left hand.
Deinde liga suspensorium, et seca super omne ouum sectione una, donec quando procedunt duo oua: tunc incide ea postquam excoriaueris utrumque, et non dimittas super ea ex sifaket aliquid praeter sifac subtile, quod est super uasa.	Then bind the suspensory ligament and cut above all one section until two testicles come forth; then cut them after you have peeled both of them, and do not leave anything on top except for a thin membrane which is above the vessels.
Et iste modus castrationis est melior eo qui fit per attritonem: quoniam attritio fortasse relinquit aliquid ex testiculis, quare desiderat animal coitum.	And this method of castration is better than the one that is done by cutting: because cutting perhaps leaves something behind from the testicles, so the animal desires copulation.
Deinde cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the wound until it heals.
¶ De cura Hermafroditae duorum modorum.	About the Cure for Hermaphrodites in Two Ways.
Caput LXX.	Chapter 70.
Hermafrodita ex uiris est secundum duos modos.	A hermaphrodite from men is according to two ways.
Vnus eorum est, quia apparet in eo quod sequitur spacium, aut in cute testiculorum, in eo quod est inter duos testiculos, figura quasi uulua mulieris, in qua sunt pili: et quandoque currit urina ex eo quod est in cute testiculorum.	One of them is, because it appears in that which follows the space, or in the skin of the testicles, in that which is between two testicles, a figure resembling a woman's vulva, with hair: and sometimes urine flows from that which is in the skin of the testicles.
In mulieribus autem est species una, et est uulua mulieris super pectinem sicut testiculi uiri parui omnino, eminentes ad exteriora: quorum unus est sicut priapus uiri, et duo sicut duo testiculi.	In women, however, there is one species, and it is the vulva of a woman over the pelvis just like the small testicles of a man entirely, protruding to the exterior: of which one is like the priapus of a man, and two are like two testicles.
Et curatio trium specierum, duarum ex uiris, et speciei unius ex mulieribus, est: quia oportet ut incidas carnes additas, donec effugiat impressio earum.	And the cure of three species, two from men and one from women, is: because it is necessary to cut off the added flesh until the impression of them departs.
Deinde cura eas curatione reliquorum uulnerum.	Then the care is by the same treatment as for other wounds.
In specie autem secunda uirorum, ex qua egreditur urina, quae est in cute testiculorum, non est operatio, neque est eius curatio omnino.	But in the second species of men from which urine comes out, which is on the skin of the testicles, there is no operation nor its cure at all.
¶ De incisione Tentiginis, et carnis eminentis in uuluis mulierum.	Of the cutting of the Tentigins and the prominent flesh in the vulvas of women.
Caput LXXI.	Chapter 71.
Tentigo fortasse additur super rem naturalem, donec foedatur et turpis fit aspectus eius: et quandoque magnificatur in quibusdam mulieribus adeo, donec expanditur sicut in uiris, et peruenit usque ad coitum.	The Tentigo perhaps is added to the natural part until it becomes foul and its appearance is loathsome: and sometimes it is magnified in certain women so much that it expands like in men, and reaches as far as copulation.
Oportet ergo ut teneas superfluitatem Tentiginis manu, aut cum uncino, et incidas: et non ultimes in incisione, praecipue in profundo radicis: ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Therefore you should hold the excess of the Tentigo with your hand or with a hook, and cut it off: and do not stop cutting until you reach the root, especially in the deep part, so that there may not be a flow of blood.
Deinde cura ipsam curatione uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then the care is by the same treatment as for wounds, until it heals.
Caro autem orta, est caro quae nascitur in orificio matricis, donec impleat ipsum: et fortasse egreditur ad exteriora secundum similitudinem caudae: et propter illud quidam primi nominant aegritudinem caudatam.	But the flesh that grows is the flesh that arises in the maternal orifice, until it fills it: and perhaps it emerges to the exterior according to the likeness of a tail: and because of this, some people call the first stage of this condition "caudal suffering".
Oportet ergo ut incidamus eam sicut incidimus Tentiginem, et curemus eam, donec sanetur.	Therefore you should cut it off like you would the Tentigo and treat it until it heals.
¶ De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.	Of the cure of the Alratica, which is the unperforated vulva of a woman.
Caput LXXII.	Chapter 72.
Alratica est, ut sit uulua mulieris non perforata, aut sit foramen paruum.	The wound of a woman is not pierced, or it has a small opening.
Et est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And it is either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis est ex aegritudine quae praecessit: et ipsa quidem fit aut ex carne nata addita, aut sifach subtili, aut spisso: et fit aut in profundo matricis, aut in lateribus eius, aut in superiore ipsius, aut inferiori eius: et prohibet a coitu et impregnatione, et partu, et fortasse prohibet menstrua.	Accidental is one that preceded the illness; and it indeed occurs either from flesh added to nature, or from thin, or from thick: and it occurs either in the depth of the womb, or in its sides, or in its upper or lower part: and it prevents coitus and impregnation, and childbirth, and perhaps prevents menstruation.
Et cognitio illius fit per aspectum obstetricis, si opilatio est apparens propinqua.	And knowledge of it is obtained by the sight of the midwife, if there appears to be an obstruction nearby.
Si autem non est apparens, tunc quaere eam digitis tuis, aut cum radio.	But if it is not apparent, then search for it with your fingers or with a probe.
Si autem opilatio est ex sifach subtili, et est propinqua duobus labiis: tunc propera, et disrumpe ipsam.	But if the obstruction is from thin tissue and is near two lips, then hasten and break it open.
Et est, ut ponas super duo labia puluillos.	And it is, that you place a poultice over the two lips.
Deinde pone indices tuos duarum manuum simul, et mulier sit super dorsum suum expansis cruribus suis.	Then place your fingers of both hands simultaneously, and let the woman be on her back with her legs spread apart.
Deinde extende duo labia cum fortitudine, donec disrumpatur sifach subtile, et aperiatur opilatio.	Then stretch out the two lips with force, until the thin tissue is broken and the obstruction opens up.
Deinde accipe lanam, et imbibe eam in oleo, et pone ipsam super locum: et coeat mulier omni die, ut non consolidetur locus uice alia.	Then take a linen cloth, and soak it in oil, and place it on the spot; and let the woman lie each day, so that the place may not harden otherwise.
Si autem sifach est grossum, spissum: tunc oportet ut seces ipsum cum spatumili lato simili folio myrti.	But if the tissue is thick and coarse, then it is necessary to cut it with a spatula like a leaf of myrtle.
Si autem opilatio est ex carne nata, tunc suspende eam cum uncinis, et incide eam: et sint tecum medicinae quae fluxum sedant sanguinis absque mordicatione, sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus aggregatum cum albugine oui.	But if the obstruction is from flesh that has grown, then suspend it with a hook and cut it off: and be with medicines that will stop the bleeding without biting, such as acacia, dragon's blood, and agaric gathered with the white of an egg.
Deinde administra cannulam ex plumbo amplam, ut non consolidetur uulnus uelociter, teneat eam diebus aliquot: et administra licinium ex lino sicco, deinde curetur reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then administer a catheter made of broad lead, so that the wound does not quickly become solidified; keep it for several days: and then apply linen made from dry flax, and then take care of the remaining treatment until it is healed.
Et quandoque nasciur in matrice natiuitas carnium aliarum: oportet ergo ut incidantur secundum hunc modum: dum non est apostema cancerosum apostemati enim canceroso quod est in matrice, non fiat contrarietas cum ferro omnino.	And when flesh is born in the womb of other births: it is necessary therefore that they are cut according to this manner: while there is no cancerous apostema, for a cancerous apostema that is in the womb, is not at all opposed with iron.
¶ De cura hemorroidarum, Athehelil, et Bothor rubeae in uuluis mulierum.	On the care of hemorrhoids, Athelis and Bothroes in the lips of women.
Caput LXXIII.	Head 73.
Hemorroides quidem sunt apertio orificiorum uenarum, donec currit ex eis sanguis multus assidue.	Hemorrhoids indeed are the opening of the venous openings, until much blood flows out of them continuously.
Cum ergo antiquantur hemorroides, fiunt thelil: et iam dixi in diuisione species earum, et signa ipsarum: et dicam hic quae ex eis recipiunt curationem, et quae non.	When therefore hemorrhoids become old, they become thickened; and I have already said in the division of their kinds and signs: and I will say here which receive cure from them, and which do not.
Dico ergo, quod hemorroides quae sunt in orificio matricis, et non apparent sensui: tunc non est ei curatio cum ferro.	I say therefore that hemorrhoids which are in the opening of the womb and do not appear to the sense: then there is no cure for it with iron.
Quae autem ex eis sunt in orificio matricis super quas cadit sensus, sunt quae curantur.	But those which are on the edge of the opening of the womb and above which sense falls, are those that can be cured.
Oportet ergo ut intromittas mulierem in domum frigidam.	It is necessary therefore that you insert the woman into a cold house.
Deinde extende athehelil cum forficibus, aut cum panno aspero, et incide eas ex radicibus suis.	Then stretch Athelis with forceps or with a rough cloth, and cut them off from their roots.
Deinde pulueriza super eas apud fluxum sanguinis ex uno puluerum incisiuorum absque mordificatione: sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus, et similia eis.	Then sprinkle powder on them near the flow of blood from one cut-up powders without biting: such as acacia, dragon's blood, and thyme, and similar things.
Deinde impellat pedes eius ad parietem hora una.	Then push her feet against the wall for an hour.
Postea depone eam in aquam frigidam.	Afterwards, put her into cold water.
Quod si perseuerat fluxus sanguinis: tunc fac eam sedere in decoctione sumach, et corticum granatorum, et gallarum, et similium.	For if the flow of blood persists, then make her sit in a decoction of sumac, and the bark of pomegranates, and cockerels, and similar things.
Deinde accipe farinam hordei, et confice eam cum melle et aceto, et fac emplastrum cum eo super dorsum eius.	Then take barley flour and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a poultice with it on her back.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis cum eo, bonum est: et si non, fac adhaerere dorso uentosas, et mammillis, absque scarificatione.	If therefore the blood is cut off with that, it is good; and if not, make the back ventous and breast-like, without scarification.
Deinde accipe lanam, et submerge in succo tarathit, aut succo arnoglossae, aut succo ramorum alaulat, id est, aglanter, uino pontico, et fac adhaerere loeo.	Then take wool and submerge it in tarragon syrup, or sycamore maple sap, or the sap of the almond tree, that is, aniseed wine from Pontus, and make it stick to the wound.
Cum ergo quiescit apostema, tunc cura locum cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	When therefore the swelling subsides, then take care of the place with ointments until it heals.
Albarth uero rubeum est simile capitibus alhaasse, et est asperi aspectus.	Red barberry is similar to the heads of aloe and has a rough appearance.
Oportet ergo ut incidas quod apparet ex eo, secundum quod dixi in thelil aequaliter: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Therefore you must cut away what appears from it, as I said before equally in the same way: and take care of it until it heals.
¶ De perforatione Exiturae quae accidit in matrice.	¶ On the perforation of the exit wound that occurs in the womb.
Caput LXXIIII.	Chapter 74.
Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.	Many kinds of swellings occur in the womb, such as cancer, and stone-like swelling, and ulcers, and thickened, and whitlowed, that is, herpes, abscesses, fistulas, hemorrhoids, and gangrenous swellings, and the like.
Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.	And I myself have already said all these diseases and their kinds, and the signs of each one, and their cures in a division: it is necessary for me to say in this treatise about the warm swelling that occurs in the womb, when it results from swellings that gather pus, and you wish to know how it opens with an iron.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	Therefore you must consider.
Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.	Then if the pain of the swelling in its inception is sharp with percussion and heat and fever: and you see it redden: if the sensation falls upon it, then do not hasten with its perforation: and take care of it with it as it helps for maturation, until when the sharpness of the accidents subsides.
Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.	Then you should make the woman sit on a stool that has two armrests, and she will recline, or be supported on her back, and gather her feet towards the lower part of her belly: and her hips should be spread apart, and place her arms under her knees, and bind each one with a suitable ligament to it.
Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latere dextro, et administra instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.	Then the midwife should sit on the right side and administer the instrument with which the opening of the maternal orifice is opened.
Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.	Whose form comes into those that are after.
Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.	And it is necessary when you wish to administer this instrument, that you should thrust it with a deep point into the woman's womb: so that nothing enters from the instrument which exceeds the depth of the womb and hurts the sick woman.
Si autem fuerit instrumentum magis quam profundum, tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos super tecturam profundi matricis: ut prohibeatur introitus instrumenti totius in profundum matricis: et oportet ut ponat uertiginem, quae currit in instrumento, ex latere superiore: et ut teneat instrumentum, et ut reuoluat minister uertiginem, donec aperiatur profundum matricis.	But if the instrument is more than the depth, then it is necessary to place small pads above the covering of the womb's depth: so that the entire instrument may not enter into the depth of the womb; and it is necessary to place a whirlpool which runs in the instrument from the upper side: and to hold the instrument and to turn back the servant of the whirlpool, until the depth of the womb is opened.
Cum ergo apparet Exitura, et tangitur manu, et est lenis et mollis: tunc oportet ut seces ipsam apud caput suum cum spatumili lato.	When therefore the exit appears and is touched by hand, and it is soft and gentle: then it is necessary to cut it at its head with a broad spatula.
Cum ergo euacuatur sanies, tunc oportet ut ponas in uulnus licinium submersum in oleo rosaceo: aut oleo uiridi, in quo sit quaedam stipticitas: et pone licinium, et extrahe sectionem in profundo matricis.	When therefore the discharge is evacuated, then it is necessary to place a linen cloth soaked in rose oil or green oil, which has some adhesive property, into the wound; and place the cloth, and draw out the section in the depth of the womb.
Et pone exterius super matricem, et super pectinem lanam mundam submersam in aqua, in qua bullitae sunt maluae.	And place it outside on the womb, and on the back a clean wool cloth soaked in water where mulberries have been boiled.
Deinde curetur post duos dies cum unguento quod conuenit ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it for two days with an ointment that is suitable for it, until it heals.
Et quandoque abluitur matrix et uulnus, ita quod clisterizatur cum aqua et melle: deinde cum aqua in qua bullita est radix lilii, aut aristolochia longa: deinde redeat ad unguentum.	And when the womb and wound are washed, so that it is cleansed with water and honey; then with water in which lily root or long aristolochia has been boiled; then return to the ointment.
Quod si uulnus absconditum fuerit interius in matrice, tunc oportet ut prohibearis ex curatione eius cum ferro, imo cura ipsum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione.	Which if the wound is hidden inside the womb, then it is necessary to refrain from its cure with iron, nay, rather cure it with what we said in the division.
¶ Doctrinae Obstetricum, qualiter medicentur embriones uiui, secundum figuram non naturalem egressi.	Doctrines of Midwives, how they treat living embryos that have not naturally issued according to form.
Caput Lxxu.	Chapter 70.
Necesse est Obstetrici, ut cognoscat in primis figuram partus naturalis.	It is necessary for a midwife to know first of all the natural form of childbirth.
Ex signis ergo eius est, quod quando uides mulierem comprimi ad inferiora, et desiderat odorare aerem, et alleuiatur super eam quod super ipsam est de partu, et festinat exitus embrionis: tunc scias quod iste partus est secundum figuram naturalem, et est exitus eius super caput suum, et secundina cum eo: aut suspensa, uel pendens ex umbilico.	Therefore, from these signs, it is known that when you see a woman compressed downwards, and she desires to breathe the air, and is relieved above what is above her in childbirth, and hastens the exit of the embryo; then you will know that this birth is according to natural form, and is its exit over its own head, and with the umbilical cord suspended or hanging from the navel.
Cum ergo uides haec signa, tunc oportet ut comprimatur uenter eius, ut descendat embrio uelociter.	When you see these signs, then it is necessary to compress her belly so that the embryo may descend quickly.
Nam quando descendit super caput suum, descendit secundina cum eo, et mundatur ex illis superfluitatibus mundificatione bona.	For when it descends over its own head, the umbilical cord also descends with it, and is purified from those superfluous things by a good purging.
Qui autem est praeter hunc partum, est innaturalis, illaudabilis.	But whoever has a birth other than this one is unnatural and unworthy of praise.
Quoniam quandoque egreditur foetus super pedes suos, et egreditur corpus eius ante caput ipsius, et pedes eius, et manus eius una, aut pes eius unus: aut egreditur caput eius et manus eius: aut egreditur uentrinus: et fortasse conuertitur super collum suum, et similia ex figuris illaudabilibus.	Because sometimes the fetus emerges over its own feet, and its body emerges before its head, and its feet and hands together, or one foot: or it emerges with its head and hands: or it emerges in the womb: and perhaps it turns over its neck, and similar things from unworthy forms.
Necesse est ergo Obstetrici, ut sit prudens, subtilis in istis rebus omnibus, et caueat sibi ab errore et decaeptione: et ego sum ostendens omnem figuram ex eis, et qualiter est ingenium in ea, et significetur per illud, et stetur super ipsum.	Therefore it is necessary for a midwife to be prudent and subtle in all these things, and beware of error and deception: and I am showing every form from them, and how the nature is in each one, and let it be signified by that, and established upon it.
Quando egreditur foetus super caput suum egressione sua naturali, et uehemens fit illud super mulierem, et difficilis fit ei partus, et uides uirtutem eius iam debilitatam: tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, aut mulieres teneant eam: et uapora uuluam eius cum foenugraeco decocto, et cum oleis humidis.	When the fetus emerges over its own head with its natural emergence, and that becomes strong on the woman, and childbirth becomes difficult for her, and you see her strength already weakened: then make her sit down on a seat, or have women hold her; and vapors warm her womb with fenugreek decoction, and with moist oils.
Deinde intromittat Obstetrix inter digitos suos Spatumile paruum, et findat cum eo secundinam, et secet eam ungue suo, donec currat quod est in ea ex humiditate: et preme uentrem mulieris, donec descendat foetus.	Then the midwife inserts a small spatula between her fingers and finds with it a second finger, and touches it with her own nail, until what is inside from moisture flows out: and presses the woman's womb, until the fetus descends.
Si autem non descendit, tunc oportet ut clisterizetur mulier ex mucillagine foenugraeci, cum oleo sisamino.	But if it does not descend, then it is necessary for the woman to be purged with fenugreek mucilage mixed with sesame oil.
Deinde praecipe ei post clistere, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi, et tene os eius et nasum ipsius hora una.	Then instruct her after the purging to be pressed: and make her sneeze with a condiment, and hold her mouth and nose for one hour.
Foetus enim egredietur statim.	For the fetus will immediately come out.
Quod si egrediantur duae manus foetus in primis, iunc oportet ut reducas eas cum facilitate paulatim.	But if the fetus's hands go out first, it is necessary to pull them back slowly and carefully.
Si autem non obedit in introitu, tunc pone mulierem super sedem, et eleua pedes eius sursum: deinde concute sedem super terram: et mulier teneatur, ut non cadat apud concussionem.	But if it does not obey on entering, then place the woman on a seat and lift her feet up: afterwards shake the seat on the ground: and hold the woman so that she may not fall with the concussion.
Si ergo non egrediuntur manus, et moritur foetus: tunc incide eas, et extrahe residuum foetus: et liga manum eius cum panno, et extrahe ipsum cum aequalitate: nam ipse egredietur.	So if the hands do not come out and the fetus dies: then cut them off, and extract the remaining fetus: and bind its hand with a cloth, and extract it carefully: for it will come out.
¶ Exitus embrionis super pedes suo.	The outcome of the embryo on its feet.
Quando egreditur foetus super pedes suos, tunc oportet ut impellat eos sursum: deinde conuertat foetum paulatim: postea aequet ipsum.	When the fetus emerges over its own feet, then it is necessary to push them upwards: afterwards turn the fetus slowly: and then straighten it.
Deinde accipiat unum pedum eius, et extendat eum paulatim.	Then take one of its feet and stretch it out slowly.
Cum ergo egrediuntur usque ad coxas, tunc praecipe ei, ut comprimatur, et fac eam sternutare cum condisi: egredietur enim, si Deus uoluerit.	When they emerge up to the hips, then instruct her to be pressed, and make her sneeze with a condiment: it will come out, if God wills.
Et si non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc reduc foetum paulatim, donec ponas eum secundum figuram naturalem.	And if it does not come out as we have narrated, then pull the fetus back slowly until you place it in its natural shape.
Nam ipse egredietur tunc egressu facili.	For it will come out then with easy delivery.
Quod si prohibeatur cum eo toto quod narrauimus: tunc accipe ex mucillagine alteae, et oleo sisamino, et gummi soluto: et percute totum in mortario percussione bona: deinde line cum eo uuluam mulieris, et inferius uentris eius.	But if it is prevented as we have narrated: then take from alum, and sesame oil, and dissolved gum: and strike the whole thing with good striking in a mortar: afterwards bind it with a woman's cloth, and put it below her belly.
Deinde fac eam sedere in aqua tepida, donec consequatur hypocundria.	Then make it sit in warm water until hypothermia occurs.
Cum ergo uides quod iam calefacta sunt inferiora eius, tunc fac ei sief de myrrha: et suppone ipsum.	So when you see that its lower parts are already warmed, then make it inhale myrrh and support it.
Quando ergo tenet sief hora una, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	When therefore the patient has taken the remedy for an hour, then make him sit on a stool.
Deinde fac eam sternutare: et stringe ipsius os et nasum: et preme inferiorem partem uentris compressione facili.	Then make it sneeze and tighten its mouth and nose, and press the lower part of the stomach with a gentle compression.
Nam foeus egredietur statim.	For fire will immediately come out.
¶ Exitus foetus super genua et manus.	The exit of the fetus is above the knees and hands.
Quando egreditur secundum hanc formam, tunc ingeniet in intromittendo manus suas paulatim.	When it emerges in this form, then guide it by slowly inserting your hands.
Deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manus suas.	Then the woman will be placed on her back over her own pillow, and her feet will hang down below, and she herself will lie on the bed, and wrap her hands around.
Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim.	Then press gently upon her abdomen gradually.
Deinde extrahe quod est sub pedibus eius ex puluinaribus, donec sit praeparata in inferiori parte.	Then remove what is under her feet from the bedclothes until she is prepared on the lower part.
Quod si non egreditur foetus, tunc accipe pedes eius, et moue eos motu uehementi.	What if the fetus does not emerge, then take hold of her feet and move them with a violent motion.
Deinde preme quod est supra hypocundria paulatim, donec ascendat foetus ad superiora.	Then press what is above hypothermia gradually until the fetus ascends to the upper part.
Deinde intromittat manus suas, et aequet foetum paulatim: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimatur, donec egrediatur foetus.	Then insert your hands and gently guide the fetus, and instruct the woman to press down until the fetus emerges.
¶ Exitus foetus latitudinaliter pendens ex manibus.	The exit of the fetus hanging laterally from the hands.
Ingenietur in reductione manus eius.	Guide it in returning her hands.
Si autem non potest reducere eam, tunc eleua mulierem, et fac eam ambulare.	But if she is unable to return it, then lift up the woman and make her walk.
Si uero ambulare non potest, tunc fac eam iacere super lectum: et concute crura eius concussione uehementi.	But if she cannot walk, then make her lie on the bed: and strike her legs with a violent shaking.
Deinde administra linimentum quod praeparasti ex mucillaginibus.	Then administer the ointment that you prepared from the pulps.
Quod si accipit eam partus, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	What if she receives the birth, then make her sit on a stool.
Deinde stude in reductione manus, et aequa foetum secundum figuram naturalem: et fac sternutare mulierem, et praecipe ei, ut comprimat se, donec egrediatur.	Then strive to reduce the hand and shape it evenly according to its natural form: and make the woman sneeze, and tell her to hold herself until she goes out.
¶ Exitus foetus super collum suum, expansis manibus, et est facies eius ad dorsum matris suae.	The exit of the fetus over its mother's shoulder, with arms extended, and its face towards its mother's back.
Oportet ut teneat Obstetrix manum foetus, deinde reuoluat eum paulatim, et aequet eum cum facilitate.	It is necessary that the midwife hold the fetus in her hand, then slowly turn it around and shape it with ease.
Cum ergo aequatur, tunc pone super uuluam eius quod narrauimus ex oleo et mucillaginibus.	When it is shaped, then place on its surface what we have described before, made from oil and mucus-like substances.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut moueatur paulatim.	Then instruct her to move it slowly.
Cum ergo feceris illud, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, et praecipe ei ut inclinetur ad latus dextrum.	When you have done that, then make her sit on a seat and instruct her to lean to the right side.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi.	Then instruct her to compress it: and make her sneeze as you have directed.
¶ Exitus foetus praeparati super latus.	The exit of the prepared fetus over the side.
Quando descendit ad orificium matricis secundum hunc modum cum secundina, tunc scinde secundinam cum ungue tuo, donec euacuetur ex humiditate.	When it descends into the mother's opening in this way with a cord, then cut the cord with your finger until it is emptied of moisture.
Si ergo suspenditur super faciem foetus, et collum eius, tunc incide eam ex umbilico: ut non retineatur, et moriatur.	If it is suspended over the face and neck of the fetus, then cut it from the navel: so that it may not remain and die.
Deinde impelle foetum ad interiora, donec ponas eam secundum quod oportet: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimat se aliquotiens: ipse enim egredietur exitu leui.	Then push the fetus inward until you place it as needed: and instruct the woman to hold herself a few times: for it will emerge with ease.
¶ Exitus Geminorum, aut foetuum multorum.	The exit of twins or multiple fetuses.
Scias, quod Gemini multotiens nascuntur: et quandoque nascuntur tres, et quatuor.	You should know that twins are often born, and sometimes three, and four are born.
Verumtamen illud extraneum est, et raro contingit.	However, that is a rare occurrence and happens infrequently.
Quinque uero est res extra naturam, et non uiuunt penitus: et continet eos, quamuis multiplicentur, secundina una: et separantur per sifach, distinguens inter eos ligatum in umbilico cuiusque eorum.	But five is a thing against nature, and they do not live at all; and it contains them, although they multiply, with one cord: and are separated by the membrane, distinguishing between each of theirs bound together by the navel.
Et quandoque egrediuntur sicut egreditur foetus unus exitu naturali, facili: et egrediuntur exitu illaudabili, sicut narrauimus.	And sometimes they come out as one fetus exits naturally, easily; and they come out in an unlamentable manner, just as we have narrated.
Quod si difficiles fuerint quidam eorum apud partum, et perueniunt ad illud quod diximus ex figuris innaturalibus, tunc cura eos sicut narrauimus: et sit ob stetrix subtilis, et faciat quod facit cum facilitate et tarditate, et ingenietur secundum omnem figuram cum eo quod praeparatur ei ex ingenio ducente ad salutem.	And if some of them are difficult at birth and arrive at what we have described as unnatural forms, then cure them as we have narrated: and let the midwife be subtle, and do what she does with ease and slowness, and shape according to every form with that which is prepared for her by a guiding intelligence towards salvation.
¶ Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.	A reminder of what forms in the womb from embryos, and those who are aborted.
Quandoque formatur in matrice unus, et duo, et tres, et quatuor, et quinque, et sex, et septem, et plures decem: et iam uerificatum est apud me, quod mulier abortiendo emisit septem, et alia quindecim, omnes formatos.	Sometimes one forms in the womb, and two, and three, and four, and five, and six, and seven, and more than ten: and now it is verified with me, that a woman, having aborted, has expelled seven, and fifteen others, all formed.
Quod factum est mensuratione gloriosi sapientis.	What was done by the measurement of a glorious wise one.
Hoc ergo totum oportet ut sit in scientia Obstetricis.	Therefore this whole thing ought to be in the knowledge of an obstetrician.
Fortasse enim perueniet ad eam simile illius: opponat ergo ei cum illo quod oportet	Perhaps it will arrive at that similar one: let him therefore oppose it with what is fitting.
¶ De extractione foetus mortui.	A treatise on the extraction of a dead fetus.
Caput LXXVI.	Chapter 76.
Quando curas foetum mortuum cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex medicatione, et non egreditur, et cogeris uti operatione cum manu, tunc oportet ut consideres.	When you have cared for a dead fetus according to what I said in the division of medicine, and it does not come out, and you are forced to use an operation with your hand, then you should consider.
Si ergo mulier est sanae uirtutis, et non est cum aliquo ex accidentibus, ex quibus timetur super eam perditio: tunc oportet ut resupinetur mulier super lectum, super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius inclinatum inferius, et crura eius eleuata: et ministra teneat eam a duabus partibus, aut ligetur ad lectum, ut non extrahatur corpus eius apud extractionem foetus.	So if the woman is of good virtue and is not troubled by any of those accidents from which one fears loss over her: then it is necessary that the woman be placed on a bed, on her back, and her head inclined downwards, and her legs raised: and let the midwife hold her from both sides, or tie her to the bed, so that her body may not be pulled apart during the extraction of the fetus.
Deinde humecta os matricis ex oleis humidis cum mucillagine alteae, et foenugraeci, et seminis lini.	Then anoint the opening of the uterus with moist oils mixed with high-quality mucus, fenugreek, and flaxseed.
Deinde inungat Obstetrix manum suam cum istis oleis et mucillaginibus: deinde intromittat eam in matricem cum facilitate.	Then the midwife should grease her hand with these oils and mucilages; then she should insert it into the womb with ease.
Deinde quaerat cum ea locum in quo figat uncinos ex foetu, et loca conuenientia ad illud.	Then she should seek out the place where she will insert the forceps from the child, and the suitable places for it.
Considera ergo tunc, si foetus est praeparatus ut descendat super caput suum: tunc fige uncinos in oculos eius, aut in collo eius, aut in ore eius, aut in palato ipsius, aut sub barba eius, aut in furcula ipsius, aut in locis propinquis costis, et sub hypocundriis.	So then consider whether the child is prepared to descend over its own head; then insert the forceps into its eyes, or on its neck, or mouth, or palate, or under its chin, or at the hollow of its shoulder, or in nearby places along the ribs, and beneath the hypochondriac region.
Si autem descensus est super pedes eius, tunc in pectine, et costis eius mediis.	But if the descent is over its feet, then into the flank and middle of its ribs.
Et oportet, ut teneat uncinum cum manu dextra: et ponat curuitatem eius in eo quod est inter digitos sinistrae manus: et intromittat cum manu cum facilitate, et figat uncinum in aliquo illorum locorum quae diximus, donec perueniat ad rem uacuam.	And it is necessary that she holds the forceps with her right hand: and places its curvature between the fingers of her left hand: and inserts it with ease, and sets the forceps in one of those places which we have mentioned, until she reaches the empty space.
Deinde figat in oppositione eius uncinum alium, aut tertium, si indiges: ut sit contractio aequalis, et non declinet ad partem.	Then she should set another forceps or third one if needed, to be in opposition to it, so that the contraction is equal and does not lean towards a side.
Deinde extendatur extensione aequali, et non sit extensio secundum rectitudinem tantum, imo moueatur ad omnem partem, ut alleuietur exitus eius: sicut fit cum dente apud eradicationem eius.	Then it should be extended with equal extension, and not just straight out, but rather move towards all parts, so that its exit is eased: just as happens when a tooth is being extracted.
Et oportet in eo quod est inter illud, ut mollificetur extensio.	And it is necessary to soften the extension in between those things.
Quod si retineatur ex eo pars, tunc oportet ut inungat Obstetrix quosdam digitos cum oleo, et intromittat eos ex parte, ut reuoluat cum eis quod retinetur.	And if a part remains stuck, then the midwife should grease some fingers with oil and insert them from that side to turn back what is holding it.
Si ergo egreditur pars foetus, tunc permutentur uncini ad locum alium qui sit altior: fac hoc donec egrediatur foetus totus.	If therefore a part of the fetus emerges, then the forceps should be changed to another place that is higher: do this until the entire fetus has emerged.
Si ergo egreditur manus ante alia, et non est possibile reducere eam, propter coartationem eius: tunc oportet, ut inuoluatur super eam pannus.	If therefore the arm emerges before others and it is not possible to reduce it because of its constriction: then it is necessary that a cloth be wrapped over it.
Deinde extrahe eam donec quando egreditur tota, incide eam aut in iunctura plantae, aut in cubito: et ita oportet ut facias in manu altera, et in duobus pedibus.	Then take her out until she comes out entirely, cut her either at the joint of the foot or at the arm: and thus you should do on the other hand as well, and on both feet.
Si autem caput foetus est magnum, aut accidit ei coartatio in exitu, aut est in capite eius aqua aggregata: tunc oportet ut intromittat inter digitos Spatumile spinosum, et findat cum eo caput, et extrahat aquam: aut disrumpat ipsum cum instrumento quod nominatur Almisdac: cuius forma uenit cum formis reliquorum instrumentorum in capitulo quod est post hoc.	But if the head of the foetus is large, or constriction occurs at birth, or water is aggregated in its head: then you should insert a thorn-like spatula between the fingers and cut with it, and draw out the water: or dismember it with an instrument called Almisdac: whose form comes with the forms of other instruments in the chapter that follows.
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.	He should do similarly if the foetus has a natural large head, then it is necessary to cut off the afterbirth: or draw it out with an Almisdac, as we said.
Deinde attrahas ossa cum forcipibus.	Then take up the bones with forceps.
Quod si egrediatur caput, et coartetur apud furculam: tunc findatur, donec effundatur humiditas quae est in pectore.	What if the head comes out and is constricted at the nape of the neck: then it should be cut, until the moisture that is in the chest is discharged.
Si autem non complicatur, neque obedit ad exitum: tunc incide caput frustatim, secundum quod possibile est tibi.	But if it does not unwind and does not yield to birth: then cut the head into pieces, as is possible for you.
Quod si inferius uentris est apostematum, aut est in eo hydropisis: tunc oportet ut perfores ipsum, donec currat humiditas ex eo.	What if the lower part of the belly is inflamed, or there is dropsy in it: then you should pierce it, until the moisture flows out of it.
Si uero foetus est super pedes suos, tunc attractio eius est facilis, et directio eius ad os matricis est leuis.	If the foetus is above its feet, then its extraction is easy and its direction towards the maternal mouth is easy.
Si autem coartatur apud uentrem, aut pectus: tunc oportet ut extrahas ipsum cum panno quem inuoluisti super manum tuam: et findat uentrem, aut pectus, donec currat quod est in eis.	But if it is constricted at the belly or chest: then you should draw it out with the cloth you have wrapped around your hand: and cut the belly or chest until what is in them flows out.
Si autem auferuntur reliqua membra, et redit caput: tunc intromittat Obstetrix manum sinistram.	But if the remaining limbs are removed and the head returns: then the Obstetrician should insert their left hand.
Si ergo os matricis est apertum, tunc intromittat manum in profundum matricis, et quaerat cum ea caput, et attrahat ipsum cum digitis usque ad os matricis: deinde intromittat in eo uncinum unum, aut uncinos duos, et attrahat ipsum cum eo.	If then the maternal mouth is open, then insert your hand into the depth of the uterus, and seek with it the head, and grasp it with your fingers up to the maternal mouth: then insert one hook or two hooks into it, and draw it out with that.
Quod si os matricis coartatur, propter apostema calidum quod accidit ei: tunc non oportet ut laboretur super ipsum, imo oportet tunc administrare effusionem rerum humidarum, pinguium: et administra emplastra: et sedeat in aquis quae mollificant et humectant.	If the os matricis is constricted, due to a warm abscess that occurs to it; then it is not necessary to work on it, rather it is necessary at that time to administer an effusion of moist things, fatty substances: and apply poultices: and sit in waters that soften and moisten.
Quod si foetus est super latus suum, tunc possibile est ut aequetur: tunc administretur quod diximus in foetu uiuo.	If a fetus is situated above its own side; then it is possible that it will be equalized: then administer what we said for a living fetus.
Quod si non est possibile illud, tunc incidatur frustatim, et extrahatur.	If it is not possible [to equalize], then cut away bit by bit and extract it.
Et oportet ut non dimittas aliquid ex secundina intus omnino.	And you must not leave anything of the afterbirth inside at all.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc administra quod diximus in apostematibus calidis quae accidunt in matricibus.	When therefore you have completed your operation, then administer what we said for warm abscesses that occur in wombs.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc descendat in aquis stipticis, et administra reliquam curationem.	If bleeding occurs, then let it flow into cooling waters and administer the remaining treatment.
Et ego quidem iam uidi mulierem, in cuius uentre mortuus erat foetus: deinde impregnata est super ipsum uice alia, postea mortuus est foetus alius etiam.	And I indeed have seen a woman whose womb had a dead fetus: then she became pregnant again with another child in its place, afterwards another fetus also died.
Accidit ergo ei post tempus longum apostema in umbilico suo, et inflatum est, donec apertum est: et coepit emittere pus.	Therefore an abscess occurred to her after a long time in her navel, and it became inflamed until it was opened: and began to discharge pus.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius, et medicatus sum ei tempore longo: et non consolidatum est uulnus.	I was therefore summoned to her treatment, and I treated her for a long time: and the wound did not consolidate.
Posui ergo super ipsum ex quibusdam emplastris fortis attractionis: et exiuit ex loco os.	So I placed on it some poultices of strong attraction, and it expelled from its place a bone.
Deinde praeterierunt ei dies aliquot, et exiuit os aliud.	Then a few days passed and another bone was expelled.
Miratus sum ergo inde, cum in uentre non sit os.	I therefore looked with wonder, since there is no bone in the womb.
Cogitaui ergo, quia erant ex ossibus foetus mortui.	I then thought, because they were from the bones of a dead fetus.
Inquisiui ergo uulnus, et extraxi ossa multa, muliere existente in melioribus dispositionibus suis: et iam uixit taliter tempore longo, et mittit ex loco pus parum.	I then examined the wound and extracted many bones from her, the woman existing in better conditions than before; and now she has lived thus for a long time, and is discharging pus a little from the site.
Et ego non firmaui hic hoc extraneum, nisi quoniam in eo est scientia, et adiutorium ad illud, quod administrat medicus artifex cum manu ex curatione.	And I did not strengthen this foreign thing here, except that it has knowledge and aid to what the medical craftsman administers with his hand for healing.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum necessariorum in extractione foetus.	§ On the shapes of necessary instruments in extracting a fetus.
Caput LXXVII.	Chapter 77.
Hic inferius est forma Strictorii, quo aequantur libri, cui aequaliter sunt duae uertigines in duabus extremitatibus duorum lignorum.	Here is the shape of the Straightener, by which books are made equal, to which two handles are attached at the ends of two pieces of wood.
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilior strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.	However, this handle should be thinner than the straightener; and it should be made either of ebony or of boxwood.
Et sit latitudo omnis ligni quasi duo digiti: et margo cuiusque amborum est quasi digitus unus, et longitudo cuiusque eorum est palmus et medietas: et in medio duorum lignorum sunt duo additamenta ex genere eiusdem ligni, quae iam firmata sunt in utrisque, quorum longitudo est medietas palmi et plus parum: et latitudo utriusque est quasi duo digiti, aut plus parum.	And the width of all wood should be about two fingers; and the edge of each of them is about one finger, and the length of each of them is a hand and a half: and in the middle of the two pieces of wood are two additions made of the same kind of wood, which are already fixed on both, whose length is half a hand and a little more: and the width of each of them is about two fingers, or a little more.
Et ista duo additamenta intromittuntur in os matricis, ut aperiatur cum eis quando tu reuoluis duas Vertigines.	And these two additions are inserted into the mother's mouth, so that it may be opened with them when you revolve the two Handles.
Forma Vertiginis qua aperitur matrix.	The shape of the Handle by which the womb is opened.
Forma alia ad simile illius, subtilior, et leuior.	Another form similar to it, thinner and lighter.
Fiat ex ligno ebani, aut bussi, secundum similitudinem forcipum.	It should be made of ebony wood or boxwood, according to the likeness of forceps.
Verumtamen in extremitate eius sint duo additamenta, sicut uides hic supra: et longitudo omnis additamenti ex eis est quasi palmus: et latitudo utriusque est, duo digiti.	However, at the end of it there should be two additions, like you see here above: and the length of each addition is about a hand: and the width of each is two fingers.
Cum ergo uis aperire matricem cum eo, tunc fac sedere mulierem super lectum, pendentibus pedibus eius, aperto quod est inter crura eius.	When therefore you wish to open the womb with this, then make the woman sit on a bed, her legs hanging down, with what is between her thighs open.
Deinde intromitte ista duo additamenta coniuncta in matricem: et tu es tenens extremitatem instrumenti inferius inter coxas eius.	Then insert those two additions joined together into the womb; and you should be holding the lower end of the instrument below her buttocks.
Deinde aperi manum tuam cum instrumento, sicut facis cum forficibus, aequaliter secundum quantitatem quam uis ex apertione oris matricis, donec faciat Obstetrix quod uult.	Then open your hand with the instrument, just as you do with forceps, equally according to the quantity which you wish from opening the mouth of the matrix, until it makes whatever the midwife wants.
Forma Vertiginis alterius quam dixerunt antiqui Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.	The form of the other kind of vertigo which the ancients called the "form impellent" by which the fetus is driven forth.
Forma Almisdac, qua conteritur caput magnum: et assimilatur forcipi, cui sunt dentes in extremitate, sicut uides.	The form of the Almisdac, whereby the great head is crushed and resembles forceps with teeth at the end, as you see.
Et quandoque fit oblungum, sicut forcipes secundum hanc formam, sicut uides, cui sunt dentes sicut dentes serrae, quo inciditur et conteritur.	And sometimes it is made oval, like forceps in this shape, as you see, with teeth like the teeth of a saw, by which it is cut and crushed.
Forma Almisdac quo conteritur caput paruum.	The form of the Almisdac whereby the small head is crushed.
Forma Vncini habentis spinam unam.	The form of the one-spired binder.
Forma Vncini habentis spinas duas.	The form of the two-spired binder.
Forma forcipis cui sunt dentes serrae, cum quo conteritur caput foetus.	The form of forceps with saw-like teeth, by which the head of the fetus is crushed.
Forma Spatumilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.	The form of a spatula having two ends for cutting off the head.
Forma duorum Spatumilium etiam latorum.	The form of two broad spatulas.
Ista instrumenta omnia exercentur, et quanto plus multiplicantur species eorum, et praeparata sunt apud artificem, est uelocior ad operationem suam, et altior apud homines, propter quantitatem suam.	All these instruments are exercised and to the extent that their kinds multiply and are prepared with the craftsman, it is swifter in its operation and higher among people due to its quantity.
Non ergo despicies ex eis instrumentum, quin sit apud te praeparatum.	Therefore do not despise any of these instruments, but rather have them prepared with you.
Inexcusabilis est enim necessitas eorum.	For there is an inexcusable necessity for them.
¶ De extractione Secundinae.	Paragraph about the extraction of the second child.
Caput LXXVIII.	Chapter 78.
Quando retinetur Secundina apud partum, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmae, ut retineat anhelitum suum.	When the second child is retained during childbirth, then it is necessary to hasten the weak woman, so that she retains her breath.
Deinde fac eam sternutare cum condisi: et stringe manum tuam super os eius, et nares ipsius.	Then make her sneeze with condiments; and bind your hand over her mouth, and nose as well.
Si ergo egreditur per hoc, bonum est.	If it then emerges through this, it is good.
Si non: tunc accipe ollam, et perfora in coopertorio foramen: et pone in ea herbas aperientes os matricis, sicut calamentum, rutam, et anetum, et camomillam, et sseham, et cassiam ligneam, et centauream: accipe omnes istas herbas, aut quasdam earum, et submerge eas cum aqua, et pone eas super ignem.	If not: then take a pot, and make a hole in its covering; and put into it herbs that open the mouth of the womb, such as calament, rue, and anise, and camomile, and sassafras, and cassia wood, and centaury. Take all these herbs, or some of them, and submerge them in water, and place them over fire.
Deinde pone embulam arundinis super foramen coopertorii ollae, et extremitatem aliam in os matricis: et teneat eam donec perueniat uapor ad concauitatem matricis.	Then place the reed's gall on top of the hole in the pot's covering, and put another end into the womb's mouth: and hold it until the vapor reaches the softening of the womb.
Deinde fac eam sternutare, sicut diximus.	Then make her sneeze, as we said.
Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitate.	For indeed the Secundin will come out with ease.
Si autem remaneat post hanc curationem, et non egrediatur: tunc praecipe Obstetrici, ut submergat manum suam in oleo sisamino, aut mucillagine alteae.	But if it remains after this treatment and does not come out: then command the midwife to dip her hand in sesame oil or a white mucus.
Deinde intromittat in uuluam, et quaerat cum ea Secundinam.	Then insert it into the womb, and seek with it the Secundina.
Cum ergo inuenerit eam, tunc accipiat eam, et extendat ipsam paulatim.	When she has found it, then take it and gradually stretch it out.
Si autem fuerit annexa in profundo matricis, tunc intromittat manum, secundum quod narrauimus, donec quando inuenerit Secundinam, et extrahat eam paulatim secundum rectitudinem, ut non cadat matrix apud attractionem uehementem: imo oportet, ut permutetur cum facilitate ad latera dextra et sinistra: deinde addatur in quantitatem attractionis.	But if it is attached deep in the womb, then insert your hand according to what we have said, until you find the Secundina, and gradually pull it out straight, so that the womb does not fall apart due to strong attraction: rather, it should be turned with ease to the right and left sides: then add to the extent of the attraction.
Ipsa enim obedit tunc, et seruatur, et euadit ab adhaerentia.	Itself will then obey, and be preserved, and escape from attachment.
Quod si os matricis est coartatum, sicut nos iam narrauimus: cura eam cum sternutatione, et ex medicatione ollae cum herbis.	But if the womb's mouth is constricted, as we have already said: treat it with sneezing and from the medicine of the pot with herbs.
Si autem non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc caue ne fatigeris super eam in iteratione extractionis.	But if it does not come out with all that we have said, then beware lest you exhaust yourself over her in the repetition of extractions.
Verum oportet, ut quod egreditur ad os matricis ex ea, liges ad coxam mulieris.	But it is necessary to tie what comes out to the mouth of the womb from her to the woman's hip.
Deinde clisteriza eam cum unguento tetrapharmacon.	Then anoint it with the four-ingredient ointment.
Ipsum enim putrefaciet eam post dies, et dissoluetur, et egredietur.	For this will corrupt and break down in her after a few days, and will be dissolved and come out.
Verumtamen quando putrefit, eleuatur ex ea odor malus ad stomachum et caput, et laedit illud infirmam.	But when it corrupts, a bad smell is raised from her to the stomach and head, and harms that sick person.
Oportet ergo ut administrentur suffumigationes conuenientes ad illud.	Therefore, suitable purgatives should be administered to him.
Quidam autem antiquorum iam experti sunt suffumigationem nasturtii, et ficuum siccarum.	But some ancient doctors have already experimented with a purging mixture of watercress and dried figs.
Forma instrumenti quo suffumigatur mulier apud retentionem Secundinae et menstruorum.	The form of the instrument by which a woman is purged during retention of the Secondine and menses.
Fiat ex uitro simile alcama, aut ex zere: et ponatur extremitas ampla super ignem: et suffumigatio sit posita super prunas: teneat eam, donec consumatur illa suffumigatio: et itera aliam.	Let it be made from a similar glass or zircon: and let the broad end be placed over the fire: and let the purging be placed on the coals: let it hold her until that purging is consumed: and then do another.
¶ De curatione Ani non perforati.	Concerning the treatment of an unperforated hernia.
Caput LXXIX.	Chapter 79.
Nascuntur multi puerorum, et Ani eorum sunt non perforati, quos iam opilauit sifac subtile.	Many boys are born and their hernias are not perforated, which I have already covered with a thin membrane.
Oportet ergo, ut obstetrix perforet illud sifac digito suo: et si non, perforet ipsum cum Spatumili acuto: et caueat lacertum, ne tangat eum.	Therefore, the midwife must pierce that membrane with her finger; and if not, she must pierce it with a sharp spatula; and beware the arm, lest it touch him.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam infusam in uino et oleo.	Then place linen soaked in wine and oil over him.
Deinde cura ipsum cum ungentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for him with ointments until he is healed.
Si autem times quod opiletur, tunc pone in foramine cannulam de plumbo diebus multis, et auferatur quando puer uult egerere.	But if you fear it will obstruct, then place a leaden cannula in the opening and leave it for many days, and remove it when the boy wishes to excrete.
Et iam accidit opilatio Ani etiam ex consolidatione uulneris, aut apostematis.	And also the obstruction of a hernia can occur through the consolidation of a wound or an abscess.
Oportet ergo ut secetur illa consolidatio, deinde curetur cum eo quod diximus ex curatione et plumbo.	Therefore, it is necessary to cut open that consolidation, and then treat it with what we said about treatment and lead.
¶ De curatione Fistularum quae accidunt in inferiori parte.	Concerning the treatment of fistulas that occur in the lower part.
Caput LXXX.	Here is the translation:
Fistulae quae accidunt in inferiori, sunt Nodatio, et Grossitudo quae accidunt prope anum deforis: aut in spacio unius partium: et est Fistula una, aut plures.	Fistulas that occur in the lower part are called Nodation and Grossitude which occur near the anus outside or in a space of one part, and there is one fistula, or multiple.
Cum ergo antiquatur illa Nodatio, aperitur, et currit ex ea humiditas aquosa alba, aut pus subtile.	When therefore that Nodation becomes old, it opens up, and watery white fluid, or fine pus, flows out of it.
Et quandoque sunt ex istis Fistulis penetrantes.	And sometimes these fistulas are penetrating.
Ergo penetrantes cognoscuntur per illud quod egreditur ex egestione, et uentositate, quando utitur infirmus egestione: et fortasse egreditur ex eis uermis.	Therefore penetrating fistulas are recognized by what comes out of discharge and vomiting when a sick person uses purgation: and perhaps a worm emerges from them.
Et sunt ex eis Fistulae quando sunt in spacio penetrantes usque ad uesicam, et usque ad meatum uirgae.	And there are fistulas among these when they are penetrating into the bladder and up to the urethra.
Et sunt ex eis penetrantes usque ad iuncturam coxae, et usque ad nodum caudae.	And there are fistulas among these that penetrate as far as the joint of the hip and as far as the knot of the tail.
Ex eo autem quo cognoscitur Fistula penetrans usque ad anum, etiam a non penetrante, est, ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum: et intromittas tentam subtilem in Fistulam ex aere, aut ferro: quando non est tortuositas.	From that which is known as a penetrating fistula up to the anus, whether it is penetrating or not, is when you insert your index finger into the anus and then insert a fine wire probe into the fistula from air or iron, when there is no bend.
Quod si in ea est tortuositas, tunc intromitte in eam tentam ex plumbo subtilem, aut pilum ex pilis equarum, donec sentias tentam, aut pilum in digito tuo.	But if there is a bend in it, then insert into it a fine probe of lead or a hair from the manes of horses until you feel the probe or hair with your finger.
Quod si non sentis ipsam penitus, neque procedit ex foramine aliquid ex egestione, neque uentositas, neque uermis sicut dixi: tunc scias, quia est non penetrans: propera ergo ad curationem.	But if you don't feel it fully and nothing comes out of the opening through discharge or vomiting, nor a worm as I said: then you will know that it is not penetrating: therefore hasten to the treatment.
Et quando Fistula est penetrans usque ad uesicam, aut ad meatum urinae: tunc significatio eius est exitus urinae ex ea, et prohibitio eius ab hoc ut consolidetur locus cum medicinis.	And when a fistula is penetrating as far as the bladder or up to the urethra: then its significance is the discharge of urine from it, and hindering this so that the place does not consolidate with medicine.
Si uero est penetrans usque ad iuncturam coxae, aut ad os coxae: tunc signum eius est, quod perueniat tenta usque illuc, si non est in ea tortuositas usque ad os: et inuentio doloris in circumitu partis, et quod egreditur pus ex ea semper: et quod non ualeat in ea medicatio, neque consolidatur cum unguento.	But if it is penetrating as far as the joint of the hip or up to the socket of the hip: then its sign is that the probe will reach there, unless there is a bend all the way to the bone; and the discovery of pain in the surrounding part, and that pus always comes out of it; and that treatment does not succeed in it, nor consolidates with ointment.
Et in istis Fistulis omnibus penetrantibus non est curatio omnino: et curatio earum est labor et uanitas ei, ex stultis medicis, super quem formatur.	And in these penetrating fistulas there is no cure at all. And the cure of them is toil and vanity for foolish doctors, who build upon it.
In illa autem quae non est penetrans, et non antiqua, speratur sanatio cum serro: secundum quod ego narro tibi, et ego iam probaui: et est, ut iaceat infirmus inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et eleua crura eius usque supra coxas ipsius, et coxae eius sint inclinatae ad uentrem ipsius.	But in those that are not penetrating and not old, there is hope of healing with a poultice. According to what I tell you, and I have already tried it: and thus the patient lies between your hands on their back; and lift up their legs as far as above the hips of theirs, and their hips be inclined towards their belly.
Deinde intromittetentam plumbi, aut aeris, si est in Fistula tortuositas, donec scias ubi peruenit tenta.	Then introduce a lead or air probe into the fistula, if it is twisted, until you know where it reaches.
Si autem sentit eam infirmus circa anum, tunc oportet ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum.	But if the patient feels it near the anus, then it is necessary for you to insert your index finger into the anus.
Si ergo sentis in digito tuo tentam iam penetrasse per seipsam detectam, praeter quod sentias inter digitum tuum, et inter ipsum sifac, aut carnem: tunc ergo scias certe, quia est penetrans: non ergo labores in ea, quoniam non est eius sanatio, sicut diximus.	So then if you feel with your finger that it has already penetrated through to the other side and detected, besides what you feel between your finger and the skin or flesh, then certainly you know that it is penetrating: therefore do not trouble yourself in it, since there is no healing for it, as we said.
Dixerunt tamen, quia sanatur in quibusdam hominibus caro, et ex medicatione qua ei speratur iuuamentum, est, ut ignias cauterium subtile secundum amplitudinem Fistulae, sicut praecessit, et intromittas ipsum ignitum in Fistulam, donec perueniat circa anum.	However, it is said that the flesh is healed in some people through medication and treatment, which promises relief. This is done by applying a burning cauter to the extent of the fistula, as previously described, and then inserting the burning cauter into the fistula until it reaches the anus.
Deinde itera illud bis, aut ter, donec scias, quia iam adustae sunt omnes illae carnes additae filtratae, quae sunt similes cannulae pennae auis.	Then repeat this process two or three times until you know that all the added, filtered flesh is charred and resembles the feathers of a bird's wing.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, donec egrediantur illae carnes, quae adustae sunt: deinde cura illud cum unguentis generantibus carnem et consolidantibus.	Then bind the charred flesh with bandages soaked in butter until it discharges; then treat it with ointments that promote flesh growth and consolidation.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est.	If it is healed, it is good.
Et si non, tunc non sanatur cum alia curatione unquam.	And if not, then it will not be healed with any other treatment at all.
Et si egreditur tenta, et non peruenerit usque ad digitum tuum, qui est in ano, et est inter ipsum et tentam uelamen spissum ex carne, aut sifac: et uides Fistulam in eo quod sequitur superficiem cutis, tunc seca cutem ab initio Fistulae, et tu uadis secando cum tenta quod est in fistula, donec perueniat secatio ubi peruenit tentae extremitas, et liberatur tenta et cadit.	And if the tract exits and does not reach as far as your finger which is in the anus, and is between it and the tract or a thick membrane of flesh, or even: and you see a fistula on the surface that follows the skin, then cut the skin at the beginning of the fistula, and you go cutting with the tract as it is in the fistula, until the incision reaches where the end of the tract ends, and the tract is freed and falls.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas, quae assimilantur cannulae pennae auis, ut non remaneat ex eis aliquid.	Then cleanse those filtered meats, which resemble a bird's feather, so that nothing remains from them.
Si autem uincit te sanguis, et soluit inter te et inter operationem tuam ut seces illas carnes: tunc melius quod fit, et uelocioris iuuamenti, cauterizare eam cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta.	But if blood overflows and prevents you from cutting those meats between yourself and the operation you are doing: then what is done is better, and hastens more to one's advantage, to cauterize it with fire or with sharp medicine.
Quoniam cauterium cum igne aggregat habitudines bonas, adustionem illarum carnium additarum, et abscisionem sanguinis, et exiccationem humiditatum.	Because the cautery with fire gathers good qualities, adds dryness to those added flesh, and brings about drying of blood and moisture.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, aut caulibus tritis, donec locus emittat pus, et egrediantur illae carnes adustae in pus.	Then care for that with bandages wrapped in lard or crushed calfskin, until the place discharges pus, and those charred flesh parts emerge into pus.
Deinde cura tunc uulnus cum unguentis consolidatiuis, generantibus carnem duram: et sunt medicinae in quibus sunt stipticitas et exiccatio.	Then care for the wound with consolidating ointments, which generate hard flesh: and there are medicines in which are astringency and drying.
Nam quando restaurantur, tunc iam sanatur: et non times iterationem.	For when it is restored, then it is already healed: and you do not fear repetition.
Si autem Fistula iam peruenit usque ad profundum ani, et elongatur a superfluitate corporis: tunc intromitte digitum tuum in anum, et inquire cum eo.	But if the fistula has reached as far as the depth of the anus, and is separated from the excess of the body: then insert your finger into the anus and explore with it.
Si ergo sentis tentam, et inter te, et inter eam est uelamen ex sifac, aut carne, et est propinqua penetrationi: tunc non est operatio in illo, nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	So if you feel the tract, and between it and yourself is a membrane of fat or flesh, and it is near penetration: then there is no operation there, unless according to the way of faith and hope.
Quod est, quia administratur in eo unus trium modorum: aut ut cauterizes ipsam, sicut diximus: aut seces eam, donec consequaris concauitatem eius, ut sit possibile tibi intromittere licinia, et curationem ex proximo.	Which is one of the three ways it is administered there: or that you cauterize it as we said: or cut it, until you achieve its concavitation, so that it is possible for you to insert a linen and effect a cure nearby.
Et non procedas multum cum sectione, ut non incidas lacertum continentem anum, et accidat super infirmum exitus egestionis absque uoluntate.	And do not proceed with a lot of cutting so that you don't cut the arm containing the vein, and there occurs on the weak person an exit of evacuation without consent.
Deinde cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then take care of that which we mentioned.
Fortasse enim sanabitur: aut elonges ipsum uelamen, et mundes ipsum postquam secas ipsum usque prope anum, sicut diximus, aut cum tenta, aut cum instrumento alio acutae extremitatis.	Perhaps it will heal; or you should draw out the cloth, and cleanse it after you have cut it up to the vein, as we said, or with a sponge, or with another sharp instrument.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas quae sunt in sectione, usque ubi potes cum perscrutatione.	Then cleanse those filtered meats that are in the incision, as far as you can with probing.
Deinde conare restaurationem uulneris totius cum sectione, et orificio superiore ubi consolidatur: et remanet Fistula aperta in interiore parte anus, et erit leuius super infirmum.	Then try to restore the wound as a whole with the incision, and at the upper opening where it is consolidated; and there will remain an open fistula in the inner part of the anus, and it will be easier on the weak person.
Et quandoque suitur Fistula secundum hunc modum: et est, quando intromittis tentam in Fistulam: et est in latere ani circa superficiem corporis cum cute et margine ani: tunc accipe tentam perforatae extremitatis, quae est sicut acus aleskef, id est, praeparantium coria, secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes the fistula follows this shape: and it is when you insert the sponge into the fistula; and it is on the side of the anus near the surface of the body with the skin and margin of the anus: then take the perforated end of the sponge, which is like an awl for preparing skins, according to this form.
Et intromitte in eam filum inuolutum ex quinque filis, et circiter ea.	And insert into it a thread wrapped around five threads, and about that size.
Deinde intromitte tentam cum filo in Fistulam, donec consequatur concauitatem eius.	Then insert the sponge with the thread into the fistula, until you reach its hollow.
Si ergo est penetrans in margine ani interius prope, tunc extrahe filum ex illo foramine: ita ut intromittas digitum tuum in anum, et extrahas extremitatem fili, et aggreges duas extremitates simul: et stringe utramque, et dimitte illud die uno, aut duobus diebus: et quanto plus incidit filum in carne, stringe ipsum bene, donec incidantur illae carnes quae sunt inter duas extremitates fili, et cadant: deinde cura uulnus, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	If therefore it is penetrating inside the margin of the anus nearby, then withdraw the thread from that hole: thus insert your finger into the anus, and draw out the end of the thread, and tie both ends together; and tighten one end a little, and leave it for one or two days: and as much as the thread goes into the flesh, tighten it well, until the flesh between the two ends of the thread falls away: then care for the wound until it consolidates and heals.
Si autem orificium Fistulae non est penetrans: tunc fac ipsum penetrare quocunque modo praeparatur tibi, nisi sit in profundo multum.	If however the opening of the fistula is not penetrating: then make it penetrate by any means that is prepared for you, except if it is very deep.
Non enim inest tibi, ut facias illud propter lacertum, ut non incidas ipsum.	It is not necessary for you to do that because of your elbow so as not to cut it.
Deinde fac cum ea sicut diximus, donec sanetur.	Then do with it as we said, until it heals.
Forma Spatumilis spinosi quo finditur Fistula, cuius curuitas est acuta ualde, et pars altera est non acuta, ut non incidat illud quod non est necesse, sicut uides.	The form of a spiny thorn that is stuck in a fistula, whose curvature is very sharp and the other part is not sharp, so that you do not cut what is unnecessary, as you see.
¶ De sutura Hemorroidarum, ex quibus currit sanguis ex incisione earum: et cura fissurarum.	Of the stitching of hemorrhoids, from which blood flows after they are cut: and of the care of fissures.
Caput LXXXI.	Chapter 81.
Sunt Hemorroides secundum duos modos.	There are hemorrhoids in two ways.
Aut enim sunt intra anum, similes uesicis carbonum, uel prunarum: aut quasi ipsae sint grana uuae.	Either they are inside the anus, similar to charcoal warts or prunes: or as if they were grape seeds themselves.
Et ex eis sunt paruae, et magnae: et sanguis currit ex eis semper, et est una, et sunt multae.	And from them are small ones and large ones: and blood flows from them always, and it is one, and there are many.
Et sunt extra anum, et in extremitatibus eius.	And they are outside the anus, and at its extremities.
Verumtamen istae quae sunt extra anum, sunt secundum plurimum paucae humiditatis, ex quibus currit aqua citrina, aut parum sanguinis cursu assiduo: et sunt secundum colorem corporis.	However, those that are outside the anus are for the most part few in moisture, from which clear water or a little blood flows with steady course: and they are according to the color of the body.
Et curatio eius quae est intra anum, est, ut praecipias infirmo ut assellet: et exprimatur, donec egrediatur anus, et appareant athelil tibi.	And the cure for what is inside the anus is, that you should have someone assist the patient to sit down: and let it be expressed, until it exits the anus, and appear to you as pure.
Propterea ergo et suspende cum uncinis: aut tene eos cum ungue tuo.	Therefore, also use a hook to suspend them: or hold them with your finger.
Deinde incide eos apud radices suas.	Then cut them at their roots.
Si autem non retinentur in eis uncini, propter humiditatem eorum et ipsorum mollificationem: tunc cape eos cum panno aspero, aut cum coto ex diploide lanea, et extrahe eos cum digitis tuis.	But if they are not held in place by hooks, due to their moisture and softening: then take them with a rough cloth, or with a piece of coarse linen, and extract them with your fingers.
Deinde incide eos, et pulueriza super eos post incisionem quosdam pulueres calidos, ut stent eis loco cauterii.	Then cut them, and powder some hot powders over them after the cutting, so that they may serve as a cauterizing agent.
Aut cauteriza eos secundum quod praecessit in capitulo cauterizandi.	Or cauterize them according to what preceded in the chapter on cauterization.
Deinde cura eos cum reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then take care of them with the rest of their treatment until they are healed.
Quod si non obedit anus egressioni, tunc clisteriza infirmum clisteri in quo sit mordicatio parua, ut lauetur cum eo quod est in ano, et obediat egressioni uelociter, quando exprimit se infirmus.	If the patient does not obey evacuations, then treat the patient with an enema containing a small amount of medication, so that they may be cleansed along with what is in their anus, and will soon obey evacuations when the patient expresses themselves.
Si autem athelil sunt extrinseci ab ano, tunc res eorum est leuis, facilis: et est ut capias eos cum ungue tuo, aut capias eos cum uncino, et incidas eos.	But if the stones are external to the anus, then their fate is light, easy; and it is as if you were to take them with your finger, or take them with a hook, and cut them.
Deinde cura eos cum eo quod diximus, donec sanentur.	Then take care of them with what we said, until they are healed.
Et qui abhorret incisionem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut administres suturam eorum secundum hunc modum.	And whoever shrinks from cutting with iron, then it is necessary to apply their stitching according to this method.
Accipe filum inuolutum, et intromitte ipsum in acum.	Take the wound thread and insert it into the needle.
Deinde extrahe athelil ad superiora, et fac ipsum penetrare cum acu in radice eius ex parte altera: et inuolue duas extremitates fili, in inferiori parte acus, et sint latitudinaliter: et stringe athelil strictura forti.	Then pull out the stone to the top, and make it pass through with the needle into its root on one side; wrap two ends of the thread around the lower part of the needle, and be transverse; and tie the stone tightly.
Deinde noda filum, et extrahe acum.	Then knot the thread, and pull out the needle.
Fac illud cum omnibus athelil, et dimitte ex eis unum: nec suas ipsum, ut currat ex eo superfluitas sanguinis.	Do that with all the stones, and leave one behind; do not touch it, so that any excess blood may run out from it.
Deinde pone super anum pannum infusum in oleo rosato, aut caeroto, et pone ipsum super anum: et praecipe infirmo, ut quiescat.	Then place a cloth soaked in rose oil or safflower oil on top of the anus and over it; and order the patient to rest.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, donec cadat.	Then let it be, until it falls.
Cum ergo cadunt athelil, cura eos cum unguentis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	When the stones have fallen, take care of them with ointments and the rest of their treatment, until they are healed.
¶ De cura Fissurarum.	Of the Treatment of Fissures.
Multotiens enim accidunt ex exiccatione stercoris, et constrictione naturae.	For indeed many times fissures occur due to excessive stool and natural constriction.
Cum ergo antiquantur, et non ualet in eis medicina: tunc oportet ut radas cum puncta Spatumilis, aut cum ungue tuo, donec fiant humidae, et auferatur ab eis cortex superior qui prohibet eas a consolidatione.	When they become old and medicine does not help in them: then it is necessary to scrape with a spoon-shaped instrument, or with your finger, until they become soft, and the upper crust that prevents their consolidation is removed.
Deinde cura eas, donec consolidentur secundum quod oportet.	Then take care of these things until they are consoled as needed.
Si autem non consolidantur: tunc itera eas cum rasione uehementiori quam prima, donec sanguinentur multum, et excorientur deinde cura eas, donec sanentur.	But if they do not consolidate: then repeat them with a stronger reason than the first, until they bleed much, and afterwards take care of them until they heal.
¶ De curatione Almirmar inuersorum, et non inuersorum: et Athelil siccorum, et Formicae.	On the cure of inverted ulcers, both those that are not inverted and those that are; and on Attila's stumps, and those of Formica.
Caput LXXXII.	Chapter 82.
Scias quod Almirmar non est nisi nodus rotundus secundum colorem corporis, similis capiti claui: et fit in toto corpore, praecipue in inferioribus partibus pedum, et digitis: et accidit ex eis dolor apud ambulationem.	Know that Almirmar is nothing but a rounded knot according to the color of the body, like a piece of headgear; and it occurs throughout the whole body, particularly in the lower parts of the feet and toes: and it happens with pain during walking.
Oportet ergo ut secetur quod est in circumitu claui, et teneatur cum forficibus, aut cum uncino, et eradicetur ex radice sua.	Therefore, what is in the vicinity of the headgear should be cut and held with forceps or a hook, and uprooted from its root.
Deinde cura illud: et si uis cauteriza illud secundum quod praecessit in capitulo suo.	Then take care of that thing; and if you wish, cauterize it as described in its own chapter.
Ex athelil autem siccis unus est eminentia parua, aspera, filtrata, rotunda supra superficiem corporis.	From Attila's stumps one is a small, rough, filtered, rounded prominence above the surface of the body.
Et multotiens accidunt in manibus puerorum.	And very often they occur on the hands of boys.
Et curatio eius est, ut extendas athelil, et incidas ipsum: aut stringas ipsum cum filo de serico: aut cum pilo, donec cadat.	And its cure is to stretch out the Attila, and cut it; or tie it with a silk thread; or with a hair, until it falls.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum secundum quod praemissum est cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta: et iam eradicantur athelil inuersi, et non inuersi cum instrumento quod ego dicam.	And if you wish, cauterize it as described above with fire or with sharp medicine; and now the inverted Attila stumps, both those that are not inverted, will be uprooted with the tool which I shall mention.
Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.	Formica is also a small, filtered, rough prominence above the surface of the body, going deeply into it; and when cold finds it, there is felt in it something similar to a Formic bite, and it occurs throughout the whole body; and most of it occurs in the hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut accipias cannulam ex penna anseris, aut penna uulturis forti: et pone illam cannulam super Formicam, donec contineat circulus cannulae ex partibus eius.	And its cure is to take a pipe made from the feather of a goose or a strong eagle's wing: and place that pipe over the Formica, until the circle of the pipe encompasses it.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum cannula, donec seces quod est in circumitu Formicae: et ponas eam in profundo carnis, et eradices Formicam ex radice eius.	Then revolve your hand with a cannula, until you cut out what is in the circuit of the ant; and put it in the depth of the flesh, and root out the ant from its root.
Et si uis, fac illud cum cannula aeris, aut ferri, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, do that with a cannula of air or iron, according to this shape.
Sit superius cannulae ad sublimitatem trahens surdum inuolutum, ut alleuietur super digitum apprehensio eius et ipsius reuolutio.	Let the cannula be placed above, drawing out a deaf man wrapped up, so that relief may be given to his grasp of it and its rotation.
Et si uis cauteriza Formicam secundum quod praemissum est in cauterizatione Athelil in capitulo de cauterio.	And if you wish, cauterize the ant according to what was previously mentioned in the cauterizing of Attila in the chapter on cauterizing.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum quae administrantur ad Clisteria in aegritudinibus Ani, et solutionis uentris, et colicae.	¶ Of the forms of Instruments which are administered for Enemas in Ani's diseases, and solutions of the bowels, and colic.
Caput LXXXIII.	Chapter 83.
Quandoque Clistere fit ex argento, aut ex aurichalco, aut ex aere fuso, aut malleato.	Sometimes an enema is made from silver, or golden gall-nut, or air blown through a pipe, or hammered metal.
Et quandoque fit ex istis Instrumentis paruum, et magnum, secundum illos in quibus administrantur.	And sometimes it is made from these instruments, small and large, according to those in which they are administered.
Illud ergo quod administratur in curatione puerorum paruorum, sit paruum: et quorum ani sunt debiles, aut dolorosi, sic et clisteria eorum.	Therefore, what is administered in the cure of small children, should be small: and for those whose anus is weak or painful, so should their enema.
Clistere magnum.	Great Enema.
Cistere paruum.	Small Enema.
Canna eius, id est, caput superius in quo ligatur uter, sit amplum secundum hunc modum: et sit ei distinctio ut ligetur uter sicut uides, et extremitas eius inferior quae intromittitur in anum, sit surda, id est, non aperta, lenis, ualde, trahens ad subtilitatem: et in uno laterum eius sint duo foramina, et in latere altero foramen unum.	The tube of it, that is, the upper part in which the uterus is tied up, should be broad according to this shape; and there should be a distinction so that the uterus may be tied like you see, and its lower extremity which is inserted into the anus, should be deaf, that is, not open, gentle, very, drawing towards subtlety: and on one side of it should be two holes, and on the other side one hole.
Et sit amplitudo foraminis secundum grossitudinem radiorum, et grossius parum, et sit uter in quo ponuntur medicinae ex uesica animalis: aut ex charta ouis, quae sit secundum formam asofrati paruae: cuius radix sit palmus unus.	And the width of the hole should be according to the thickness of the roots, and a little thicker, and it should be like the uterus in which medicines are placed from animal bladder: or from sheep parchment, which is shaped like a small asparagus: whose root is one palm.
Et perforetur foraminibus multis sicut reuoluitur, et sit spacium quod est inter omne foramen grossitudo digiti.	And it will be pierced with many openings as it is rolled up, and there will be space that is between every opening the thickness of a finger.
Deinde intromitte in illa foramina filum forte ex filo crudo, quod sit ex decem filis, aut circiter ea, et aggrega cum eo utrem sicut asofrati.	Then insert a strong thread of raw linen, which is made from ten threads or roughly that, and gather it up with him like an apron.
Cum ergo ponitur in eo uter, stringatur in capite clisteris inter duo distinguentia constrictione forti.	When therefore it is placed in the uterus, tie it at the head of the catheter between two distinct constrictions with a strong knot.
Deinde clisteriza cum eo.	Then inject with him.
Et haec est forma circuli utris hic depicta, et foraminum.	And this is the shape of the circle of the uterus here depicted, and the openings.
Qualitas autem clisterizandi cum eo, est: ut impleas utrem, aut uesicam ex medicina, quae sit calefacta secundum quantitatem tolerantiae infirmi: et caue ne sit calida ualde, aut frigida ualde.	The quality of injecting with him is that you should fill the uterus or bladder of medicine, which is warmed according to the tolerance of the sick person; and beware lest it be very hot or very cold.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et eleuet crura sua ad superiora: et pone sub eo inthaan, id est, corium super quod iacent homines, aut linteamen.	Then the patient will be lifted up onto his back, and he will elevate his legs to the upper parts; and place under him an inthan, that is, a hide or cloth on which people lie.
Deinde inunge extremitatem Clisteris cum oleo, aut cum albugine oui, aut cum mucillagine foenugraeci, aut similium.	Then grease the extremity of the catheter with oil, or with white of egg, or with fenugreek mucilage, or similar things.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in anum cum facilitate.	Then insert it into the anus with ease.
Deinde accipiat minister utrem cum duabus manibus suis simul, et exprimat ipsum cum uehementia, donec euacuet totum quod est in Clisteri in intestinum.	Then let the attendant take hold of the catheter with both his hands at once, and express it with vehemence, until all that is in the catheter is emptied into the intestine.
Deinde extrahe Clistere, et eleuet infirmus crura sua ad parietem.	Then draw out the catheter, and let the patient lift up his legs to the wall.
Quod si medicina cogit eum ad exitum, tunc teneat quantum potest.	But if medicine urges him to evacuation, then hold it as long as you can.
Et si dormit cum ea nocte tota, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if he sleeps with it all night, it is more beneficial for his recovery.
Si autem clisterizas eum in aegritudinibus solutionis uentris, et festinat exitus eius: tunc itera clistere, donec sanetur.	But if you catheterize him in the troubles of intestinal colic, and hasten his evacuation: then iterate the catheterization until he is healed.
Quod si in ano sunt hemorroides, aut apostemata laedentia, tunc sit clistere subtile ualde, lene, ex clisteribus quibus clisterizantur pueri.	What if there are hemorrhoids or painful abscesses in the anus: then let the catheter be very fine, soft, from those catheters with which children are catheterized.
Et haec sit forma clisteris subtilis super quod sit stricta cutis.	And this is the form of a fine clyster above which the skin should be tightly stretched.
¶ De curatione Vulnerum capitis sine fractura ossis.	On the treatment of head wounds without bone fracture.
Caput LXXXIIII.	Head 44.
Iam dixi in diuisione de curatione uulnerum quod conueniebat libro, et ego dicam hic curationem eorum cum manu, et cum medicinis secundum complementum.	Now I have spoken about the division of wound treatment which was fitting for the book, and I will say here the treatment of these wounds with the hand and with medicines according to their complement.
Dico ergo, quod uulnera diuersificantur secundum illud quo fiunt uulnera, et secundum locum super quem cadit uulnus.	Therefore I say that wounds are differentiated according to that by which they are caused and according to the place upon which the wound falls.
Res ergo quibus fiunt uulnera multotiens, sunt sicut iactus lapidis: aut incisio ensis, aut cultelli: aut percussio cum lancea, aut ligno, aut sagitta: et similibus illis ex rebus multis.	Therefore, the things by which wounds are caused many times are like a thrown stone: either a cut from a sword or knife: or a blow with a lance or wood or arrow: and similar to those things from many other things.
Vulnera autem quae fiunt secundum loca corporis sunt, sicut uulnus quod cadit super caput, aut collum, aut pectus, aut uentrem, aut epar: et similia ex eis membris.	However, wounds that are caused according to the parts of the body are like a wound that falls on the head, or the neck, or the chest, or the belly, or the flank: and similar ones from these members.
Et ego sum narrans curationes quorundam uulnerum, ut ponam eam ratiocinationem et regulam super reliqua uulnera.	And I am recounting treatments for some wounds, in order to set forth a reason and rule for the remaining wounds.
Et ego incipiam a uulneribus capitis simplicibus: quoniam rememoratio compositorum ueniet in principio capituli tertii.	And I will begin with simple head wounds: because the recollection of composed ones will come at the beginning of chapter three.
Dico ergo.	I say therefore.
Quando accidit in capite uulnus simplex, et non est fractura ossis: considera tunc, si est ex iactu lapidis, aut ei similibus, et iam fregit cutem tantum: et est uulnus magnum, et times super infirmum euentum apostematis calidi: tunc propera, et phlebotoma cephalicam statim: et non tardes illud: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius: si non fuerit prohibens aliquid a phlebotomia, praecipue si fuerit sanguis qui egreditur ex uulnere paucus.	I say therefore. When a simple wound occurs in the head and is not accompanied by bone fracture: consider then if it was caused by a thrown stone or something similar, and only the skin has been broken: and the wound is large, and there is fear of a hot aposteme: then hasten and perform phlebotomy of the cephalic vein immediately: and do not delay it: and extract from his blood according to the quantity of its virtue: if nothing prohibits phlebotomy, especially if the blood flowing out of the wound is little.
Et sit phlebotomia ex contrario partis uulneratae.	And let the phlebotomy be on the contrary side from the wounded part.
Et caueat infirmus sibi a repletione, et uino, et cibis grossis.	And let the sick person beware of fullness, and wine, and heavy foods.
Si autem minutionem prohibet aliquid, tunc minoretur ex cibo, et non appropinquet carnibus, neque uinis.	However, if something prevents cutting off, then reduce from food, and do not approach meats or wines.
Et pone super uulnus si accidit ei apostema calidum, cotum infusum in oleo rosato solo, aut cum uino in quo est stipticitas.	And put on the wound if a warm abscess happens to him, a poultice infused with rose oil alone, or with wine that has purgative properties.
Si autem securus fueris ab apostemate calido, tunc pone super uulnus, si est recens cum sanguine suo, et non mutauit ipsum aer, puluerem quem ego narrabo post paululum: et si iam mutauit ipsum aer, tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, donec sanetur.	But if you are sure there is no warm abscess, then put on the wound, if it is fresh with its own blood, and has not been changed by air, the powder that I will tell you later: and if already the air has changed it, then put on it some ointments until it heals.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, aut est ex incisione ensis, et similium: et non aggregantur labia eius per puluillos, tunc aggrega ipsa cum sutura, secundum quod ego narrabo in uulneribus uentris de sutura eorum.	But if the wound is large, or is from a cut with a sword, and similar cases: and its edges do not come together through swelling, then bring them together with a suture, according to what I will tell you about the sutures of abdominal wounds.
Si autem uulnus iam detectum est ab osse, et pendet, et non est retentio eius, nisi in suspensorio paruo: tunc incide ipsum.	But if the wound has already been detected by bone and is hanging, and there is no retention of it except in a small sling: then cut it.
Deinde cura uulnus cum medicinis, et restaura in eo carnem duram loco cutis, et praecipe infirmo, ut alatur cibis in quibus est grossitudo, sicut sunt capita, et triticum coctum, donec sit ut puls: et eis similia.	Then take care of the wound with medicines and restore hard flesh to its place in the cut skin. And instruct the sick person to eat foods that are heavy, such as bread and cooked wheat, until they have a pulse, and similar things.
Quod si inuenis in cute putrefactionem, et non adhaeret ossi: tunc incide putrefactum totum, et proiice ipsum: deinde cura illud.	And if you find putrefaction in the cut and it does not stick to the bone: then cut out the putrid part entirely and throw it away: then take care of that.
Si autem in his uulneribus est arteria, aut uena ex qua fluit sanguis: et non abscinditur per medicinas, tunc inquire super arteriam.	But if there is an artery or vein in these wounds from which blood flows: and it does not stop with medicines, then search for the artery.
Si ergo inuenis eam non sectam, tunc seca eam cum Spatumili, aut liga eam.	So if you find it not severed, then cut it off with a Scalpelium, or tie it.
Quod si necessitas prouocat quando non confert illud quod diximus, tunc cauteriza eam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	What if necessity forces you when that which we said does not help; then cauterize it until the blood is cut off.
Si autem uulnera ista sunt parua, simplicia, tunc res eorum est facilis, leuis: ita ut puluerizes super ea hunc puluerem: quoniam consolidat ea antequam mutet ea aer.	If however these wounds are small and simple, then the remedy for them is easy and light. So you powder over them this powder, because it consolidates them before it changes the air.
¶ Modus Pulueris incarnatiui.	The Method of the Fleshy Powder.
Recipe olibani partem unam, et sanguinis draconis partes duas, et calcis non extinctae partes tres: teratur totum multum, et cribelletur: et impleatur ex eo uulnus, et constringatur constrictione bona, donec adhaereat super ipsum bene, et coaguletur cum sanguine.	Recipe one part of olibanum, two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of unextinguished lime. Grind the whole together much, and sift it. Fill the wound with this mixture, and bind it tightly until it adheres well to the surface and coagulates with the blood.
Deinde stringe ipsum desuper cum puluillis, et dimitte ipsum, neque soluas ipsum dum permanet, ita quod non apostemetur.	Then bind it over with wool, and let it be, nor loosen it as long as it remains, so that it may not suppurate.
Nam non eradicatur ab eo medicina, donec sanatur.	For the medicine is not removed from this wound until it is healed.
Et quandoque facit illud calx sola, quando non sunt tibi in praesenti olibanum, et sanguis draconis etiam facit eandem operationem in multis ex uulneribus magnis, quando conuenit ut ponatur super ea et stringantur, et sunt uulnera recentia cum sanguine suo, quae non alterauit aer.	And at times the lime alone does this, when you do not have olibanum available, and dragon's blood also performs the same operation in many large wounds, when it is convenient to put it on them and bind them up, and they are recent wounds with their own blood, which has not been altered by air.
Quod si iam alterauit ea aer quadam alteratione, praecipue quando est in tempore aestatis, tunc non est in positione huius pulueris intentio: cura ergo ipsum cum eo quod diximus, ita ut ponas super ea quaedam unguenta digestiua: aut ponas super ea pultes ex farina hordei, factas cum aqua et melle, donec emittant pus.	But if the air has already altered them in some way, especially during the time of summer, then it is not advisable to use this powder: therefore take care of it with what we have said, by putting on it certain digestive ointments. Or put on it cakes made from barley flour, mixed with water and honey, until they discharge pus.
Deinde cura ea reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then take care of the remaining cure, until they heal.
Si uero accidat cum uulnere fractura in osse, et est parua, tunc extrahe illud cum Gesti: et ego iam dicam curationem fracturarum capitis in eo quod futurum est.	If a fracture occurs with the wound in bone and it is small, then remove that with Gestes. And I will already say the cure for head fractures in what is to come.
¶ De uulneribus Colli.	The Wounds of the Neck.
Caput LXXXV.	Chapter 85.
SI Autem uulnus accidat in Collo, tunc non est inter ipsum differentia in medicatione, et inter uulnus capitis quando est simplex.	If a wound occurs in the neck, then there is no difference between it and the wound of the head in terms of treatment, when it is simple.
Si autem iam incisus est neruus Colli, aut arteria: tunc si est neruus, non est in eo ingenium, nisi ut deuitetur curatio eius cum eo quod facit stipticitatem uehementem, sicut ziniar, et zegi, et eis similia.	If the nerve of the neck has already been cut, or an artery: then if it is a nerve, there is no skill in treating it unless treatment is done with great tourniquet, such as with ziniar, and zegi, and similar things.
Quoniam nocent neruis, et contrahunt eos.	Because they harm the nerves, and draw them together.
Et non ponas super uulnus aliquid frigidum omnino: quoniam substantia neruorum est frigida, et continuatio eius est cum cerebro, quod est sublimius membrorum: et sit illud quo curatur ex medicinis lene, sicut calx lota cum aqua dulci aliquotiens infusa cum oleo, aut cum oleo rosato, et tuthia, quando abluitur etiam cum aqua dulci: et reliqui lapides minerales, secundum hunc modum, et unguenta humida.	And you should not put anything completely cold on the wound: because the substance of nerves is cold, and its continuity is with the brain, which is a more elevated part of the members: and let what is used to treat it be gentle medicines, such as lime washed with sweet water infused several times with oil or with rose oil, and tuthia, when it is also washed with sweet water: and the remaining mineral stones, in this way, and wet ointments.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, tunc administra suturam: aut coarta labia eius cum puluillis.	If the wound is large, then apply a suture; or close its edges with sawdust.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals.
Si uero uulneri est profunditas, aut accidit in eo sinus in inferiori parte eius, in quo iam aggregatur pus, tunc perfora ipsum in magis depresso loco in eo.	If the wound has depth or occurs on the lower part of it where pus is already accumulating, then puncture it in a more depressed location.
Quod si iam incisa est in uulnere arteria, et consecutus est sanguinem eius fluxus: tunc separa, uel seca eam, et liga ipsam: aut cauteriza eam, si prouocat necessitas ad illud.	If the artery has already been cut in the wound and its flow of blood has resulted: then separate it, or cut it off, and bind it; or cauterize it if necessity demands that.
Si autem iam incidit spondiles gutturis, aut totum, et saluatae sunt alhaudegi: tunc aggrega labia cutis cum sutura super cannam gutturis, et non tangas guttur, imo aequa ipsum, et reduc ipsum super figuram naturalem.	If the vertebrae of the throat have already been cut, or the whole thing, and the ligaments are saved: then bring together the edges of the skin with a suture over the cane of the throat, and do not touch the throat, rather make it even, and restore it to its natural shape.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti, et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot.	Then tie it tightly with a decent bandage, and leave it for several days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis in quibus est stipticitas et exiccatio, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointments that have tourniquet-like properties and drying effects, until it heals.
Si autem uulnus iam fecit impressionem in osse, tunc perquire ipsum: tunc si in ipso sunt fragmenta ossis, extrahe ea omnia, aut quae potes ex eis: et quod non praeparatur, dimitte illud, donec putrescat uulnus, et separetur et alleuietur egressio eius.	If the wound has already made an impression on the bone, then explore it; then if there are fragments of bone in it, remove all of them, or as much as you can: and what is not prepared, leave it until the wound putrefies and its discharge separates and subsides.
Quod si uulnus fuerit recens, tunc pulueriza super ipsum puluerem quem narraui.	If the wound is recent, then apply powdered [substance] on top of it, which I mentioned earlier.
Si autem uidetur in uulnere os, et fit Fistula: tunc cura ipsam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.	But if a bone appears in the wound and a fistula forms: then treat it with the remedy mentioned in its own chapter.
¶ De uulnere in Spatulis.	On Wounds of the Knives.
Caput LXXXVI.	Chapter 86.
SI Est percussio lanceae, aut cultelli: et uides eius profunditatem, tunc considera.	If there is a puncture from a lance or knife: and you see its depth, then examine it.
Si ergo ex uulnere egreditur uentositas, quando anhelat ex eo infirmus, tunc scias, quia uulnus est mortale.	So if pus is discharged from the wound, and a sick person breathes out through it, then you will know that the wound is mortal.
Quod si non fuerit ei profunditas, et est recens cum sanguine suo: tunc non ponas in eo a prima hora puluerem, neque stringas ipsum, ut non retineatur sanguis in profunditate eius, et reuertatur ad cor, et interficiat infirmum: sed pone in ipso unguentum attractiuum, et solue ipsum in die bis.	That if it is not deep and the wound is recent with its own blood: then do not put powdered [substance] on it from the first hour, nor bind it, lest the blood retained in its depth returns to the heart and kills the sick person: but place an attractive ointment on it and wash it twice a day.
Si uero unguentum non est tibi praesens, tunc pone in orificio uulneris cotum uetustum, ut sugat illud quod egreditur de eo ex humiditatibus: et fac ut dormiat infirmus super uulnus, ut currat quod aggregatur in eo.	But if you do not have the ointment present, then place an old cotton swab in the wound's orifice, so that it sucks up what emerges from it due to moisture: and make the sick person sleep on top of the wound, so that what accumulates there can flow.
Si uero iam praeterierint uulneri tres dies, aut plures, et non accidit infirmo spasmus, neque tremor cordis malus, neque strictura in anhelitu, et uides reliquas dispositiones eius bonas: tunc scias, quia uulnus est saluum.	But if already three days or more have passed since the wound and the sick person has not experienced spasms, nor a bad heart tremor, nor constriction in breathing, and you see his other conditions good: then you will know that the wound is sound.
Cura ergo ipsum et cum liciniis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	So therefore care for it with lint and other healing remedies until he is healed.
Si uero excusatur sanatio eius, et iam aperitur semper, tunc scias, quia iam factum est Fistula.	But if his healing is hindered and an opening always appears, then you will know that a fistula has formed.
Cura ergo ipsam ex capitulo suo.	So therefore care for it according to its own chapter.
Et si uulnus est ex incisione ensis, aut cultelli, et est simplex in superficie pectoris, aut dorsi: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit ex sutura, si est magnum: aut cum puluere, si est paruum.	And if the wound is from a cut made by a sword or knife and is simple on the surface of the chest or back: then care for it with suturing if it is large, or with powder if it is small.
Si autem iam fecit impressionem in osse, et incidit ex eo frusta: tunc inquire uulnus, et propera ad extrahendum illa frusta, si sunt separata.	If however he has already made an impression on bone and cut off fragments from it; then investigate the wound and hasten to remove those fragments if they are separated.
Si uero non sunt separata, tunc dimitte ea, donec putrefiat uulnus, alleuiatur enim extractio eorum.	But if they are not separated, then leave them alone until the wound becomes putrid, for the removal of them is eased by their decay.
Reliquorum autem uulnerum accidentium in reliquis membris iudicium in curatione, est iudicium eius quod diximus.	However, as for other accidents of wounds on other limbs, the judgment for healing is that which we mentioned.
¶ De uulneribus Ventris, et exitu intestini, et exitura eorum.	¶ On Wounds of the Belly and Exit of Intestines, and their Issues.
Caput LXXXVII.	Book 87.
Disruptio quae accidit uentri, est magna, et media, et parua.	The disruption that occurs in the belly is great, moderate, and small.
Ex magna igitur quandoque egreditur intestinum, aut numerus intestinorum.	Therefore, a large disruption sometimes produces an intestine or several intestines.
Quare fit intromissio eorum, et eorum sutura uehementior et difficilior.	Wherefore their insertion and stitching are more violent and difficult.
Et disruptio parua etiam fit difficilis ex modo alio.	And a small disruption also becomes difficult in another way.
Sequitur ergo, ut sit reductio eorum difficilior, si non properas in intromissione sua ad locum suum statim: quoniam inflatur, aperitur, et ingrossatur: quare fit difficilis introitus eius.	Therefore, it is necessary to reduce them with difficulty if you do not hasten their insertion into its place immediately: since it becomes swollen, opens up, and grows larger: therefore, its entry becomes difficult.
Propter hoc ergo fit melior disruptionum disruptio media: quoniam cum ea non fit difficilis reductio intestini, sicut fit dissicilis in his duabus speciebus.	Therefore, a moderate disruption is better on account of this: because with it the reduction of the intestine is not difficult, as it is in these two species.
Scias, quod sutura uenris est secundum quatuor modos.	Know that the stitching of the belly is according to four modes.
Duae suturae communes conueniunt in sutura uentris, et in sutura reliquorum uulnerum corporis: et duae suturae aliae proprie communicant reliquis uulneribus.	Two kinds of stitching are common to the stitching of the belly and the stitching of other wounds of the body; and two other kinds of stitching properly communicate with other wounds.
Verumtamen sunt magis propriae cum sutura uentris: et ego narro tibi unamquamque cum expositione, et declaratione.	However, they are more proper to the stitching of the belly; and I will tell you each one with explanation and declaration.
Dico ergo, quia quando uulnus est paruum, et egreditur ex eo aliquid ex intestino, et fit difficile reducere ipsum: tunc illud est propter unum duorum modorum.	I say therefore, because when the wound is small and something emerges from the intestine, and it becomes difficult to reduce it; then it is due to one of two modes.
Aut propter paruitatem disruptionis, sicut diximus: Aut quoniam in intestino est inflatio propter frigus aeris.	Either because of the smallness of the disruption, as we said; or because there is an inflation within the intestine due to the cold air.
Quando ergo illud est ita, tunc oportet ut calefacias ipsum, ita ut submergas spongiam, aut pannum humidum in aqua tepida sola.	When therefore that is so, then it is necessary to warm it, so that you may soak a sponge or a damp cloth in lukewarm water only.
Aut decoquas in aqua squinantum, et cyperum, et spicam, et embroces cum ea intestinum, donec resoluatur inflatio.	Or you may boil in hot water, and then mix with it the juice of squinanthus, and of cypress, and of rue, and use this mixture to fill the intestine until the swelling subsides.
Quandoque facit illud uinum in quo est stipticitas: et est melius quam aqua sola in resolutione inflationis.	Sometimes it does good with that wine which has a purging quality: and this is better than water alone for resolving the swelling.
Cum ergo uides inflationem iam resolui, tunc humecta intestinum cum aqua in qua decocta est altea, aut malua.	When therefore you see the swelling now resolved, then moisten the intestine with water in which althea or mulberry has been boiled.
Nam per illud alleuiatur introitus eius cum re parua.	For through this it is alleviated the entrance of that thing with a small discharge.
Si autem excusatur reditus eius post hanc curationem, tunc finde in disruptione parum, cum instrumento quo secantur hemorrhoides.	But if however the return of that thing is impeded after this cure, then search for a slight fissure, with the instrument by which hemorrhoids are cut.
Et curatio prima est melior quando praeparatur, quam sectio: et non fit coactio ad secandum post necessitatem et defectum instrumenti.	And the first cure is better when it is prepared than when one cuts; and there is no need to force oneself to cut after necessity and deficiency of instruments.
Sit pars eius una quae est torta, acuta, et pars eius altera non acuta, et extremitas subtilis non sit cum subtilitate Spatumilis, imo sit obtusior parumper: et est illa quae similatur caiada, sicut uides.	Let the part of it be one that is twisted, sharp, and the other part not sharp, and let the extremity be slightly blunt, rather than very fine: and it is like a caecum, as you see.
Cum ergo amplificatur uulnus, et ingreditur intestinum, tunc oportet, ut sit reductio eius secundum formam suam naturalem in loco suo sibi proprio, si possibile est super illud: quoniam est melius.	When therefore the wound is enlarged and enters the intestine, then it is necessary that its reduction be made according to its natural shape in its proper place, if possible above it: for this is better.
Quando uero disruptio est ampla in inferiori parte uentris: tunc oportet ut facias iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et pone crura sua altiora capite suo.	When however the disruption is wide at the lower part of the belly: then it is necessary that you make the patient lie on their back, and place their legs higher than their head.
Et si est in superiore parte uentris, tunc pone caput eius, et pectus ipsius altiora quam eius inferiora.	And if it is at the upper part of the belly, then place his head and chest higher than his lower parts.
Et similiter si est disruptio in una duarum partium uentris, tunc pone intentionem tuam, et tuam considerationem semper in hoc, ut pars in qua est uulnus sit altior parte altera.	And similarly if there is a disruption in one of the two parts of the belly, then place your intention and attention always on this, that the part where the wound is may be higher than the other part.
Et ita oportet, ut admimistres illud in uulneribus magnis, et in uulneribus mediis.	And thus it is fitting that you anoint it on great wounds and on medium-sized wounds.
In uulneribus autem paruis, pone illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	But in small wounds, apply it according to how it is prepared for you.
Deinde fac ut sit praesens inter manus tuas minister pius, qui teneat disruptionem totam manu sua: et aggrega labia eius.	Then have a devout and pious servant present, who holds the entire wound with his hand and brings together its edges.
Deinde detege ex ea ei qui sequitur suturam aliquid post aliquid: et iste est modus suturae communis unius.	Then remove from it a little bit to the one who is about to sew, and this is the common method of sewing one thing after another.
Et est, ut accipias acum, aut numerum acuum secundum quantitatem amplitudinis uulneris.	And it is, that you take an awl or a number of awls according to the size and breadth of the wound.
Deinde dimitte ab extremitate disruptionis quantitatem digiti anularis, id est, medici: et fige acum unam praeter quod intromittas in eam filum in duabus extremitatibuis cutis, cum duabus extremitatibus sifac quod est sub cute ab interioribus, donec facias eam penetrare ab alia parte, et tu iam aggregasti duas extremitates cutis, et duas extremitates sifac: et fiunt quatuor ordines.	Then release from the edge of the disruption a quantity equal to the width of an annular finger, that is, of a doctor: and place one awl outside what you insert into it a thread on both sides of the skin, with two strips of sifac on either side, as far down as the skin's natural layer from within, until it penetrates from the other part; and you have already brought together the two edges of the skin, and the two edges of sifac: and four orders are formed.
Deinde stringe cum filo duplo in circumitu acus aliquotiens a duabus partibus simul, quousque sint aggregata duo labia uulneris aggregatione decenti.	Then tie with a doubled thread around the awl several times from both sides at once, until the two edges of the wound are brought together in a decent union.
Deinde dimitte grossitudinem digiti etiam, et fige in eis acum aliam: postea reta eam cum filo, sicut fecisti cum acu prima.	Then release the thickness of the finger and place another awl in it; afterwards tie it with a thread, just as you did with the first awl.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum eo quo indiges ex acubus, donec compleas constrictionem uulneris totius.	Therefore do not cease to do that with each one as you need it from the awls, until you complete the entire closure of the wound.
Et sint acus mediae inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem: quoniam acus subtiles ualde uelociter incidunt carnem: et grossae sunt difficilis introitus in cutem: propter illud oportet ut sint mediae in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	And let the awls be of medium thickness between coarseness and subtlety, because very fine awls quickly pierce flesh, and coarse ones are difficult to introduce into the skin: for that reason it is necessary that they be of medium thickness in subtlety and coarseness.
Et non oportet, ut figatur acus in duabus extremitatibus cutis propinquae multum: ut non incidatur caro uelociter, et aperiatur uulnus ante consolidationem sui, et non elongentur etiam cum sutura, ut non prohibeatur uulnus a consolidatione.	And it is not necessary to place the awl in the two edges of the skin that are very close together: lest the flesh be quickly pierced and the wound opened before its own closure, and also stretched during the sewing, so that the wound may be hindered from consolidating.
Deinde incide extremitatem acuum, ut non laedant infirmum apud somnum suum: et pone eis puluillos ex pannis ab omni parte, qui teneant extremitates acuum: et dimitte eos, donec scias quod uulnus iam consolidatum est.	Then cut off the ends of the wounds, so that they may not hurt the sleeping patient; and put small pieces of linen around them from all sides, which hold the ends of the wounds: and leave them until you know that the wound is already consolidated.
Et haec quidem species suturae cum acubus taliter est conuenientior in uulneribus paruis.	And this kind of stitching with needles is more suitable for small wounds.
Quoniam sufficit in sutura eorum acus una, aut duae, aut circiter eas.	Because one, or two, or about that many needles suffice for their stitching.
Sutura autem secunda communis est, ut aggreges cum sutura extremitates quatuor: extremitates, duas cutis, et extremitates duas sifac in uice una, cum acu in qua sit filum inuolutum aequale in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	But the second stitching is common, to gather together with one stitch four edges: two skin edges and two sinew edges on one side, with a needle having a thread wrapped around it of equal fineness and thickness.
Deinde quando penetraueris cum acu has extremitates quatuor, reduc acum a parte a qua incaepisti eadem, ut cadat filum retatum a superiori parte uulneris: ut sit sutura, sicut sutura panni quo stringuntur panni, et pone inter omnem suturam quantitatem grossitudinis digiti minoris.	Then when you have penetrated with the needle these four edges, draw the needle back from the part where you began, so that the thread falls down from the upper part of the wound: in order to be a stitch, just as stitches are in cloth which are sewn together, and put between every stitch the thickness of a small finger.
Hanc autem suturam sciunt homines.	But this stitching is known to people.
Et cum hac sutura ego sui uulnus quod acciderat uiro in uentre suo, qui fuerat uulneratus cum cultello, et erat disruptio uulneris maior palmo uno: et exierat ex intestinis circiter duos palmos ex intestino medio, et erat disruptio in medio uentris.	And with this stitching I stitched up the wound that had occurred to a man in his own belly, who had been wounded with a knife, and there was a greater disruption of the wound than one palm: and something had come out from the intestines about two palms from the middle of the intestine, and there was a disruption in the midst of the belly.
Reduxi ergo illud postquam stetit intestinum eius extra uulnus xxiiii horis.	So I reduced it after his intestine had stood outside the wound for 24 hours.
Consolidatum est ergo uulnus in spacio quod fuit circiter XV dies: et curaui ipsum, et sanatus est: et uixit post illud annis multis, conuersatus in suis dispositionibus.	The wound was therefore consolidated after a period of about 15 days: and I cared for it, and he recovered: and he lived after that for many years, living according to his habits.
Et medici iudicauerant, quod non sanaretur.	And the doctors had judged that he would not recover.
Et ex miraculo fuit, quod non curaui illud cum unguento.	And it was a miracle, since I did not treat it with an ointment.
Quoniam fui in loco in quo non inueniebatur unguentum, neque aliquid ex medicinis.	Because I was in a place where no ointment could be found, nor anything from medicines.
Posui ergo super uulnus cotum uetustum bis in die, et assiduaui ablutionem eius cum aqua mellis, donec sanatum est.	I therefore placed an old linen cloth over the wound twice a day, and attended to its constant washing with honeyed water until it was healed.
Duas autem species suturae proprias dicam secundum narrationem sermonis.	However, I will describe two proper types of suturing according to the narrative of the conversation.
Et est, ut incipias cum sutura acuta: et intromittas acum ab exteriori ad interiorem partem.	And it is that you should begin with sharp suturing: and insert the point from the outside towards the inner part.
Cum ergo penetrat acus in cutem, et in lacertum euntem secundum longitudinem et latitudinem totius corporis: dimitte extremitatem sifac in latere in quo intromisisti acum, et fac penetrare in extremitatem aliam ab interiori parte ad exteriorem in extremitate altera mirach.	When therefore the needle penetrates the skin and into the vein that follows along with the length and breadth of the entire body: leave the extremity there where you inserted the needle, and make it penetrate to the other extremity from the inner part to the outer in another mirror-like manner.
Cum ergo feceris eam penetrare, tunc fac eam penetrare secundum hoc in eadem hac extremitate mirach ab exteriori parte ad interiorem: et dimitte extremitatem sifac, quae est in hoc latere, et fac penetrare acum in extremitatem alteram ab interiori parte ad exteriorem: et fac penetrare cum penetratione tua qua facis eam penetrare in sifac extremitate mirach, quae est in parte eius, donec penetret in ipsum totum.	When therefore you have made it penetrate, then make it penetrate thus in the same mirror-like extremity from the outer part to the inner: and leave the extremity there which is on this side, and make the needle penetrate into the other extremity from the inner part to the outer: and make it penetrate with your penetration as you make it penetrate in the mirror-like extremity which is on its part, until it penetrates entirely.
Deinde incipe etiam ab hoc eodem latere, et sue ipsum cum extremitate, quae est ex sifac in latere alio, et extrahe acum ex cute quam penetrauit.	Then begin also from this same side, and take hold of the part itself with the extremity which is from the sifac on the other side, and pull out the needle from the skin that it has penetrated.
Deinde reduc eam in illam cutem, et sue extremitatem sifac, quae est in latere alio, cum hac extremitate mirach: et extrahe eam ex cute quae est ex parte eius, et fac illud uice una, et alia: et fac illud uice post uicem, usquequo suas extrinsecum totum secundum illud exemplum.	Then return it to that skin and take hold of the part itself with the extremity which is on the other side, along with this mirror-like extremity: and pull out the needle from the skin that is from its part, and make it thus once and again, and so forth, until you have brought outside all the parts according to that example.
Et summa huius suturae, est ut suas sutura pellipariorum qua suunt pelles: ita ut suas sifac uice una ex parte una extremitate cutis: et ut dimittas eam uice alia ex parte alia, donec compleas.	And the sum of this suturing is that you should make your sutures like those of a pellipariorum who sew skins: thus as to sew sifac one by one from one extremity of the skin: and leave it off one side and take up the other, until you have completed.
Secunda species suturae propriae, quam dixit Gale nus.	The second kind of suturing proper is what Galenus said.
Iste eius sermo narratus est, ut suas eam secundum similitudinem, qua suunt eas quidam medicantium, ita quod aggregant omnem partem ad comparem suam conuenientem per naturam: et applicant extremitatem sifac ad eius aliam extremitatem, et extremitatem mirach ad extremitatem eius aliam.	This is his saying, that he likened it to the way some physicians join certain parts together according to their natural similarity, so that they bring together all a part with its corresponding part by nature: and apply one end of a suture to the other end of another, and the end of a ligature to the end of another.
Et illud fit secundum quod narro tibi.	And this is done according to what I am telling you.
Oportet ut figas acum in extremitatem mirach propinquam tibi ab exteriori parte, et facias eam penetrare ad interiorem in eo solo: et dimittas duas extremitates sifac.	You should insert the needle into the end of the ligature that is nearest to you from the outer part, and make it enter only into the inner one; and then let go the two ends of the suture.
Deinde reuolue acum, et fac eam penetrare ab exteriori parte ad interiorem in duas extremitates sifac, scilicet utrinque.	Then turn back the needle and make it enter from the outer part into the inner one in both ends of the suture, that is, on both sides.
Deinde reuolue utrasque, etiam fac penetrare utrasque ab interiori usque ad exteriorem, in duas extremitates mirach alias, quae sunt in latere opposito.	Then turn back the other end as well, and make it enter from the inner part to the outer one in both ends of the ligature again, into the two ends of the mirror image which are on the opposite side.
Et iste modus suturae est melior sutura communi facili, et est sutura cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And this method of suturing is a better and easier common suture, and it is the one whose description preceded.
Iste est ergo sermo Galeni etiam.	This is therefore Galen's saying as well.
Et dixerunt quidam.	And some people said.
Retificatur sutura uentris cum duabus acubus.	The suture of the belly is corrected with two needles.
Quod est, ut intromittas in eis utrisque filum unum: et incipe cum intromissione acus, ex eo quod est apud te, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, secundum suturam eorum qui suunt coria aequaliter.	Which is to say that you should introduce one thread into both of them: and begin with the introduction of the needle from where it is at your side, and make it enter up to the other side, according to the suture of those who sew skins equally.
Et scias, quod quando disruptio est in medio uentris: tunc sutura eius est difficilior quam reliquorum locorum uentris.	And know that when there is a disruption in the middle of the belly: then the suture of it is more difficult than those of other places in the belly.
Iudicium uero medicationis uulneris, est iudicium reliquorum uulnerum.	The judgment of wound treatment is the judgment of all wounds.
Quod est, quia quando tu consequeris uulnus recens cum sanguine suo, antequam alteret ipsum aer: et reducis intestinum, et suis ipsum, et aptas ipsum: tunc pone super puluerem incarnatiuum.	Which is to say that when you dress a fresh wound with its own blood, before it has changed by the air; and reduce the intestine, and restore it, and make it fit again; then place it on top of powdered flesh.
Quod si aer iam alterauit uulnus: tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, quae sunt tibi praesentia, donec faciant pus: et cadant fila, et consolidentur sifac, et mirach.	If the air has altered the wound: then place on it certain ointments that are present to you until they make pus: and let the strings fall, and be consoled with a sponge, and myrrh.
Deinde cura illud sicut est curatio reliquorum uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it as is the treatment for other wounds, until it heals.
Si autem non sunt tibi praesentes medicinae, tunc pone super ipsum statim, exquo incipit emittere pus, cotum uetus: et permuta ipsum bis in die, sicut docui te, donec sanetur.	But if you don't have medicines available to you, then place on it immediately the old poultice from which pus begins to emerge: and change it twice a day, as I taught you, until it heals.
Nam tu non indiges medicatione alia in pluribus dispositionibus, quando uulnera sunt simplicia.	For you don't need any other medicine in many cases, when wounds are simple.
Si autem times, quod communicet uulnus membris principalibus in laesione, tunc oportet ut submergas lanam lenem in oleo temperatae caliditatis, aut in oleo rosato: et pone ipsam in circumitu locorum quae sunt inter inguina, et sub ascellas.	But if you fear that the wound will spread to the principal members by its location, then it is necessary to immerse a woolen cloth, gentle and tempered with warm oil or rose oil: and place it in the area between the groin and armpits.
Quod si sentit dolorem, aut punctiones, aut putrefactionem in intestinis suis (nam multotiens accidit illud) tunc clisteriza ipsum cum uino stiptico, nigro, tepido: praecipue si putredo iam peruenit in intestino, et facta est exitura penetrans usque ad concauitatem eius.	If it feels pain, or punctures, or putrefaction in his intestines (for that often happens) then fumigate him with a stiptic wine, black and warm: especially if the putrefaction has already reached the intestine and has become an exit that penetrates to its hollow.
Et scias, quod illud quod est ex intestino grosso, est facilioris sanationis: et quod ex eis est ex subtili, difficilioris sanationis.	And know that what comes from the large intestine is easier to heal from: and what comes from the small intestine is harder to heal from.
Intestinum autem quod nominatur Ieiunum, non suscipit sanationem ex uulnere quod accidit in eo omnino: et illud est propter multitudinem eius, quod est ex uenis, et magnitudine earum, et propter subtilitatem corporis eius, et propinquitatem ipsius naturae neruorum.	However, the intestine that is called Jejunum does not admit healing from a wound that occurs in it at all: and this is due to its multitude, which comes from veins, and its great size, and the subtlety of its body, and its proximity to the nature of nerves.
Si autem illud quod procedit ex uulnere est zirbum, et consequeris ipsum recens: reduc ipsum secundum reductionem tuam, qua reducis intestina aequaliter.	But if what proceeds from the wound is a liquor, and you follow it immediately: reduce it according to your own reduction, by which you reduce the intestines equally.
Si uero praeteriit ei spacium, et iam factum est uiride, aut nigrum: tunc oportet ut stringas ipsum cum filo supra locum qui denigratus est ex eo, ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	But if a period of time has passed and it has already become green or black: then it is necessary to tie it with a thread above the spot where it was discolored, so that there may not be a flow of blood.
In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.	In the groin there are veins and arteries.
Deinde incide quod est praeter illud ligamentum, et pone duas extremitates fili pendentes ex inferiori parte uulneris extra ipsum: ut alleuietur super te attractio eius, et extractio ipsius apud casum zirbi, et emissionem pus uulneris.	Then cut what is beyond that ligament, and place two ends of a thread hanging from the lower part of the wound outside it, so that its attraction to you may be relaxed, and its extraction at the time of the groin's case, and the discharge of pus from the wound.
¶ Rememoratio uulneris quod accidit in Intestino.	A reminder of a wound that occurs in the intestine.
Quando accidit disruptio in Intestino, et est parua: tunc possibile est, ut restauretur in quibusdam hominibus: propterea, quia ego uidi qui fuit uulneratus in uentre suo cum percussione lanceae, et erat uulnus a dextra stomachi, et antiquatum est uulnus: et factum Fistula, et exiuit ex eo egestio, et uentositas.	When a disruption occurs in the intestine and is small: then it is possible for it to be restored in some people: therefore, because I have seen someone who was wounded in his abdomen with a lance blow, and the wound was on the right side of the stomach, and the old wound had become a fistula, and there was a discharge and a blowing out.
Posui ergo curationem, usque quod ego non fui confisus in sanatione eius: neque cessaui subtiliare ipsum, donec sanatus est, et consolidatus est locus.	So I applied the treatment until I was no longer confident about his recovery; nor did I cease to intervene with him until he was healed and the site had consolidated.
Postquam ego uidi locum iam consolidatum, timui super infirmum, quod accideret super infirmum accidens malum in uentre suo: et non accidit ei ex illo accidens malum.	After I saw the place had been consolidated, I feared for the weak person, that some other bad thing might happen to him in his abdomen; and it did not happen to him from then on.
Et remansit in melioribus dispositionibus suis, comedens et bibens, et futuens, et intrauit balneum, et exercitatus est in dietis suis.	And he remained in better physical condition, eating and drinking, and having sexual relations, and entered the bath, and exercised himself according to his regimen.
Et iam dixerunt quidam experimentatorum, quia quando accidit in Intestino uulnus, et est paruum: tunc oportet ut ligetur secundum hunc modum.	And now certain practitioners have said that when a wound occurs in the intestine and is small: then it is necessary to bind according to this method.
Et est, ut accipias formicas magnorum capitum.	And it is, as if you were taking ants of great heads.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, et pone formicam unam ex eis quae habeant os apertum super duo labia uulneris.	Then gather two lips of the wound, and place one ant with an open mouth on top of the two lips of the wound.
Cum ergo capit super ea, et stringit os suum, abscinde caput eius, adhaeret enim, et non soluitur.	When then it closes over them and tightens its mouth, cut off its head, for it sticks and does not come loose.
Deinde pone formicam aliam prope primam, et non cesses facere illud cum formica post formicam secundum quantitatem uulneris totius.	Then place another ant nearby the first one, and do not cease to do that with each ant after the next according to the size of the entire wound.
Deinde reduc ipsum, et sue uulnus.	Then reduce it to itself and bind up the wound.
Illa enim capita remanent annexa in Intestino, donec cibetur Intestinum, et sanetur, et non accidat infirmo nocumentum penitus.	For those parts remain joined to the intestine until the intestine is nourished and heals, and no harm at all comes to the sick person.
Et iam possibile est, ut ligetur Intestinum etiam cum filo subtili: quod abstersum est ex intestino animalis, annexo cum eo postquam intromittitur in acum.	And it is now possible to tie the intestine with a thin thread: which has been taken from the intestinal membrane of an animal and attached to it after being introduced into the acute angle.
Et est, ut accipias extremitatem huius fili ex intestino, et excarnetur multum.	And it is necessary to take the end of this thread from the intestine and to scrape away much.
Deinde liga in extremitate eius filum lini subtile inuolutum.	Then bind a thin linen thread around its end.
Deinde intromitte illud filum in acum, et sue cum eo intestinum.	Then introduce that thread into the acute angle and tie it to the intestine.
Deinde reduc ipsum in disruptionem.	Then reduce it back into its natural state.
Et iste modus suturae cum formicis et intestino, non est nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	And this method of suture with ants and intestine is only according to the way of confidence and hope.
Scias, uulnus quod est magnum, amplum, praecipue si est in uno intestinorum gracilium: tunc non est ingenium nisi subtiliatio, neque est eius sanatio omnino.	Know that a wound which is great and wide, especially if it is in one of the thin intestines, then there is no skill except to cut away gently, nor is its healing at all.
¶ De cura Zuchemen, et Fistularum.	Of the treatment of Zuchemen and Fistulas.
Caput LXXXVIII.	Book 88.
Scias, quod omne uulnus, aut apostema quando ueterascit et antiquatur, et fit ulcus, et non consolidatur, et emittit pus semper, et non abscinditur: tunc nominatur uniuersaliter in quocunque membro fuerit Fistula, et nos nominamus ipsum Zuchemen.	Know that every wound or apostema when it becomes old and worn out, and forms an ulcer, and does not consolidate, and always discharges pus, and is not healed: then it is universally called a Fistula, wherever it may be in the body, and we call it Zuchemen.
Et Fistula quidem est secundum ueritatem nodatio filtrata, dura, alba: cum qua non est dolor, cui est concauitas pennae auis: et propter illud nominant eam quidam Risati, id est, pennam.	And a Fistula indeed is a hard, white, and tough knotting, without pain, like the concavity of a bird's feather; and for that reason some call it Risati, that is, the feather.
Et est in quibusdam horis humida, quae emittit pus.	And it is damp in certain hours, which discharges pus.
Et fortasse scinditur humiditas in quibusdam horis.	And perhaps the moisture breaks apart in certain hours.
Et quandoque est haec humiditas multa, et est pauca: et est grossa, et est subtilis.	And sometimes this moisture is abundant, and at other times it is scarce; and sometimes it is thick, and at other times it is thin.
Et ego iam praemisi in diuisione, tunc cum dixi uulnera, quod omne ulcus quod non sanatur, neque nascitur in eo caro, non est illud nisi propter unam nouem caussarum.	And I have already spoken about division, then when I said wounds, because every ulcer that is not healed and does not produce flesh, it is none other than for one of nine causes.
Quarum una est, aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore: aut propter maliciam eius: aut quoniam inter ipsum, et super labia eius est caro dura, prohibens natiuitatem carnis: aut quia est multae sordis et sordiciei: aut quoniam ulcus in seipso est putridum, et materia quae mittitur ei est malae qualitatis: aut quoniam medicina est inconueniens in curatione eius: aut quoniam corruptio cadens in regione est genus pestilentiae, aut per proprietatem in regione, sicut accidit in Caesaraugusta: in qua fit difficilis digestio aegritudinum, et tardatur in ea sanatio apostematum per naturam: aut quoniam in eo est os unum, aut numerus ossium.	One of these is because there is a lack of blood in the body; or because of bad blood itself; or because there is hard flesh between it and its edges, preventing the formation of new flesh; or because it is covered with many stains and scabs; or because the ulcer itself is putrid and the material sent to it is of poor quality; or because the medicine used for its treatment is unsuitable; or because corruption falls in that region as a kind of pestilence, or due to the nature of the region, just as happens in Caesaraugusta, where digestion is difficult and healing is slow by nature; or because there is one bone or a number of bones involved.
Et ego iam ostendi omnes istas caussas et signa earum, et curationes ipsarum cum medicinis in diuisione: et oportet hic ut faciam te scire curationem Fistulae et Zuken, quae fit per uiam operationis cum manu.	And I have already shown all these causes and signs of them, and their treatments along with medicines in division; and it is necessary for me to make you know the treatment of a fistula and a zuke, which occurs through an operative procedure by hand.
Scias ergo, quod Fistula accidit in omnibus membris corporis.	Know therefore that a fistula occurs in all parts of the body.
Nam ex eis sunt Fistulae quae perueniunt ad uenas magnas et arterias, aut neruos, aut sifac: aut ad intestinum, aut ad uesicam, aut ad aliquam ex costis: aut ad aliquam ex spondilibus dorsi, aut ad aliquam iuncturarum compositarum compositione: sicut manus, et pedis: et ex eis sunt quae uadunt ad propinquitatem membri principalis, et similium.	For some of them are fistulas that reach the major veins and arteries, or nerves, or sinews: or to the intestine, or bladder, or to some part of the ribs: or to some part of the vertebrae, or joints composed in composition: such as the hands and feet: and among these are those that go to the proximity of the main member and similar.
Quae ergo ex his Fistulis est secundum hunc modum, est ex aegritudinibus difficilis sanationis, et non recipit curationem, et occupatio cum ea est labor et ignorantia.	Which of these fistulas is according to this manner, is from difficult-to-heal illnesses and does not receive treatment, and preoccupation with it is labor and ignorance.
Quod si est ex Fistulis aliqua cuius profunditas non peruenit ad haec loca quae dixi: et speras, et confidis in curatione eius, et uis peruenire ad cognitionem illius, tunc accipe tentam ex aere, aut ferro, si Fistula tendit secundum rectitudinem, et perquire eam cum ipsa.	For if it is from some fistula whose depth does not reach the places I said: and you hope and trust in its treatment, and wish to come to know it, then take a test with air or iron, if the fistula inclines straight, and examine it along with itself.
Si autem in Fistula est tortuositas, tunc inuestiga eam cum tenta de plumbo subtili.	If however there is tortuosity in a fistula, then investigate it with a thin lead probe.
Quoniam plumbum cum lenitate sui corporis alleuiatur, et curuatur circa tortuositatem.	Because lead is tempered by the softness of its own body and is curved around the tortuosity.
Quod si Fistula est habens orificia multa, non est tibi possibile ut significes super eam cum tenta.	For if a fistula has many openings, it will not be possible for you to signify upon it with a probe.
Clisteriza ergo ex eis orificium ex orificiis suis.	Therefore, cleanse one of its openings from among its own openings.
Nam humiditas qua clisterizas ipsum, uadit uersus orificia alia, et currit ex eis.	For the moisture with which you cleanse it flows towards other openings and runs out from them.
Deinde exquisite inquire secundum quem modum est tibi possibile: ut cognoscas quod illic est os, aut neruus, et est Fistulae concauitas longinqua, aut propinqua: aut est Fistula una cui sunt orificia multa, et sta super totum illud, cum summa fortitudinis tuae: cum interrogatione tua, qua interrogas infirmum, et inuentione doloris apud compressionem cum manu tua super locum, et similibus ex significationibus et caussis accidentibus apostemati.	Then, with great care and attention, investigate the situation according to your ability: so that you may know what is present there, whether an opening or a nerve, and whether it is a distant or nearby constriction of the fistula, or whether it is one fistula with many openings, and be positioned above all that, with the utmost strength of your hand: with your questioning of the patient, and the discovery of pain upon compression with your hand on the spot, and similar signs and causes of apostemation.
Cum ergo steteris super omnia illa statione uera, tunc uade ad curationem secundum confidentiam: et est, ut consideres tunc, si est Fistula propinqua apparens, aut in loco saluo longinquo a iunctura, aut a neruo, aut arteria, aut uena, aut uno locorum quae dixi tibi: tunc seca Fistulam secundum quod praemissum est ex narratione mea, et aufer quod est in ea ex filtratione, et carnibus corruptis, quod nascitur in orificio eius ex carne, aut thelul, et similibus: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	When you have therefore taken your position above all that, then go to the cure according to your confidence: and it is for you to consider then, if there is a fistula appearing nearby, or in a distant place from the junction, or near a nerve, or artery, or vein, or one of the places I mentioned to you: then cut the fistula as described above from my narrative, and remove what is within it by filtration, and corrupt flesh, which originates in its opening from the flesh, or thela, and similar things: and care for it until it heals.
Si autem Fistula est longinquae profunditatis, et est secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut seces eam in profundo quantum est tibi possibile.	If however the fistula is of great depth and straight: then it is necessary that you cut it as deep as possible.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex omnibus carnibus eius corruptis.	Then cleanse it from all the corrupt flesh within it.
Deinde administra licinia inuoluta in medicinis acutis: et intromitte ea usque ad concauitatem Fistulae quam comprehendisti cum ferro: fac cum ea illud aliquotiens, donec corrodat medicina acuta totum quod remansit in concauitate Fistulae ex corruptione.	Then apply a poultice wrapped in sharp medicines and insert it into the constriction of the fistula as far as you comprehended with your iron. Make it so with that several times, until the sharp medicine eats away all that remains in the constriction of the fistula from corruption.
Deinde restaura ipsam cum unguentis quae generant carnem sanam, donec sanetur.	Then restore it with ointments that produce healthy flesh until it is healed.
Si uero non sanatur per illud, tunc cauteriza ipsam secundum quod narrauimus.	But if it does not heal by that means, then cauterize it according to what we have narrated.
Si ergo caussa Fistulae est os, et certificatur apud te illud: tunc inquire ipsum, et seca ipsum secundum quod narraui tibi: si non prohibet te aliquid ex uena, aut neruo, aut membro principali, sicut diximus.	And if the cause of the fistula is a bone, and you are certain of it in your own judgment: then investigate that bone and cut it according to what I have told you; but if nothing prevents you from doing so due to a vein, or nerve, or main member, as we have said.
Si ergo detegitur tibi os, et est in eo quiddam corruptionis, et nigredinis: tunc rade ipsum, donec auferatur corruptio eius tota.	And if you find a bone and there is something rotten and blackened in it: then scrape it clean until all the corruption is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with what covers it, until it heals.
Quod si non sanatur, et emittat pus sicut faciebat: tunc scias, quod tu non peruenisti ad totam eradicationem corruptionis.	And if it does not heal and discharges pus as before: then you will know that you have not succeeded in the complete eradication of the corruption.
Detege ergo super illud secundo, et exquisite fac rasionem eius, et mundificationem ipsius cum ultima fortitudine tua.	Therefore, scrape over it again and make a thorough cleansing of it, and purify it with your utmost strength.
Deinde restaura ipsum.	Then restore it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est: et si non, tunc scias quod illa corruptio est in profunditate longinqua corporis, quam non es consecutus.	And if it heals, that is good; and if not, then you will know that the corruption is in a deep-seated part of the body, which you have not reached.
Non est ergo tibi in ea ingenium, nisi dimittere ipsam naturae.	You do not have skill in that matter except to leave it to nature.
Quod si corruptum est os paruum, et est possibile tibi, attrahe ipsum cum forficibus subtilibus quae conueniunt ad illud.	And if the small bone is corrupted and you can manage it, then draw it out with fine forceps that are suitable for it.
Si autem sunt ossa multa, tunc exquisite fac attractionem eorum omnium, neque dimittas ex eis aliquid cum tua fortitudine.	And if there are many bones, then make a precise extraction of all of them, and do not leave any behind with your strength.
Si uero contrarietatem facit tibi aliquid ex humiditatibus, et non est in incisione eorum timor, uel error: tunc incide illas humiditates et carnes, si sunt illic, et libera ossa.	But if something from the moistures is opposing you, and there is no fear or error in cutting them out: then cut away those moistures and flesh, if it is present, and free the bones.
Si uero non est tibi praeparatio auferendi ossa ex hora tua, tunc pone super uulnus quod putrefaciat ipsum: et dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat quod est in circumitu illorum ossium ex carnibus et humiditatibus.	But if you do not have preparation for removing bones from your own time, then place over the wound that is corrupting it a poultice: and let it alone until it corrupts what is surrounding those bones from flesh and moistures.
Et custodi uulnus ut non consolidetur.	And guard the wound so that it does not consolidate.
Et constringatur sectio quam tu secuisti in operatione tua.	And be constricted by the incision which you made in your operation.
Imo pone super ipsum, si times, cotum submersum sulfure trito cum oleo: aut cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio, aut aliquo unguentorum uiridium.	In fact, place over it, if you fear, an ointment submerged in powdered sulfur with oil; or an ointment submerged in Egyptian balm, or some green ointments.
Nam quando putrefient illae scilicet humiditates, et separantur ex eis ossa, alleuiatur ablatio eorum, et ipsorum attractio.	For when those humors decay and the bones are separated from them, the removal of these things is alleviated and their attraction.
Si autem est os unum magnum, sicut os cruris, aut os coxae, et similia illis, et quod ex eo corruptum est, est pars magna: tunc rade ipsum rasione ultima, donec auferatur illa nigredo et corruptio.	But if it is a large bone, such as the tibia or femur, and something like that is corrupted from it, and it is a great part: then scrape it off with the last scraping until the blackness and corruption are removed.
Deinde restaura uulnus.	Then restore the wound.
Si uero quod est in eo corruptum, est pars magna, et corruptio iam consecuta est medullam ossis, tunc necesse est serrare ipsum, et incidere ipsum totum usque ad locum, ubi peruenit corruptio: tunc cura ipsum, donec consolidetur.	If what is corrupted in it is a great part, and corruption has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to saw it off and cut it all the way down to where the corruption has reached: then care for it until it heals.
Et ego narro tibi zuken, quae accidit uiro in crure suo: ut ponas ipsam exemplum et adiutorium super operationem tuam.	And I tell you of Zukan, what happened to a man in his leg: so put it as an example and aid on your operation.
Fuit uir iuuenis aetate circiter triginta annos, cui accidit dolor in crure suo, a caussa quae mota est super ipsum intra corpus, id est, ab interioribus, donec peruenerunt materiae ad crus, et apostematum est apostemate magno: et non fuit ei caussa extrinseca.	There was a young man of about thirty years old, to whom it happened that he had pain in his leg, due to something moved over him within the body, namely from inside, until the matter reached his leg and became a large abscess: and there was no external cause.
Extensum est ergo cum eo tempus cum errore medicorum, donec apertum est apostema, et concurrerunt cum eo materiae multae.	So it was prolonged with him over time with the mistake of physicians, until the abscess was opened and many materials concurred with him.
Et postposita est curatio eius, donec fistulatum est crus, et facta sunt in eo orificia multa: quae omnia emittebant pus, et humiditates corporis.	And his treatment was delayed until the leg became a fistula and many openings were made in him: which all discharged pus and bodily humors.
Curauit ergo ipsum multitudo medicorum circiter duos annos, et non fuit in eo sapiens in arte manus, donec uocatus sum, et uidi crus eius, et materias quae currebant ex illis orificiis cursu magno: etiam omne uiri corpus iam tabuerat, et color eius citrinus erat.	So a multitude of doctors treated him for about two years, and there was no wise hand in the art until I was called, and I saw his leg, and the matters that were flowing from those openings with great flow: also the whole body of the man had already decayed, and his color was yellow.
Intromisi ergo tentam in uno locorum orificiorum, et peruenit tenta ad os.	I therefore inserted a thread into one of the openings in the wound, and the thread reached the mouth.
Deinde perscrutatus sum orificia omnia: et inueni ea peruenire ad se inuicem ex omnibus partibus cruris.	Then I examined all the openings: and I found them to reach each other from all parts of the leg.
Properaui ergo, et secui super unum illorum orificiorum, donec detexi partem ossis: et inueni ipsum corruptum: quod iam corrosum erat, et denigratum, et putruerat, et perforatum erat, donec penetrauerat usque ad medullam.	I hastened therefore and cut above one of those openings, until I uncovered a part of the bone; and I found it corrupted: which was already eaten away, and denigrated, and putrid, and perforated, until it had penetrated to the marrow.
Serraui ergo quod detectum est mihi, et praeparatum ex osse corrupto.	I therefore cut what was shown to me, and prepared from the corrupted bone.
Et deputaui, quod non esset in osse nisi illa corruptio, quam abscidi, et serraui.	And I removed what was not in the bone except for that corruption which I cut away.
Et ego iam eradicaueram eam.	And I had already pulled it out.
Deinde posui restaurationem uulneris cum medicinis consolidatiuis spacio longo.	Then I applied the wound restoration with consolidating medicines over a long space.
Et non est consolidatum.	And it is not consolidated.
Deinde tentaui, et detexi super os secundo supra detectionem primam: et inueni corruptionem continuam cum osse: et serraui quod apparuit mihi etiam ex illa corruptione.	Then I probed again and uncovered something above the bone for a second time, after the first discovery; and I found continuous corruption with the bone; and I cut what appeared to me also from that corruption.
Deinde conatus sum restaurationem eius.	Then I tried to restore it.
Et non est restauratum.	And it is not restored.
Detexi ergo super ipsum iterum, et non cessaui incidere os particulatim, et conari restaurationem eius: et non est restauratum, donec incidi ex osse circiter palmum unum, et extraxi illud cum medulla sua.	I therefore uncovered it again above that and did not stop cutting away the bone bit by bit, and tried to restore it; and it is not restored, until I cut off from the bone about a hand's breadth, and extracted it with its marrow.
Deinde restauraui ipsum cum medicinis, et consolidatum est uelociter, et sanatum: et non fuit necessaria haec iteratio in operatione eius, et sectione ipsius, nisi propter dispositionem debilitatis infirmi, et paucitatem tolerantiae eius, et timorem meum super ipsum de morte: quoniam accidebat ei in omnibus horis ex superfluitate euacuationis syncopis mala.	Then I restored it with medicines, and it was quickly consolidated and healed; and this iteration was not necessary for its operation and section, except on account of the debilitated patient's weakness, his lack of tolerance, and my fear for him regarding death: because it was happening to him in every hour from excessive evacuation.
Sanatus est ergo sanatione integra: et nata est in loco ossis caro dura, et bona facta est dispositio in corpore suo, et rediit uirtus eius: et conuersatus est in dispositionibus suis: et non fecit ei contrarietatem in ambulatione nocumentum omnino.	He was therefore healed with complete healing: and firm and good flesh grew in the place of the bone, and a good arrangement was made in his body, and his strength returned: and he reverted to his usual habits: and he did not experience any harm or inconvenience at all in his walking.
Si autem os eminens in loco corporis iam fractum est: tunc oportet ut serres ipsum, secundum hunc modum: et est: ut accipias ligamentum, et stringe ipsum in extremitate ossis eminentis: et praecipe alicui, qui extendat ipsum ad sursum: et pone ligamentum aliud ex lana grossius ligamento primo.	If the prominent bone is already broken in its place in the body: then it is necessary to repair it, in this manner: and is: take a ligament, and tie it at the extremity of the prominent bone: and order someone to stretch it upwards: and place another ligament made of coarse wool from the first ligament.
Deinde liga ipsum super carne, quae est suh osse: et extende extremitatem eius, ut trahas carnem ad inferiora: et tu detegis carnem super locum quem uis serrare, ut non laedat Serra carnem.	Then bind it above the flesh which is under the bone: and stretch the extremity of it, so that you draw the flesh down to the lower parts: and you take away the flesh from the place which you want to sew, so that the suture does not hurt the flesh.
Pone lignum, aut tabulam sub osse inferius decenter: quoniam quando facis illud, non prohibetur quin secet carnem corruptam.	Place a piece of wood or a board under the bone below moderately: because when you do this, it does not prevent the corrupted flesh from being cut.
Et oportet ut sit Serratura super locum corruptum parumper, ut non sit in concauitate ossis corruptio: et non appareat in apparitione sua sensui, et cogat ad Serraturam sui uice alia.	And it is necessary for the suture to be over the corrupted place a little bit, so that the corruption of the bone does not occur in concavity; and it should not appear in its appearance to the sense, and make another suture in its place.
Quod si os est corruptum, et non est eminens, imo continuatur pars eius cum parte: et corruptio est in medio eius, aut in parte ipsius: tunc detege carnem ab omnibus partibus totam.	What if the bone is corrupted and is not prominent, but rather continues with its part; and corruption is in the middle of it or in a part of it: then remove all flesh from around the entire area.
Deinde pone lignum inferius.	Then place wood underneath.
Postea serra illud ex parte prima, ubi est corruptio, donec continuetur Serratura ex parte altera: et sit Serratura secundum longitudinem a corruptione parumper, secundum quod diximus.	Afterwards sew that from the first part where there is corruption, until the suture is continued on the other side; and let the suture be according to the length from the corruption a little bit, as we said.
Quod si corruptio est in iunctura, incide ipsam iuncturam corruptam, et serra os ubi continuatur ex parte altera.	What if the corruption is at the joint, cut off the corrupted joint and sew the bone where it continues on the other side.
Si uero corruptio est in continuatione duarum iuncturarum, tunc non est in ea ingenium nisi abrasio.	If however the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then there is no skill except abrasion.
Quod si corruptio est in pectine manus, aut in pectine pedis: tunc res in eo est difficilis ualde.	What if the corruption is in the pit of the hand or in the pit of the foot: then the matter in that case is very difficult.
Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter appareat tibi.	But it is necessary for you to inquire into the corruption and see how it appears to you.
Et abradas eam, et mundes ipsam secundum quamcunque dispositionem tibi possibile est, et cum quocunque ingenio rectificatur tibi: quando non facit tibi contrarietatem Vena, aut Neruus.	And smooth it out, and clean the same according to whatever arrangement is possible for you, and with whatever skill you have; when it does not make opposition to you, Vein, or Nerve.
Et scias quod incisoria, et Serrae ad incidendum ista ossa sunt multa, secundum situm ossium, et praparationem eorum, et ipsorum grossitudinem, et subtilitatem eorum, et magnitudinem, et paruitatem ipsorum, et duriciem ipsorum, et eorum raritatem.	And know that the saws and files for cutting these bones are many, according to the position of the bones, and their preparation, and their thickness, and subtlety, and magnitude, and smallness, and hardness, and rarity.
Quapropter oportet, ut praepares omni speciei operationis instrumentum conueniens ad illam operationem.	Therefore it is necessary to prepare the suitable instrument for every kind of operation.
Et scias, quod operationes istae significant tibi super speciem instrumenti quo indiges, quando tecum est studium longum.	And know that these operations are significant to you according to the type of instrument you need, when with you is a long study.
Et cognitio modorum huius artis, testimonium modorum aegritudinum: tunc enim iam inuenies per teipsum illud quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis ad omnem infirmitatem.	And knowledge of the methods of this art is a testimony to the methods of illnesses: then indeed you will find through yourself what fits each weakness from instruments.
Et ego sum firmans tibi in ultimo huius capituli numerum instrumentorum, quae pones exempla super quae incides, et probationem qua experiaris super alia.	And I am setting forth for you at the end of this chapter the number of instruments which you will use as examples on which to cut and proof by which to test other things.
Forma Serrae.	Saw shape.
Forma alterius Serrae.	Shape of another saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	Shape of the other saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	Shape of another saw.
Haec forma Serrae depicta, sit decenter facta.	This shape of a saw is depicted, let it be well-made.
Fiat arcus eius superior, acuitas eius ex ferro: et manubrium eius ex buxo, et sit pyramidale decenter factum.	Let the upper part of its bow be made, and its edge sharp from iron: and its handle from boxwood, and let it be well-made pyramidal.
Forma Rasorii iuncturarum.	Shape of a file for joints.
Sit caput huius Rasorii, secundum formam capitis claui stellati: et puncta eius sint secundum formam punctorum elischetfegi.	Let the head of this file be, according to the shape of the head of a star-shaped awl; and its points, according to the shape of the points of an emery stone.
Et non conuenit, nisi ut fricentur cum eo capita iuncturarum, quando corrumpuntur, aut os amplum, et magnum est.	And it is not suitable except that they rub against this file when the joints are worn out, or a large and great bone.
Forma maioris Rasorii.	Shape of a larger file.
Forma medii Rasorii.	Form of the Middle Razor.
Forma Rasorii lati.	The shape of a broad razor.
Forma Rasorii in quo est concauitas.	The shape of a razor in which there is hollowing.
Forma Rasorii alterius subtilis.	The shape of another, thin razor.
Forma Rasorii alterius curuatae extremitatis.	The shape of another, curved-tipped razor.
Forma Rasorii parui, subtilis tentae.	The shape of a small, thin file-like razor.
Forma Rasorii cum quo inciduntur ossa.	The shape of a razor with which bones are cut.
Forma etiam Rasorii magni.	The shape also of a large razor.
Hoc similatur Radio, et extremitas est sicut Serra: exhibetur in locis multis ex rasione ossium.	This resembles a saw, and the end is like a file: it is shown in many places for scraping bones.
Forma Rasorii quod conuenit ad rasionem eius quod perforatum est ex ossibus.	The shape of a razor that is suitable for scraping what has been pierced from bones.
Extremitas eius triangula, acutarum est extremitatum.	Its end is triangular, with sharp tips.
Fit ex Indi.	It is made in India.
Et similiter oportet, ut fiant omnia quae diximus ex Rasoriis, et Incisoriis, et Serris.	And similarly all that we have said should be made from Razors, Files, and Sawblades.
¶ De incisione extremitatum, et Serratura ossium.	Of cutting off extremities and sawing bones.
Caput LXXXIX.	Head 89.
Putrefiunt extremitates, aut ex caussa extrinseca, aut intrinseca.	They putrefy because of an external cause or an internal one.
Cum ergo medicatus fueris illam corruptionem curatione medicinarum, et non confert curatio: et uides corruptionem incidere in membrum, quam non repercutit aliquid: tunc oportet ut incidas illud membrum usque ubi consequitu corruptio, ut euadat infirmus per illud a morte, aut a malicia quae est maior defectu membri.	Therefore, when you have treated the corruption with medicines and the treatment does not help: and you see the corruption occurring in a member which does not respond to anything: then it is necessary that you cut off that member up to where the corruption follows, so that the sick person may escape through that member from death or from the greater defect of the member.
Et signum cui accidit illud est, quod denigratur membrum, donec putetur: quod ignis combussit ipsum, aut putrefit post nigredinem: donec inciditur illa putredo usque ad illud quod sequitur illud membrum, et serpit in totum corpus.	And the sign that this occurs is that the member turns black until it becomes putrid: which fire has consumed, or has rotted after becoming black: until the putrefaction is cut off up to where that member follows, and spreads throughout the entire body.
Propera ergo cum incisione eius, et similiter si caussa corruptionis est a percussione quorundam uenenosorum: sicut scorpionis marini, et uiperae, et rutellae, et similium.	Therefore, proceed with the cutting off of that member, and similarly if the cause of corruption is due to the striking of certain venomous things, such as the sea scorpion, viper, or adder, and similar ones.
Si ergo corruptio, aut percussio est in extremitate digiti, tunc incide digitum, et non des spacium corruptioni, ut incedat usque ad reliquam manum.	If therefore corruption or striking is at the tip of the finger, then cut off the finger and do not give space to corruption to spread until it reaches the rest of the hand.
Et similiter si accidit in manu, tunc incide eam ex radice focilis, et non des spacium corruptioni, donec capiat in focili brachii.	And similarly if it happens in the hand, then cut off the hand from the wrist and do not give space to corruption until it reaches the forearm.
Et si inuadit in eo, tunc incide brachium apud cubitum in iunctura sua.	And if it spreads into him, then cut off the arm at the elbow joint.
Si autem pertransit corruptio, et uides eum circiter cubitum: tunc in illo est mors infirmi.	But if corruption passes through and you see him around the elbow: then death is at hand for that person.
Et administrare praeter illud ex curatione, est quantitas uirtus.	And to apply something beyond that in healing is a quantity of power.
Et similiter fac de pede, quando inuadit corruptio in digito, tunc incide ipsum apud unum nodorum: et si capit in pectine pedis, tunc incide pedem totum.	And similarly do this for the foot, when corruption invades the toe; then cut it off at one of the joints. And if it reaches into the instep of the foot, then cut off the entire foot.
Si autem ascendit ad genu, tunc incide crus apud iuncturam genu.	But if it ascends to the knee, then cut off the leg at the knee joint.
Quod si corruptio iam peruenit supra genu, tunc non est in ea ingenium, nisi dimissio, et relinquere infirmum morti.	And if corruption has already reached above the knee, then there is no skill in it except giving up and leaving the sick person to death.
Et modus incidendi membrum, aut serrandi ipsum est, ut stringas ligamentum in inferiori, quem uis incidere: et stringe ligamentum aliud supra locum.	And the method of cutting off a limb or cutting it is to tighten the ligament on the lower side that you wish to cut off: and then tighten another ligament above the place.
Et extendat minister ligamentum unum ad inferiora: et extendat minister aliud ligamentum superius ad sursum.	And have the assistant stretch one ligament down lower: and have the assistant stretch another ligament up higher above.
Et tu separa carnem quae est inter duo ligamenta, cum Spatumili lato, donec detegatur caro tota.	And you separate the flesh that is between the two ligaments with a broad spatula, until all the flesh is exposed.
Deinde incidatur, aut serretur.	Then it should be cut off or cut.
Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.	And it is necessary that you place a linen cloth around all parts and not touch the healthy area with the saw: and the sick person will suffer added harm and a warm abscess.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis interius dum operaris, tunc cauteriza locum uelociter: aut pone super ipsum quosdam pulueres abscindentes sanguinem.	If bleeding occurs internally while you are working, then cauterize the place quickly: or place some powder on top that absorbs blood.
Deinde redi ad medicationem tuam, donec compleatur.	Then return to your treatment until it is complete.
Deinde liga membrum uulneratum cum ligamento conueniente ei, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bind the wounded limb with a suitable ligament and care for it until it heals.
Et ego narro tibi quod accidit uiro in pede suo, hoc idem accidens quod narro tibi.	And I will tell you what happened to a man on his foot, the same thing that is happening to him.
Quod est, quia accidit in pede suo nigredo, cum adustione quae assimilatur combustioni ignis: et corruptio illa in primis accidit in digito suo, donec coepit pedem totum.	What is this? Because a blackening occurred on his foot, similar to a burning by fire, and that corruption first affected his finger until it spread throughout his entire foot.
Properauit ergo uir ex seipso, postquam uidit corruptionem incidere in membro cum uehementia eius, quod inuenit ex dolore, et adustione eius: et incidit ipsum apud iuncturam, et sanatus est.	Therefore the man took care of himself after he saw the corruption affecting his member with its madness, which he discovered through pain and burning; and it happened to him at the joint, and he was healed.
Et postquam praeteriit ei tempus longum, accidit ei illa eadem corruptio in digito manus suae indice.	And after a long time had passed, the same corruption occurred on his index finger of his hand.
Venit ergo ad me, et conatus sum recuperare illam superfluitatem cum eo quod posui super manum ex medicinis post mundificationem corporis eius: et non repercussa est superfluitas, et coepit incedere in digitum alium: donec coepit coruptio in manum.	So he came to me, and I attempted to remove the excess with him by applying medicines after purifying his body; and the excess was not removed, and it began to move to another finger: until corruption spread throughout his hand.
Vocauit ergo me, ad incidendum manum eius: et nolui illud, sperans ex me super repercussionem illius superfluitatis: et timui etiam super ipsum apud incisionem manus eius mortem.	So he called me to cut open his hand; and I did not want to do it, hoping that the excess would be removed through itself; and I also feared death for him during the opening of his hand.
Quoniam uirtus uiri erat super casum.	Because the man's strength was above his condition.
Postquam ergo desperauit de me, reuersus est ad terram suam: et peruenit ad me de eo, quia properauit, et incidit manum suam totam: et sanatus est.	After that, he lost hope in me and returned to his land; and he came back to me about it because he was advised, and cut open the entire hand of his own accord; and he was healed.
Et non attuli hanc narrationem, nisi ut sit adiutorium super illud quod cadit de genere huius aegritudinis: et ut sit significatio qua significetur, et secundum quam agatur.	And I did not bring this story forth except to be a help for what falls under the category of this kind of illness; and so that it may be a signification by which one may signify and according to which one should act.
¶ De cura Sinuum, et qualitate clisterizationis cum medicinis.	Chapters on the treatment of sinuses, and the quality of cleansing with medicines.
Caput XC.	Chapter 90.
Quando accidit apostema in quibusdam membris carnosis, et prolongatur spacium apostematis, donec collectionem facit saniei: deinde rumpitur, aut perforatur, et egreditur quod in eo est ex sanie, et remanet locus uacuus quasi sit uas: et cutis quae est super ipsum sicut pannus qui iam subtiliatus est: et non peruenit ad ultimum in corruptione sua, neque imprimit in os, neque in neruum, neque in ligamentum: meretur ut nominetur Sinus: et non nominatur Fistula: uerumtamen si prolongatur spacium eius, donec imprimat corruptio in aliquid horum membrorum, tunc nominatur Fistula, aut zuken.	When an abscess occurs in certain fleshy members and the space of the abscess is prolonged until it forms a collection of pus: then it bursts or perforates and what is inside it comes out through the pus, and the location remains empty as if it were a vessel; and the skin that covers it is like a piece of cloth that has been worn thin. And it does not reach its final state of corruption nor imprint on bone, muscle, or ligament: it merits being called a Sinus; and it is not called Fistula. However, if the space of this abscess is prolonged until corruption imprints on one of these members, then it is called Fistula, or sinus.
Et cura eius est, ut incidas illam cutem totam sicut reuoluitur: et praecipue quando subtiliata est, et facta sicut pannus: et confidis quia non aaehaeret cum loco, propter corruptionem suam.	And the treatment for it is to cut off that skin entirely as it has rotted; and especially when it has been worn thin and made like a piece of cloth. And you may rely on this because it will not adhere to the location due to its own corruption.
Si autem speras quod adhaereat cutis, et non consequitur ex eo corruptio illa ultima consecutione: et si in cute est spissitudo ex carne, tunc cura ipsum cum Clisteri: et est, ut consideres ad Sinum.	But if you hope that the skin will adhere and does not result from that last stage of corruption; and if there is a thickness on the skin from flesh, then treat it with a clyster, and it is to consider it with respect to the sinus.
Tunc si est magnus, et pus quod emittitur ex eo est foetidi odoris: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum medicamine aegyptio, quod est aceti, et olei, et ziniar, partes recipiens aequales, aggregentur in uase: et decoquantur super ignem, donec rubeat medicamen: et ueniat in spissitudinem mellis.	Then if it is large and the pus that is emitted from it has a foul odor: then clysterize it with a medicine from Egypt, which is a mixture of vinegar, oil, and zinc powder, with equal parts, gathered in a vessel: and let them be decocted over fire until the medicine turns red: and come to the thickness of honey.
Deinde accipe ex eo quod tibi necesse est: et dissolue ipsum cum aqua et melle, et clisteriza cum eo Sinum: et stringe orificium eius, et dimitte medicinam in eo ad quantitatem duarum horarum.	Then take from it what you need: and dissolve it with water and honey, and clysterize it with that into the sinus: and tie off its opening, and let the medicine stay in it for a period of two hours.
Deinde extrahe ipsum cum expressione: fac illud diebus tot, donec mundificetur Sinus, et remoueatur foetor.	Then extract it with expression: make it that way for days until the sinus is cleansed and the foul odor is removed.
Et quandoque clisterizatur cum aqua cineris, quando non est tibi praesens hoc medicamen: et est, ut accipias cinerem lignorum uitis, aut cinerem ex lignis ilicis: et proiicias super eam aquam.	And sometimes clysterize it with ash water when this medicine is not available to you; and it is, that you take the ash of vine wood or ash from ilex trees: and throw it over her.
Deinde cola eam, et clisteriza cum ea, donec confidas quod Sinus iam ablutus est.	Then smear it on and cover it with a poultice until you are confident that the sinus has been cleansed.
Quod si infirmo non est tolerantia super medicamen aegyptium, neque aquam cineris, tunc clisteriza ipsum cum aqua et melle, cui iam permixtum est aliquid ex ziniar contrito.	If the patient is not tolerating the Egyptian remedy nor water of ashes, then cover him with a poultice made from water and honey to which some crushed ziniar has been added.
Aut clisteriza ipsum cum melle et uino permixtis, quoniam de proprietate mellis est, ut mundificet, et abluat: et uinum facit adhaerere Sinum, praecipue quando in uino est superfluitas stipticitatis et siccitatis.	Or cover him with a poultice made from honey and wine mixed together, since it is known that the property of honey is to cleanse and purify: and wine makes the sinus stick together, especially when there is an excess of dryness and bitterness.
Cum facis illud aliquotiens, et confidis quod Sinus corruptio iam remota est: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum eo quod facit nasci carnem in eo.	When you have done this a few times and are confident that the corruption of the sinus has been removed: then cover him with a poultice made from what produces flesh growth in it.
Et est, ut accipias ex emplastro dyafinicon: et dissoluas ipsum cum oleo rosato, et uino stiptico: aut clisteriza ipsum cum quibusdam medicinis, et unguentis aliis, quorum proprietates scripsi in tractatu unguentorum.	And it is, as you take from the plaster a diaphanizing substance; and dissolve it with rose oil and astringent wine: or cover him with a poultice made from certain medicines and other ointments, whose properties I have written in the treatise on ointments.
Quod si orificium Sinus est strictum, in quo non capit cannula clisteris: tunc amplifica ipsum cum ferro parumper: aut pone in ipso licinium inuolutum in unguento aegyptio, aut in unguento basilicon, donec amplificetur.	If the orifice of the sinus is narrow and does not admit a catheter for a poultice: then dilate it with a iron instrument for a little while: or place in it a linen cloth wrapped in Egyptian ointment or basilikon ointment, until it has been dilated.
Et similiter si est orificium etiam amplum, tunc aggrega labia eius cum sutura: et dimitte ex eo quantitatem in quam ingrediatur clistere sine additione.	And similarly if the orifice is also large, then gather up its lips with a suture and let go from it as much as the catheter can enter without addition.
Et similiter si orificium eius ex quo currit pus, est eleuatum ad superiora: tunc seca ipsum in depressiori loco qui est in ipso, ut currat ex eo pus usque inferius: quoniam pus quando coartatur in profunditate Sinus, prohibet carnem generari in eo.	And similarly if the orifice through which pus flows is elevated towards the upper parts: then cut it at a lower point which is in it, so that the pus may flow from it downwards: because when the pus is compressed in the depth of the sinus, it prevents flesh from growing in it.
Quod si non est tibi possibile secare Sinum circiter inferius eius secundum quod uis: tunc conare, ut praepares membrum praeparatione qua currat ex eo pus cum facilitate secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	If it is not possible for you to cut the sinus around its lower part as you wish: then try to prepare the limb with a preparation by which the pus may flow from it with ease, according to what is prepared for you.
Conare, ut non retineatur in eo aliquid ex pus omnino: et accipe medicinas consolidatiuas quae ponuntur super signum, conuenientes ad illud quod uis.	To prevent anything from sticking to it from pus entirely: and receive medicinal congees placed on the mark, suitable for what you wish.
Et extende eas super pannum lini.	And stretch them over a linen cloth.
Et sit pannus tantae quantitatis, qua fiat communicatio totius Sinus.	And let the cloth be of such a size that there may be communication throughout the sinus.
Deinde incide cum forficibus in directo orificii Sinus foramen, amplius orificio Sinus parumper.	Then cut with forceps directly into the orifice of the sinus, making the opening a little larger than the orifice of the sinus.
Deinde extende ex unguentis lenibus super pannum alium, secundum quantitatem foraminis: et pone eum super ipsum positione longinqua ab orificio Sinus, ut alleuietur exitus pus ex eo: et non auferas pannum magnum, nisi post dies aliquos uice una.	Then spread a soft ointment on another cloth, according to the size of the opening; and place it over it, far from the orifice of the sinus, so that the discharge of pus may be alleviated from it: and do not remove the cloth until after several days.
Ille autem qui est super orificium Sinus, est ille quem remoues in omni hora, ut egrediatur quod aggregatur in eo ex pus: et ut scias, an illud quod currit ex eo uirus, est multum, aut parum: aut digestum, aut indigestum.	But the one that is on the orifice of the sinus, you remove at every hour, so that what has accumulated in it from pus may flow out; and to know whether the flowing substance is much, a little, digested, or undigested.
Et cum hoc iterum considera locum Sinus ipsius, an in ipso sentiat dominus eius dolorem, aut non sit in eo dolor, et an sit in eo apostema, aut non sit in eo apostema.	And when you have done this again, examine the site of the sinus itself, whether its lord feels pain in it or not; and whether there is abscess in it or not.
Cum ergo protenditur medicatio tua taliter, et uides materiam quae egreditur super orificium Sinus, tunc scias, quod Sinus iam adhaeret, aut approximat adhaerentiae: tunc ergo solue ipsum in mane, aut in tertio die: et quando soluis uulnus, tunc permuta pannum alium, et renoua unguentum.	When therefore your treatment proceeds thus, and you see the material that flows out on the orifice of the sinus, then you will know that the sinus has already adhered or is approaching adhesion: then therefore dissolve it in the morning, or on the third day; and when you dissolve the wound, then change the cloth to another one and renew the ointment.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post spacium longum uirus subtile, tunc non desperes de adhaerentia eius, nam sanatio eius appropinquat, quoniam ex hominibus sunt qui tardant generationem carnis in uulneribus suis, et ex eis sunt qui agunt econtrario illius.	But if a subtle pus flows out from the sinus after a long period, then do not despair of its adhesion, for its healing is approaching, since there are people who delay the formation of flesh in their wounds, and there are those who act contrary to that.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post dies multos pus indigestum, tunc scias quod sinus non adhaeret.	But if a undigested pus flows out from the sinus after many days, then you will know that the sinus does not adhere.
Si ergo tardatur adhaerentia Sinus, et prolongatur res eius: tunc adde in exiccatione medicinarum, uerum faciant medici, ut sint medicinae in substantia sua humidae, et in uirtute sua siccae: sicut unguentum dyafinicon, quando additur in eo superfluitas additionis ex zegi.	If therefore the adhesion of the sinus is delayed and its substance is prolonged: then add to the drying remedies what physicians truly make, so that they are humid in their substance and dry in their power, just as diaphoretic ointment when an excess of addition is made from aloes.
Et ex magis ultimo quo curatur, est, ut accipias unguentum dyafinicon, et soluatur cum oleo rosato, et roretur super ipsum uinum antiquum aequale in substantia sua.	And from the last part of the treatment is this: that you take diaphoretic ointment and dissolve it with rose oil, and sprinkle it over old wine equal to its substance.
Deinde confice ipsum cum eo, et utere ipso.	Then mix it with that, and use it.
Et iam facit simile huic actioni, quando non est tibi praesens unguentum dyafinicon, mel, quando decoquis ipsum, donec ingrossetur, et uteris eo.	And now this makes a similar action when you do not have diaphoretic ointment, honey, by cooking it until it thickens, and using it.
Aut accipe myrrham, et aloen, et olibanum: tere totum, et pulueriza illud super mel dum est super ignem.	Or take myrrh, and aloe, and frankincense: grind all together, and powder it over honey while it is still warm.
Deinde line super ipsum pannum, et stringe ipsum super Sinum: et line cum melle quod decoquisti, donec ingrossatum est: et pulueriza super ipsum species, et pone super ipsum pannum, et stringe eum.	Then spread the mixture over the cloth, and tie it over the sinus: and then tie with honey that you have cooked until thickened: and powder over it the kind of powder, and put it on the cloth, and tie it.
Et quandoque administratur in illo aristolochia longa, et radices lilii coelestis, et est lilium: et farina herbi, et centaurea.	And sometimes administer it with Aristolochia longa, and the roots of the Heavenly Lily, and is Lily: and the flour of a herb, and Centaury.
Utere eis simplicibus, aut aggregatis, tere ea, et cribella ipsa: et pulueriza super mel quod narraui, et utere eo.	Use them simple or combined, grind them together, and sift it: and powder over the honey that I narrated, and use it.
Quod si prolongatur res Sinus, et non sanatur hac curatione: tunc scias, quod in profundo eius est corruptio: aut iam facit impressionem in ossibus, aut in reliquis membris duris, aut ligamentis: tunc cura ipsum curatione Fistularum, secundum quod praemissum est.	But if the sinus's condition prolongs and is not healed by this treatment: then you will know that there is corruption deep within it: or already making an impression on the bones, or in other hard members, or ligaments: then cure it with Fistula treatments, as was previously mentioned.
¶ De cura Panaritii et unguis attritae, et incisione digiti additi, et sectione.	About the treatment of Panaritis and worn-out nails, and the addition of finger cuts and sections.
Caput XCI.	Chapter 91.
Panaritium est apostema quod nascitur sub ungue pollicis manus, aut pedis: et fortasse nascitur in reliquis digitis.	Painful swelling is a pustule that arises under the nail of the thumb or foot: and perhaps it arises in other fingers.
Cum ergo prolongatur res eius, et negligitur curato eius, et apostematur apostemate calido: aut corrumpitur, et emittit pus, donec corrodit radicem unguis: et fortasse corrumpit eam totam, et fortasse peruenit corruptio ad os, donec est ei odor foetidus: et fit extremitas digiti lata, et fit color eius fuscus.	When therefore the condition of this thing is prolonged and its cure is neglected, and a pustule arises with heat: or it becomes corrupted and emits pus, until it corrupts the root of the nail: and perhaps it corrupts it entirely, and perhaps the corruption reaches to the bone, until it has a foul odor: and the end of the finger becomes wide, and its color becomes dark.
Quando ergo tu curas ipsum, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut incidas cum ferro totam superfluitatem quae remansit ex ungue.	When therefore you are treating it as we said in the division, and your treatment is not effective: then it is necessary that you cut off with iron all the excess that remains from the nail.
Deinde cauteriza uulnus post illud.	Then cauterize the wound afterwards.
Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.	For cauterization is very helpful.
Si uero os est sanum, et est unguis etiam sana, et additiones uacuae unguis iam comprimunt carnem ad interiora, et incipiunt pungere ipsam, et laedunt eam: tunc oportet ut ponas Radium subtilem sub angulo unguis quae pungit carnem, et impelle eam sursum: et incide eam carnem cum facilitate, et pone super illud quod remanet de carne ex medicinis comburentibus, corrosiuis, donec remoueatur totum eius.	If however the bone is sound, and the nail also sound, and the added flesh of the nail already compresses the flesh to the inside, and begins to pierce it, and hurt it: then it is necessary that you place a subtle Radicum under the angle of the nail which pierces the flesh, and push it upwards: and cut through the flesh with ease, and put over what remains of the flesh from medicines that burn and corrode, until the whole thing is removed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointments, until it heals.
Si autem corruptio iam imprimit in os, tunc oportet ut incidas illud os, et extrahas ipsum: non enim sanatur unquam dum permanet in eo os corruptum.	If however the corruption has already taken root in the bone, then it is necessary that you cut off that bone and remove it: for it will never heal as long as the corrupted bone remains.
Quod si uides corrosionem et corruptionem incedere in digitum, tunc incide eum in uno nodorum, secundum quod praemissa est eius rememoratio.	What if you see a corruption and gangrene spreading to the finger, then cut it off at one of the joints, according to what has been previously remembered about it.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it, until it heals.
Si autem accidat ungui attritio, aut percussio: et contingit in ea dolor uehemens, tunc oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	If however fingernail attrition or percussion occurs, and severe pain accompanies it, then it is necessary that you bleed the patient first.
Deinde seca unguem cum Spatumili acuto sectione transuersa de sursum ad uisum.	Then cut the nail with a sharp Spathiumuli cross-section from above downwards.
Et custodi, ne sectio perueniat ad carnem quae est sub ungue, nam tu facies accidere per illud super infirmum dolorem uehementem, et erit caussa ad natiuitatem carnis additae in loco.	And take care that the cutting does not reach the flesh which is under the nail, for you would cause severe suffering to an innocent person through that above, and it will be a reason for adding flesh to the place.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod sedat dolores.	Then care for the place with what calms pain.
Digitus uero additus qui nascitur in quibusdam manibus hominum, fortasse est carnosus totus: et fortasse sunt in quibusdam eorum ossa, et fortasse est in eo unguis: et quidam eorum nascitur in radice iuncturae, aut est natiuitas eius in quibusdam nodis digiti.	The added finger that is born on some hands of men, perhaps is all fleshy: and perhaps there are bones in some of them, and perhaps there is a nail on it: and some of them are born at the root of the joint, or its birth is in certain knots of the finger.
Ille ergo qui nascitur in quibusdam nodis digiti, non mouetur: et ille qui nascitur apud iuncturam digiti, fortasse mouetur.	Therefore, the one that is born in certain knots of the finger does not move: and the one that is born at the joint of the finger, perhaps moves.
Eius ergo qui ex eis est carnosus, sectio eius facilis est.	Therefore, the fleshly one among them is easy to cut.
Quod est, ut incidas ipsum apud radicem suam cum Spatumili lato.	Which is, that you should cut it at its root with a broad Spathium.
Eius autem cuius natiuitas est in radice iuncturae curatio, est difficilis.	But the cure of one whose birth is at the joint of the root is difficult.
Abstine ergo ab incisione eius.	Therefore, abstain from cutting it.
In illo uero qui nascitur in digito apud ultimum nodorum, tunc oportet ut incidas in primis carnem eius incisione rotunda usque ad os.	In that one who is born at the end of the fingers, then it is necessary to cut into its first flesh with a rounded incision up to the bone.
Deinde serra os cum una illarum Serrarum conuenientium ad illud.	Then saw through the bone with one of those saws that are suitable for it.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals.
Consolidatio autem quae accidit digitis adinuicem, multotiens accidit aut ex natiuitate hominis, id est, nascitur cum eo, aut a consolidatione uulneris, aut combustione ignis, et similibus.	However, the union that occurs between fingers one against the other, often happens either through the birth of a person, that is, it grows with him, or from the consolidation of a wound, or from burning by fire, and similar things.
Oportet ergo ut seces illam consolidationem, donec redeant digiti secundum formam suam naturalem.	Therefore, you should cut that union until the fingers return to their natural shape.
Deinde pone inter eos licinia, aut pannos infusos in oleo rosato: ut non consolidentur uelociter, et separa inter eos: aut pone inter eos laminam plumbi subtilem, donec consolidetur locus secundum quod oportet.	Then place between them linen or cloths soaked in rose oil: so that they do not consolidate quickly, and separate between them: or place between them a thin plate of lead, until the place is consolidated as it should be.
Et similiter si accidat consolidatio quibusdam digitis cum palma, tunc seca illam consolidationem, secundum quod praeparatur et conuenit figurae membri.	And similarly if consolidation occurs in some fingers with the palm, then cut off that consolidation, according to how it is prepared and suits the shape of the member.
¶ De incisione Vitium.	Chapter on Cutting Off Defects.
Caput XCII.	Head 92.
Uites sunt Venae inuolutae, grossae, plenae superfluitatibus melancholicis quae accidunt in pluribus membris corporis: et plurimum euentus earum est in cruribus, praecipue in cruribus iter agentium et laborantium, et portantium.	There are swollen, thickened, and distended veins which occur from excessive melancholic humors that happen in many parts of the body: and most often they occur in legs, especially in those who walk or work a lot, and carry heavy loads.
Oportet ergo ut administres excussionem corporis ex cholera nigra aliquotiens excussione forti.	Therefore it is necessary to administer a purgation of the body with black chalk several times with strong scratching.
Deinde phlebotoma patientis eas basilicam.	Then let bloodletting be done on the patient's basilica vein.
Curatio uero earum cum ferro, est secundum duos modos.	However, their treatment with iron is according to two methods.
Vnus eorum est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger.	One of them is that they should be cut and the black blood drawn out.
Et modus alter est, ut eleuetur Vena, et extrahatur tota.	And the other method is to elevate the vein and draw it all out.
Sectio uero eius est secundum hunc modum.	The cutting of it is according to this method.
Embroca crus in primis cum aqua calida multum, donec resoluatur sanguis grossus faeculentus.	Wrap the leg first with hot water a great deal, until the thick, clotted blood dissolves.
Deinde stringe crus infirmi a superiori parte coxae eius, usque ad inferiorem partem genu cum uitta.	Then bind the lame leg with a bandage from the upper part of the hip down to the lower part of the knee.
Deinde seca uenam in loco uno, aut duobus, aut tribus sectione ampla.	Then cut the vein at one place, or two places, or three wide incisions.
Deinde eleua, id est, extrahe sanguinem in manu tua ab inferiori parte cruris, usque ad sursum, et a superiori oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	Then elevate, that is, draw out the blood from your hand from the lower part of the leg up to the top, and it is necessary to let the patient bleed first.
Deinde seca unguem cum usque inferius: donec egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uides sufficere, et quam tolerat uirtus infirmi.	Then cut off the nail right down to the bottom: until a quantity of blood emerges that you see is sufficient and which the patient's strength can tolerate.
Postea liga eam: et praecipe ei, ut abstineat a cibis generantibus choleram nigram: et itera euacuationem et phlebotomiam, quando implentur Venae, et nocet illud infirmo.	After that, bind it up and advise him to abstain from foods that produce black bile: and repeat the evacuation and bloodletting when the veins are full and it harms the patient.
Eleuatio autem eius est secundum hunc modum.	The elevation of it is according to this method.
Rade crus infirmi, si in ea sunt pili multi.	Remove the crippled man's crutches if there are many hairs in them.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in balneum: aut embroca ipsum in crure eius cum aqua calida, donec rubeat, et exuberentur Venae: aut exercitetur exercitio forti, si non est ei praesens balneum, donec calefiat membrum.	Then introduce him into a bath; or immerse his leg in hot water with him until it becomes red and the veins are filled: or exercise him in strong exercise, if there is no bath present, until the limb warms up.
Deinde seca cutem in directo uenae sectione per longitudinem: aut in ultimo eius apud genu, aut in inferiori parte eius apud calcaneum.	Then cut the skin along the straight course of the vein throughout its length: or at its end near the knee, or at its lower part near the heel.
Deinde aperi cutem cum uncinis, et excoria uenam ab omni parte, donec appareat sensui: et est apud apparitionem eius, quod uides eam rubeam ad nigredinem decliuem.	Then open the cut with forceps and scrape the vein clean from all parts until it is visible to the sense; and at its appearance, you will see it becoming red, then declining to blackness.
Cum ergo uadit ex cute, uides eam albam quasi sit chorda.	When it comes out of the cut, you will see it white as if it were a cord.
Deinde intromitte sub ea Radium, donec quando eleuatur et egreditur de cute: suspende eam cum uncino caeco, leni.	Then introduce Radix under it until when it is lifted up and emerges from the cut: suspend it with a blind forceps, gently.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam prope illam sectionem tribus digitis.	Then cut another section near that section three fingerbreadths away.
Deinde excoria cutem a superiori parte uenae, donec appareat.	Then scrape the cut from the upper part of the vein until it appears.
Deinde eleua eam cum Radiis sicut fecisti, et suspende eam cum uncino alio, sicut fecisti in primis.	Then lift it up with Radix as you did, and suspend it with another forceps as you did at first.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam, aut sectiones plures, si indiges illo.	Then cut another section, or multiple sections if needed.
Deinde eleua, et incide ipsam ultima sectione apud calcaneum.	Then lift it up and cut off the last section at the heel.
Deinde extrahe eam ad sectionem quae est supra eam.	Then pull it out to the section that is above it.
Et fac illud, donec extrahas eam ex sectione quae est superior, uel altior sectionibus omnibus, donec quando egreditur tota: tunc incide eam.	And do this until you pull it out from the upper or higher sections altogether, when it emerges entirely: then cut it.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad extrahendum, et eleuandum: tunc intromitte acum cum filo forti duplo, et liga eam, et extrahe ipsam: aut intromitte sub ea Radium: et reuolue manum tuam ad omnem partem, donec egrediatur.	If it does not obey you to pull out and lift up: then introduce a needle with a strong thread twice as long, and bind it, and pull it out: or introduce Radix under it: and turn your hand in all directions until it emerges.
Et caue, ne incidatur.	And beware, lest it be cut.
Nam si incidatur, fit difficile tibi eleuare eam ualde, et ingreditur super infirmum ex ea nocumentum.	For if it is cut, it will be difficult for you to lift it strongly, and harm from it will come upon the patient.
Cum ergo extraxeris eam totam: tunc pone super locum uulnerum lanam submersam in uino et oleo rosato, aut oleo: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	When therefore you have taken it all out: then place a soaked cloth of wool on the wound site, submerged in wine and rose oil, or oil: and care for it until it heals.
Quod si Vitis est contracta, habens tortuositatem cui sit inuolutio ad partes, et non est sicut diximus secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut findas super eam ad omnem partem tortuositatis eius, et loca inuolutionis ipsius.	And if it is a vitiligo that has contracted and has twisting and turning to parts, and it is not as we said according to straightness: then it is necessary for you to cut into it on all sides of its twisting and the places of its encircling.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncinis, donec eleues eam totam: et caue apud sectionem tuam super eam ne incidas uenam, aut uulneres: nam difficile fiet super te eleuare, uel extrahere eam.	Then suspend it with a hook until you lift it all out: and beware not to cut into the vein or wound on it: for it will be difficult for you to lift or pull it out.
Conserua ergo prudentiam tuam.	Therefore, conserve your prudence.
Forma Incidentis quo sanatur Vitis.	The Form of Cutting by Which Vitiligo Heals.
Forma Vncini caeci.	The Form of the Blind Knot.
Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uulneret uenam: et est grossae flectuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret uenam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.	It is not curved like the other knots, nor is it sharp at its extremity, so that it does not cut a vein: and it has a large, gentle curvature: because if it were thin, it would cut a vein with its thinness: indeed let there be excessive thickness, as we said.
De extractione Venae cruris.	On the Extraction of the Vein of the Thigh.
Caput XCIII.	Chapter 93.
Haec Vena generatur in cruribus in terris calidis, sicut Alizegi, et terra Arabum, et in terris aridis, calidis, paucae teneritatis, id est, in quibus non nascitur herba, neque arbor.	This Vein is generated in the thighs of people living in hot lands, such as Alizegi, and Arabian land, and in dry, hot lands with little vegetation, that is, where no grass or tree grows.
Et fortasse generatur in locis aliis corporis praeter crura.	And perhaps it is generated in other parts of the body besides the thighs.
Et generatio quidem eius est a putrefactione quae accidit sub cute, sicut accidunt intra corpora serpentes et uermes ascarides, et uermes generati inter cutem et carnem.	And its generation indeed is from the putrefaction that occurs under the skin, just as it happens to serpents and ascaride worms inside the body, and worms generated between the skin and flesh.
Et signum incaeptionis euentus huius Venae est, quod accidit in crure inflammatio uehemens.	And the sign of the beginning of this vein's outcome is that a violent inflammation occurs in the leg.
Deinde uesicatur locus.	Then the place is irrigated.
Deinde incipit Vena exire ex loco illius uesicationis, quasi sit radix plantae, aut animal.	Then the vein begins to flow out from that area of irrigation, as if it were the root of a plant or an animal.
Cum ergo apparet ex ea extremitas eius, tunc oportet ut inuoluas super ipsam frustum plumbi, cuius pondus sit ex drachma keil, usque ad drachmas II et noda ipsam: et dimitte plumbum suspensum ex crure.	So when its end appears from it, then you must wrap around it a piece of lead, whose weight is one and a half drachmas to two drachmas, up to the node, and let the lead hang down from the leg.
Quotiens ergo egreditur ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, inuolue illud in plumbo, et noda illud.	Whenever then something emerges from it to the outside, wrap that in lead and tie it off.
Quod si prolongatur multum, tunc incide partem eius, et inuolue residuum.	But if it is prolonged greatly, then cut off a part of it and wrap up the remainder.
Et non incidas eam radicitus antequam egrediatur tota.	And do not cut it at its root before it has emerged completely.
Quoniam si incidis, contrahitur, et ingreditur in carnem: et facit accidere apostema, et putredinem in loco, et ulcus malum.	Because if you cut it, it contracts and enters into the flesh; and causes an aposteme, and putridity in the place, and a bad ulcer.
Quapropter oportet, ut suauiter tractetur, et extrahatur paulatim, donec egrediatur ex ultimo sui, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid in corpore: et ex hac quidem Vena egreditur in quibusdam hominibus quod est in longitudine sua quinque palmorum et decem.	Therefore it is necessary to handle it gently and draw it out gradually, until it emerges from its last part, and nothing remains of it in the body; and from this very Vein, in some people, there flows a matter which is five palms and ten digits long.
Et iam peruenit ad me, quia exiuit uiro ex XX palmis.	And now it has reached me, because it flowed out of a man for twenty palms.
Si autem inciditur tibi in hora medicationis tuae: tunc intromitte radium in foramine eius, et perfora eam foramine longo, cum corpore, donec euacuetur totum quod est in ea ex materia: et administra putrefactionem loci cum medicinis diebus aliquot.	But if you are cut on the hour of your medical treatment: then insert a catheter into its orifice and pierce it with a long instrument, along with the body, until all that is in it is evacuated from the material: and administer putrefaction to the place with medicines for several days.
Deinde cura ipsum curatione apostematum.	Then cure the wound by curing the apostemes.
Et haec quidem Vena quandoque habet ramos multos, praecipue quando apparet in iunctura pedis, aut in pede ipso: et accidunt ei orificia multa, et egreditur ex omni orificio ramus.	And this Vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears at the junction of the foot, or on the foot itself: and it has many openings, and a branch emerges from every opening.
Cura ergo ipsam, sicut diximus in diuisione, et cum eo quod praemissum est.	Therefore, treat it as we have said in division, and with what has been added before.
¶ De sectione super Vermes generatos sub cute, et dicitur Aegritudo bouina.	About the removal of worms generated under the skin, and it is called Ox-like Distress.
Caput XCIIII.	Chapter 94.
Haec Aegritudo nominatur in quadam terra apud nos Aegritudo bouina: propterea, quia multotiens accidit bouibus, et est uermis paruus unus, qui nascitur inter cutem et carnem.	This Distress is called Ox-like Distress in a certain land among us; therefore, because it often happens to oxen, and it is a small worm that is born between the skin and flesh.
Et uadit in corpore toto, ascendendo et descendendo: et ostenditur sensui apud ambulationem eius de membro ad membrum, donec disrumpit ubicumque disrumpit in cute locum, et egreditur.	And it wanders throughout the body, ascending and descending; and it is revealed to the sense during its movement from member to member, until it breaks wherever it breaks through the skin, and emerges.
Et generatio eius est ex putredine quorundam humorum.	And its generation is from the putrefaction of some humors.
Sicut accidunt uermes et serpentes, id est, lumbrici, et ascarides in uentre.	Just like worms and serpents, that is, earthworms, and roundworms in the belly.
Et timetur ex malicia eius.	And be feared from its evil.
Quia quando ipse uadit in corpore, et eleuatur ad caput, et peruenit ad locum: tunc fortasse aperit in eo, et egreditur, et destruit oculum: et accidit illud multotiens.	Because when it goes through the body and ascends to the head, and reaches a place: then perhaps it opens there, and emerges, and destroys an eye: and that happens many times.
Cum ergo uis curare eum, et extrahere ipsum, tunc non fit illud nisi apud ambulationem eius, et apparitionem ipsius sensui.	When therefore you wish to cure it and extract it, then that is not done except through its wandering and the appearance of itself to the sense.
Oportet ergo, ut stringas quod est supra eum, et quod est sub eo cum ligamento constrictione forti.	Therefore, you must bind what is above it and what is below it with a strong constricting bandage.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then cut above it, and extract it.
Quod si profundatur in carne, et non inuenis ipsum: tunc pone super locum cauterium cum igne, donec moriatur.	And if it burrows into the flesh and you cannot find it: then place a cautery above the place with fire, until it dies.
Et maius quod timetur, est corruptio eius, qua corrumpit oculum, sicut diximus.	And what is feared most is its corruption, which corrupts the eye, as we said.
Si autem uides eum iam peruenisse in capite prope oculum, tunc stringe sub eo supercilium strictura bona.	If however you see it has already reached the head near the eye, then bind below it the eyebrow with a good constriction.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then cut above it, and extract it.
Et oportet ut utatur infirmus mundificatione sui corporis, cum medicinis soluentibus humores putridos malos.	It is necessary that the sick person uses cleansing of his body with medicines dissolving foul bad humors.
Et caueat sibi a cibis generantibus putrefactionem.	And he should beware for himself against foods causing corruption.
¶ De sectione super aegritudinem Nakir.	About the treatment of Nakir's illness.
Caput XCV.	Chapter 95.
Haec aegritudo nominatur in terra nostra Nakir: et est dolor qui accidit in quibusdam membris: deinde permutatur de membro ad membrum.	This illness is called Nakir in our land; and it is a pain that occurs in some members, then it changes from member to member.
Et ego quidem iam uidi ipsum, secundum quod narro tibi.	And I myself have indeed seen him, according to how I tell you.
Vocatus sum ad mulierem infirmam in quibusdam uillis.	I was called to a sick woman in certain villages.
Et detexit brachium suum, et uidi inflationem paruam in uena funis brachii.	And she showed me her arm, and I saw a small swelling in the vein of the arm.
Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.	And after staying for one hour, I saw a swelling moving with the pulse, like a worm, ascending to her shoulder more quickly than it can be, so that it is like living silver when it runs from place to place.
Recessit ergo dolor ex illo loco, et fixus est in humero.	Therefore the pain departed from that place and was fixed in the shoulder.
Deinde sedi hora una, et cucurrit in reliquum corpus, donec perueniret in brachium aliud.	Then I sat for one hour, and it ran through the rest of the body until it reached another arm.
Deinde narrauit mihi, quia reuoluebatur in toto corpore suo, secundum quod uidi.	Then she told me that it was revolving throughout her entire body, according to what I saw.
Miratus sum ergo de uelocitate permutationis eius de membro ad membrum.	I was amazed therefore at the speed of its changes from member to member.
Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.	And I myself had not seen this illness with my own eyes in such a way before that.
Verumtamen uidi multos, qui inueniunt dolorem permutari de membro ad membrum: et non uidi ipsum oculis, sicut uidi eum in muliere.	However I have seen many who find pain changing from member to member, and I did not see it with my own eyes as I saw it in the woman.
Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quod mulier fuit ex illis qui sunt ex uillis sicci corporis detectarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui illa uentositas permutata.	And I do not think that it is not, except that the woman was one of those who are from dry and arid bodies with detected veins: hence it appears to my sense that this windiness has been changed.
Et est necesse, ut non appareant secundum hanc rationem in illis qui sunt deliciosi, et corporibus humidis, occultarum uenarum.	And it is necessary that they do not appear according to this reason in those who are delicate and have moist bodies with hidden veins.
Cum ergo uis curationem eius, et sentit patiens illud dolorem: tunc si est apparens tibi oculo, sicut diximus, tunc stringe supra ipsum, et sub ipso uelociter: et seca supra ipsum, donec egrediatur illa uentositas coartata: et cauteriza locum.	When you wish to treat it and the patient feels that pain: then if it appears to your eye, as we said, then bind above it quickly and beneath it swiftly: and cut above it until the swelling subsides: and cauterize the place.
Si autem non uides ipsum oculis tuis: tunc cura ipsum cum excussione corporis, et cum eo quod expellit uentositates, et carminat eas cum pillulis foetidis, et pillulis de serapino, et similibus.	But if you do not see it with your own eyes: then treat it by excision of the body and by that which drives out swellings, and expel them with fetid poultices and with poultices made from serapium and similar things.
¶ De extractione Sagittarum.	On the Extraction of Arrows.
Caput XCVI.	Chapter 96.
Sagittae diuersificantur secundum species suas, et secundum loca in quibus cadunt ex corpore.	Arrows are distinguished according to their kinds and according to the places where they fall from the body.
Earum uero diuersitas est: quoniam ex eis sunt quae habent cuspides magnos, et paruos: et concauae, et surdae.	And their diversity is this: because some of them have large points, and small; and hollow, and blunt.
Et ex eis sunt quae habent tres angulos.	And some of them have three angles.
Et ex eis quibus sunt linguae.	And some of them have tongues.
Et ex eis quibus sunt astellae.	And some of them have stars.
Illae uero quae sunt secundum membra in quibus cadunt, est secundum duos modos.	Those that fall according to the members are two-fold.
Aut enim membra sunt ex membris principalibus concauis, sicut cerebrum, et cor, et epar, et pulmo, et renes, et intestina, et uesica, et eis similia.	Or else the members are from the main concave members, such as the brain, and the heart, and the liver, and the lung, and the kidney, and the intestines, and the bladder, and those like them.
Quando ergo cadit in aliquo horum membrorum, et apparent tibi signa mortis, quae ego narro tibi post, tunc oportet ut deuites extractionem illius sagittae ex eis, nam mors consequitur illum in quo est, in pluribus dispositionibus.	When therefore it falls on one of these members and you see signs of death which I will tell you later, then it is necessary to remove the arrow from that member, for death follows him who has it in many situations.
Et quando non apparent tibi ista signa mala, et sagitta non est absconsa in profunditate membri, tunc extrahe ipsam, et cura uulnus.	And when you do not see those bad signs and the arrow is not hidden in the depth of the member, then remove it and treat the wound.
Ex signis enim cerebri quando cadit in eo sagitta, et penetrat os, et egreditur siphac quod est super cerebrum, est: quoniam accidunt ex illo soda uehemens, et scotomia, et uertigo, et rubedo in oculis, et inflatio, et rubedo linguae, et spasmus, et permixtio intellectus, et uomitus cholerae.	For the signs of the brain are: when an arrow falls on it and pierces the skull, and the siphac that is above the brain comes out; namely, because there occurs a sudden faintness, and dimness of vision, and vertigo, and redness in the eyes, and inflation, and redness of the tongue, and spasm, and a mixture of intellect, and vomiting of bile.
Et fortasse egreditur sanguis ex naribus, aut auribus.	And perhaps blood will flow from the nose, or ears.
Et fortasse abscinditur sermo, et destruitur uox.	And perhaps speech is cut off, and voice is destroyed.
Et egreditur ex loco uulneris humiditas alba similis pulti.	And moisture like whitewash comes out from the place of the wound.
Et exit ex eo simile aquositati carnis.	And pus like fatty meat juice flows out from it.
Si ergo apparent tibi ista signa, tunc abstine a curatione, et extrahe sagittam si non egreditur.	If then these signs appear to you, then refrain from treatment, and extract the arrow if there is no discharge.
Signa autem sagittae quando cadit in corde, sunt: quod ipsa est prope mammillam sinistram: et sentit cum ea quasi ipsa sit fixa in re dura, non in re uacua.	The signs of the arrow when it falls in the heart are: that it is near the left breast; and it feels as if it were fixed in a hard substance, not in an empty space.
Et fortasse sagittae est motus similis motui pulsus: et currit ex uulnere sanguis niger.	And perhaps the arrow's movement is similar to the pulse; and black blood flows from the wound.
Et sequitur illud frigus extremitatum, et sudor frigidus, et syncopis.	And then follows numbness in the extremities, and cold sweat, and fainting.
Scias ergo, quod mors descendit procul dubio.	Know therefore that death is surely approaching.
Et signum sagittae quando uulnerat pulmonem, est exitus sanguinis spumosi ex uulnere: et uasa quae sequuntur collum, apostematur, et mutatur color infirmi.	And the sign of the arrow when it wounds the lung is: that foam-like blood flows from the wound; and the vessels that follow the neck, become inflamed, and change color to a sickly hue.
Et expirat spiritum magnum, altum: et quaerit attractionem aeris frigidi.	And he expires with a great, deep breath; and seeks the support of cold air.
Quod si cadat sagitta in uelamen, quod est in pectore: tunc est prope costas paruas: et fit anhelitus magnus cum dolore uehementi, cum suspirio: et mouentur omnia membra humerorum.	Which if the arrow falls in the membrane that is in the chest: then it is near to the small ribs; and a great panting occurs with violent pain, with a sigh: and all the upper limb members are moved.
Et si cadat sagitta in stomachum, tunc fortasse egreditur ex uulnere ex cibo aliquid indigestum.	And if the arrow falls in the stomach, then perhaps something undigested from food will flow out from the wound.
Et si cadit sagitta in Ventrem, et figitur in eo: egreditur aliquid stercoris ex uulnere, aut zirbum, aut intestinum quod iam disruptum est.	And if the arrow falls into the Womb and is stuck there: something like dung will flow out from the wound, or a yellowish discharge, or an intestine that has already been torn.
Non est ergo spes in curatione eius, neque in extractione sagittae.	Therefore there is no hope for its cure, nor for extracting the arrow.
Quod si sagitta cadat in Vesicam, et egrediatur urina: et procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, et fortior sit dolor super infirmum: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	Which if the arrow falls into the Bladder and urine flows out: and something proceeds from it to the outside, and the pain is more severe over the sick person: then you will know that it is mortal.
Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.	The remaining limbs, such as the face, neck, and throat, and the scapula, and the assistant, and the thoracic vertebrae, and the cruris, and those similar to them from limbs are saluted according to many dispositions: when an arrow does not find an artery or a nerve; and it is not a poisonous arrow.
Et ego narro tibi quod uidi de esse harum sagittarum, ut significes per illud super curationem tuam.	And I will tell you what I saw to be about these arrows, so that you may signify it for your cure.
Quod est, quia cuidam uiro cecidit sagitta in lachrymali oculi eius, in radice nasi.	What is this? Because a certain man had an arrow fall into the root of his nose and the lacrimal gland of his eye.
Extraxi ergo eam ipsi ex parte altera, sub adipe auris eius: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei in oculo eius nocumentum.	I therefore removed it from him on the other side, under his ear fat; and he was healed, and no harm befell his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam Iudaeo, quae cecidit ei in adipe oculi sui sub palpebra inferiori: et sagitta iam occultata erat, et non consecutus sum ex ea nisi extremitatem paruam eius, cum qua adhaeret in ligno suo: et erat sagitta magna ex sagittis arcuum Turcorum, cum ferro leni, in qua non sunt aures.	And I removed another arrow from a Jew, which had fallen into the fatty part of his eye below the lower eyelid; and the arrow was already hidden, and I did not manage to remove anything from it except for its small tip with which it was stuck in its wood: and the arrow was a large one from the bows of the Turks, with a gentle iron, without ears.
Sanatus est ergo Iudaeus, et non accidit in oculo eius accidens malum.	And therefore the Jew was healed, and no evil befell his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam ex gutture Christiani.	And I removed another arrow from a Christian's throat.
Et erat sagitta arabica, et est illa cui sunt aures.	And the arrow was Arab, and it is that one with ears.
Secui ergo super ipsam inter duas guidegi: et iam submersa erat in gutture eius.	So I followed above it between two gullet-ribs; and already it was submerged in his throat.
Subtiliatus sum ergo cum ea, donec extraxi eam: et sanatus est Christianus.	I therefore worked carefully with it until I removed it: and the Christian was healed.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam uiro quae ceciderat in uentre eius: et cogitauimus, quia moreretur ex ea.	And I removed another arrow from a man who had fallen into his belly; and we thought that he would die from it.
Postquam ergo praeterierunt ei triginta dies, et non mutatum est super eum aliquid ex dispositionibus eius, secui super sagittam: et ingeniaui super eam, et extraxi eam: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei accidens malum.	Afterwards, then, thirty days had passed for him and nothing had changed in his condition; I followed above the arrow: and I worked carefully on it, and removed it: and he was healed, and no evil befell him.
Et uidi uirum cui cecidit sagitta in dorso eius, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam.	And I saw a man whose arrow had fallen on his back, and the wound had been closed over it.
Postquam ergo fuit post septem annos, exiuit sagitta in radice coxae eius.	Afterwards, therefore, seven years having passed, the arrow was discharged from its root in his hip joint.
Et uidi mulierem cui cecidit in uentre suo sagitta, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam, et remansit sagitta intra ipsam: et non mutata est ex dispositionibus eius aliqua, et mulier non inuenit ei nocumentum in aliqua ex operationibus suis naturalibus.	And I saw a woman whose arrow had fallen into her womb, and the wound was closed over it, and the arrow remained within her; and nothing of her physical functions was changed, and the woman did not find any harm in her natural bodily processes.
Et uidi uirum alium, cui cecidit sagitta in facie sua: et consolidatum est uulnus, et remansit, non inueniens ei multum dolorem: et similia istis multa.	And I saw another man whose arrow had fallen on his face; and the wound was closed, and it remained without causing him much pain; and similar things are numerous.
Et extraxi sagittam uiro ex principibus Regis, quae ceciderat ei in medio nasi sui, et iam declinauerat ad partem dextram parumper: et occultata erat sagitta tota.	And I extracted the arrow from a man who was one of the king's chief men, which had fallen into his nose and had already begun to incline towards the right side; and the arrow was entirely concealed.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius post casum sagittae usque ad tres dies.	I was therefore summoned for his treatment after the arrow's fall, until three days had passed.
Inueni ergo uulnus sagittae strictum ualde.	I found then the wound of the arrow to be very tightly bound.
Inquisiui ergo eam cum tenta subtili, et non sensi eam: et ipse quidem inueniebat punctionem et dolorem sub aure sua ex parte dextra.	I therefore questioned him with a fine probe, and did not feel it; but he himself found a puncture and pain under his ear on the right side.
Speraui ergo, quod erat illa punctio ex extremitate sagittae.	I therefore hoped that that puncture was from the end of the arrow.
Emplastraui ergo locum cum emplastro in quo erat uirtus attractiua, et digestiua, confidens apud me, quod apostemaretur locus, et appareret mihi signum sagittae, ut secarem super eam: et non accidit in loco accidens significans quod sagitta consecuta sit locum.	I therefore applied a dressing to the place with a dressing that had drawing and digestive power, trusting in myself that the place would suppurate and I would see a sign of the arrow appearing for me to cut above it; and nothing happened in the place that would indicate that the arrow had reached there.
Assiduaui ergo cum emplastro super eum diebus multis: et non accidit accidens, et consolidatum est uulnus interim: et remansit infirmus de extractione eius spacio dierum, donec sensit sagittam die quodam intra nasum suum.	I therefore applied the dressing to him day after day for many days; and nothing happened, and the wound was closed in the meantime: and he remained weak from its extraction for a space of days, until one day he felt the arrow inside his nose.
Et narrauit mihi illud.	And he told me this.
Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno.	So I put a sharp and corroding medicine on it for many days until it was opened; and when I probed it gently, and felt the tip of the arrow subtly attached to the wood.
Deinde addidi in apertione uulneris per illam medicinam acutam, donec apparuit nobis uisibiliter extremitas sagittae: et praeteriit mihi cum eo spacium temporis circiter quatuor menses.	Then I added to the opening of the wound with that sharp medicine until the tip of the arrow appeared visibly to us; and after this time, a period of about four months passed.
Deinde postquam amplificatum est uulnus, et possible fuit mihi intromittere forcipes in ipsam, et mouere ipsam, et non obediuit ad exitum: tunc non cessaui subtiliare, et ingeniare super eam cum modis ingeniorum, donec coepi super eam die quodam cum forcipibus decenter factis, secundum quod ueniet forma eorum in fine capituli, donec extraxi eam.	Then after the wound had been enlarged and it was possible for me to insert a forceps into it and move it, but it did not yield to exit: then I did not cease to subtilize and engineer over it with various methods, until on a certain day I extracted it with well-made forceps, according to their shape at the end of the chapter.
Deinde restauraui uulnus.	Then I restored the wound.
Et medici quidem iudicant, quod cartilago nasi non restauratur.	And doctors indeed judge that the nasal cartilage is not restored.
Restauraui ergo ipsam, et consolidatum est uulnus, et sanatus est infirmas sanitate integra: nec nocuit ei aliquid omnino.	So I restored it and the wound was consolidated and the patient recovered with entire health, nor did anything harm him at all.
Et ego narro tibi qualitatem extractionis quarundam sagittarum: ut ponas illud regulam et significationem super illud quod non dixi.	And I tell you the quality of extracting some arrows: so that you may put it as a rule and signification for what I did not say.
Quoniam partes huius artis et distinctiones earum non comprehenduntur cum narratione: neque comprehendit illud liber, et artifex prudens comparat cum pauco super multum: et cum eo quod est paesens, super illud quod est absens: et inuenit operationem nouam, et instrumentum nouum apud descensus rerum extranearum huius artis quando accidunt.	Because the parts and distinctions of this art are not comprehended by narration: nor does that book comprehend it, and a wise craftsman compares little with much: and with what is present, about what is absent: and he finds a new operation and a new instrument in the descents of external things of this art when they occur.
Dico ergo, quod sagittae non egrediuntur ex membris quibus sunt fixae, nisi secundum duos modos.	I say that arrows do not exit from the members in which they are fixed, unless according to two modes.
Aut per attractionem ex loco ex quo intrauit.	Or by attraction from the place where it entered.
Aut contrario partis alterius.	Or by the contrary part of the other side.
Et illa quae egreditur unde intrauit, aut est sagitta procedens in loco carnoso: et attrahitur, et egreditur.	And that which exits from where it entered is either an arrow proceeding into a fleshy place and is attracted and exits.
Quod si non obedit ad exitum ex hora in qua cadit: tunc oportet ut dimittas ipsam aliquot diebus, donec putrefiat caro quae est in circumitu eius: et alleuietur attractio eius, et eius egressio.	If it does not obey the exit at the hour when it falls: then it is necessary to release it some days until the flesh surrounding it becomes rotten: and let its attraction and egress be eased.
Et similiter si figitur in osse, et non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc dimitte ipsam etiam aliquot diebus: et itera eam cum attractione et motione omni die, donec egreditur.	And similarly, if it is stuck in bone and does not obey you at the exit, then release it also some days: and repeat it with attraction and motion every day, until it exits.
Quod si non obedit tibi ad exitum post dies, tunc oportet ut perfores in circumitu sagittae in ipso osse ab omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificentur sagittae.	If it does not obey you at the exit after days, then it is necessary to pierce in the surrounding bone with a fine awl from all sides, until the splinters are widened.
Deinde attrahe eam, et extrahe ipsam.	Then draw it out and extract it.
Si autem sagitta est fixa in capitis osse, et iam processit in uno uentrium cerebri, et apparent ex infirmo quaedam illorum accidentium quae dixi: tunc abstine ab attractione sagittae, et dimitte eam, donec aequetur esse eius post dies.	But if the arrow is fixed in the skull bone and has already entered one of the cerebral ventricles, and some of those symptoms I mentioned appear from the patient: then abstain from drawing out the arrow and release it, until its aftermath subsides after days.
Nam si sagitta peruenit ad sifach, tunc mors non prolongatur ei.	For if the arrow reaches the sifach, then death is not prolonged for him.
Et si sagitta non est fixa, nisi in corpore ossis tantum, et non penetrat usque ad sifach: et remanet infirmus aliquot diebus, et non accidit ei ex illis accidentibus aliquid: tunc ingenia in attractione sagittae et extractione eius.	And if the arrow is not fixed except in the body of bone only and does not penetrate as far as the sifach, and the patient remains weak for some days and nothing from those accidents happens to him: then attempt at drawing out the arrow and extracting it.
Si autem est fixa ualde, et non obedit tibi ad attractionem: tunc administra terebella in circumitu sagittae, sicut narraui tibl: deinde cura locum, donec sanetur.	But if it is fixed very firmly and does not obey you at the drawing out: then apply a file to the surrounding area of the arrow, as I told you before: then take care of the wound, until it heals.
Si autem Sagitta iam absconsa est in loco corporis, et occultatur et absconditur a sensu: tunc inquire eam cum tenta.	But if the arrow is already concealed in the body and hidden from sense perception: then search for it with probes.
Si autem sentis eam, tunc attrahe eam cum quibusdam instrumentis quae conueniunt attractioni eius.	But if you feel it, then draw it out with certain instruments that are suitable for drawing it out.
Si autem non potes super eam, propter constrictionem uulneris, et propter longitudinem sagittae in profundo: et non est illic os, neque neruus, neque uena: tunc finde super eam, donec amplificetur uulnus, et sit possibile extrahere sagittam.	But if you cannot pull it out over it, due to the constriction of the wound and the length of the arrow deep inside: and there is no bone, nor nerve, nor vein nearby: then find a way over it, until the wound opens up and it becomes possible to extract the arrow.
Quod si sunt ei aures quibus teneatur, tunc libera carnem fixam in eis ab omni parte, omni ingenio quo potes illud, et ingenia, si non potest super euasionem carnis in fractura aurium, et contorsione earum, donec euadat.	If the patient has ears that are affected, then free the fixed flesh from all parts of those ears, by any means you can manage to do so, and if it is not possible to lift the flesh above the breaking point of the ears and their twisting until it goes away.
Et tu quando administras extractionem Sagittae, in quocumque loco est, tunc utere contorsione manus tuae, cum forficibus ad partes omnes, donec facias eam euadere: et subtilia ultima subtilitate, ut non frangatur Sagita, et fiat difficilis tibi attractio eius, et ipsius extractio.	And when you are extracting the arrow, wherever it is located, then use a twisting motion with your hand and forceps to all parts until it comes out: and with very fine subtlety, so that the arrow does not break and its extraction becomes difficult for you.
Quod si non potes super eam ex hora una, tunc dimitte eam diebus aliquot, donec putrefiant quae sunt in circumitu eius.	If you cannot extract it within an hour, then leave it for a few days until the decayed matter surrounding it has rotted.
Deinde itera eam: alleuietur enim tuncia Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra quod diximus ex curatione in capitulo suo: et custodi uirtutem tuam ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, aut chordae.	Then reiterate the extraction: for it will be relieved by means of a poultice. If, however, it causes bleeding contrary to your expectation, then administer what we have said in its own chapter: and preserve your strength from incision of the vein, nerve, or cord.
Et administra ingenium omni modo quo tibi possibile est euasionis Sagittae: et sit illud cum facilitate, et tranquillitate, uel tarditate, et firmitate, sicut narraui tibi.	And administer your skill in any way possible for the extraction of the arrow: and let it be with ease, and quietness, or slowness, and firmness, as I have told you.
Et oportet, ut facias cum trahis Sagittam, ut infirmus sit secundum figuram, secundum quam fuit apud casum Sagittae in ipso.	And it is necessary that you make the arrow pull weakly as if an invalid was pulling, according to the shape and form of how the arrow was situated at the moment of its being shot.
Quoniam est magis iuuatiuum.	Because it is more beneficial.
Si autem non est tibi possibile illud, tunc administra quod tibi est possibile ex figuris.	If however it is not possible for you to do that, then administer what is possible for you according to the shapes.
Sagitta autem quae egreditur ex contrario partis alterius, aut iam procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora: aut facit gibbositatem extremitas Sagittae per sensum ex superiore parte cutis propinquae, et uides eam eminentem: seca ergo super eam, et sit sectio secundum quantitatem quod capiant in ea forcipes.	However, if the arrow emerges from the opposite part of the other side, or already something has proceeded from it to the outside, or the extremity of the arrow makes a swelling at the sense through the upper part of the nearby skin, and you see it protruding: then cut above it, and let the incision be according to the quantity that the forceps can hold in it.
Deinde attrahe eam: ipsa namque fit facilis ad exitum.	Then draw it out; for it becomes easy to exit.
Si uero retinetur in osse, tunc torque manum tuam secundum rotunditatem, donec imprimat Sagitta in osse, et amplificet sibiipsi: deinde trahe ipsam.	If it is retained in the bone, then twist your hand according to the roundness, until the arrow impresses on the bone and makes itself larger: then draw it out.
Et si non: dimitte eam diebus aliquot: deinde itera eam, donec egrediatur.	And if not: leave it for a few days: then repeat it until it comes out.
Quod si lignum Sagittae est in ea, tunc impelle ipsam cum eo.	If the arrow is stuck in her, then push her with it.
Si autem cecidit lignum, et uis administrare impulsionem: tunc intromitte ad eam instrumentum concauum, ut ingrediatur concauitas eius in caudam Sagittae: deinde impelle eam cum ipso.	But if the wood has fallen and you wish to administer a push: then introduce into her a concave instrument, so that it enters the hollow of her backside into the arrow; then push her with it.
Si autem Sagita est concaua, tunc impelle eam cum instrumento intrante in ipsam.	But if the arrow is hollow, then push her with the instrument entering into it.
Sagitta enim alleuiatur per illud.	For the arrow is eased by that.
Quod si Sagitta est toxicata, tunc oportet, ut concaues carnem totam, in qua est uenenum: si est tibi possibile illud.	Since if the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary to remove the flesh entirely, where the venom is, if that is possible for you.
Deinde cura eam cum eo quod conuenit ad illud.	Then take care of her with what is fitting for that.
Quod si Sagitta est cadens in pectore, aut in uentre, aut in uesica, aut in latere: et est propinqua ex eo quod tangis cum tenta, et possibile est tibi secare super eam: tunc seca, et caue ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, et extrahe eam.	Since if the arrow is falling in the chest, or in the belly, or in the spleen, or on the side: and it is close to what you touch with your probe, and it is possible for you to cut above it: then cut, and beware of cutting into a vein, or nerve, and draw her out.
Deinde sue uulnus, si uides, et cura illud, donec sanetur.	Then clean the wound, if you see it, and take care of it until it heals.
Et haec est forma Forcipum, quibus extrahuntur Sagittae.	And this is the shape of forceps by which arrows are drawn out.
Sint extremitates similes rostro auis, quae factae sunt sicut ferra: quando capiunt super Sagittam, non dimittunt eam.	Let the extremities be like the beak of a bird, which are made of iron: when they take hold above the arrow, they do not let it go.
Et fiunt ex eis species multae, magnae, et paruae, et mediae, secundum quantitatem magnitudinis Sagittae, et paruitatis eius, et amplitudinis uulneris, et constrictionis eius.	And they are made in many forms, great and small and medium-sized, according to the size of the arrow, its length, and the magnitude of the wound, and its constriction.
Forma Impellentis concaui.	The shape of a concave impeller.
Et forma Impellentis surdi.	And the shape of a deaf impeller.
Hoc est surdae extremitatis sicut Radius, ut alleuietur introitus eius in sagittam concauam, et impellatur cum eo.	This is the form of the deaf extremity like a radius, so that its entrance may be opened into a concave arrow, and impelled with it.
Huius extremitas impellentis concauae est concaua sicut penna auis: ut alleuietur introitus sagittae in ipsam et impulsio eius.	The extremity of the concave impeller is concave like a bird's wing: so that the entrance of the arrow may be opened into it and its impulse.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum.	Chapter on venesection of veins.
Caput XCVII.	Head ninety-seven.
Uenae phlebotomandae, quarum cucurrit consuetudo in corpore, sunt triginta.	The veins that are accustomed to being cut in the body are thirty.
Ex quibus in capite sunt sexdecim: duae Venae pulsatiles, quae sunt post aures, dictae duae Herbae: et duae Arteriae, quae sunt in duobus timporibus apparentes: et duae Venae quae sunt in duobus lachrymalibus duorum oculorum, quae dicuntur Aspicientes: et Vena praeparata in medio frontis: et uena quae est in extremitate nasi.	Of which sixteen are in the head: two pulsating veins that are behind the ears and are called two Herbae; and two arteries that appear in both temples; and two veins that are in both tear ducts of the two eyes, which are called Aspicientes; and a prepared vein in the middle of the forehead; and a vein that is at the tip of the nose.
Et duae Guidegi, quae sunt in collo.	And two Guidigi that are in the neck.
Et duae uenae quae sunt in labio superiore oris.	And two veins that are on the upper lip of the mouth.

Et duae uenae quae sunt sub lingua.	And two veins that are under the tongue.
Venae autem quae phlebotomantur in brachiis, sunt quinque uenae in omni brachio.	However, the veins that are cut in the arms are five in each arm.
Vna earum est Cephalica, et est ex latere syluestri: et nominat eam uulgus uenam capitis.	One of them is Cephalica, and it is from the outer side of the shoulder: and the people call it the vein of the head.
Et Fusca.	And Fusca.
Et est Media uena, et est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae: et nominat eam uulgus uenam corporis.	And it is the Median vein, and it is composed of a branch of the Basilic and a branch of the Cephalic: and the people call it the vein of the body.

Et nominat eam uulgus uenam uentris.	And it is called by the common people a "vein" of the belly.
Et Funis brachii, et est posita super focile: et est illa in qua phlebotomatur, et est illa quae apparet supra pollicem appatitione manifesta.	And it is called the arm cord, and it is placed above the elbow: and it is that one in which blood-letting is done, and it is that one which appears above the wrist with a clear indication.
Et Saluatella: et est uena quae est inter annularem et minimum: et sunt ei duo rami.	And Salvatella: and it is a vein that is between the ring finger and the smallest [finger]: and it has two branches.
Et in crure et in pede sunt tres uenae.	And there are three veins in the leg and foot.
Vna earum est quae est sub pollicis curuatura ex latere syluestri.	One of them is which is located beneath the curvature of the thumb on the outer side.
Et secunda est Saphena: et locus eius est apud calcaneum ex latere domestico.	And the second one is Saphena: and its location is at the heel from the inner side.
Et uena Nesse: et locus eius est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	And the vein of Ness: and its location is at the heel from the outer side.
Et in crure alio sunt tres uenae similes illis.	And on the other leg there are three veins similar to those.
¶ De phlebotomia duarum uenarum post Aures.	On bloodletting of two veins after the ears.
Phlebotomiae uero duarum uenarum quae sunt post Aures, iuuamentum est ad catarros antiquos, et hemigraneam, et sahafati, et ulcera capitis mala antiqua.	The bloodletting of two veins which are after the ears is beneficial for old catarrhs, and headaches, and sahafati, and bad old head sores.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eam est secundum quod narro.	And the quality of bloodletting on it is according to what I say.
Et est, ut radatur caput infirmi: et fricetur occipitium eius in loco duarum uenarum cum panno aspero fricatione bona.	And it is that the head of the sick person is shaved: and his occiput is rubbed with a rough cloth on the spot of the two veins with good friction.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum cum uitta, donec appareant duae uenae.	Then the sick person should bind his neck with a cord until the two veins appear.
Et loca earum sunt post Aures in duobus locis depressis capitis.	And their locations are after the ears in two depressed places on the head.
Quaere ergo eas digito tuo, et ubi sentis pulsum earum sub digito tuo, illic signa cum encaustro.	Therefore search for them with your finger and where you feel their pulse under your finger, mark it with encaustic.
Deinde accipe phlebotomum cultellarem, et est ille qui dicitur Incidens.	Then take the bloodletting knife, which is called "Incidens".
Deinde intromitte ipsum sub uena in cute, donec perueniat phlebotomus ad os.	Then introduce it under the vein in the skin, until the bloodletting reaches the mouth.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum uena et cute ad superiora, et incide uenam cum cute incisione incidente.	Then elevate your hand with the vein and skin towards the upper part, and cut the vein with a skin incision that meets it.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quantitas duorum digitorum iunctorum, aut circiter illud: et fac exire ex sanguine quantum uis.	And let the length of the incision be equal to the distance between two joined fingers, or roughly that, and make as much blood flow out as you like.
Deinde stringe eam cum puluillis, et dimitte eam, donec sanetur.	Then tie it with ligatures, and let it be, until it heals.
Et iam praecessit in principio libri incisio earum, et ipsarum cauterizatio.	And now precedes in the beginning of the book, the cutting of those and their cauterization.
¶ De phlebotomia duarum Arteriarum in timporibus.	Of Phlebotomy of Two Arteries at Different Times.
Duarum uero Arteriarum quae sunt in duobus timporibus phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad hemigraneam antiquam: et sodam prauam, et obtalmiam assiduam: et cursum superfluitatum effusarum acutarum ad oculos.	The benefit of the two arteries which are in two phases of phlebotomy is against an old headache, and a bad fever, and a persistent eye disease; and to remove the course of overflowing and sharp fluids to the eyes.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est secundum quod narro tibi.	And the quality of phlebotomy for them is according to what I will tell you.
Stringat infirmus collum suum multum, donec appareant duae uenae sensui apparitione manifesta: et demonstretur pulsus earum sub digito tuo.	A weak person should tighten his neck a great deal, until the two veins become clearly visible to the sense; and it should be shown that their pulse beats under your finger.
Tunc enim signa cum encaustro.	Then mark with encaustic.
Deinde eleua cutem desuper uenam ad superiora cum digito tuo indice, et intromitte phlebotomum incidentem desubtus, et eleua uenam ad superiora.	Then elevate the skin above the vein towards the upper part with your finger as a guide, and insert the phlebotomy instrument below, and elevate the vein towards the upper part.
Et incide eam, sicut fecisti in duabus uenis aliis: et fac currere ex sanguine secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	And cut it as you did with the two other veins, and make flow from the blood according to the quantity of your need.
Deinde solue coartationem infirmi, et pone digitum tuum super uenam hora una.	Then loosen the constriction of the patient, and place your finger on top of the vein for one hour.
Postea pone super ipsam cotum et puluillos, et stringe ipsum desuper constrictione forti: et dimitte ipsam, donec sanetur.	Afterward place a cauter and ligatures on top of it, and tie it securely with strong constriction; and let it be, until it heals.
Et iam praecessit rememoratio earum, et ipsarum incisio, et earum extractio in principio libri.	And now precedes the reminder of those, and their incision, and their extraction at the beginning of the book.

Deinde solue perforationem infirmi, et stringe eam, donec sanetur.	Then loosen the puncture of the sick person, and bind it until he is healed.
Et quandoque aperitur cum phlebotomo lato.	And sometimes it opens with a broad blood-letting.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut sit phlebotomus acutae extremitatis, sicut reliqui phlebotomi, imo sit latae extremitatis.	However, it is not necessary for the blood-letting to be sharp at its end, like the other blood-lettings, but rather broad.
Et phlebotoma eam secundum transuersionem: quoniam os est propinquum: et fortasse in eo frangetur phlebotomus quando est subtilis.	And perform the blood-letting according to the passage: since it is near the opening: and perhaps the blood-letting will be broken when it is thin.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum in duobus Lachrymalibus.	About the blood-letting of veins in two tear ducts.

¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Nasi.	On the Bleeding of Veins of the Nose.
Venae autem Nasi phlebotomia, est conferens ad febrem acutam, et sodam uehementem, et aegritudines faciei, sicut hemigraneam, et rubedinem quae accidit in facie: praecipue quando est antiqua.	The bleeding of the nose's veins is useful against acute fever and violent headache, and troubles of the face, such as hemi-granum and redness which occurs on the face, especially when it is old.

Then take the nose of that person with your left hand and receive a thin, long bleeding; and insert it into the middle of the hare itself, between what separates the nose according to straightness.
Quoniam uena non apparet sensui illic, et quia sanguis incipit fluere statim.	Because the vein does not appear to the sense there, and because the blood begins to flow immediately.
Et oportet, ut ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo parumper: et facias currere ex sanguine secundum necessitatem tuam.	And it is necessary for you to hold your hand with the bleeding a little while and make blood flow according to your need.
Deinde liga ipsam nocte una.	Then bind it at night once.
Ipsa enim restauratur uelociter.	For it is restored quickly itself.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Guidegi.	On the Bleeding of Veins of the Gullet.
Duarum uero Guidegi phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad constrictionem anhelitus, et incaeptionem leprae, et aegritudines melancholicas, et impetiginem et ulcera mala, et corrodentibus, id est, herpetibus estiomenis.	The benefit of the two Guidegi bleedings is for constriction of breathing, and onset of leprosy, and melancholic troubles, and impetigo and bad ulcers, and corroding sores, that is, herpes-like sores.

¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Algeberich.	A section on bloodletting of veins by Algeberich.
Venae autem Algeberich phlebotomiae iuuamentum est: quia confert ad alcolam in ore, et corruptionem gingiuae: et ulcera mala: et fissuras labiorum, et ulcera mala, etiam quae sunt in naso, et in circumitu eius.	The veins of Algeberich are the seat of bloodletting because they conduce to the mouth and the corruption of gums; and bad ulcers; and fissures of lips; and also bad ulcers which are on the nose, and around its circumference.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est, ut facias sedere infirmum coram te: et stringe collum eius cum uitta.	And the quality of bloodletting from them is that you make the patient sit before you and tie his neck with a cloth.
Deinde reuolue labium eius, et aspice ad duas uenas: quarum una est a dextera labii, et secunda a sinistra eius: et demonstratio utriusque est per nigredinem ambarum.	Then turn back his lip and look at the two veins: one is on the right side of the lip, and the second on the left side of it; and the indication of each is by the discoloration of both.
Et illud uerum est: quia in circumitu earum sunt uenae minutae, nigrae.	And that is true: because around them are small dark veins.
Incide ergo utramque incisione incidente.	Therefore cut both with a cutting cut.
Si autem dubitatio est super te, et non scis quae earum est: tunc intende ad incisionem maioris earum, et ipsarum manifestiorem.	But if you are in doubt and do not know which one it is: then direct your cut to the larger of the two and the more obvious one.
Et similiter fac de duabus uenis quae sunt in labio superiore: et plurimum quidem currit consuetudo cum eo: et incide duas uenas quae sunt in labio inferiori.	And similarly do the same with the two veins that are on the upper lip: and indeed custom goes along with this; and cut the two veins that are on the lower lip.
¶ De phlebotomia Venae sub lingua post Cephalicae phlebotomiam.	A section on bloodletting of the vein under the tongue after cephalic bloodletting.
Duarum uero Venarum quae sunt sub lingua phlebotomiae iuuamentum: est, quod phlebotomia Cephalicae est ad praefocationes quae sunt in gutture, et aegritudinem uuulae, et aegritudines oris.	The two veins that are under the tongue are the seat of bloodletting: because cephalic bloodletting is for obstructions that are in the throat, and trouble of the uvula, and troubles of the mouth.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est, ut sedeat infirmus inter manus tuas coram sole: et eleualinguam eius, et aspice sub lingua a latere eius uno uenam, et a latere eius alio uenam: et color utriusque decliuis ad nigredinem.	And the quality of bloodletting from them is that the patient sits between your hands before the sun: and raise his tongue, and look under his tongue at one side for one vein, and on the other side for another vein: and the color of each is declining to blackness.
Phlebotoma ergo utramque: et custodi, ne ultimes manum tuam in phlebotomando eas.	Letting blood then on both sides: and taking care not to put your hand too far in when letting it.
Nam sub eius sunt arteriae, et fortasse accidet fluxus sanguinis ex illis arteriis.	For under his skin are the arteries, and perhaps a flow of blood may occur from those arteries.
¶ De tribus Venis in cubito.	On the three veins in the arm.
Venae autem tres quae phlebotomantur in cubito, sunt in quarum phlebotomia cucurrit consuetudo in omnibus hominibus.	The three veins that are let out on the arm are those whose letting is a customary practice with all men.
Et phlebotomia earum fit secundum duos modos.	And the letting of blood from them is done in two ways.
Aut pungendo cum phlebotomo myrtino lato: aut oliuari ad subtilitatem decliui: aut secando cum phlebotomo cultellari, et est Alnesil.	Either by pricking with a myrtle-leaf phlebotomist; or to incline towards fineness with olive oil; or by cutting with a cullery phlebotomist, and it is called Alnesil.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Sic Alnesil est, quod conuenit ad sectionem.	Thus Alnesil is what is suitable for cutting.
Et ex eis sunt species latae, et subtiles secundum amplitudinem uenarum et stricturam earum Forma phlebotomi myrtini sit lata, sicut uides.	And from these there are broad and fine kinds according to the width and constriction of the veins. The form of the myrtle leaf phlebotomist is broad, as you see.
Et conuenit ad aperiendas uenas concauas, plenas, procedentes, apparentes, grossas, et illas quae continent sanguinem grossum, turbidum.	And it is suitable for opening up concave veins that are full, swelling, swollen, apparent, thick, and those that contain thick, turbid blood.
Et iste phlebotomus est minoris latitudinis, et subtilioris extreminatis.	And this phlebotomist is of smaller width and finer at the extremities.
Et conuenit ad phlebotomiam uenarum subtilium, quae continent sanguinem subtilem citrinum	And it is suitable for letting blood from fine veins that contain subtle yellowish blood.
¶ De phlebotomia Basilicae.	On the Basilic vein.
Basilicae autem quae est una harum trium uenarum phlebotomiae iuuamentum est.	The Basilic, which is one of those three veins whose letting is a benefit.
Quia extrahit sanguinem ex aegritudinibus, quae sunt sub gutture et collo, ex eo quod sequitur pectus, et uentrem: et conuenit phlebotomatori cum phlebotomat eam, ut caueat, et sit super timorem ex ea nam sub ea est arteria.	Because it draws out blood from afflictions that are under the throat and neck, following from the chest and belly; and it is suitable for a phlebotomist to beware of it and be on guard against it, because there is an artery underneath.
Si ergo errat, et addit in punctura phlebotomi, incidet illam arteriam, et accidet fluxus sanguinis.	If therefore the phlebotomist makes a mistake and adds to the incision, he will cut into that artery and a flow of blood will occur.
Quapropter oportet, ne phlebotomet eam cum phlebotomo pungente: imo sit secans cum Alnesil.	Therefore it is necessary not to let a blood-letter bleed her with a bleeding instrument. Instead, let him cut with Alnesil.
Quod si non apparet Basilica apparitione manifesta, tunc oportet, ut alienes ipsam, et permuteris ad aliam, aut quaeras aliquem ramum eius: aut phlebotomes loco eius Funem brachii.	If the basilisk does not appear in a manifest apparition, then it is necessary to have someone else touch her or to exchange with another or seek out a branch of hers. Or, you should find a blood-letter in her place and tie the cord of her arm.
Ipsa enim est manifesta, et seca eam cum phlebotomo Anesil, sicut diximus.	For she is indeed manifest, and cut her with a bleeding instrument made of Alnesil, just as we said.
Si autem uis phlebotomiam ipsius eiusdem, tunc oportet ante stricturam brachii, ut tangas locum, donec cognoscas locum pulsus.	But if you wish to perform a blood-letting on her own self, then it is necessary before making the incision in the arm, that you touch the place until you recognize the place of the pulse.
Deinde signa super locum cum encaustro, postea brachium, et seca uenam sectione concaua cum phlebotomo Alnesil, sicut diximus.	Then mark the spot with encaustic, afterwards the arm, and cut the vein in a concave section with a bleeding instrument made of Alnesil, just as we said.
Et caue ne cadat percussio per spacium a loco arteriae.	And beware that the blow does not fall through an interval to the place of the artery.
Et quando uides, cum tu stringis ligamen, inflationem in loco quem signasti cum encaustro, tunc illa inflatio est inflatio arteriae: deuita ergo eam.	And when you see that as you are binding the bandage, there is swelling in the place which you marked with encaustic, then that swelling is the swelling of an artery; therefore avoid it.
Quod si uides sanguinem apud phlebotomiam salire, sicut urina pueri, et est sanguis subtilis, rubeus: tunc scias, quia est ex sanguine arteriae.	What if you see blood rising in the phlebotomy, like a child's urine, and it is fine, red blood; then you will know that it is from an arterial blood.
Tunc ergo propera, et pone digitum tuum super ipsum spacio longo, deinde aufer digitum tuum.	Then therefore hasten and put your finger on the same space for a long time, then withdraw your finger.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis (multotiens namque abscinditur) tunc stringe brachium, et dimitte ipsum: et caueat infirmus a motione eius: et sit super timorem eius.	If therefore the blood is cut off (for it is often cut off) then bind the arm and let it go, and beware that the patient may be injured by its movement, and let it be on his guard against fear.
Et non moueat ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	And do not move him for several days until he is healed.
Si autem non abscinditur sanguis, et uincit te: et non est tibi praesens in momento tuo medicina, tunc incide arteriam, si apparet tibi.	But if the blood does not flow and conquers you, and medicine is not present to you at the moment, then cut the artery if it appears to you.
Nam extremitates eius contrahuntur, et abscinditur sanguis.	For its extremities are contracted, and blood is severed.
Aut accipe corticem fistici, et finde eum: accipe medietatem unam, et stringe eam super locum uenae strictura decenti, cum ligamento et puluillis usque ad diem alium.	Or take the skin of the suture and cut it; take one middle part and bind it above the place of the vein constriction fittingly, with a ligament and fluffing up to another day.
Tunc si abscinditur sanguis, est bonum.	Then if blood is severed, it is good.
Et si non: tunc cura ipsum cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio ex loco puluerum abscindentium fluxum sanguinis: et abscisio sanguinis eius non est difficilis in pluribus dispositionibus, propter locum paruum uulneris, et possibilitatem ligamenti ex brachio.	And if not: then treat it with the one who was previously mentioned, from the place of powdering off blood flow: and severance of his blood is not difficult in many arrangements, due to the smallness of the wound and the possibility of binding on the arm.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae Fuscae.	On Bloodletting from the Black Vein.
Venae autem Fuscae phlebotomiae iuuamentum est, quod trahit sanguinem ex superiori parte capitis, et inferiore corporis: propterea, quia est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae, sicut diximus.	However, the Black Vein is beneficial for bloodletting because it draws blood from the upper part of the head and lower part of the body: therefore, since it is composed of a branch of the Basilic vein and a branch of the Cephalic vein, as we said.
Et conuenit phlebotomanti eam, ut sit super timorem ex phlebotomia eius, nam sub ea est neruus.	And it is suitable for bloodletting to be done above the fear of its own bloodletting, because beneath it is a nerve.
Si ergo addit in punctura phlebotomi, et inuenit neruum, accidit in ea stupor, et difficilis fit sanatio eius, et fortasse non sanatur penitus.	Therefore, if you add to the incision of bloodletting and find a nerve, it happens that one becomes numb, and healing becomes difficult for it, and perhaps it does not heal at all.
Et iste neruus multotiens apparet sensui.	And this nerve is often perceived by the senses.
Si autem occultatur in quibusdam hominibus, et est subtilis, et non ostenditur: tunc oportet ut ponas phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas, sectionem cum Alnesil, et deuita neruum cum fortitudine tua.	But if it is hidden in some people, and is subtle, and does not show itself: then it is necessary for you to place your bloodletting such that you may reach the vein, with a section using Alnasil, and remove the nerve with your own strength.
Quod si uena est inter duos neruos, tunc finde uenam in longitudine.	If the vein is between two nerves, then find the vein in length.
¶ De uena Cephalica.	On the Cephalic Vein.
Phlebotomiae autem uenae Cephalicae iuuamentum est, quia attrahit sanguinem ex capite, et confert ad aegritudines oculorum.	The benefit of bloodletting from the Cephalic Vein is that it attracts blood from the head and relieves eye ailments.
Et oportet in hac uena proprie, si uis, ut phlebotomes eam pungendo cum phlebotomo oliuari, aut cum phlebotomo myrtino: quoniam est saluior uenarum omnium, quoniam non est subea arteria, neque neruus.	And it is necessary in this vein properly, if you wish, to puncture it with a lancet of olive oil or with a lancet of myrtle: because it is the most healthy of all veins, since there is no artery underneath nor nerve.
Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.	However, it is fitting for you during venesection that you should first uncover with the lancet just enough of the tip of the wrist and then look for a more gentle place: and it does not harm him if he is not found on the first strike, but rather it may be repeated several times over that place with venesection.
Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.	However, perhaps an abscess will form in some people if it is not venesected at the first strike, but that abscess does not harm him anyway.
¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis.	Of the usefulness of Venesection and the cautions to be observed in it.
Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare.	The quality however of Venesection and its accidents from which you should take thought in its correction.
Primum ergo illius est de quo oportet ut scias, quod phlebotomia non administratur, nisi in conseruatione sanitatis, et perseuerantia eius, et cautela ab aduentu aegritudinum.	Firstly then of that you should know, that venesection is not administered unless for the conservation of health, and the perseverance of it, and caution against the advent of diseases.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum trium quae sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica.	And so that venesection may be done in one of the three veins on the arm, namely, the Cephalic, and the Fuscous, and the Basilic.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in principio Veris super ieiunium, in uere, et aestate: et autumno, et hyeme post comestionem, quando apparent significationes repletionis.	And so that venesection may be done at the beginning of spring after fasting, in truth, and summer; and autumn, and winter after digestion, when signs of fullness appear.
Et fiat phlebotomia in die primo, aut in tertio, postquam praeterierint de die tres horae.	And let venesection be done on the first or third day, after three hours have passed since dawn.
Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quando prouocat conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.	But venesection which is administered in diseases has no fixed hour: but whenever occasion and necessity demand it, whether by night or day, at any hour, and at any time.
Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quatuordecim anni.	And it is not fitting that children should be venesected until they have reached the age of fourteen years.
Neque phlebotometur mulier praegnans, nisi a mense quarto usque ad septimum.	Nor should a pregnant woman be bled, except from the fourth month up to the seventh.
Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.	Nor should elderly men who have passed sixty years be bled.
Cum ergo aliquis uult phlebotomari propter quemcumque modum sit: oportet, ut mundificet intestina sua ante phlebotomiam cum clisteri leni, si in eis est stercus multum retentum: ut non attrahant uenae apud phlebotomiam ex intestinis superfluitates putridas nocentes membris principalibus.	When someone wants to be bled for any reason, it is necessary that he clean his bowels beforehand with a gentle enema if there is much retained feces in them, so that the veins are not attracted at the time of bleeding by superfluous putridities from the intestines that can harm the principal limbs.
Neque phlebotometur patiens toctina, id est, satietatem nauseatiuam: neque crapulatus, neque euadens ab ebrietate, donec remoueatur illud ab eis.	Nor should a patient who is disgusted by eating, that is, one who has no appetite; nor one who is drunk and vomiting from drunkenness, until that is removed from them.
Neque infirmus cum hydropisi.	Nor should an invalid with dropsy.
Et caueatur phlebotomia iterum post colicam passionem, et uomitum, et fluxum uentris, et multiplicationem coitus, et laboris, et exercitii, et uigiliarum, et ieiunii, et omnis quod dissoluit uirtutem ex re corporea aut animali.	And beware of bleeding again after a bout of colic, and vomiting, and diarrhea, and an increase in sexual activity, and labor, and exercise, and wakefulness, and fasting, and any other thing that dissipates bodily or animal vigor.
Deinde considera in subtilitate humorum ante illud, si sanguis est grossus cum cibis et potibus, et medicinis: si possibile est ei illud.	Then consider the subtlety of humors before that, whether blood is thickened with food and drink, and medicines: if it is possible for him.
Deinde introeat balneum, si non prohibet ipsum aliquid: aut exercitetur aliquo exercitio, ut subtilietur sanguis.	Then enter the bath, if nothing forbids it: or exercise in some way, so that blood may be thinned.
Et pone phlebotomiam eius in pectore, circa tertiam diei, sicut diximus: et conare, ut euacuetur pectus eius illa die ex omnibus accidentibus animalibus malis: sicut angustia, et ira, et timor: et ex omnibus accidentibus corporeis, sicut labor, et poena, et superfluicoitus, et illis similia.	And place the bleeding of him in the chest, around the third day, as we said: and strive to purge his chest that day from all animal evils, such as constriction, and anger, and fear: and from all bodily evils, such as labor, and pain, and superfluities, and similar things.
Et sedi suae faciat esse praesentes res cum quarum usu cucurrit consuetudo hominum ex aromaticitate, et odoramento, et tripudio et similibus illis per quantitatem possibilitatis.	And make his seat be present with things from which the habit of humans has become accustomed to use through aromaticity, and scent, and joy, and similar things in proportion to their possibility.
Deinde sedeat phlebotomator super puluinari, quod sit altius quam puluinar phlebotomandi: postea extrahat brachium suum, et fricet ipsum phlebotomator manu sua bis, aut ter.	Then the bleeding attendant should sit on a cushion that is higher than the cushion for bleeding: afterwards he should pull out his own arm and rub it with his hand twice or three times.
Deinde stringat ligamentum cum corrigia, et inuoluat eam bis.	Then he ties the ligament with a girdle and wraps it twice.
Et sit strictura temperata, quoniam strictura quando est inaequalis, aut per superfluitatem in strictura, tunc prohibet cursum sanguinis: aut in mollificatione, tunc etiam prohibet cursum sanguinis.	And let the constriction be tempered, because when the constriction is unequal, either through excess or lack of constriction, then it hinders the flow of blood: or in relaxation, then it also hinders the flow of blood.
Deinde post stricturam oportet, ut fricet phlebotomandus manus suas simul adinuicem, donec inflentur uenae, et declarentur sensui.	Then after the constriction, it is necessary that the phlebotomist rub his hands together in a circular motion until the veins are inflated and become apparent to the sense.
Deinde abstergat phlebotomator phlebotomum cum pauco oleo, antiquo proprie.	Then the phlebotomist should wipe the phlebotomy site with a little old oil, properly.
Deinde ponat digitum suum indicem manus sinistrae super ipsam uenam sub loco cuius phlebotomiam uult, parum: ut non fugiat uena, et cassetur percussio.	Then he should place his index finger of the left hand on top of the vein at the spot where he intends to perform the phlebotomy, slightly: so that the vein does not escape and a blow can be struck.
Quoniam ex uenis est quam inuenis sicut chordam fugientem apud phlebotomiam: et ex eis est quae est plena uentositate: et quando ponis phlebotomum super eam, contrahitur sub phlebotomo, et decipitur phlebotomator, et non aperit phlebotomus uenam: et si aperit eam, est stricta: propter illud ergo oportet, ut firmetur phlebotomator, et sit sollicitus in his rebus omnibus.	For it is known that veins are like fleeing strings during phlebotomy: and some of them are full of breath: and when you place the phlebotomy instrument on top of it, it contracts under the phlebotomist, and the phlebotomator is deceived, and the wound does not open: and if it does open, it is narrow: therefore one should be careful to ensure that the phlebotomist is firm and attentive in all these matters.
Deinde deponat phlebotomum.	Then he should remove the phlebotomy instrument.
Si ergo aperitur uena ex uice una, tunc bonum est.	If then the vein opens on one side, it is good.
Et si non, tunc itera illud uice alia sub illo loco parum, aut supra ipsum cum festinatione: si non apostematur locus.	And if not, then do that on the other side a little bit below or above with haste: if the place does not abscess.
Quod si apostematur, aut expauescit infirmus, tunc dimitte eum die, aut duobus diebus: et non stringat ligamentum.	Which if it abscesses or becomes inflamed, then let him rest for a day or two: and do not tie the ligament.
Fortasse enim attrahet apostema calidum.	Perhaps indeed an abscess may draw in warmth.
Neque ingrediatur balneum.	Nor should he enter a bath.
Deinde iteret phlebotomiam, si amat.	Then he should repeat the phlebotomy if it is desired.
Quod si apertio est parua, aut currit sanguis subtiliter: et times ut non egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uis: tunc itera phlebotomum in foramine ipso secundum rectitudinem, et adde in operatione parum.	If the incision is small or if the blood flows thinly: and you fear that a quantity of blood may not emerge as desired: then continue to make the venesection at the same opening according to straightness, and add a little to the procedure.
Et fac illud cum festinatione, antequam apostemetur locus, apostematus enim locus est in multis hominibus apud operationem paruam.	And do it with haste before the place becomes inflamed, for an inflamed place is often found in many people during a small operation.
Si ergo uides ipsum iam apostematum, tunc non iteres super ipsum omnino, non enim excusat apud te aliquid.	If therefore you see it already inflamed, then do not make another incision on it at all, for nothing excuses that in your presence.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex faece olei: quoniam alleuiat cursum sanguinis.	And place something from the fat of oil upon it, since it will ease the flow of blood.
Et est melior in hoc loco quam oleum ipsum, et quam reliqua olea.	And it is better in this place than oil itself and than other oils.
Et similiter administra faecem olei in omni phlebotomia tua, qua phlebotomas uenas apud prohibitionem cursus sanguinis: et faciunt illud tyriaca alfarach, et sagzenea, quando ponitur ex una earum super locum.	And similarly administer the fat of oil in every venesection of yours, whereby you make incisions on veins to prevent the flow of blood; and they are called tyriaca alfarach, and sagzenea, when one of them is placed on top of a place.
Sanguis enim subtiliatur et resoluitur, quando est grossus.	For blood is refined and dissolved when it is thick.
Quod si accidat in loco phlebotomiae apostema magnum, nam multotiens accidit, praecipue ei qui non est phlebotomatus nisi uice illa, aut est apertio uenae parua, tunc propera et pone super locum spongiam infusam in aqua et sale, calefacta parumper: et stringe eam hora una: quoniam soluitur.	For if a great inflammation occurs at the site of the venesection, which often happens, especially to one who has not been venesected except by that method, or if the opening of the vein is small, then hasten and place a sponge soaked in water and salt, warmed for a short time, upon the place; and bind it for an hour, since it dissolves.
Et oportet, ut facias illud post exitum sanguinis ex uena ipsa, cum complemento sui, aut ex uena alia.	And it is necessary that you do this after the blood has come out from the same vein, with its completion, or from another vein.
Quod si remanet in loco post dies aliquid nigredinis, aut uiriditatis, non nocet illud: et si uis, pone super ipsum aliquid aloe, aut myrrhae solutorum: aut aliquid ex succo menthastri, id est, calamenti aut simile illius.	And if something of darkness or greenness remains in the place after some days, it does not harm; and if you wish, place something like aloe or myrrh solvents upon it; or something from the juice of mentha, that is, calament or similar to it.
Et multotiens quidem accidunt apostemata et eminentiae apud phlebotomiam Basilicae.	And many times indeed inflamations and swellings occur during venesection at the basilica.
Pone ergo manum tuam super ipsam, tunc si inuenis molliciem apud compressionem tuam super ipsam, tunc illa eminentia est mala.	So then put your hand on it, and if you find softness under your pressure on it, then that prominence is bad.
Caue ergo, ut ponas super eam aliquid ex eo quod diximus.	Therefore, take care to place something from what we said over it.
Nam fortasse fluet ex ea sanguis arteriae.	For perhaps blood may flow from it of the artery.
Sed fac emplastrum ei cum eo in quo est stipticitas, ut induretur locus.	But make a poultice for it with that which has astringency, so that the place may be hardened.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Et oportet, ut extrahas omni homini ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis suae.	And it is necessary to remove from every man's blood according to the quantity of his virtue.
Et quod apparet ex colore uincente super sanguinem.	And what appears from its victorious color over the blood.
Nam sanguis si est niger, tunc dimitte ipsum exire, donec rubeat: et similiter si uides ipsum grossum: tunc dimitte eum, donec subtilietur: et similiter si est acutus, donec auferatur acuitas eius.	For if the blood is black, then let it flow out until it turns red; and similarly if you see it thick, then let it go until it becomes thin; and similarly if it is sharp, then let its sharpness be removed.
Et oportet ei qui est plenus, fortis, et indiget extractione sanguinis uice una, ut amplificetur phlebotomia uenae, et sit phlebotomus latus: et in eo qui est debilis, sit econtrario illius.	And it is necessary for one who is full, strong, and needs bloodletting to amplify the venous phlebotomy, and let the phlebotomist be on the left side; and conversely for one who is weak.
Et oportet, ut extrahat ipsum in uicibus, et ut sit foramen strictum: et melius quod administratur in phlebotomia uenae est, ut sit transuersa sectio, non punctura.	And it is necessary to remove it through openings and to have a narrow aperture; and better what is administered in venous phlebotomy is that there be a crosswise incision, not a puncture.
Et iste modus phlebotomiae est saluus a fluxu sanguinis, et ab incisione nerui: et est laudabilior, et saluior quam phlebotomia per latitudinem et longitudinem.	And this method of phlebotomy is safe from the flow of blood and from cutting the nerve; and it is more praiseworthy and healthier than phlebotomy by width and length.
Et cui consueuit peruenire apud phlebotomiam syncopis, oportet ut cibes ante phlebotomiam modico pane infuso in aqua granati muzi: aut secaniabin, si est calefactus: et extrahas ei ex sanguine in tribus uicibus, aut quatuor.	And one who is accustomed to syncope during phlebotomy should eat before phlebotomy a moderate amount of bread infused with grape juice water; or pomegranate seeds if it is heated up; and remove from him three or four times.
Et si est infrigidatae complexionis, tunc accipiat ante phlebotomiam panem infusum in syrupo miua, aut in syrupo de melle aromatizato cum speciebus, aut in syrupo aromatizato odorifero.	And if it is of a cold complexion, then let him take before phlebotomy bread infused with honey syrup, or with aromatic spices, or with aromatic odoriferous syrup.
Quod si accidat syncopis apud phlebotomiam, et est caussa eius exitus sanguinis multi: tunc oportet, ut sumat in potu aquam carnis, et syrupum odoriferum subtilem: et utatur aromaticitate cum algalia, et liniatur pectus eius cum ea: et utatur reliquis quae diximus in diuisione in capitulo syncopis ex euacuatione.	If it happens that adhesions occur during phlebotomy and the cause is the exit of much blood: then it is necessary to take a drink of meat broth, and a subtle perfumed syrup; and to use aromaticity with aloes, and to anoint his chest with it: and to use the other things we mentioned in the chapter on adhesions for evacuation.
Qui autem uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo: oportet ei cuius phlebotomia est propter euacuationem multam, et uirtus eius est debilis, ut soluat sanguinem paulatim per quantitatem uirtutis in diebus continuis.	However, whoever wants to withdraw his arm and release his blood gradually: it is necessary for him whose phlebotomy is for the evacuation of much blood, and whose power is weak, to release his blood little by little according to the quantity of his power over continuous days.
Qui uero uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo, et est corpus eius forte: tunc faciat illud post septem horas, aut nouem a phlebotomia sua prima.	However, whoever wants to withdraw his arm and release his blood gradually, and has a strong body: then let him do it after seven hours or nine hours from his first phlebotomy.
Qui autem uult attrahere sanguinem ex corpore suo ad contrarium partis ad quam declinat: oportet ut euentetur ei in die secundo, aut in tertio.	However, whoever wants to attract blood from his body to the opposite side of where it inclines: it is necessary for him that it happen to him on the second day or third.
In cuius uero corpore est sanguis multus iam calefactus, et acuitur, et facit accidere febrem: oportet, ut egrediatur ex eo sanguis in uice una, et extrahatur ex eo quantitas multa: et amplificetur apertio usquequo accidat syncopis: postquam tu fueris conseruans omnes conditiones phlebotomiae: et ut ponas manum tuam super pulsum eius apud cursum sanguinis, ut non accidat mors loco syncopis.	In whose body is much blood already heated and sharpened, and causes fever to occur: it is necessary that the blood go out from him in one direction, and a great quantity be drawn from him; and the opening be enlarged until adhesions occur: after you have preserved all the conditions of phlebotomy, and put your hand on his pulse at the course of the blood, so that death does not occur at the site of adhesions.
Multotiens enim accidit illud, quando ignorat phlebotomator, et cadit negligentia.	For indeed it often happens when the phlebotomist is unaware and falls into negligence.
Et non oportet quando uis soluere brachium, et soluere sanguinem secundo, cum iam clausum sit orificium uenae, et fiat difficilis exitus sanguinis, ut prematur super ipsum cum uehementia, et curuatum extendatur uelociter.	And it is not necessary when you want to withdraw the arm and release the blood gradually, with the orifice of the vein already closed and the exit of the blood becoming difficult, that you apply pressure on top of it with great force and stretch it quickly.
Nam illud est malum ualde, imo dimitte ipsum, donec phlebotometur secundo.	For this is very bad, nay, leave it be, until it is rephlebotomized again.
Aut remoue cum acuitate phlebotomi illud quod coagulatum est ex sanguine in orificio uenae, et pone super ipsum aliquid salis dissoluti in aqua.	Remove with sharpness of phlebotomy what has coagulated from blood in the venous opening, and place something dissolved salt on top of it.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex tyriaca alfaroch, aut sagzenea, et pone ipsum compressione leni, donec egrediatur sanguis.	And place something from Tyrian balm or sage wine on top of it, and apply gentle pressure to it until the blood flows out.
Si uero iam apostemata est uena, tunc dimitte eam, et non tegas eam, donec sedetur apostema.	If the vein is already inflamed, then leave it alone and do not bind it until the inflammation subsides.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad soluendum sanguinem secundo, et non est excusatio, tunc aut phlebotoma ipsum supra illum locum, aut in brachio alio in uena alia.	But if necessity demands that you shed blood again, and there is no excuse, then either let blood above that spot or in another arm in a different vein.
Funis autem brachii phlebotomatur loco Fuscae, et Basilicae, cum non inueniuntur, et sunt occultae, quoniam est composita ex eis.	The veins of the arm are let blood at the place called Black and Basilian, when the other two cannot be found and are hidden, since they are made up of these.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus manum suam in aqua calida, donec rubeat focile, et appareat uena manifeste.	And the quality of this bloodletting is that the patient should put his hand into hot water until it turns red and the vein becomes clearly visible.
Deinde stringatur super ipsam cum ligamento parum constrictione media.	Then bind it with a bandage, a little constricted in the middle.
Deinde phlebotoma secundum transuersationem paulatim, non latitudinaliter, neque secundum longitudinem: et sit apertio ampla, et sit phlebotomia tua qua eam phlebotomas super iuncturam manus parumper.	Then perform the bloodletting across the vein gradually, not widthwise or lengthwise; and have a wide opening and your bloodletting be done slightly above the joining of the hand.
Quod si prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera manum in aqua calida, et dimitte sanguinem currere in aqua, donec consequaris necessitatem tuam.	But if the flow of blood is hindered, then put your hand back into hot water and let the blood run out into the water until you achieve your necessity.
Si autem fueris in diebus aestatis, tunc excusaris ab iteratione manus in aqua calida.	But if it is summer days, then excuse yourself from putting your hand back into hot water.
Et plurimum quidem ponitur cursus sanguinis in aqua calida in tempore hyemis.	And indeed the flow of blood is placed in hot water more often in winter time.
Et phlebotomia huius uenae est saluior omnibus uenis, quoniam non est sub ea uena pulsatilis, neque neruus.	And the bloodletting of this vein is healthier for all veins, because there is no pulsating artery or nerve under it.
Phlebotomia uero Saluatellae manus dextrae, est conferens aegritudinibus epatis.	The bloodletting of the Salutella vein of the right hand is conducive to alleviating liver ailments.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringas mahason manus cum ligamento, aut manu tua, postquam tu intromittis eam in aquam calidam, donec infletur uena, et demonsteretur sensui ualde.	And the quality of phlebotomy is that you bind a bandage around the arm with a ligament or your own hand after you put it into warm water until the vein swells and is very noticeable to the sense.
Deinde phlebotoma eam transuersando.	Then, cut the vein across.
Et si incidis eam totaliter, non nocebit ei illud in aliquo.	And if you cut it entirely, that will not harm him at all.
Et conserua, ne ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo.	And preserve so that your hand is not last with the phlebotomist.
Sub ea enim sunt nerui digitorum denudati ex carne.	Underneath it indeed are the nerves of the fingers exposed from the flesh.
Deinde itera manum ad aquam calidam, et dimitte currere sanguinem in ea.	Then put your hand into warm water and let the blood flow freely in it.
Nam si tu non iteras eam in aqua calida, coagulatur sanguis in orificio uenae, et prohibetur a cursu.	For if you do not put it into warm water, the blood will clot in the incision of the vein and prevent its flow.
Cum ergo extraxeris ex sanguine quantitatem necessitatis, tunc pone super uenam oleum et sal: ut non consolidetur uelociter.	When therefore you have taken out the necessary quantity of blood, then place oil and salt over the vein: so that it may not clot quickly.
Et similiter oportet, ut facias cum omni ramo stricto.	And similarly, it is fitting for you to do this with every tight branch.
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae eius ex manu sinistra, est: quoniam est conferens ad aegritudines splenis: et similiter fac in phlebotomia eius, sicut fecisti in secunda aequaliter.	The medicine of this phlebotomy is from the left hand, because it is connected to diseases of the spleen; and similarly do the same with its phlebotomy as you did with the second one equally.
Saphenae autem phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad aegritudines quae sunt in inferiori parte corporis, sicut aegritudines matricum, et retentionem menstruorum, et infirmitates renum, et ulcera coxarum et crurium antiqua, et similia ex aegritudinibus.	The medicine of the phlebotomy of the saphena is for diseases that are in the lower part of the body, such as diseases of the womb, and retention of menses, and weaknesses of the kidneys, and old ulcers of the hips and legs, and similar ones from diseases.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus pedem suum in aquam calidam: et faciat super ipsum fricationem, donec exuberent uenae: et liga supra iuncturam pedis cum corrigia.	And the quality of this phlebotomy is that the patient puts their foot into warm water and makes a friction on it until the veins swell; and binds above the joint of the foot with a garter.
Et uenae quidem locus est apud calcaneum, apparens uersus pollicem: et ramificantur ex ea in facie pedis rami multi.	And the location of the veins is at the heel, appearing towards the thumb; and they branch out from there into multiple branches on the surface of the foot.
Phlebotoma ergo eam in ampliore ramo eius, aut apud calcaneum in aggregatione eius: quoniam est melius et saluius.	Letting blood therefore is done on a larger branch of it, or at the heelbone in its gathering; for it is better and more healthful.
Quod si phlebotomas eam in facie pedis, tunc caue a neruis qui sunt sub ea super faciem pedis.	But if you let blood on the face of the foot, then beware of the nerves that are beneath it above the face of the foot.
Et pone phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas ex transuerso, quasi tu uelis incidere eam: et sit phlebotomus Nesil.	And place your phlebotomy so that you may let blood from across, as if you wished to cut it; and make the phlebotomist Nasil.
Si autem prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera pedem eius in aqua calida: et dimitte sanguinem currere in eam, donec euacuatur.	But if the flow of blood is hindered, then go on to his foot in hot water: and let the blood run into it, until it is drained.
Quod si errat uenam phlebotomator in prima uice, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper, nam locus est saluus, et non times ex eo maliciam, quando tu caues a neruis, sicut diximus.	For if the phlebotomist goes wrong in the first attempt, then go on to phlebotomy at a higher point for a little while, because the place is safe and you do not fear harm from it, when you beware of nerves, as we said.
Et similiter cum Saphena pedis alterius aequaliter.	And similarly with the vein on the other foot in equal measure.
Venae autem Sciaticae locus, sicut diximus, est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	The location of the Sciatic veins is, as we said, at the heelbone from the left side.
Et iuuamentum phlebotomiae eius est, ad dolorem anchae, quando est propter sanguinem calidum.	And the benefit of his bloodletting is, to relieve the pain of the ankle, when it is due to hot blood.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut ingrediatur infirmus balneum, et festinet: et stringe crus eius a latere anchae usque supra calcaneum quatuor digitis, cum uitta subtili longa: non enim apparet nisi propter illud.	And the quality of his bloodletting is, that the patient enters the bath and hastens; and bind his leg from the side of the ankle up to the heelbone for four digits, with a thin cord long: for it does not appear except on account of this.
Quando ergo apparet, tunc phlebotoma eam secundum quodcumque ingenium est tibi possibile, aut secundum transuersionem: et est melius, aut ut incidas eam incisione, aut seces eam sectione.	When it appears, then let blood it according to your own ability, or across; and it is better, either to cut it by cutting, or to divide it by dividing.
Locus enim eius est saluior, et ipsa est in pluribus hominibus occulta ualde.	For its location is more healthful, and it is very hidden in many people.
Quod si non inuenis eam, et non apparet sensui omnino: tunc phlebotoma aliquem ramum eius, et est ille qui apparet in dorso pedis, et uersus auricularem: et caue a neruis, et fac currere ex sanguine quantitatem quam uis.	For if you do not find it and it does not appear to your sense at all: then let blood some branch of it, and that is the one which appears on the back of the foot, and towards the ear; and beware of nerves, and make flow from blood as much as you wish.
Deinde solue stricturam, et pone super locum phlebotomiae corium, et stringe locum.	Then loosen the constriction, and place the skin over the site of venesection, and tie the place.
Uelociter enim sanatur.	For indeed it soon heals.
¶ De Ventosatione, et qualitate usus eius.	On Pneumatic Therapy, and its Quality.
Caput XCVIII.	Chapter Ninety-Eight.
Uentosae fiunt ex cornibus, et ex aere, et ex uitro.	Wind-bags are made from horns, and from air, and from glass.
Et Ventosatio quidem fit secundum duos modos.	And Pneumatic Therapy indeed is done in two ways.
Cum scarificatione, et extractione sanguinis: et alter est uentosatio sine scarificatione.	With scarification and bloodletting: and the other is pneumatic therapy without scarification.
Et haec Ventosatio quae est sine scarificatione, est secundum duos modos.	And this Pneumatic Therapy which is done without scarification, is done in two ways.
Aut enim est cum igne.	Or it is with fire.
Aut est absque igne.	Or it is without fire.
Et uentosis quae administrantur cum scarificatione et extractione sanguinis sunt quatuordecim loca corporis.	And the pneumatic remedies which are administered with scarification and bloodletting are fourteen places of the body.
Quorum unus est, Ventosatio Alnocrati, et est postremum capitis: et Alkehel, et est medium colli: et uentosae Alhagdahim, et sunt duae laminae colli a duabus partibus simul: et uentosae menti, et est sub mandibula in inferiori oris: et uentosae duarum spatularum: et uentosae Alachosos super finem caudae: et uentosae duorum focilium, et sunt medium duorum brachiorum: et uentosae duorum crurium: et uentosae duarum cauillarum.	One of which is Ventosa Alnocrati, and it is the last place at the top of the head; and Alkehel, and it is in the middle of the neck; and Ventosas Alhagdahim, and they are two plates on the neck from both sides at once; and Ventosas to the mind, and it is under the jawbone in the lower part of the mouth; and Ventosas of the two spatula-shaped areas; and Ventosas of Alachosos above the end of the tail; and Ventosas of the two elbow regions, and they are in the middle of both arms; and Ventosas of the two leg regions; and Ventosas of the two shoulder-blade areas.
Et Ventosatio quidem non extrahit sanguinem tibi ex uenis minutis sparsis in carne, et propter illud non cadit uirtus ex eis, sicut est casus eius ex phlebotomia.	And indeed Pneumatic Therapy does not extract blood from small scattered veins in the flesh, and because of that it does not have power over them, just as is the case with venesection.
Neque oportet, ut administretur uentosatio siue cum igne, aut absque igne in aliqua aegritudinum quae fiunt ex repletione, donec euacuetur totum corpus.	Nor is it necessary to administer Pneumatic Therapy, whether with fire or without fire, for any ailment that arises from fullness, until the whole body has been purged.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad Ventosationem ex aegritudine, aut propter consuetudinem, administramus eam in omni hora in principio mensis, in fine eius, et in medio ipsius, et in quocumque tempore fuerit.	But if necessity demands Pneumatic Therapy due to illness or habit, we administer it every hour at the beginning, end, and middle of the month, and whenever is necessary.
Quod est, quia ex hominibus est qui quando multiplicatur in eo sanguis, donec indiget extractione eius per uentosationem, inuenit in capite suo grauedinem, et sodahan.	What is this? Because there are people who when multiplied in him blood increases to the point where it needs to be extracted through venesection, find a swelling in their head and sudden death.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit repletionem et rubedinem in facie sua, capite suo, et collo suo.	And among them is one who finds repletion and redness on his face, head, and neck.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit pruritum in facie sua, et fronte sua, et tenebrositatem, et hebetudinem in oculis suis.	And among them is one who finds itching on his face and forehead, and darkness and dullness in his eyes.
Et ex eis est qui scalpit locum uentosationis suae.	And among them is one who forms an ulcer at the site of venesection.
Et ex eis est cuius risus multiplicatur.	And among them is one whose laughter increases.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit gustum sanguinis in ore suo: aut apostematur lingua, et expuit sanguinem.	And among them is one who finds the taste of blood in his mouth; or his tongue will ulcerate and spit out blood.
Et ex eis est cuius somnus multiplicatur.	And among them is one whose sleep increases.
Et ex eis est qui uidet in somno suo sanguinem et rubedinem, et interfectos, et plagas, et quae sunt similia illis.	And among them is one who sees blood and redness, and dead bodies, and wounds, and things similar to these while sleeping.
Quando ergo uidemus aliquid ex illis, et proprie si est in tertia media mensis: praecipimus tunc uentosationem fieri, postquam praeterierunt de die duae horae, aut tres.	When we see something from those things and it is exactly on the 15th day of the month: we prescribe then that venesection be done, after two hours or three have passed since dawn.
Iuuamentum autem Ventosationis nuchae, est: quoniam ipsa confert ad grauitatem in capite, et quod effunditur ad oculos.	The juice of venesection is: because it brings relief to the heaviness in the head, and what flows out affects the eyes.
At uero oportet, ut sit illud post euacuationem totius corporis.	But it must be done after the evacuation of the entire body.
Et haec quidem Ventosa est loco phlebotomiae Cephalicae.	And this is indeed a form of cephalic phlebotomy.
Et non licet, ut utatur ea qui est frigidae complexionis, aut in quo est catarrus.	And it is not allowed to use it on someone who has a cold complexion or one with a catarrh.
Nam infert ei nocumentum magnum.	For it would cause him great harm.
Et propter illud non oportet, ut utantur ea senes, et in cuius capite sunt aegritudines frigidae.	And because of this, one should not use it on the elderly or those who have cold afflictions in their head.
Qui autem super eam fit assiduus, generatur super eum obliuio.	But whoever becomes habituated to it forgets about it afterwards.
Et propter illud oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut deponat manum suam cum uentosa parumper ad inferiora, timendo ex generatione obliuionis.	And because of this, one should instruct the phlebotomist to put their hand down with the vein for a little while at the lower part, fearing the generation of forgetfulness.
Ventosatio aut Alkehel, est loco phlebotomiae Fuscae, et phlebotomiae Basilicae, et propter illud confert asmati, et constrictioni anhelitus, et fissurae instrumenti anhelitus, et tussi, et repletioni.	Ventosatio or Alkehel is a place for dark bloodletting and basilic vein bloodletting. And because of this, it serves for the relief of breathlessness and constriction of breathing, and for the opening of the instrument of breathing, and coughing, and repletion.
Et oportet, ut impellatur Ventosa Alkehel parumper, quoniam si ponitur inferius, generat debilitatem in corde, et stomacho.	And it is necessary to have the ventosatio Alkehel pushed slightly, because if it is placed lower down, it generates weakness in the heart and stomach.
Ventosatio uero alhagdahim, confert doloribus accidentibus in capite, et obtalmiae, et hemigraneae, et perforationi, et dolori in radicibus dentium: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae.	The ventosatio alhagdahim serves for pains and accidents in the head, and for inflammation of the eyes, and for headache, and for perforation, and pain in the roots of the teeth; and it is a place for basilic vein bloodletting.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And it is necessary to warn the ventosator not to press his hand with scarification so that he does not cut the artery and cause a flow of blood.
Ventosatio autem sub mento, confert alcolae in ore, et corruptioni gingiuae, et similibus eis ex aegritudinibus quae sunt in ore: et stat loco phlebotomiae alieherich, quae sunt in duobus labiis.	The ventosatio under the jaw serves for ulcers in the mouth, and corruption of the gums, and similar things from illnesses that are in the mouth: and it is a place for bloodletting alieherich, which are in both lips.
Ventosatio autem spatularum, confert ad alchafacham, quae fit ex replexione, et caliditate.	The ventosatio of spatulae serves for alchafacham, which is caused by repression and heat.
Ventosatio uero interiorum partium duorum focilium, confert iuuamentum phlebotomiae uenarum trium, Basilicae, et Fuscae, et Cephalicae: quoniam ipsa attrahit sanguinem ex omnibus illis uenis minutis, quae sunt in carne: et attrahunt illae uenae minutae ex uenis aliis grossioribus eis, donec peruenit attractio ad uenas tres.	The ventosatio of the inner parts of two cauldrons serves for the benefit of bloodletting from the three veins, Basilicae, Fuscae, and Cephalicae: because it attracts blood from all those small veins that are in the flesh: and those small veins attract from other larger veins until the attraction reaches the three veins.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne multum procedat in scarificatione: quoniam locus est denudatus carne, et sub eo sunt nerui et arteriae.	And it is necessary to warn the ventosator not to proceed too much in scarification: because the place is denuded of flesh, and beneath it are nerves and arteries.
Ventosa autem quae uentosatur super alchausos, confert hemorroidibus Ani, et ulceribus inferioribus.	The ventosa which is applied above the alkaous serves for hemorrhoids of the anus and ulcers below.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut sit uentosa magna, et ut sit ex aere: quoniam locus indiget suctione forti, et fortasse franguntur Ventosae subtiles: et scarificetur scarificatione magna.	And it is necessary to sharpen the ventouses, that they be great and made of air, because the place needs strong suction, and perhaps the fine ventouses are broken: and let a great scarification take place.
Ventosae autem crurium minuunt diminutione manifesta: quoniam attrahunt sanguinem ex toto corpore, et conferunt doloribus antiquis in renibus, et matricibus, et uesica: prouocant menstrua, et conferunt bothor, et ademenul: et stant loco phlebotomiae duarum saphenarum, et alhorcobeni.	But the ventouses of the legs diminish by manifest diminution; because they draw blood from the entire body, and transfer pains to old wounds in the kidneys, matrix, and bladder: they provoke menstruation, and transfer abscesses, and swelling; and stand in place of phlebotomy for two saphenous veins, and alhorcobeni.
Verumtamen debilitant corpus multum, et faciunt accidere syncopim in pluribus hominibus.	However, they weaken the body greatly, and cause syncope to occur in many people.
Et Ventosarum alhorcobeni iuuamentum est propinquum iuuamento Ventosarum duorum crurium.	And the benefit of two leg ventouses is nearby the benefit of one leg ventouse.
Qualitas positionis Ventosarum est, ut ponas uentosam in primis uacuam, et sugas suctione temperata: et non prolonges positionem uentosarum, sed pone eas uelociter, et remoue eas uelociter, ut ueniant humores ad locum aduentu aequali: et non cesses iterare illud et continuare, donec uideas locum iam rubere et inflari, et appareat rubedo sanguinis: tunc ergo scarifica, et itera suctione paulatim.	The quality of ventouse position is that you put the ventouse in a first empty place, and suck with moderate suction: and do not prolong the position of the ventouses, but put them quickly, and remove them quickly, so that the humors come to the place with equal arrival: and do not cease to repeat that and continue, until you see the place already red and swollen, and appears redness of blood: then therefore scarify, and iterate suction slowly.
Deinde considera in dispositione corporum.	Then consider the bodily dispositions.
Nam qui ex hominibus est tenerae carnis, rarorum pororum, oportet ut scarifices ipsum semel, non plus: ut non ulceretur locus.	For those who are of thin flesh, few pores, it is necessary to scarify them once only, not more: so that the place may not become inflamed.
Et praecipe Ventosatori, ut amplificet scarificationem, et profundet parum: et temperet suctionem in facilitate, et uelocitate, et motu suaui.	And instruct the ventouse operator to widen the scarification and make it a little deep; and moderate the suction in ease, speed, and gentle motion.
Quod si in sanguine est grossitudo, tunc oportet, ut scarifices ipsum bis.	What if there is coagulation of blood, then you must scarify it twice.
In uice quidem prima aperitur uia subtiliationi sanguinis, et aquositati eius: et in secunda quidem perscrutationi exquisitae extractionis sanguinis grossi.	Indeed, the first opening reveals the way for subtle blood thinning and its liquidation; and in the second, indeed, a thorough and exact extraction of thickened blood.
Si uero sanguis est faeculentus ualde, tunc fiat scarificatio uice tertia: ut consequatur ultimum.	If indeed the blood is very feculent, then a scarification should be made in the third place, so that it may be the last.
Et ad ultimum, quando uolumus extrahere sanguinem paulatim, uel parumper, sufficit nobis scarificatio una.	And to the end, when we wish to extract blood little by little, or just a moment, one scarification is enough for us.
Quod si uolumus extractionem sanguinis multi, scarificamus scarificatione plurima.	For if we wish to extract blood many times, we make many scarifications.
Et si nos mensuramus, quod sanguis est grossus: tunc oportet, ut scarificetur scarificatione profunda: et terminus aequalis in scarificatione, est profunditas cutis.	And if we measure it, and the blood is thick: then it is necessary that it be scarified with a deep scarification: and the equal limit of the scarification is the depth of the skin.
¶ Quid sit illud quod oportet administrari ex oleis apud positionem Ventosarum, et quid caueat uentosandus.	What should be administered from oils at the placement of Windsores, and what the wind-sore patient should beware of.
IN illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.	In that person whose skin is thick, hard, and dark, and whose pores are tight, it is necessary that the areas of Windsores be anointed with open, softening, dissolving oils: if it is in the time of summer, such as oil of alkeiri, or violet oil, or oil from sweet almonds, or oil from cucumber seeds.
Et si est in tempore hyemis, tunc oleum narcissinum, aut oleum de lilio, aut oleum camomellinum, aut sarbatinum: et eis similia.	And if it is in the time of winter, then oil of narcissus, or oil of lily, or oil of chamomile, or safflower oil: and similar things to these.
Si uero superfluitas est grossa, frigida: tunc oleum sit amaracinum, aut oleum de balsamita aut oleum alben, aut oleum anetinum: et eis similia.	If the excess is thick and cold: then oil should be used that is bitter almond, or oil of balsam, or white oil, or anetion oil: and similar things to these.
Si uero uentosandus est amplorum pororum, tenerae carnis: tunc oportet, ut prohibeatur ab oleo, et oportet ut isti abluant loca Ventosarum earum post uentosationem cum aqua rosata, aut cum aqua frigida, aut cum aqua solatri, aut cum aqua cucurbitae, aut cum aqua portulacae: et similibus eis.	If the wind-sore is of large pores and tender flesh: then it is necessary to prevent it from oil, and it is necessary that these areas be washed with rose water, or cold water, or solatri water, or cucumber water, or portulaca water: and similar things to these.
Ille autem cuius sanguis est multae humiditatis, abluat uentosas cum aceto, aut cum aqua myrti, et sumach: et similibus eis.	He whose blood is of great humidity, should wash the windsores with vinegar, or with water of myrtle and sumach: and similar things to these.
Cuius autem superfluitates sunt grossae, abluat uentosas suas cum uino antiquo, aut cum aqua samsuci, aut decoctione aneti, aut camomillae: et eis similibus.	Whoever has excesses that are coarse, should wash their purulent sores with old wine, or with water of samsum, or with the decoction of anise, or of chamomile: and similar things.
Et oportet, ut caueatur uentosatio in balneo, aut in uestigio balnei, imo oportet, ut administretur post exitum ex balneo per horam, aut per horas duas.	And one should beware of purulent discharge in the bath, or in the vicinity of the bath; indeed, one should administer it after exiting the bath for an hour, or for two hours.
Et non oportet, ut dormiat aliquis post uentosationem.	And one should not sleep after purulent discharge.
¶ Quid est quo oportet ut regatur Ventosandus, aut Phlebotomatus ante uentosationem.	What is required to be done before purulent discharge: the Ventsandus, or the Phlebotomatus.
ET post eam oportet, ut consideres in primis: tunc si Ventosatus, aut Phlebotomatus sit cholericus, et uincunt super sanguinem eius acuitas et inflammatio: tunc oportet, ut accipiat infrigidantia, sicut granatum muzum: et etiam endiuiam cum aceto et lactuca, et secaniabin, et iuleb: et eis similia.	And after that, one should consider first: then if the Ventsandus or Phlebotomatus is choleric, and they conquer above his blood sharpness and inflammation: then it is necessary, that he take cooling things, such as pomegranate pomace: and also endive with vinegar and lettuce, and safflower, and julep: and similar things.
Et pone cibaria eius pullos, et carnes ouium sekebiget, et cibos conditos cum agresta: et eis similia.	And put his food in the form of eggs and old sheep's flesh, and foods cooked with wild herbs: and similar things.
Et cuius complexio est frigida, oportet ut sumat in potu syrupum de melle, aut de almiua, aut alsecaniabin de seminibus factum: et sumat uinum odoriferum medium, quod est inter uetus et nouum: et praecipiatur, ut utatur paucitate cibi.	And whoever has a cold complexion should take in his drink syrup made from honey, or from almond, or from sesame seed: and he should take a fragrant wine that is between old and new: and it will be necessary for him to use moderation in his food.
Et pone cibum eius pullos, et canebir: et passeres, id est, paruas aues: et pullos columborum issiadebet.	And put his food in the form of eggs and hens' flesh: and sparrows, that is, small birds: and he should demand pheasant's eggs.
Et oportet, ut potus die uentosationis et phlebotomiae plus sit quam cibus: et oportet, ut detur in potu in quibusdam hominibus in horis tyriaca alfaroch, aut medicamen de musco, id est, muscata, aut alesselithe ante uentosationem: et ante phlebotomiam, aut post: ut confortentur membra principalia, et subtilietur sanguis.	And it is necessary that the drink on the day of purulent discharge and bloodletting be more than food: and it will be necessary to give in the drink to some people in certain hours tyriaca alfaroch, or a medicine made from moss, that is, muscata, or alethes before purulent discharge: and before phlebotomy, or after: so that the principal members may be comforted, and the blood may be thinned.
Et non oportet, ut sumant eam in potu calefacto.	And it is not fitting for them to take it in a warmed bowl.
¶ De Ventosis sine scarificatione.	On Hiccoughs without Scarification.
Uentosae autem quae sunt sine scarificatione, sunt Ventosae quae ponuntur super epar, et splenem, et podagram, et super uentrem, umbilicum, et loca renum, et pixidem anchae: quoniam ista membra non sufferunt scarificationem super se.	But hiccoughs that are without scarification are those which are placed above the liver, and spleen, and podagra, and above the belly, navel, and places of kidneys, and pixides again; because these members do not endure scarification upon themselves.
Et non quaeritur per eas, nisi aut attactio ex membro sanguinis ad membrum: sicut ponimus Ventosam super mammillas in aegritudine fluxus sanguinis narium.	And it is not sought through these [hiccoughs], except for attraction of blood from one member to another; just as we place hiccough above the breasts in a disease of flowing nasal blood.
Et utimur eis, ut soluamus a membro uentositatem frigidam inuiscatam in membro: sicut ponimus uentosam super uentrem, et umbilicum.	And we use them to release from one member a cold and congealed hiccup in another; just as we place it above the belly and navel.
Ipsa enim rarificat membrum, et calefacit ipsum, et remouet dolorem propterea, quia resoluit illam uentositatem.	For it [the hiccup] rarefies the member, and warms it, and removes the pain on account of this, because it resolves that hiccough.
Etiam ponitur super renes, quando accidit in eis opilatio, aut lapis.	And it is also placed above the kidneys when there occurs a stoppage or stone.
Uirtute enim attractionis suae fortasse aperit opilationem, aut eradicat lapidem ex loco suo.	For indeed by the power of its attraction it perhaps opens up the stoppage or eradicates the stone from its place.
Et similiter facit quando ponitur super epar, et splenem apud uentositatem terendam in eis utrisque.	And similarly it does when it is placed above the liver and spleen, and there is a hiccup to be removed from both.
Et istae Ventosae administrantur uacuae cum sectione tantum.	And these hiccoughs are administered empty with just an incision.
Et quandoque administrantur cum igne.	And sometimes they are administered with fire.
Et quandoque administrantur plenae aqua tepida in aegritudinibus pleuresis: et illud est, ut impleatur Ventosa, et sit magna, aqua calida sola, aut aqua in qua decoctae sint herbae quae conueniunt.	And sometimes they are administered with warm water full of aegritudes of pleurisy: and that is so that the hiccough may be filled and great with hot water alone, or with water in which herbs that agree have been decocted.
¶ Forma Ventosae administratae cum igne.	The form of a hiccup administered with fire.
Sit amplitudo orificii eius duorum digitorum apertorum, secundum quod formauimus: et quantitas eius in profundo sit medietas palmi: et sit in latere eius in loco qui est circiter medium eius, foramen paruum, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum acus: fiat ex aere simul, aut citrino, grossorum marginum, lenium, aequalium, tersorum: ut non laedat membrum apud positionem suam super ipsum: et sit in medio eius uirga transuersa ex aere, aut ferro, ubi ponitur candela cum igne.	Let the width of its opening be two fingers spread apart, according to what we have formed: and let the quantity of it in depth be one half of a palm: and let there be on its side, in the place which is about its middle, a small hole, according to the size that an acus will enter into; let it be made from air simultaneously, or citron, rough edges, smooth, equal, and clean: so that it does not hurt the member at its position above itself: and let there be in the middle of it a crossbeam from air, or iron, where a candle is placed with fire.
Et iam fit haec uentosa magna, maior ea quam narrauimus, et parum minor illa, secundum aegritudines et aetatem eius qui utitur.	And now this boil becomes great and large, greater than we have described, and a little smaller, according to the ailments and age of the one who uses it.
Ventosae enim puerorum, et extenuatorum sunt aliae, quam uentosae uirorum, et grossorum corporum.	For wind abscesses of boys and those who are emaciated are different from those of men and those with fat bodies.
Qualitas autem ponendi hanc uentosam cum igne super membrum, est, ut accendas licinium cum igne ex lino decenter, aut candelam paruam ex caera: et pone eam super medium uirgae transuersae quae est in medio uentosae: ut sit accensus ignis circiter inferiorem partem uentosae, ut non comburatur corpus infirmi.	However, the quality of placing this boil with fire on a limb is such that you should light a linen wick or a small candle from wax and place it on the middle of the transverse rod which is in the middle of the boil: so that the burning fire may be about the lower part of the boil, lest the sick body be burned.
Deinde ponatur super membrum: et digitus sit super foramen quod dixi, donec quando tenemus uentosam: dum indigemus, auferamus digitum, et egredietur uapor super illud foramen, et soluetur uentosa statim.	Then place it on the limb and let your finger be above the opening that I mentioned until you hold the boil; while we need something, remove your finger and let the vapor go out through that opening and the boil will be immediately released.
Deinde igni licinium secundum modum suum, et itera eam, si indiges illa.	Then light the linen wick according to its way, and repeat it if you need it.
In Ventosa autem quae administratur in aegritudine pleuresis cum aqua, non est uirga transuersa, neque foramen: et non administratur, nisi quia impletur aqua, et ponitur super membrum tantum.	However, the boil that is administered in the disease of pleurisy with water does not have a crosswise rod nor an opening: and it is not administered unless it is filled with water and is placed only on the limb.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et haec Ventosa quanto plus est magna, ut capiat aquam multam, est melior.	And this boil, the more it is large so that it can hold a lot of water, is better.
¶ De suspensione Sanguisugarum.	¶ On the Suspension of Bloodlettings.
Caput XCIX.	Chapter 99.
Sanguisugae non administrantur in pluribus, nisi in quibus membris non est possibilis positio uentosarum, propter paruitatem eorum, sicut labium, et gingiua, et eis similia.	Bloodlettings are not administered on many parts of the body, unless on those where it is not possible to place boils due to their smallness, such as the lip and gum and similar things.
Aut in membro denudato a carne, sicut digitus, et nasus, et eis similia.	Or on a bare limb without flesh, such as the finger, and nose, and similar things.
Et qualitas utendi eis est: ut ueneris ex Sanguisugis quae sunt in aquis dulcibus, mundis a putredinibus.	And the quality of using them is: that you should take from bloodlettings which are in sweet waters, purified from putrid things.
Deinde dimittantur die et nocte in aqua dulci, donec famelicae sint, et non remaneat in uentre earum aliquid.	Then they are left in sweet water day and night until they are famished, and nothing remains in their bellies.
Deinde euacuetur corpus in primis cum phlebotomia, et cum uentosis.	Then the body is cleansed first with bloodletting and with poultices.
Deinde absterge membrum infirmi, donec rubeat.	Then wash the afflicted member until it turns red.
Postea ponantur super ipsum.	Then place them on top of it.
Cum ergo implentur, et cadunt, et est possibilis suctio loci cum uentosa, tunc est magis ultimum in iuuamento: et si non, tunc ablue locum cum aceto.	When they are filled and fall away, and it is possible to suck the area with a poultice, then it is more beneficial for healing. And if not, then wash the area with vinegar.
Deinde cum aqua multa, et fricetur, et exprimatur.	Then with much water, it is rubbed and expressed.
Quod si prolongatur cursus sanguinis post casum Sanguisugarum, et est illud resudando: tunc infunde pannum lini in aqua frigida, et pone ipsum desuper, donec abscindatur resudatio.	But if the flow of blood is prolonged after the injury, and it is that which is flowing away by itself: then pour a linen cloth into cold water, and place it on top, until the bleeding subsides.
Quod si multiplicatur sanguis, tunc pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, aut gallas, et similia eis ex stipticis: donec abscindatur sanguis.	But if the blood multiplies, then powder of alum or gallnuts and similar substances from styptics are sprinkled on top, until the bleeding subsides.
Aut ponantur super locum medietates fabarum excorticatarum: et dimittantur, donec adhaereant fabae in loco, nam sanguis abscinditur.	Or place the midriff of peeled figs on top and leave them until they stick to the place, for the blood subsides.
Et oportet si necessaria est iteratio Sanguisugarum, quando est possibile, mutare eas.	And it is necessary if a repetition of Sanguisugarum is needed, whenever possible, to change them.
Si autem prohibentur Sanguisugae a suspensione, tunc abstergatur locus cum sanguine recenti.	But if the bloodsuckers are prevented from suspending, then clean the place with fresh blood.
Aut fige acum in locis, donec egrediatur aliquid ex sanguine.	Or fix a quill in the places until something comes out of the blood.
Deinde ponantur, nam ipsae quando sentiunt aliquid ex sanguine, adhaerent statim.	Then place them, for when they feel something coming from the blood, they adhere immediately.
Quando ergo uis ut cadant, pulueriza super eas aliquid ex aloe trito, aut salem, aut cinerem: et cadent statim.	When you want them to fall, sprinkle something from ground aloes or salt or ash on top of them: and they will fall immediately.
¶ Partis Secundae Finis.	End of the Second Part.
¶ Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars III.	The Book of Surgery by Albucasis, Part III.
¶ Sermo uniuersalis de restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus.	A general discourse on restoration, and dislocation, and cure of twisting and similar things.
Caput I.	Here is the translation:
Hoc Capitulum etiam multotiens est necessarium in arte Medicinae, et est restauratio fracturae, et dislocationis accidentium in ossibus.	This chapter is also very necessary in the art of medicine, and it is a restoration of fractures and dislocations of bones.
Scitote o Filii, quia iactant se de hoc Capitulo stolidi medicorum et uulgi, et qui non inspexerunt unquam antiquorum librum, neque legerunt ex eo literam.	Know this, sons, that foolish doctors and the common crowd boast about this chapter, and those who have never looked at an old book nor read a letter from it.
Et propter hanc caussam fit, quod iste modus ex scientiis in terra nostra est priuatus.	And because of this reason, our country is deprived of this method based on knowledge.
Et ego non obuiaui in eo unquam bono omnino, et non adeptus sum ex eo illud, quod sum adeptus nisi propter longitudinem lectionis librorum antiquorum, et studium super intellectum eorum, donec extraxi scientiam illius ex eis.	And I have not opposed it anywhere entirely, and I have not obtained from it what I have obtained unless by the length of reading old books and studying their understanding, until I extracted that science from them.
Deinde adhaesi experimento et studio longitudine uitae meae.	Then I adhered to experimentation and study throughout the length of my life.
Et iam descripsi uobis ex illo in hoc Capitulo totum quod continet scientia mea: et super quod praeteriit experimentum meum, postquam abbreuiaui illud uobis, et liberaui illud ex occupatione elongationis, et abbreuiaui illud fine abbreuiationis, et ostendi illud fine declinationis: et formaui in eo formas multas ex formis instrumentorum quae administrantur in eo, cum sit ex additione declinationis, sicut feci in duobus Capitulis praecedentibus.	And now I have described to you everything that contains my knowledge in this chapter: and beyond what I have shortened for you, and freed from the occupation of elongation, and shortened at the end of shortening, and showed at the end of declination: and shaped many forms in it from the forms of instruments used in it, as I did in the two preceding chapters.
¶ Summae, et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessaria est, antequam incipiamus rememorationem membrorum fractorum, et diuersorum, si uniuscuiusque.	General and collections from the being of bone fractures, from those whose preliminary necessity is necessary before we begin to recall the broken members and different ones if each.
Caput II.	Head II.
Oportet, ut dicamus in prologo huius Capituli, summas sermonis, et capitula, ad quarum intellectum cogitur in primis artifex ad stationem super earum ueritatem: scilicet ut uos, et qui sunt prompti, sciant, uel addiscant hanc artem nobilem, et alii a uobis.	It is necessary that we say the summary of this chapter and its headings, so that the craftsman may first grasp their understanding: namely, that you and those who are ready may know or learn this noble art from you.
Dico, ergo, quod quando accidit alicui fractura, aut dislocatio, aut torsio, aut casus: tunc oportet, ut properes in primis ad phlebotomandum eum, et soluendum ipsum, aut utraque simul: si non prohibeat aliquid, sicut debilitas uirtutis: aut est ille cui accidit aliquid ex illis puer, aut senex decrepitus: aut est tempus uehementis caloris, aut uehementis frigoris ualde.	I say therefore, that when any fracture, dislocation, or twisting, or fall occurs to someone: then it is necessary for the physician in the first place to bleed him, and dissolve him, or both at once: unless something prevents it, such as a lack of vital energy; or if he is a child, or an old decrepit person; or if there is a time of very great heat, or very great cold.
Deinde sit contentus in cibo suo, oleribus frigidis, et carnibus auium, et haedorum: et prohibe uinum, et carnes grossas, et repleri ex cibis et omni cibo qui replet uenas sanguine.	Then he should be content with his food, cold vegetables, and bird meats, and fowl. And let him abstain from wine, and fat meats, and fill himself with foods and all foods that fill the veins with blood.
Donec quando securus sis ex apostemate calido, et non times effusionem materiei ad membrum: tunc redeat infirmus ad regimen suum primum cum quo cucurrit consuetudo eius.	Until you are secure from the boil's heat and do not fear discharge onto the member; then the patient should return to his original regimen with which he was accustomed.
Cum ergo incipit os fractum restaurari, tunc oportet, ut cibetur infirmus cibis nutrientibus nutrimento multo, grosso, graui, in quibus sit uiscositas: sicut cibaria facta ex tritico cocto cum aqua, et rizum, et capita, et pedes, et uentres uaccarum, et oua, et pisces recentes: et uinum grossum, et similia illis.	When the broken bone is being restored, then it is necessary for the patient to be nourished with nourishing foods in large quantities, thick, heavy, and having a slimy consistency. For example, food made from cooked wheat with water, and rice, and meat of sheep, goats, and cattle, and eggs, and fresh fish: and strong wine, and similar things.
Cum hoc enim regimine fit coagulatio fracturae uelocius, et melius.	For in this regimen the coagulation of the fracture occurs more quickly and better.
Et scias, quod ossa fracta, quando sunt in uiris qui sunt in prima senectute, et decrepitis, non est possibile, ut continuentur et consolidentur secundum naturam suam semper, propter exiccationem membrorum eorum: et consolidantur et continuantur quae ex eis sunt in fine lenitatis, sicut ossa puerornm paruorum.	And know that fractured bones, when they are in individuals who are in the first stage of old age and decrepitude, it is not possible for them to be kept and consolidated according to their natural state always, because of the drying up of their limbs; and those which come from them at the end of softness, like the bones of young children.
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.	However, nature joins something similar to glue over the fractured bone from all sides, which has thickness, so that it sticks and binds itself until it is completely glued together and bound together, until it comes to the end of strength and firmness, just as it was in the beginning, unless something prevents it from performing its functions; and for this reason, it is necessary to provide the patient with nourishing foods which have gravity, sliminess, and thickness, as we said.
Et scias, quod fracturae species sunt diuersae, secundum diuersitatem membrorum: quoniam fractura cruris, est diuersa a fractura ossis capitis: et fractura ossis pectoris, est diuersa a fractura ossis dorsi: et similiter reliqua membra omnia diuersa existunt adinuicem: et ego ueni cum rememoratione omnis speciei fracturae expositae in Capitulo suo distinctae ab alia.	And know that there are diverse species of fractures, according to the diversity of limbs; for a fracture of the leg is different from a fracture of the skull: and a fracture of the breastbone is different from a fracture of the backbone: and similarly all other members exist differently one from another: and I come with an exposition of every species of fracture in its own chapter, distinguished from another.
Et diuersificantur species fracturae ossis etiam in seipsa.	And the kinds of bone fracture are differentiated even within themselves.
Quoniam fit fractura eius arcuata, praeter quod accidant in ea astellae.	Because it happens to be a curved fracture, besides which stars occur in it.
Et quandoque fit fractura eius secundum longitudinem ossis: et sunt fracturae eius satagiae, id est, astellae, et additiones procedentes, sicut sunt in calamo, cum aptatur cultello ad scribendum.	And sometimes it happens to be a fracture along the length of the bone: and there are fractures like these, that is, stars, and additions proceeding, just as they are on a reed, when it is adapted to writing with a pen.
Et non procedentes: et est fractura cum uulnere et disruptione in capite: et est fractura fissura parua.	And not proceeding: and there is a fracture with wound and disruption at the head: and there is a fracture, small crack.
Et omni speciei est ingenium, uel instrumentum proprium in restauratione eius, secundum quod ueniet rememoratio eius, distincta in locis suis.	And every kind of it has its own technique or tool for restoration, according to the memory of it, distinguished in its own places.
Et ex eo quo cognoscitur fractura ossis, est tortuositas eius, et ipsius eminentia: et apparitio eius sensui, et sonitus eius quando comprimis ipsum manu tua.	And from the fact that a bone fracture is known, its tortuousness and prominence are evident: and its appearance becomes apparent to the sense, and its sound when you press it with your hand.
Quando ergo non est in loco tortuositas apparens, neque sonitus apud tactum tuum cum tangis os cum agitatione, neque inuenit infirmus magnum dolorem: tunc non est illic fractura, imo possibile est, ut sit tortuositas, aut fissura parua: non ergo oportet, ut moueas ipsum cum manu et compressione omnino, imo pone super ipsum ex medicinis, quarum uenit rememoratio, post momentum illud quod conuenit loco: deinde stringatur strictura subtili.	When therefore there is no apparent tortuousness in the place, nor a sound when you touch it with your hand as you palpate, nor does an invalid find great pain: then there is no fracture there, indeed it may be that there is a tortuosness or small crack. Therefore do not move it at all with your hand and compression, but put something over it from the medicines of which there comes a recollection, after the moment that corresponds to the place: then let it be bound with a subtle bandage.
Et scias, quod locus quando arcuatur, et scinditur in duo, praeter quod accidant in eo satagiae, uerumtamen remouetur omnis pars a compari sua: tunc oportet tibi, ut incipias ab hora tua ad rectificationem eius, aequando ipsum antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And know that when the place is curved and split into two, besides which stars occur in it, yet every part is removed from its companion: then you must begin at your own hour to correct it, equalizing it before a warm abscess occurs.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum, tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec quiescat apoestema.	But if a warm abscess occurs, then leave it for several days until the abscess subsides.
Deinde aequa ipsum secundum quemcunque modum potest ex lenitate et ingenio.	Then equalize it according to any method possible through gentleness and ingenuity.
Et scias, quod restauratio eius, et ipsius aequatio, est facilior quam ossis, in quo accidunt satagiae.	And know that the restoration of it and its equalization is easier than for bones where stars occur.
Deinde stringe ipsum, secundum quod ueniet tibi rememoratio eius.	Then bind it up, according as its recollection comes to you.
Si uero in osse sunt satagiae, tunc necessaria est extensio huius membri fracti ex duabus partibus, si manus sit, aut pes: aut cum manu tua, si membrum est paruum: aut cum duobus funibus, aut cum fune et manu.	If there are swellings in the bone, then it is necessary to extend this broken member from two parts, if it be a hand or foot: or with your own hand, if the limb is small: or with two ropes, or with a rope and one hand.
Et sit positio tua qua ponis membrum super locum aequalem, secundum figuram suam naturalem, donec quando extenduntur partes membri fracti: tunc conare, ut redire facias illas additiones omni ingenio, et secundum quemcunque modum potes in locis suis: et caue secundum fortitudinem tuam, ne accidat super infirmum per operationem tuam dolor, neque laesio: et conare secundum fortitudinem tuam, ut applices unum duorum ossium cum socio suo, secundum meliores formas.	And be in a position where you place the limb on an equal place, according to its natural shape, until the parts of the broken member are extended: then try to make those additions return by all means, and in any way you can, in their own places: and beware, according to your strength, lest pain or injury occur over a weak person through your operation; and try, according to your strength, to apply one bone to its fellow, according to better forms.
Et oportet in illa hora, ut tentes et tangas ipsum manu tua.	And it is necessary at that time to test and touch it with your own hand.
Si ergo uides illic aliquid diuersum, rectifica ipsum, et aequa illud per quantitatem tuae uirtutis.	If then you see something different there, correct it, and make it equal by the measure of your own virtue.
Et caue extensionem uehementem, et compressionem fortem, sicut faciunt multi stolidorum.	And beware of excessive extension and strong compression, as many foolish people do.
Multotiens enim faciunt accidere per operationem illam suam apostema calidum, aut contractionem in membro: sicut iam uidimus illud ex operationibus eorum multotiens.	For indeed they often cause to occur through their own operation an apostema of warmth or a contraction in the member: just as we have already seen many times from their operations.
Deinde annecte post aequationem, et decentem operationem, et stricturam illius membri, et quietem, et tranquillitatem: et mone infirmum super ipsum.	Then bind it after equality and proper operation, and the binding of that member, and rest, and calmness: and warn the weak person above it.
Et fac ipsum cauere, ne moueat ipsum in hora suarum uigiliarum, et somni sui apud reuolutionem suam, et agitationem suam, et apud egestionem suam, et omnes motus suos ultima uirtute sua.	And make it so that it does not move during its hours of wakefulness, and sleep at the time of its rotation, and agitation, and at the time of its emission, and all its movements with its greatest strength.
Et ut caueat, ne sit positio membri positio cum qua sequatur dolor.	And that it may beware, lest the position of the member be a position that follows pain.
Quod est, quia quando sentit in dispositione positionis membri dolorem, aut laesionem: tunc oportet, ut permutes ipsum ad dispositionem aliam ab illa cum qua non sentiat dolorem.	Which is because when it feels pain or injury in the position of the member, then it is necessary to change it into another position from that one with which it does not feel pain.
Et caue cum illo, ut sit positio eius illa aequalis, recta: ut non accidat in membro tortuositas, quando restauratur.	And beware that his position is equal and straight: so that there may not be tortuosity in the member when it is restored.
Et qualitas stricturae membri fracti est, secundum quod narro.	And the quality of the fracture of a broken member is, as I narrate.
Scias, quod membra fracta diuersificantur in paruitate sua, et eorum magnitudine, et ipsorum forma.	Know that broken members are differentiated by their smallness, and their magnitude, and their shape.
Quae ergo ex eis sunt parua, sicut brachium, et digitus, et focile, et similia eis, tunc oportet, ut sit inuolutio panni mollis, subtilis.	What then are small ones, such as an arm, and a finger, and a foot, and similar things; then it is necessary that there be wrapping with a soft, thin cloth.
Quae autem ex eis sunt grossa, sicut coxa, et crus, oportet ut sit in eis inuolutio lata, dura.	What however are large ones, such as the hip and the thigh; it is necessary that there be wrapping with a wide, thick cloth.
Quoniam ligamentum latum, connectit membrum magnum, et stringit ipsum ab omni parte strictura aequali, ita quod non ingreditur ipsum macula.	Because the broad band connects a large member and tightens it equally from all parts of its fracture, so that no blemish enters it.
Deinde incipe post euacuationem tuam ab aequatione ponere linimentum conueniens ad illud, in stuppa leni super locum fracturae ipsius.	Then begin to place the suitable ointment after your evacuation on top of the fracture site, in a soft lump over the location of the break itself.
Deinde incipe inuoluere ligamentum super locum fracturae ipsius tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod meretur membrum: et stringe manum tuam parumper cum ligamento.	Then begin to wrap the bandage three or four times over the location of the break itself, according to what the member deserves; and bind your hand for a little while with the bandage.
Deinde uade cum eo ad partem superiorem a loco fracturae, et stringe minus quam fuit strictura tua, qua strinxisti locum fractum.	Then go with him to the upper part above the site of the break and bind less tightly than your previous binding which you used to tighten the broken location.
Deinde elonga te cum inuolutione a loco fracturae parumper, et mollifica stricturam paulatim, donec capias ex loco sano rem magnam.	Then stretch yourself with the wrapping away from the site of the break for a little while and soften the tension gradually until you reach a healthy part.
Deinde accipe uittam aliam, et inuolue eam iterum super locum fractum inuolutionibus.	Then take another cloth and wrap it again over the broken location with wrappings.
Postea uade cum inuolutione ad partem inferiorem a fractura.	Afterwards go with the wrapping to the lower part below the break.
Et sit operatio tua in strictura inuolutionis, et mollificatione eius, secundum quod diximus in inuolutione prima superiore.	And let your operation be in binding and softening it, according to what we said in the first wrapping above.
Deinde pone inter inuolutiones ex stuppa leni, aut panno, cum quo aequetur tortuositas fracturae, si est in ea tortuositas: et si non, non ponas in ea aliquid.	Then place something soft, such as a rag or cloth, between the wrappings to straighten out any tortuosity of the break if it exists; and if not, do not put anything there.
Deinde inuolue super ipsam uittam aliam.	Then wrap another one over it.
Postea aequa super has inuolutiones astellas decenter factas statim, si non est in loco inflatio, neque apostema calidum.	Next, place equal numbers of astylia on top of these bandages, made thirty days previously, immediately if there is no swelling or warm abscess.
Si autem in ea est inflatio, aut apostema: tunc pone super eam quod sedet illud apostema, et auferat inflationem: et dimitte eam aliquot diebus.	But if there is swelling or abscess in it: then place what covers the abscess on top of it and remove the swelling: and leave it for a few days.
Deinde stringe super ipsam tunc astellas.	Then tie over it, those astylia.
Et sint Astellae ex medietatibus cannae latae, rasae, formatae sapienter: aut sint ex ligno unde fiunt cribra, quae fiunt ex pino, aut geraid, id est, ramis palmae, aut calingi: et sit amplitudo omnis Astellae, secundum hanc formam, et hanc eandem figuram.	And let the astylia be made from the middle of a wide cane, smoothed and cleverly shaped: or they can be made from wood which is used to make sieve baskets, or pine, or geraid, that is, palm branches, or calingi: and let the width of every astyla be according to this shape and same figure.
Verumtamen oportet, ut Astella quae ponitur super ipsam tracturam, sit grossior et latior parumper, quam reliquae Astellae: et longitudo Astellae sit secundum quod licet membro ex magnitudine et paruitate.	However, it is necessary that the astyla which is placed over the bandage be slightly thicker and wider than the other astyliae: and the length of the astyla should be according to what allows the member to be proportioned in size and smallness.
Deinde stringe super Astellas cum uitta alia, secundum stricturam primam eandem.	Then tie over the astylae with another bandage, according to the first tightening.
Deinde liga desuper cum filis decenter, secundum quod diximus de strictura: et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae plus: et quanto plus elongatur a fractura sit, strictura minor.	Then bind above with threads thirty days old, according to what we said about tightening: and it is that your tightening should be over the site of the fracture more, and as far as you stretch away from the fracture, the tightening should be less.
Et oportet, ut sint fila media in grossitudine et subtilitate, et sint ex lino molli.	And it is necessary that the threads be of medium thickness and subtlety, and they should be made from soft flax.
Quoniam si fila sunt grossa, sicut uidi ex operatione stolidorum ponentium fila sua ex chordis lini tortis, est error magnus: quoniam cadit strictura cum eis extra qualitatem.	For if the threads are thick, as I have seen from the operations of ignorant practitioners who place their threads made from twisted flax strings, it is a great mistake: because the tightening falls outside the proper quality.
Et fila subtilia iterum non conueniunt: quoniam tu non consequeris per stricturam cum eis illud quod uis.	And thin threads do not fit again: because you do not achieve through tightening with them what you desire.
Et non oportet, ut sit inter astellam et astellam minus quam digitus.	And it is not necessary that there be less than a finger's width between the astylae.
Quod si laeditur infirmus per extremitates astellarum post stricturam in locis sanis: tunc pone sub eis ex stuppa leni, aut lana carminata, donec nihil laedatur ex illo.	If the patient is injured by the extremities of stars after constriction in healthy places: then place under them a piece of soft stuff or fluffed wool until nothing is hurt from that.
Quando autem est fractura cum uulnere, et accidit disruptio in cute, ego ueniam cum rememoratione eius in capitulo secundum singularitatem.	However, when there is a fracture with an injury, and the skin is torn apart, I come with his recollection in the second chapter by way of individuality.
Et scias, quod non omne membrum fractum oportet ut stringatur cum astellis a primo die.	And know that not every broken member needs to be bound with stars from the first day.
Quod est, quia membrum quando est magnum, non oportet ut ponas superipsum astellas, nisi post quinque dies, aut septem, aut plus, secundum securitatem tuam ab euentu apostematis calidi.	For it is because a member when it is large does not need to be placed with stars above it, unless after five days, or seven, or more, according to the security you have from the outcome of an apostematous heat.
Et iste est modus emplastrorum, quibus restaurabant antiqui, quae ponuntur super fracturam et dislocationem.	And this is the method of plasters which the ancients used to restore, which are placed over a fracture and dislocation.
¶ Modus Emplastri communis abbreuiati, restaurans fracturam, conueniens pluribus complexionibus, praecipue mulieribus, et pueris: quoniam est ex eo super quod non uincit calor, neque frigus.	The common plaster method for abbreviating, restoring a fracture, suitable for many complexions, especially women and children, since it is above what neither heat nor cold can overcome.
Et est, ut accipias ex puluere molendini, et est medulla farinae quae pendet in parietibus molendini apud motum molae: et conficias ipsum sicut est, praeter quod cribelles ipsum cum albugine oui: et pone confectionem eius non spissam, neque subtilem.	And it is, to take from the mill dust, and that is the wheat flour pulp which hangs on the walls of the mill during the movement of the millstone: and prepare it as it is, except that you will sift it with a whiteness of egg white; and place its preparation not thick nor thin.
Deinde utere eo.	Then use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, restaurantis fracturam, et dislocationem, et torsionem.	The other plaster method for restoring a fracture, and dislocation, and twisting.
Recipe almess, et laudani, et acaciae, et enulae, et mugath: et suc, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V et alethil ʒ XX terantur omnia, et cribellentur, et misceantur cum aqua alethil: aut cum albugine oui, si complexio infirmi est calefacta.	Recipe of almonds, and laurel, and acacia, and enula, and mugwort: and the juice of all 10 parts myrrh, and aloe of both 5 parts each, and mix all together 20 times, and sift them, and mix with alethil water; or with egg white if the patient's complexion is heated.
Deinde utere hoc emplastro.	Then use this plaster.
Nam ipsum est bonae compositionis, restaurat ossa fracta uelociter, et confert pluribus hominibus.	For it is good for composition, quickly restores broken bones and is beneficial to many people.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, quod etiam confert fracturae et torsioni.	Another method of plugging, which also helps with fractures and twisting.
Recipe mugath, et mess, et alteae albae, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V acaciae ʒ VI boli armeni ʒ XX terantur omnia contritione multa, et cribellentur, et conficiantur cum aqua, aut albugine oui: et administrentur.	Recipe of myrrh, and cinnamon, and white alum, equal quantities of each; and of Armenian bole, twenty times as much; all are to be pounded much and sifted and mixed with water or egg-white, and administered.
¶ Modus Emplastri ad iuncturas, et ossa separata ex locis suis: et sedat dolorem accidentem eis, et scissuram ossis, et fracturam.	Another method of plugging for joints, and separated bones in their proper places; and it calms the accidental pain, and bone splitting, and fracture.
Sumatur lana succida, et submergatur in aceto, et oleo decocto: et ponatur super locum.	They take succulent wool and immerse it in vinegar and boiled oil; and place it on the spot.
Et in hoc quidem Emplastro non est uirtus restaurationis, sed est bonum in sedatione apostematis calidi: et expellit dolores proprie.	And in this plaster there is no power of restoration, but it is good for the sedation of hot apostumes and it expels pains properly.
¶ Modus Emplastri, quod restaurat os fractum.	Another method of plugging that restores a broken bone.
Sume folia fici surdi, et folia papaueris syluestris: et tere omnia, et fac emplastrum ex utrisque.	Take mulberry leaves and leaves of papaver silvestre; and grind all, and make a plaster from both.
¶ Modus Emplastri abbreuiati, administrati apud restaurationem fracturae ossis: et quando tu uis resolutionem residui apostematis.	Another method of plugging abbreviated for administering in the restoration of a broken bone: and when you wish to dissolve the residue of an apostume.
Recipe radicis alteae, et camomillae, et florum uiolarum, et farinae herbi, omnium ana partem unam: terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum uino, si non est membrum calefactum.	Recipe of white aloes root, and chamomile, and violet flowers, and herb flour; all equal parts; pound all and mix with wine, unless the member is inflamed.
Si uero est calefactum, tunc confice illud cum aqua coriandri humidi, aut cum aqua, et utere eo.	If it is inflamed, then mix it with moist coriander water, or with water, and use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius fortioris in resolutione, quam istud primum, quando accidit apostema durum apud restaurationem membri.	Another method of plugging stronger than the first one for resolution, when a hard apostume occurs during restoration of the member.
Recipe radicis alteae, et seminis lini, et balaustiae, et melliloti, et samsuci, et floris uiolarum, et camomillae, omnium ana, partem unam, terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum aqua salicis, aut cum aqua dulci, aut cum uino.	Recipe of white aloes root, and linseed, and balm-leaves, and melilot, and samphucus, and violet flowers, and chamomile; all equal parts; pound all and mix with willow water, or with sweet water, or with wine.
Totum illud secundum caliditatem membri, et quietem caloris eius.	This entire thing according to the heat of the member and the calmness of its warmth.
Hippocrates uero non dixit in libro suo, quod ponatur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius, nisi caerotum factum ex caera, et oleo: non aliud: et narrauit, ut sit medium inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem.	Hippocrates, however, did not say in his book that anything should be placed on a fractured member during its restoration except for a mixture made from cerate and oil, nothing else; and he narrated that it should be the middle between thickness and thinness.
Galeno autem uisum est, ut ponantur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius res, in quibus est exiccatio caliditatis, sicut myrrha, et aloes et olibanum, et similia eis ex eis quae narrauimus.	However, Galen thought that things should be placed on a fractured member during its restoration, in which there is the cooling of heat, such as myrrh, and aloes, and frankincense, and similar things to those we have narrated.
¶ Modus Emplastri quod confert ad laesionem et dolorem.	The Method of Making a Plaster that Relieves Injury and Pain.
Recipe mugath, et ciceris, et capillorum hominis incisorum, aut pennae auis, et alteae, et salis partes aequales: terantur, et cribellentur, et conficiantur: et fiat ex eo emplastrum.	Recipe of equal parts of mugwort, cypress, human hair clippings, or bird's feathers, and wormwood: grind them, sift them, and make a plaster from it.
Quantitas autem secundum quam oportet, ut remaneat ligatura, deinde soluatur, est, ut consideres tunc, si non accidit infirmo dolor, neque pruritus, neque mouetur os fractum a loco suo: tunc non resoluas ipsum diebus multis.	However, the quantity should be such that the bandage remains intact and then loosens, namely, you should consider whether the injured person does not experience pain or itching, nor does the fractured bone move from its place; then do not dissolve it for many days.
Quod si accidat ei in loco pruritus uehemens, aut dolor inquietans, aut inflatio: tunc propera, et solue in hora ipsum, et aufer emplastrum ab eo: et accipe pannum lenem, aut spongiam marinam lenem, humidam: et submerge eam in aqua tepida, et ablue cum ea locum, donec quiescat pruritus, et sedetur dolor.	But if it happens to him that there is intense itching or distressing pain or swelling in the place; then hasten and dissolve it in an hour, and remove the plaster from him: and take a soft cloth or a marine sponge, damp; and submerge it in warm water, and wash with it the place until the itching subsides and the pain is alleviated.
Deinde dimitte membrum quiescere una hora.	Then let the member rest for one hour.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam succidam, submersam in aceto et oleo, aut oleo rosato: et liga super ipsum nocte una, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido, et quiescat inflatio membri, et remoueatur dolor eius.	Then place a skinned wool over it, submerged in vinegar and oil, or rose-colored oil; and bind it on at night for one night, until you are secure from hot aposteme, and the swelling of the member ceases, and the pain is removed.
Deinde itera ipsum ad stricturam subtilem, et emplastrum paruum: et non stringas ipsum constrictione tua prima, et subtilia cum eo, donec sanetur.	Then repeat this on him with a fine bandage and a small plaster; and do not bind it tight with your first constriction and subtlety, until he is healed.
Quod si uides, quod apostema, et rubedo, et dolor, et inflatio, et omnia accidentia iam remota sunt penitus, et indiges emplastro et strictura, tunc itera illud sicut fecisti in primis aequaliter.	If you see that the abscess, redness, pain, swelling, and all other attendant symptoms have been entirely removed, and you are still desirous of applying an ointment and constriction, then repeat what you did at first evenly.
Quod si non accidit membro aliquid ex eis quae diximus, tune non soluas ipsum, nisi post tres dies, aut quatuor, aut quinque, aut septem.	If nothing of what we have said happens to the member, then do not cut it off unless after three days, or four, or five, or seven.
Et quando que dimittitur uiginti diebus totum illud, secundum quod apparet tibi ex solutione membri, sicut diximus, donec quando adhaeret fractura, et approximat coagulatio carnis super eam: adde etiam tunc in strictura plus quam strictura tua prima tota: et adde etiam in ingrossatione cibi infirmi, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius.	And when the whole of it is removed after twenty days, according to what appears to you from the solution of the member, as we said, until when the fracture adheres and the coagulation of flesh comes together over it: add also then in constriction more than your first constriction altogether; and add also in the fattening of the patient's food, according to what has been mentioned before.
Si autem uides locum fracturae iam exiccari, et extenuari plus quam oportet: tunc scias, quod nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad ipsum.	But if you see the place of the fracture already drying out and wasting away more than it should: then know that nourishment is prevented from reaching it.
Embroca ergo ipsum cum aqua tepida apud omnem uicem qua soluis ipsum, et sit illud in omnibus tribus diebus, et alleuia stricturam parumper.	So then apply it with warm water all around as you dissolve it, and let that be for three days, and then ease the constriction a little.
Per hanc ergo operationem currit ad membrum nutrimentum, et sanatur uelociter.	Through this operation, nourishment reaches the member, and it is quickly healed.
Illud autem quod faciunt stolidi restauratores ex fractura membri uice alia, quando non restauratur in primis, secundum quod oportet, et restauratur secundum tortuositatem, est error ex operatione eorum, et timor magnus: et si esset rectum, dixissent illud antiqui in libris suis, et operati fuissent cum eo.	But those who are simple and unskilled in setting fractures, when the member does not set right at first, according to what is fitting, but sets wrong, this is an error of their operation, and a great fear: and if it were right, they would have said so in their books, and operated with that.
Et ego non uidi alicubi eorum uestigium in illo omnino, et rectius est, ut non fiat illud.	And I did not see anywhere the slightest trace of theirs in this at all, and it is better that it not be done.
¶ De factura accidente in capite.	Of the treatment of an accidental wound on the head.
Caput III.	Chapter III.
Species fracturae sunt diuersae, et figurae eius multae: et caussae eius sunt distinctae.	The species of fracture are diverse, and its forms many: and the causes thereof are distinct.
Nam ex fractura est quae fit a percussione cum ense: et percussio aufert os totum usquequo peruenit ad siphac, quod est sub osse, sicut facit axia in ligno: et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Axialis.	For there is a fracture which occurs by percussion with an instrument: and the percussion takes away the whole bone as far as it reaches to the siphac, which is beneath the bone, just as an axle does in wood: and because of this it is called this species of fracture Axialis.
Aut ensis incidit quiddam ossis, et incidit faciem eius, et non penetrat incisio usque ad ultimum eius: et nominatur haec species fracturae Kalaan, id est, Leuatio absolute.	Or the blade falls upon some bone, and it cuts its face, and the cut does not reach to the very end of it; and this kind of fracture is called Kalaan, that is, a complete splitting.
Et est uulnus duarum fracturarum, aut magnum, aut paruum.	And it is a wound of two fractures, or great, or small.
Et ex fractura est, quae est contritio, aut attritio: et caussa eius est percussio cum lapide, aut casus super lapidem, aut eis similia.	And from a fracture is one which is crushing or grinding: and the cause of it is percussion with a stone, or falling upon a stone, or similar things.
Et haec fractura est etiam aut penetrans, quae iam appropinquat panniculo, quod est sub osse: aut est in facie ossis: et est uulnus harum duarum fracturarum etiam aut paruum, aut magnum.	And this fracture is also either piercing, which already approaches the membrane, which is beneath the bone; or it is on the face of the bone: and it is a wound of these two fractures, whether small or great.
Et ex fractura est, quae est occulta in osse in subtilitate capilli: et est fissura parua, et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Capillaris.	And from a fracture is one which is hidden in the bone in subtlety of hair: and it is a small crack, and because of this it is called this kind of fracture Capillaris.
Et ex eis est fractura, quae fit a casu, aut percussione lapidis, et eis similium, quae faciunt ingredi laminam ossis ad interiora, et fit loco concauitas: sicut accidit caldariis aeris, quando occurrit eis percussio, et ingreditur pars eorum ad interiora.	And from these is a fracture which occurs by a fall, or percussion with a stone, and similar things, which make the plate of bone to enter the inner parts, and it becomes concave: just as happens in cauldrons of air when they are struck and part of them enters the interior.
Et plurimum quidem fit illud in capitibus humidorum ossium, sicut sunt capita puerorum.	And indeed this occurs most frequently in the heads of hollow bones, such as those of children.
Et fiunt omnibus istis speciebus fracturae satagiae separatae, et ego ueniam cum rememoratione illius totius in loco suo.	And all these species of fractures are separate and I come with a reminder of the whole in its place.
Et cognoscimus omnes has species fracturae per detectionem super eam, et inquisitionem earum cum tentis, et ablationem carnium corruptarum, quae sunt super eas.	And we know all these species of fractures through examination above them and inquiry into them with probes, and removal of corrupted flesh that is above them.
Species uero Capillaris cognoscitur per hoc, quod detegitur super os, et abstergitur, et linitur super ipsum cum encaustro: fractura enim apparet nigra.	The species indeed Capillaris is known by this, that it is uncovered above the bone, and wiped away, and anointed above it with encaustic: for the fracture appears black.
In curatione autem fracturae, considera in primis accidentia infirmi: tunc si uides ex accidentibus quod significet significatione manifesta super timorem, sicut uomitus cholerae, et extensio, et amissio intellectus, et abscisio uocis, et syncopis, et febris acuta, et egressus oculorum, et rubedo eorum, et similia eis ex accidentibus in pluribus dispositionibus, proculdubio non sanatur: et si uides accidentia non terrentia te, et speras salutem: tunc incipe curationem eius.	In the treatment of a fracture, consider first the accidents of the patient. Then, if you see from these accidents what signifies in manifest significance over fear, such as vomiting due to cholera, and diarrhea, and loss of intellect, and loss of voice, and syncopes, and acute fever, and discharge of eyes, and redness of them, and similar things from accidents in many dispositions, without a doubt he is not healed. And if you see that these accidents do not frighten you, and you hope for salvation: then begin his treatment.
Quod est, si uenit ad te uulneratus in primis cum uulneratur: et est illud in diebus hyemis, tunc oportet, ut studeas in ablatione ossis ante diem quartumdecimum secundum omnem dispositionem.	What is this, if someone comes to you wounded at first when they are wounded: and it is that on winter days, then it is necessary for you to study in the removal of bone before the fourteenth day according to every disposition.
Et si est in diebus aestatis, tunc oportet, ut properes remouere os ante diem septimum, antequam corrumpatur quod est sub osse ex panniculo, et accidant illa accidentia quae narrauimus.	And if it is on summer days, then it is necessary for you to hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, lest what is beneath the bone is consumed by a membrane and those accidents which we have narrated occur.
Quod si fractura ossis iam peruenit ad panniculum tangentem cerebrum, et est cum minutiis, et attractione: tunc oportet, ut incidas partem comminutam, et attritam, secundum quod narro tibi.	What if the fracture of the bone has already reached the membrane touching the brain, and it is with minute fragments and attraction: then it is necessary for you to cut out the broken and bruised part, according to what I shall tell you.
Et est, ut radas caput uulnerati: et detege super os secundum quemcunque modum possibile est tibi: et secundum figuram uulneris, et quod leue est super infirmum.	And it is, as if you were to shave the head of the wounded person: and wash over the bone in whatever way is possible for you: and according to the shape of the wound, and what is easy on the patient.
Quod si accidat tibi apud detectionem ossis fluxus sanguinis, aut apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet.	What if it happens to you when detecting bone bleeding or warm pus: then apply to him what is necessary.
Et est, ut impleas locum cum pannis infusis in uino, et oleo rosato: et facias quiescere uulnus, donec sedetur apostema, et sis securus a fluxu sanguinis.	And it is, as if you were to fill the place with cloths soaked in wine and rose oil: and make the wound rest, until the pus subsides, and be secure from bleeding.
Deinde incipe in curatione ossis, et ablatione eius.	Then begin in the treatment of the bone and its removal.
Et illud fit secundum unum duorum modorum.	And it is done according to one or two methods.
Modus quidem unus est, ut incidas os cum Incisorio strictae aciei: et haec est forma eius.	One method is, that you cut open the bone with a sharp-edged blade of the Incisorium; and this is its form.
Dende administra Incisorium aliud post Incisorum latius eo parumper: et haec est forma eius.	Then administer another Incisorium, a little wider than the first one after the Incisors; and this is its form.
Deinde administra etiam Incisorium aliud latius etiam quam secundum.	Then also administer an Incisorium, even wider than the second one.
Et modus secundus est, ut sit apud te numerus Incisoriorum diuersorum: quorum quaedam sint latiora quibusdam, et quaedam eorum breuiora quibusdam: et sint in ultimo acuitatis extremitatum suarum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut fuled: et utere facilitate in percussione super Incisorium, ut non concutiat caput, et laedat ipsum.	And the second method is, that you have a number of different Incisorium at your disposal: some are longer than others, and some shorter; and they should be sharp to their very edges, made from iron or steel; and use them with ease in striking on the Incisorium, so as not to shake the head, nor hurt it.
Si autem os est forte, durum: tunc oportet, ut perfores in circumitu eius, antequam tu administres Incisoria, cum Terebris quae nominantur Terebra non profundantia: et non nominantur ita, nisi quoniam ipsa non pertranseunt terminum ossis carnei ad illud, quod est post ipsum: propterea, quod Terebro est extremitas rotunda super illud, quod est sub capite eius acuto, similis margini, et circulus paruus prohibet submergi, et pertransire spissitudinem ossis.	But if the bone is hard and tough, then you must perforate its circumference before administering the Incisorium, with Terebras that are not deep-piercing; and they are not so called except because they do not pass beyond the terminus of the bony part to what lies behind it. This is because the end of the Terebra is rounded above what is under the sharp point of its head, similar to an edge, and a small circle prevents sinking in and piercing the thickness of the bone.
Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis Terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo Terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.	And it is fitting for you to take a large number of these Terebras, each one matching the thickness of the bone, until the present Terebra fits all your cranium: and the sharpness of its rounded end should be in length and shortness according to the thickness of that cranium.
Et haec est forma trium specierum Terebrorum, uel Trepanorum.	And this is the form of three species of Terebras, or Trepanums.
Qualitas autem perforandi in circumitu ossis fracti, est: ut ponas Terebrum super os, et reuoluas ipsum digitis tuis, donec scias, os iam penetratum esse.	The quality of piercing the circumference of a fractured bone is: that you place the Terebra on the bone and turn it with your fingers, until you know the bone has been penetrated.
Deinde permuta Terebrum ad locum alium, et pone quod est inter omne foramen quantitatem grossitudinis radii, aut circiter illud.	Then change the Terebra to another place and put it so that it is between every hole of the same size as the thickness of a radius, or around that.
Deinde incide cum Incisoriis quod est inter omne foramen ex osse: et fac illud subtilius quam potes super illud ex fine leuitatis, sicut diximus, donec eradices os, aut manu tua, aut cum aliquo alio ex quibusdam instrumentis, quae parasti ad illud: sicut tenaliae, et forpices subtiles.	Then cut with the cutting tools which is between every opening from bone; and make it finer than you can on that one from the tip of lightheartedness, as we said, until you eradicate the bone, or by your hand, or with some other instrument among those you prepared for this: such as tenaculae and fine forceps.
Et oportet, ut caueas omni cautela, ne tangat Terebrum, aut Incisorium aliquid ex siphac.	And it is necessary that you beware with all caution, lest the Borer or Cutting Instrument touches anything from the Siphon.
Cum ergo circumieris os perforando, et separatum fuerit a siphac, si fuerit continuum cum eo, et extraxeris ipsum, oportet ut radas, et aeques extremitatem eius quod remanet in osse cum instrumento alio simili Incisorio.	When therefore you have gone around the bone by boring and it has been separated from the siphon, if it was continuous with it, and you have taken it out, it is necessary that you scrape and equalize the end of what remains in the bone with another similar cutting instrument.
Verumtamen oportet, ut sit tenuis et subtilis magis aliis Incisoriis.	However, it should be thin and fine more than other cutting instruments.
Quod si remanet aliquid ex ossibus paruis, et satagiae: tunc accipe ea cum facilitate, cum eo quod est apud te ex instrumentis.	If anything remains from the small bones and fragments: then take them up with ease, along with what is present among your instruments.
Deinde cura uulnus post illud cum liciniis, et unguentis quae diximus.	Then care for the wound after that with licorice and ointments which we said.
Et modus alius operationis est facilis, prorsus longinquus a timore: quem dixit Galenus, et laudauit ipsum laude magna: et iste est sermo eius.	And another method of the operation is easy, quite remote from fear: which Galen said and praised with great praise: and this is his saying.
Necese est tibi in primis, ut incipias detegere partem ossis ex loco, in quo fractura est uehementior, et manifestior: donec quando detexeris illam partem, et posueris sub eo extremitatem huius Incisorii lenticularis, cuius haec est forma.	It is necessary for you first to begin uncovering the part of the bone from the place where the fracture is more violent and manifest: until when you have uncovered that part and placed the end of this lenticular cutting instrument under it, which has this shape.
Et pars lenticularis, lenis non incidit aliquid: et pars acuta eius in duabus lateribus eius uadens in longitudinem, sicut uides: ut sit pars lenticularis innixa ad siphac, facie eius incidente acuta in osse.	And the lenticular part is gentle and does not cut anything: and the sharp part of it goes along both sides of it in length, as you see: so that the lenticular part leans on the siphon, with its acute face cutting into the bone.
Deinde percute super Incisorium a parte una cum malleo paruo, donec incidas totum os cum facilitate, sicut reuoluitur: et tu sis securus ex panniculo, quod non accidat in eo accidens, quod timeas prorsus.	Then strike above the cutting instrument on one side with a small hammer, until you cut through the entire bone with ease, as it yields: and be secure with a cloth, lest anything unfortunate happens to you that you fear most.
Et si medicans non esset stultior hominum, et magis ignarus eius, nec esset dormiens, tunc si remaneret aliquid annexum ossi ex panniculo in quibusdam locis, incideret ipsum ab eo cum extremitate incisorii lenticularis ipsius, et liberaret ipsum ab eo cum facilitate.	And if the surgeon were not more foolish than men, and more ignorant of his craft, nor sleeping, then if anything remained attached to the bone from the linen bandages in certain places, he would cut it away from him with the edge of the lenticular knife and release it with ease.
Liberatur enim ab eo sine nocumento, et absque timore.	He is freed from him without harm, and without fear.
Et si fractura ossis non penetret usque ad panniculum, et illud quod abscinditur ab osse est facies eius, et remanent in ipso asperitas et satagiae subtiles: tunc oportet, ut radas illam asperitatem, et eradices illas satagias cum rasoriis subtilibus ex quibus praeparasti numerum diuersarum quantitatum, ut sit tibi possibile administrare ex eis in omni loco conuenientiora eorum, et rectiora ipsorum, secundum illud ad quod perducit te operatio, et ipsum os fractum, et figura eius.	And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate to the linen, and what is cut away from the bone is its face, and there remain on it roughnesses and subtleties: then it is necessary that you file off that roughness, and eradicate those subtleties with subtle rasps which you prepared in different quantities, so that it will be possible for you to apply them in every place more suitable and correct for each one, according to what the operation leads you to, and the fractured bone, and its shape.
Et oportet, ut administres in rasione tua, qua in primis radis os, latius illorum rasoriorum.	And it is necessary that you apply them according to your own judgment, so that first you file the bone with those more broad rasps.
Deinde utere post ipsum subtiliore eo.	Then use after that a subtler one.
Et non cesses facere illud secundum continuitatem, donec peruenias ad administrandum tenuius, et subtilius eorum omnium.	And do not cease to do this according to continuity, until you arrive at administering more thinly and subtlety of all of them.
In unaquaque autem fissurarum reliquarum paruarum capillarium, et fractura subtili, oportet ut administres curam, secundum illud quod perducit ad rectificationem eius.	In each of the remaining small fissures, and in a subtle fracture, it is necessary that you apply care, according to what leads to its correction.
Et est res quae non occultatur super omnem, cui in hac arte est quodlibet studium, et stetit super illud quod scripsimus, et ostendimus in fracturis magnis.	And it is a thing that does not conceal itself above all, to which every study is devoted in this art, and stands above what we have written and shown in great fractures.
Si autem panniculus detectus retinetur, quando tu eradicas os: tunc oportet, ut accipias pannum lini, secundum quantitatem uulneris, et submerge ipsum in oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super orificium uulneris.	If however the linen strip is detected and retained when you eradicate the bone: then it is necessary that you take a piece of linen cloth, according to the size of the wound, and immerse it in rose oil, and place it over the opening of the wound.
Deinde accipe pannum alium duplicatum, aut triplicatum, et submerge ipsum in uino et oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super pannum primum: et fac illud quam facilius potes super illud, ut non grauetur siphac.	Then take another piece of linen, doubled or tripled, and immerse it in wine and rose oil, and place it over the first cloth: and make it as easily as you can over it, so that it does not become swollen with pus.
Deinde administra supra ipsum ligamentum latum: et non stringas ipsum, nisi per quantitatem quae teneat uulnus tantum: et dimitte ipsum cum hac cura die uno, aut diebus duobus, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido.	Then apply the bandage above this broad ligament; and do not tighten it unless by an amount that holds only the wound so much. And leave it with this care for one day or two days until you are sure from a hot aposteme.
Deinde solue ipsum, et administra post illud medicinas cum quibus est superflua siccitas: sicut radices lilii, et farina herbi, et puluis thuris, et aristolochia, et similia eis: et est, ut facias ex istis medicinis puluerem, qui puluerizetur super uulnus sicut sunt siccae.	Then loosen it and apply medicines to what is excessive dryness after that, such as lily roots, plant flour, frankincense powder, aristolochia, and similar things. And it is, so you make a powder from these medicines which will be powdered over the wound like dry things.
Et uniuersaliter administra in illo omnem medicinam de proprietate cuius est ut abstergat, et non mordicet.	And apply all medicine with a property to remove and not inflame that wound universally.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, ut uulnus in curatione tua sit limpidum: neque sit in ea sordes unguenti, neque sordicies.	And beware according to your power, that the wound is clear in your treatment; and let it not be in that mixture of ointment's filth nor putridity.
Neque dimittas uirus aggregari in eo omnino: quoniam quando uirus aggregatur super panniculum cerebri, corrumpit eum, et putrefacit ipsum, et accidit super infirmum post illud malicia magna: et iam accidit in siphac capitis, cum mundificatur ab eo os, praecipue quando negligitur cura eius, nigredo in superficie eius.	Nor should you allow the pus to accumulate there entirely; for when pus accumulates on a piece of brain, it corrupts and putsrefies it, and evil happens to the sick person after that, and especially it happens to the head's siphac when the mouth is cleansed by it, particularly when the care of it is neglected, blackness occurs on its surface.
Considera ergo tunc, si accidunt infirmo accidentia quae diximus, scias, quia est pernitiosum proculdubio.	Therefore consider then, if accidents befall the sick person as we said, know that it is most certainly pernicious.
Et si nigredo non accidit, nisi a medicina quae ponitur super ipsum, et est in uirtute illius medicinae, ut faciat illam nigredinem: tunc oportet, ut accipias ex melle partem unam, ex oleo rosato partes tres, et linias cum eis pannum.	And if blackness does not occur except from the medicine that is put on it, and it is in the power of that medicine to cause that blackness: then you should take one part from honey, three parts from rose oil, and mix with them a cloth.
Deinde pone ipsum super siphac: postea cura ipsum cum speciebus curationis quae conueniunt, donec sanetur.	Then place it over the siphac: afterwards care for it with the appearance of healing that is suitable, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Nasi quando frangitur.	Note on the Restoration of the Nose when it is broken.
Caput IIII.	Book IV.
Scias, quod non franguntur ex Naso nisi duae partes eius superiores simul, aut una earum: propterea, quod ipse sunt duo ossa: quoniam inferius eius est cartilaginosum, non frangitur, et non accidit ei nisi attritio, et tortuositas, et simitas.	Know that the nose does not break except for two parts of it above simultaneously, or one of them; because they are two bones: for what is below is cartilaginous and does not break, but only suffers attrition, twisting, and similar things.
Si frangitur una duarum partium eius, tunc oportet, ut intromittas digitum paruum in foramen Nasi, et aeques illam fracturam digito tuo indice, et pollice deforis, donec redeat Nasus super figuram suam naturalem: et fiat illud arte, cum facilitate.	If one of the two parts of it is broken, then you should insert a small finger into the nasal opening and equalize that fracture with your index finger and thumb outside until the nose returns to its natural shape: and do this skillfully with ease.
Et caue, ne accidat per operationem tuam illam super infirmum dolor.	And beware, lest through your operation that person should be afflicted by excessive pain.
Quod si fractura est in superiore parte Nasi, et non perueniat ad illam digitus: tunc oportet, ut aequetur extremitate radii, in quo sit grossitudo parua.	What if the fracture is in the upper part of the nose and cannot be reached by your finger: then you should equalize with the tip of the radius, which has a small thickness.
Si uero fractura est in duabus partibus, tunc fac simile illius: et propera cum restauratione eius in die primo fracturae, si est possibile.	If indeed the fracture is in two parts, then do similar things for both and hasten with its restoration on the first day of the fracture, if possible.
Et si non, tunc post diem septimum, aut decimum apud quietem apostematis calidi.	And if not, then after seven days or ten days in quiet, away from suppuration and heat.
Deinde intromitte in extremitate Nasi licinium ex panno lini, si fractura est in parte una: aut intromite duo licinia si fractura est in duabus partibus: et sit in licinio grossitudo tantae quantitatis, quae impleat foramen Nasi.	Then insert a linen strip at the tip of the nose, if the fracture is in one part: or insert two strips if the fracture is in two parts: and let the thickness of the linen be such that it fills the nasal opening.
Et dixerunt quidam antiquorum restauratorum, ut infundantur licinia in butyro, et permutentur omni die.	And some ancient restorers have said that the linen strips should be steeped in butter and changed every day.
Illud uero non uidetur mihi, imo oportet, ut infundatur licinium in albugine oui, confecto cum puluere molendini.	That I do not see, but rather it should be steeped in egg white mixed with miller's flour.
Deinde dimitte licinium, donec firmetur os, et induretur cartilago.	Then leave the linen strip until the bone becomes firm and the cartilage hardens.
Et quandoque intromittitur in Nasum loco licinii penna anseris, postquam inuoluitur super ipsam pannus lenis: et fit, quod ipsa tenet fracturam Nasi uehementius, et ut non prohibeatur infirmus ab inspiratione.	And sometimes a goose feather is inserted into the nose where the linen strip was, after it has been wrapped with a soft cloth; and it does this, namely that it holds the nasal fracture more strongly and so prevents the sick person from being hindered in their breathing.
Et non est haec res necessaria.	And this is not necessary.
Si uis, fac illud: et si uis, fac licinia.	If you wish, do that: and if you wish, make a linen bandage.
Quod si accidat Naso iterum dum operaris apostema calidum, emplastra nasum cum caeroto, aut cum coto infuso in oleo rosato, aut modico ex dyaquilon.	What if an aposteme of heat occurs on the nose again while you are operating, apply a poultice to the nose with cerate, or with cot infused in rose oil, or a moderate amount from diaquylon.
Si autem non accidit apostema calidum, tunc oportet, ut emplastres ipsum cum farina sisami, et puluere thuris confecti cum albugine oui.	If however a warm abscess does not occur, then it is necessary that you dress it with a poultice made of sesame flour and the powder of burnt incense mixed with egg white.
Deinde pone super ipsum stuppam lenem, et non liges Nasum cum aliquo omnino.	Then place on top of it a soft compress, and do not tie the nose with anything at all.
Si uero franguntur ossa Nasi fractura parua, aut comminuuntur, tunc oportet, ut scindas super ea, et extrahas ipsa cum instrumentis quae conueniunt eis.	If the bones of the nose are broken by a small fracture or shattered, then it is necessary that you cut above them and extract the pieces with instruments that are suitable for them.
Deinde sue scissuram, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat, et consolidat ex emplastris conuenientibus ad illud, uel unguentis.	Then bind it up and care for it with that which fattens and consolidates it, using plasters suitable for it or ointments.
Quod si accidat inter Nasum uulnus, tunc oportet, ut cures ipsum cum liciniis: et administres cannulam de plumbo, donec sanetur.	What if a wound occurs between the nose, then it is necessary that you care for it with lyciums and administer a lead catheter until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Mandibulae inferioris, quando disrumpitur.	De restauratione Mandibulae inferioris, quando disrumpitur.
Caput V.	(It seems like there is no translation for this phrase, as it appears to be the title of a chapter or section in the text.)
Quando disrumpitur Mandibula inferior, et fractura eius non est cum uulnere: conspice tunc si est fractura eius deforis tantum, et non frangitur in duo, et curuatur ad interiora: tunc cognitio eius est facilis.	When the lower jaw is dislocated and its fracture is not accompanied by a wound: then see if it is fractured only on the outside and does not break into two and curves towards the inside: then recognition of it is easy.
Oportet ergo, si est fractura eius in parte dextra, ut intromittas digitum indicem sinistrae in os infirmi: similiter si fractura est in mandibula sinistra, tunc intromitte indicem manus dextrae: et impelle cum eo gibbositatem fracturae deintus cum facilitate ad exteriora cum manu tua altera ab interiori parte ossis decenter, et cum eo aequa ipsam.	Therefore, if the fracture is on the right side of the jaw, you should insert your left index finger into the weak bone: similarly, if the fracture is on the left side of the jaw, then insert the index finger of your right hand: and push with it the prominence of the fracture backwards with ease towards the outside with your other hand from the inner part of the bone, and thus equalize it.
Quod si fractura mandibulae iam separata est in duo, tunc oportet, ut administres extersionem a duabus partibus, secundum rectitudinem: donec possibilis sit aequatio eius.	What if the fracture of the jaw has already separated into two parts? Then it is necessary that you administer an extension from both sides, according to straightness: until it becomes possible to equalize it.
Si autem iam accidit in dentibus commotio, aut disruptio: tunc stringe illos de quibus speras quod remaneant cum filo auri, aut argenti, aut seta.	But if there is already disturbance or disruption of the teeth, then tie those that you hope will remain with a thread of gold, silver, or silk.
Deinde pone super mandibulam fractam caerotum.	Then place a splint over the fractured jawbone.
Deinde pone super ipsum pannum duplicatum, et pone super pannum astellam magnam decenter factam: aut frustum cutis soleae aequale, in longitudinem mandibulae.	Then place over it a doubled cloth, and place over the cloth a large metal plate made decently: or a piece of sole leather equal to the length of the jawbone.
Deinde liga ipsum desuper, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ligatura eius, et conuenit ipsius applicatio, donec non destruitur: et praecipe infirmo, uti tranquillitate et quiete: et pone cibum eius sorbitiones lenes.	Then bind it above, according to how you prepare its binding, and as its application agrees with it, until it is not destroyed; and instruct the sick person to use tranquil and quiet: and give them food in gentle sips.
Si autem estimas, quod iam alteratur aliquid figurae aliquo modorum: tunc propera, et solue ipsum in die tertio.	But if you think that already something is altered in its shape by some method: then hurry and release it on the third day.
Deinde rectifica quod alteratum est ex eo, et emplastra ipsum ex puluere molendini, cum albugine oui, aut cum farina sisami, postquam tu abstuleris caerotum: et pone super emplastrum lanam lenem.	Then correct what has been altered from that, and apply a poultice to it with fine flour of the mill, with egg white, or with sesame meal, after you have removed the splint: and place over the poultice a soft wool.
Dum ergo permanet annexum illud emplastrum super ipsum, et non alteratur ossis dispositio, dimitte ipsum, ne soluas, donec sanetur: aut stringe fracturam.	While that poultice remains attached to it and the bone arrangement does not change, release it, lest you break it, until it heals: or strengthen the fracture.
Multotiens enim stringitur haec fractura in tribus septimanis.	For this fracture is often strengthened in three weeks.
Quod si interim accidat apostema calidum, tunc administra illud quod diximus multotiens in sedatione eius, donec remoueatur illud apostema.	And if a hot abscess occurs in the meantime, then administer what we said many times to calm it, until that abscess is removed.
Et si fractura est cum uulnere, considera.	And if there is a fracture with an open wound, consider.
Namsi iam separatur ex osse frustum, aut a satagie: tunc subtilia te in hoc, ut auferas illa frusta satagiae cum eo quod conuenit tibi in ablatione eorum ex instrumentis.	But if a fragment is separated from the bone, or from the gums: then be subtle about this, and carefully remove those fragments with what agrees with you for their removal using instruments.
Si uero orificium uulneris est strictum, tunc amplifica ipsum cum phlebotomo secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	But if the wound opening is narrow, then enlarge it with a phlebotomist according to the amount of your need.
Deinde quando abstuleris illa satagie, et non remanserit ex eis aliquid, sue tunc orificium uulneris, si est amplum: et si non, pone super ipsum ex emplastris quae conueniunt ad illud, et incarnant illud, donec sanetur.	Then when you remove those fragments, and nothing remains of them, whether the wound opening is wide or not: and if it is not, place over it a poultice that agrees with it and helps to cover it, until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Furculae, quando frangitur.	Of the restoration of a broken clavicle.
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Plurimum quidem frangitur Furcula ab anteriore parte ex parte humeri, et fractura eius fit secundum unum trium modorum.	Indeed the clavicle is often broken from the anterior part of the shoulder and its fracture occurs in one of three ways.
Aut enim frangitur et separatur in duo, praeter quod accidant in ea satagiae: et est facilius ad restaurationem eius.	Or indeed it is broken and separated into two parts, apart from the complications that may occur with it; and this is easier to restore.
Aut ita, quod accidunt in osse satagiae: et est difficilius ad restaurationem.	Or indeed, as happens in bone complications; and this is harder to restore.
Aut ita, quod est fractura cum uulnere.	Or indeed, as occurs with a fracture accompanied by a wound.
Et operatio in ea quando fractura est absque uulnere, est, ut facias praesentes esse duos ministros, ut teneat unus eorum adiutorium quod sequitur Furculam fractam, et alter extendat collum uersus partem.	And the operation in this case when there is no wound is to have two attendants, one of whom should hold the aid that follows the broken clavicle and the other stretch out the neck towards the side.
Deinde aequa fracturam digitis tuis, donec fiat forma eius, secundum quod oportet: et non sit in ea eminentia, neque concauitas.	Then equalize the fracture with your fingers until its shape is formed as it should be, and there is no prominence or depression.
Quod si indiges extensione plus, tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico infirmi spheram ex panno, aut lana: et sit magnitudo eius secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae: et extende, et eleua Furculam, et coarta spheram manu tua, donec aeques fracturam, secundum quod oportet.	But if you need more extension, then it is necessary to place a small ball or sphere made of cloth or wool under the patient's shoulder, and its size should be according to your own necessity; and extend and lift up the clavicle, and compress the ball with your hand until the fracture is equalized as it should be.
Quod si non potes trahere extremitatem Furculae ad exteriora: propterea, quia peruenit ad profundum: tunc oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et ponas sub humero eius puluinar medium in magnitudine, et premat minister humerum eius ad inferiora, donec eleuetur os Furculae quod est in profundo ad sursum: atque tunc rectifica fracturam, et aequa eam digitis tuis.	But if you are not able to pull the extremity of the clavicle outwards because it has reached too far down: then it is necessary for the patient to be propped up on their own chest; and place a medium-sized pillow under his shoulder, and have your attendant press down on his shoulder to lift up the bone of the clavicle that is in deep into the air: and only then straighten out the fracture and equalize it with your fingers.
Si autem sentis sathaiatum ex Furcula, et mouetur: tunc oportet, ut findas super illud, et extrahas ipsum alsathaiatum cum facilitate.	But if you feel a spongy thing protruding from the clavicle and it moves: then it is necessary to bind over it and extract that spongy thing with ease.
Si autem est retentum in osse, tunc ingenia in incisione eius cum uno Incisoriorum quae praeparasti ad illud, postquam tu posueris sub Furcula instrumentum quod seruat sifach: et est instrumentum ex ligno, aut ex ferro.	If it is retained in bone, then skillfully perform the incision on it with one of the forceps that you prepared for this purpose, after you have placed the instrument under the furcula which saves from sifach: and this instrument is made of wood or iron.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its shape.
Assimilatur cochleari cui non est concauitas.	It resembles a snail shell that has no depression.
Et sit latitudo eius secundum illud quo indiges eo ex magnitudine ossis, et paruitate eius.	And its width should be according to what you need for it from the size of the bone and its narrowness.
Longitudo uero eius etiam secundum quod possibile est tibi ad operationem.	Its length, however, is also according to what is possible for you in the operation.
Et habeat duas extremitates, sicut uides: et extremitas una sit ampla, et altera stricta.	And it should have two ends, as you see: and one end should be broad, and the other narrow.
Si autem disruptio uulneris quod scidisti quando extraxisti sathaiatum ossis, est ampla, et securaris ab apostemate calido: tunc aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura.	If the disruption of the wound that you cut when you removed the bone fragment is wide and you secure it from a hot inflammation: then bind together the two lips of the wound with a suture.
Et si disruptio est parua, aut times apostema calidum: tunc imple uulnus cum pannis, et puluillis secundum quantitatem scissurae uulneris.	And if the disruption is small or you fear a hot inflammation: then fill the wound with cloths and powders according to the size of the cut wound.
Quod si accidat apostema calidum, tunc infunde pannum in oleo rosato, et aceto, et uino, et pone super ipsum.	Which if a hot inflammation occurs, then pour oil of roses, and vinegar, and wine upon it, and place something on top.
Strictura uero ossis quando est absque uulnere, et absque sectione, est, ut ponas super os emplastrum factum ex farina molendini cum albugine oui.	The binding of the bone when it is without a wound and without cutting is to apply an ointment made from wheat flour with the white of an egg over the bone.
Et pone stuppam lenem super ipsum.	And place a linen cloth on top of it.
Deinde pone spheram sub titillico eius, si indiges illa.	Then place a sphere under the splint of it, if you need to.
Deinde accipe himematem, id est, rotam quam tenent Saraceni, quae sit longa ualde: et sit latitudo eius palmi unius, aut circiter illud.	Then take a hammatah, that is, a wheel which the Saracens hold, which is very long: and its width should be one palm, or about that.
Deinde pone puluillum duplicatum super stuppam et emplastrum.	Then place a doubled poultice over the cloth and ointment.
Deinde accipe astellam ex tabula subtili, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, et in longitudine similiter.	Then take a staple made from thin board, whose width is three fingers, and similarly in length.
Deinde inuolue eam in panno.	Then wrap her in cloth.
Deinde inuolue pannum illum cum astella in loco alhimemati qui cadit super fracturam et locum.	Then wrap the piece of cloth with a bandage in the place opposite the inflammation that falls over the fracture and the area.
Deinde pone alhimemati super fracturam sicut reuoluiur, et inuolue eam super collum eius, et sub titillico eius sano, et sub titillico eius infirmo: et reduc eam super omnem partem, et quomodo uides quod strictura tenet fracturam strictura decenti: et est illud, quod non occultatur super te, et totum, ut non remoueatur astella desuper os fractum.	Then place the inflammation above the fracture as it swells, and wrap it around his neck, and under the strong part of him, and under the weak part: and bring it back over every part, and see how tight the swelling holds the fracture tightly; and that is what should not be hidden from you, nor removed until the bandage is taken off above the broken bone.
Et propter hoc oportet, ut aspicias infirmum in omni die.	And therefore it is necessary for you to watch over the weak one every day.
Quotiens ergo mollificatur ligamentum, et uides astellam iam remoueri: tunc rectifica illud, et stringe ligamentum.	Whenever then the bandage loosens and you see that it is already being removed: then straighten it out and tighten the bandage.
Deinde pone somnum infirmi super dorsum eius, et pone sub titillico eius apud somnum eius puluinar paruum in nocte, ut cum eo eleuetur adiutorium eius a latere ipsius.	Then place the patient's bed behind his back, and place a small pillow under the strong part of him while he is asleep at night, so that when he is lifted up by the aid from beside him.
Eleuatur ergo fractura furculae per eleuationem humeri.	The fracture of the wing is therefore lifted through the elevation of the arm.
Aut liga brachium eius ad collum ipsius: et non soluas ligamentum, si non accidat in loco accidens ex pruritu, aut ab apostemate, usque ad duodecim dies.	Or bind his arm to his neck: and do not loosen the bandage unless something happens to cause itching or an abscess in that place, until twelve days have passed.
Deinde renoua emplastrum, si uideris faciem eius ad illud.	Then renew the poultice if you see his face leaning towards it.
Et adde in strictura, et dimitte ipsum, donec restauretur et coaguletur.	And add to the swelling, and let him go until he is restored and the wound has closed.
Et fractura quidem furculae stringitur et confortatur secundum plurimum in uigintiocto diebus: et quandoque fit in quibusdam hominibus in minore illo.	And indeed, the fracture of the wing is bound and comforted to a great extent within twenty-eight days; and sometimes it happens in some people in a shorter period.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spatulae.	Of the Restoration of the Fracture of the Wing.
Caput VII.	Chapter 7.
Raro frangitur Spatula, et in loco lato eius: et non franguntur ex ea nisi margines eius.	The wing is rarely broken and usually breaks away from the rest of it; and only the edges of it are broken.
Quando ergo frangitur ex eo locus, et frangitur in medio eius, et non cognoscitur illud nisi per tactum: tunc secundum quod est figura fracturae conare praeparationem eius.	When however the break is in the middle of it and not recognized except by touch; then prepare for it according to the shape of the fracture.
Et reduc eam super figuram naturalem omni modo ingenii, quod est tibi possibile.	And bring it back to its natural shape by every means of artistry, as much as is possible for you.
Deinde pone super locum puluerem molendini cum albugine oui, et stuppam lenem, et pone desuper puluillum ex panno duplato.	Then place a layer of miller's dust with white of egg, and soft wax, and place a poultice made of double cloth on top.
Deinde pone super ipsum astellam latam ex tabula subtili secundum quantitatem Spatulae totius, aut ampliorem ea parum.	Then place above it a broad plate made of thin board, according to the size of the spatula whole or slightly larger.
Si uero sub astella est concauitas in aliquo locorum Spatulae, tunc aequa illam concauitatem cum stuppa leni, donec descendat astella secundum aequalitatem.	But if there is a depression under the plate in some part of the spatula, then equalize that depression with soft wax, until the plate descends according to equality.
Deinde ftringe desuper cum alhimemati longa, constrictione decenti, et firmitudine astellae, donec non remoueatur a loco suo.	Then bind it above with a bandage of Alhimi's material, by applying a gentle constriction and the firmness of the plate, until it does not move from its place.
Et considera ligamentum in omni die.	And inspect the bandage every day.
Quotienscunque ergo mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum, et aequa astellam si remoueatur a loco suo: et iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	Whenever the bandage becomes soft, bind it again, and equalize the plate if it moves from its place; and let the invalid lie on his healthy side.
Et Spatula quidem restauratur in uiginti diebus, aut in uigintiquinque diebus.	And the spatula is indeed restored within twenty days or within twenty-five days.
Quando ergo completur iste numerus, tunc solue ligamentum: et tu sis in securitate.	When this number is completed, then loosen the bandage: and you will be at ease.
Nam ipsa est ex ossibus quorum communitio non timetur, neque eorum solutio.	For it is of bones whose union is not to be feared, nor their separation.
Si autem procedat ex osse frustum, et pungit sub cute: tune scinde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum.	If however a fragment of bone should proceed and pierce under the skin: then cut above it and remove it.
Et fac quod diximus in fractura furculae ex sedatione apostematis calidi, si accidat ex eo aliquid.	And do as we have said in the case of a fracture of the wing-bone from the settlement of an inflamed aposteme, if anything should happen to it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Pectoris.	Of the Restoration of a Fracture of the Breast.
Caput VIII.	Chapter VIII.
Pectus quandoque frangitur in medio sui, et raro accidit illud.	The breast is sometimes broken in its middle, and it rarely happens.
Extremitates eius quidem plurimum franguntur, et comminuuntur ex accidentibus eius.	Its extremities indeed are mostly broken and shattered from accidents.
Quando frangitur eius medium, quod declinat ad inferiora, et accidit ei dolor uehemens, et difficultas in anhelitu, et tussis: et fortasse euomit sanguinem, et declaratur concauitas in osse fracto, et non occultatur sensui, Restauratio eius est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et pone inter Spatulas eius puluinar.	When it breaks in its middle, which slopes downwards and happens to him with intense pain, difficulty in breathing, and coughing; and perhaps he vomits blood, and the concavity is declared in the broken bone, and does not remain hidden from sense. The restoration of this is that the invalid be lifted up onto his back: and place a poultice between its spatulas.
Deinde preme humeros eius, et aggrega costas a duabus partibus uel lateribus cum manibus: et subtiliare in aequatione eius, secundum omnem modum quo possibile est illud et conuenit, donec redeat figura ossis, secundum quod oportet.	Then press his shoulders and bring together the ribs from both sides with your hands: and shape it in proportion to him, according to every possible way that is suitable for this and fits, until the figure of the bone returns, as needed.
Deinde pone super ipsum emplastrum et stuppam, et pone desuper astellam ex tabula subtili ex salice, aut chalingi, et ex eis similibus in leuitate, postquam tu inuoluis eam in panno.	Then place a poultice and binding over him, and put a splint made from thin willow bark or calking, or something similar, on top of it, after you have wrapped it in cloth.
Deinde subtiliare in ligando eam super os fractum, ut non remoueatur: et uade cum ligatura secundum rotunditatem ad dorsum aliquotiens, et stringe ipsum strictura decenti.	Then shape the binding to fit over the fractured bone so that it doesn't move: and go around with the binding according to the curvature to the back several times, and tie him securely.
Deinde considera ligaturam in omni hora, et quotienscumque mollificatur, stringe eam: et si necessitas eius prouocat ad solutionem eius apud pruritum, uel corrosionem quae accidit in loco, aut dolorem, aut apostema: tunc propera, et solue eam, et eradica emplastrum, et rectifica quod accidit cum modo curationis eius.	Then consider the binding at every hour, and whenever it becomes soft, tighten it: and if necessity prompts you to release it on account of itching, or corrosion that occurs in the place, or pain, or abscess: then hurry, and loosen it, and remove the poultice, and correct what has happened with the method of its cure.
Deinde reduc emplastrum, si uides ad illud faciem: et annecte ei stricturam, donec sanetur.	Then reduce the poultice if you see it is ready for that; and bind him securely until he is healed.
¶ De restauratione Costarum, quando franguntur.	The Restoration of Ribs When They are Broken.
Caput IX.	Chapter 9.
Scias, quod Costarum fractura non accidit, nisi in locis grossis quae sequuntur dorsum, et ex extremitatibus earum ab anteriori parte.	You should know that the fracture of the ribs does not occur unless it is in the thick places which follow the back and from the extremities of these on the anterior part.
Et non accidit eis attritio, nisi propterea, quia sunt cartilaginosae.	And attrition does not happen to them unless because they are cartilaginous.
Et cognitio ipsius non occultatur sensui apud inquisitionem cum digitis.	And the knowledge of it is not hidden from sense during an examination with fingers.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, ut aeques fracturam cum digitis secundum modum possibilem, donec aequetur figura, secundum quod oportet.	And its restoration is done so that you equal the fracture with your fingers according to every possible way until the figure is equal, as needed.
Deinde emplastra, et stringe os fractum cum astella, si indiget illo.	Then apply poultices and bind the fractured bone with splints if it needs them.
Et si fractura Costarum est decliuis ad interiora: tunc accidit infirmo dolor uehemens, et punctura, sicut punctura illa quae accidit illi qui habet pleuresim: propterea, quod os pungit uelamen, et etiam ei accidit difficultas anhelitus, et tussis, et uomitus sanguinis multi: et haec est difficilis curationis.	And if the rib fracture is inclined towards the interior: then it happens to the patient a severe pain and puncture, just like the one that occurs in someone who has pleurisy: because the bone pierces the membrane, and also difficulty breathing, coughing, and vomiting of blood occurs often: and this is a difficult cure.
Et iam ingeniati sunt antiqui in ea cum ingeniis multis: et ex eis sunt qui dicunt, ut ponas cibos infirmi qui generent inflammationem et uentositatem, ut inflammetur uenter, et extendatur, et impellatur fractura ad exteriora.	And now the ancient ones have become skilled in it with many skills: and among them are those who say that you should give food to the infirm which produces inflammation and swelling, so that the belly may be inflamed, and stretched, and forced fracture towards the outside.
Nos uero abhorremus, ut non fiat caussa uelox ad faciendum apostema calidum, si non accidit.	But we shun it, so that there may not be a speedy cause for making a hot abscess, unless it happens.
Si autem iam accidit, tunc addit in eo.	But if it has already happened, then he adds to it.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: ponatur super locum uentosa, deinde sugatur cum fortitudine, et est similius ratiocinationi.	And some of them said: a poultice should be placed on the swollen place, then it should be sucked out with force, and it is similar to reasoning.
Verumtamen timetur, quod attrahat uentosa superfluitates ad locum, propter dispositionem debilitatis.	However, it is feared that the swelling will attract superfluities to the place, due to a condition of weakness.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: oportet ut cooperiatur locus cum lana quae iam submersa est in oleo calido: et ponantur puluilli inter Costas, donec impleatur: ut sit ligatura aequalis quando inuoluis eam secundum rotunditatem.	And some of them said: it is necessary that the place be covered with wool which has already been soaked in hot oil; and lint should be placed between the ribs, until it is filled: so that there may be an equal bandage when you wind it around according to its curvature.
Deinde curetur infirmus curatione pleuresis ex cibo et medicina.	Then take care of the infirm with the treatment of pleurisy by food and medicine.
Quod si coartat infirmum res uehemens, quam non tolerat, et os pungit uelamen punctura laedente, et timemus super infirmum: tunc oportet, ut scindamus super locum, et detegamus a Costa fracta.	But if the patient's vital force is oppressed by what he does not tolerate, and his mouth pierces with a painful puncture, and we fear for the patient: then it is necessary that we cut open above the place, and uncover the broken rib.
Deinde ponamus super ea instrumentum quod conseruat sifac, cuius rememoratio praecessit: et incidamus os cum facilitate, et incidamus ipsum.	Then let us put over it an instrument that preserves the suture, whose description preceded: and let us cut open the mouth with ease, and incise it.
Deinde aggregemus duo labia uulneris, si est magnum cum sutura: et curemus ipsum cum emplastris, donec sanetur.	Then let us bring together the two lips of the wound, if it is large with a suture: and let us care for it with plasters, until it heals.
Quod si accidat interim apostema calidum, tunc propera, et infunde puluillos in oleo rosato, et pone super locum: et curetur infirmus cum eo quod conuenit apostemati.	But if an abscess should happen to occur meanwhile, then hurry and pour lint into rose oil, and place it over the place: and let the patient be cared for with what is suitable for the abscess.
Interim etiam resupinetur super latus super quod dormit, donec sanetur.	Meanwhile, it will also be lifted over onto the side on which they sleep, until they are healed.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spondilium dorsi et colli.	On the restoration of fractures of the dorsal and cervical spine.
Caput X.	Chapter 10.
Ossibus quidem colli quandoque aduenit fractura, et raro accidit eis attritio: et similiter Spondilibus dorsi etiam.	Indeed, fractures of the neck bones sometimes occur, and rare is the occasion when they become worn away; similarly, too, with the dorsal spine.
Cum ergo accidit illud alicui, et uis scire, an sanetur, an non sanetur: tunc confidera.	So then, if it happens to someone, and you wish to know whether they will recover or not, then investigate.
Nam si uides manus eius iam mollificatas, et stupefactas, et mortuas: et non potest mouere eas, neque extendere eas, neque constringere eas: et quando constringis eas cum digitis tuis, et pungis eas cum acu, non sentit illud, et non sentit in eis dolorem: tunc scias, quia non sanatur, et in pluribus dispositionibus est mortale.	For if you see that their hands are already softened, and numb, and lifeless; and they cannot move them, nor extend them, nor contract them; and when you contract them with your fingers and prick them with a needle, they do not feel it, and they do not experience pain in them: then you will know that they will not recover, and many of these cases are mortal.
Quod si mouet eas, et sentit in eis constrictionem cum digitis et puncturam: tunc scias, quia nucha ossis salua est, et quod infirmus sanabitur cum curatione.	And if they move them and feel constriction and puncture in them with your fingers and needle: then you will know that the vertebra is sound, and that the injured person will recover with treatment.
Quod si eueniat Spondilibus dorsi simile illius, et uis scire, an sanetur etiam, an non: tunc considera ad pedes eius: tunc si uides quod mollificati sunt, et accidit in eis illud quod accidit in manibus: deinde quando iacet super dorsum suum, egreditur uentositas et egestio absque uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super uentrem suum, egreditur egestio sine uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super dorsum suum, et uult mingere, et non potest: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	And if a similar condition occurs in the dorsal spine and you wish to know whether it will also recover or not: then consider his feet; then if you see that they are softened and that the same thing happens as happened in his hands: afterwards when he lies on his back, flatulence and evacuation occur without his consent; and when he is raised up over his belly, evacuation occurs without his consent; and when he is raised up over his back, and he wishes to defecate, but cannot: then you will know that it is mortal.
Non ergo labores in curatione eius.	Therefore do not labor at his cure.
Si uero non accidit ei aliquid ex illo, res est leuior.	But if nothing of that sort occurs to him, the case is easier.
Et curatio eius quod accidit ex illo est, ut coneris sedationem apostematis calidi: ita, ut ponas super Spondilem attritam oleum rosatum solum: aut cum uitellis oui assati.	And the treatment of him who suffers from that is to apply a cooling poultice to the apostematic area; so that you place over the worn-out vertebra only rose-scented oil, or with goose fat.
Pone super ipsam illud aliquotiens in die, donec quando sedatur apostema calidum: tum pone super locum unum ex emplastris confortantibus, exiccantibus, et stringe super ipsum cum ligamento: et praecipe infirmo, ut utatur quiete et tranquillitate.	Put this on top of it several times a day until the hot abscess is drained. Then put one of the supporting, drying, and binding plasters on top of it with a bandage. And order the patient to use quietness and tranquility.
Nec dormiat super partem cum qua inuenit dolorem, donec sanetur.	He should not sleep on the part where he finds pain until he is healed.
Quod si accidit apud attritionem ossis sathaiatum, aut aliquid quod iam separatum fit ex eo: tunc oportet, ut seces super cutem, et auferas illud.	If a bone or some part that has been separated from it occurs through attrition: then you should cut above the skin and remove it.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, si est magnum, cum sutura.	Then close two lips of the wound, if it is large, with a suture.
Deinde cura ipsum cum aliquo incarnatiuo, ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with some sort of emollient ointment until he is healed.
Si uero frangitur postremum ossis alhausos, et est finis caudae: tunc oportet, ut intromittas pollicem manus sinistrae in anum, et aeques os fractum manu altera, secundum quod possibile est, et secunda aequatione.	If the last vertebra of the backbone is broken and it is at the end of the tail: then you should insert your left thumb into the anus, and with your other hand, set the fractured bone as well as possible, in a second approximation.
Deinde pone super ipsum, et aufer ipsum: et cura uulnus cum curatione quae praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then place something on top and remove it; and care for the wound with the treatment that came before until he is healed.
¶ De restauratione Anchae.	Restoration of the Anal Canal.
Caput XI.	Chapter 11.
Raro franguntur ossa Ancharum.	Bones of the anus are rarely broken.
Quod si franguntur, tunc fractura eorum non est, nisi comminutio in extremitatibus ipsorum: et scinduntur in longitudine, et declinantur ad interiora: et accidit infirmo dolor in loco, et punctura: et stupescit crus quod frangitur.	For if they are broken, then the break is not elsewhere than at the extremities of these bones; and they split longitudinally and decline towards the inside; and it happens that the patient suffers pain in the place and a puncture: and the leg that breaks becomes numb.
Et restauratio quidem eius est, ut extendas manum tuam super ipsum, donec stes super fracturam qualiter est figura eius.	And its restoration is indeed to stretch out your hand over it until you place yourself on the fracture as it is.
Quod si fractura est in extremitatibus eius tantum, tunc aequa illam fracturam, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ex aequatione, donec assimiletur figurae suae naturali.	And if the fracture is only at its extremities, then adjust it to fit the fracture as much as possible, until it resembles its natural shape.
Si autem fractura est in longitudine, aut iam declinat ad interiora: tunc fac iacere infirmum super uentrem suum, donec praeparetur tibi restauratio illius fracturae.	But if the fracture is in length, or already declines towards the inside: then make the patient lie on his belly, until preparation is made for you to restore that fracture.
Quando ergo aequaueris ipsam, pone super ipsam emplastrum: deinde pone super ipsam astellam ex ligno, aut ex cute: et stringe strictura super quam non timeas permutationem fracturae, neque remotionem astellae.	When you therefore equalize it, place a poultice over it: then place a splint of wood or leather on top of it; and tie the bandage tightly so that you do not fear displacement of the fracture nor removal of the splint.
Et aequa concauitatem illorum cum eo quod impleat eam, donec capiat eam strictura secundum aequalitatem: et praecipe infirmo, ut dormiat super dorsum suum, aut super latus suum sanum.	And equalize the concavity of those with it as it fills it, until it takes its shape under tight bandaging according to equality; and command the patient to sleep on their back or healthy side.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc cessa ab extensione eius, et ipsius restauratione, donec sedetur apostema calidum: et pone super ipsum quod sedet ipsum, secundum quod praecessit, deinde redi ad restaurationem eius: et stringe ipsum sicut oportet.	But if a warm abscess occurs to him: then cease from stretching it and its restoration until the warm abscess subsides: and place over it what settles it, according to how it preceded; then return to restoring it: and bind it as is necessary.
Si uero accidit in osse satagie, aut comminuitur, extrahe.	If however it happens that a bone breaks or is shattered, remove it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Adiutorii.	Of the Restoration of Fractures by Means of an Assistant.
Caput XII.	Chapter 12.
Adiutorium est illud, quod est inter cubitum usque ad caput Spatulae.	The assistant is that which is between the elbow and the head of a spatula.
Si ergo frangitur, tunc restauratio eius est secundum unum duorum modorum.	If therefore it breaks, then its restoration is according to one or two methods.
Quorum unus est: ut accipias lignum planum mediae grossitudinis, secundum hanc formam, quae sequitur.	One of which is: to take a flat piece of wood of medium thickness, according to this shape that follows.
Et ligentur in duabus extremitatibus duo ligamenta.	And it is bound at both ends with two straps.
Deinde suspendatur ex loco eleuato: et sedeat infirmus super sedem.	Then it is suspended from an elevated place; and the patient sits on a chair.
Deinde proiiciat brachium suum fractum super lignum, donec perueniat ad titillicum eius, in cuius medio sit annexa curuitas ligni.	Then he throws his broken arm over the wood, until it reaches the fulcrum of his elbow, where a curvature of the wood is attached.
Deinde suspende desuper ipsum aliquid graue, ut extendat ipsum minister ad inferiora.	Then something heavy is suspended above it, so that the assistant may stretch it downwards.
Deinde aequet medicus fracturam manibus suis simul, donec redeat fractura, secundum quod oportet.	Then the doctor equalizes the fracture with his own hands simultaneously, until the fracture returns to its proper place.
Et modus alter est, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et suspende manum eius a collo ipsius cum ligamento.	And the other method is, that the patient be placed on his own back; and his hand be suspended from his neck with a strap.
Deinde praecipe duobus ministris, ut teneat unus eorum illud quod est supra fracturam cum manibus suis: et ut alter teneat inferius eius, et extendat unusquisque eorum ad partem suam.	Then command two attendants to have one of them hold with his hands what is above the fracture, and to have the other hold below it and stretch out each one to his own side.
Et si uis, ut sit extensio fortior, tunc stringe sub fractura cum ligamento, et supra ipsam cum ligamento alio: et extendat ea unusquisque duorum ministrorum ad duas partes suas.	And if you wish the extension to be stronger, then bind with a bandage under the fracture and above it with another bandage; and let each of the two attendants stretch out to his own two sides.
Si ergo fractura est propinqua extremitati humeri, tunc oportet, ut ponatur unum ligamentum sub titillico, et alterum sub fractura uersus cubitum.	If then the fracture is near the shoulder extremity, then it is necessary that one bandage be placed under the deltoid and another under the fracture towards the elbow.
Et similiter si fractura est propinqua cubito: tunc oportet, ut ponatur ligamentum super illum locum, et super cubitum ipsum.	And similarly if the fracture is near the elbow: then it is necessary that a bandage be placed over this place and over the elbow itself.
Deinde aequa fracturam cum facilitate absque labore, donec quando aequatur fractura secundum quod oportet, et applicatur applicatione bona: tunc stringe eam, si non accidit apostema calidum.	Then equalize the fracture with ease and without labor until the fracture is equal as it should be, and a good application is applied: then bind it if no hot swelling occurs.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam usque ad diem septimum.	If however a hot swelling occurs, then release the binding until the seventh day.
Et pone super ipsum lanam succidam imbibitam in aceto et oleo rosato, donec quando quiescit apostema: tunc stringe eam: et modus stringendi eam est, ut ponas emplastrum super fracturam.	And place a poultice of succulent wool soaked in vinegar and rose oil on top of it until the swelling subsides: then bind it; and the manner of binding is to place a plaster over the fracture.
Deinde pone inuolutionem ex panno nouo super emplastrum.	Then place an impregnation of new cloth over the plaster.
Deinde aggreget brachium super adiutorium ipsum, et ponat manum suam apertam super humerum suum.	Then bring the arm above the support and place his hand open on his shoulder.
Et pone pannum, et stringe super adiutorium brachium, ut brachium stet loco astellarum: si non prohibet te ab illo aliquid, neque alteretur super te aliquid ex osse fracto.	And place a cloth and bind it over the support of the arm, so that the arm stands in its star-like position; if nothing prevents you from doing this, nor does anything change on top of you from the broken bone.
Quod si times, quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid, tunc utere astellis: et est, ut ponas super fracturam ipsam astellam quae sit latior et fortior reliquis astellis.	Which if you fear that something will change on top of you from the broken bone, then use asterisks; and it is to place above the fracture itself an asterisk which is broader and stronger than the other asterisks.
Et ponas inter omnem astellam latitudinem digiti: et sit longitudo astellarum secundum fracturam cum additione trium digitorum ab omni parte.	And you will place between every star the breadth of a finger; and let the length of the stars be according to the fracture with the addition of three fingers from all parts.
Deinde stringe super astellas strictura quam dixi in principio capituli.	Then bind tightly over the stars as I said at the beginning of this chapter.
Et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae strictior.	And it is that your binding should be tighter above the site of the fracture.
Et quanto plus elongatur fractura, sit strictura minor.	And as much as the fracture is more elongated, let the binding be less tight.
Si ergo uides situm astellarum et stricturam, sicut diximus, in hora qua restauras membrum statim, tunc fac: et si times apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam et astellas usque ad diem septimum, sicut diximus.	If then you see the site of the stars and the binding as we said, in an hour when you restore the member immediately, then do so; and if you fear a warm abscess, then release the binding and the stars until the seventh day, as we said.
Deinde considera ligamentum in omnibus tribus diebus, ut non accidat in loco pruritus, aut inflatio, aut prohibeatur cibus peruenire ad membrum, propter dispositionem superfluitatis stricturae.	Then consider the bandage on all three days, so that it does not happen that there is itching, or swelling, or that food cannot reach the member because of the excess tightness of the binding.
Rectifica ergo illud totum, secundum quod diximus.	Correct therefore the whole thing, according to what we said.
Si uero es super fiduciam, ut non accidat ex illo aliquid: tunc non soluas ligamentum, nisi post tres dies, aut plus.	If indeed you have confidence that nothing will happen from it: then do not remove the bandage unless after three days or more.
Et sit dormitio infirmi super dorsum suum, et manus eius super stomachum suum: et pone sub adiutorio culcitram plenam lana aequaliter.	And let the invalid sleep on his back and have his hands on his belly; and place under him a cushion full of wool evenly.
Et considera in omni hora noctis, aut diei, ut non soluatur figura membri fracta, aut mollificetur ligamentum.	And watch over every hour of the night or day, lest the figure of the broken member be dislocated or the bandage become loosened.
Rectifica ergo illud totum uirtute tua.	Correct therefore the whole thing with your skill.
Et pone cibum infirmi secundum ordinem quem praemisimus, ita ut sit cibus subtilis in primis, donec incipiat os stringi: tunc oportet, ut ingrosses cibum eius.	And give food to the invalid according to the order we have prescribed, so that his food is subtle at first, until his mouth begins to loosen up; then it becomes necessary for you to thicken his food.
De consuetudine enim adiutorii et cruris est, ut stringatur in quadraginta diebus: tunc ergo oportet, ut soluatur, et administretur balneum, et medicetur cum unguentis quae rectificant illud.	For the habit of assistance and foot is that it should be loosened in forty days; then accordingly it becomes necessary for you to release it, and to give a bath, and to treat with ointments which correct that.
Quod si fractura fuerit foeda, attrita: tunc non soluas ab ea ligamentum et astellas usque ad quinquaginta dies, et usque ad duos menses.	If a fracture is foul, roughen it; then do not cut the ligament and stitches until fifty days and two months.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Brachii.	On the restoration of a fractured arm.
Caput XIII.	Chapter 13.
Brachium est compositum ex duobus ossibus, quae nominantur duo focilia.	The arm is composed of two bones which are called the two humeri.
Quorum unum est paruum: et est illud quod sequitur pollicem.	One of which is small and is that which follows the thumb.
Et alterum est magnum, et est illud quod est positum sub paruo ab inferiori parte.	And the other is large, and it is that which is placed beneath the small one from the lower part.
Fortasse ergo frangitur focile maius solum, aut paruum: et fortasse franguntur simul.	Perhaps therefore the larger or smaller humerus alone breaks, or perhaps they both break together.
Quando ergo frangitur focile paruum superius, tunc restauratio eius est facilis, et sanatio eius est facilior.	When therefore the small upper humerus is broken, then its restoration is easy and its healing is easier.
Et quando frangitur focile inferius, est fractura eius mala, et sanatio eius difficilis.	And when the lower humerus is broken, it is a bad fracture, and its healing is difficult.
Et deterior ea est, quando franguntur duo ossa simul.	And worse still is that, when both bones are broken together.
Si ergo os quod frangitur est focile parum superius, tunc conuenit medico apud restaurationem eius, ut ponat extensionem paruam cum facilitate, donec aequet ipsum.	If therefore the bone that is broken is the small upper humerus, then it is fitting for a doctor to use in its restoration an extension with ease, until it becomes equal.
Si uero focile magnum est illud quod fractum est: tunc oportet, ut ponat stricturam fortiorem ualde.	If however the larger humerus is that which is broken: then it is necessary to use a very strong tightening.
Et oportet, ut ponat figuram manus apud restaurationem eius, et ipsius extensionem extensam super puluinar.	And it is necessary to place the shape of a hand in its restoration, and the extended extension above the palm.
Et sit pollex manus ad superiora altior omnibus digitis: et sit articularis inferior omnibus digitis, uel reliquis: et infirmus sedens quadratus super seipsum, et sit puluinar coram eo, uel in directo eius, in altitudine, ut non incurrat infirmus laborem.	And let the thumb be above all the fingers, higher and more elevated; and let the wrist joint below all the fingers or the rest: and let the patient sit quadrately on himself, and let the palm be before him, or directly opposite him, at an elevation, so that the patient does not experience labor.
Deinde extendat minister Brachium ab inferiori parte, aut manu sua, aut cum ligamento.	Then let the servant extend the arm from the lower part, either by hand or with a bandage.
Et minister alius extendat desuper similiter.	And another servant extend similarly above.
Deinde aequet medicus os, donec reducat ipsum secundum meliorem figuram quam potest.	Then the doctor equalizes the bone until he reduces it to its better shape as much as possible.
Quod si in fractura ossis sunt satagiae, tunc conare reducere omne frustum in loco suo uirtute tua.	If there are splinters in a bone fracture, then try to reduce every fragment to its proper place with your skill.
Si uero apparet in eo sathaiatum separatum, et pungit cutem, et non est tibi spes in restauratione eius: tunc finde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum secundum modum quem diximus in eis quae praemissa sunt.	If indeed a severed sathaium appears, and it pierces the skin, and you have no hope of restoring it: then find it and remove it according to the method we mentioned earlier.
Si autem fractura est cum uulnere, ego iam feci ad illud capitulum singulare, ergo accipe curationem illius inde.	But if there is a fracture with a wound, I have already dealt with that special topic, so receive the treatment for it from there.
Quod si accidat in principio tuae restaurationis apostema calidum, tunc line pannum cum caeroto facto ex oleo rosato, et caera alba, et sit medium inter spissitudinem et subtilitatem: et stringe pannum super ipsum strictura subtili, donec quando sedatur apostema: tunc remoue caerotum, et pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum albumine oui.	What if an abscess occurs at the beginning of your treatment, then wrap a cloth made from cerate, which is a mixture of rose oil and white wax, with a medium consistency between thickness and thinness: and tie the cloth over it tightly but not too tight, until the abscess subsides; then remove the cerate and apply an ointment prepared from miller's flour with egg white.
Deinde pone astellas, et sit astella quae ponitur super fracturam ipsam latior parumper, et fortior.	Then place poultices, and let the poultice placed above the fracture itself be a little wider and stronger.
Et scias, quod numerus astellarum Brachii est sex in pluribus dispositionibus: siue sit fractura in focili uno, aut in duobus focilibus simul.	And know that the number of poultices for the arm is six in various arrangements: whether the fracture is in one or two places at once.
Deinde pone stricturam tuam super locum fracturae fortiorem et uehementiorem, et aliquanto plus cum strictura ad superiora fracturae, aut ad inferiora eius: aut pone stricturam molliorem strictura eius parumper, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius in principio capituli.	Then place your bandage above the fracture stronger and more tightly, and a little bit further up or down from the fracture, or place a softer bandage next to it for a while, according to how it was remembered at the beginning of this chapter.
Et sint panni qui inuoluuntur super fracturam, panni lenes, humidi: et non sint duri, asperi.	And let the cloths wrapped over the fracture be soft, moist ones: and not hard, rough ones.
Et sit filum quo stringitur ex lino proprie, medium inter subtile et grossum, sicut narrauimus.	And let the thread used to tie it be made of linen properly, with a medium thickness between thin and thick, as we have mentioned.
Et considera membrum et ligamentum post dies.	And consider the member and ligament after days.
Quod si accidat aliquid cuius rectificatio sit necessaria, sicut pruritus qui accidit membro: tunc oportet, ut embroces membrum cum aqua calefacta, donec quiescat ille pruritus, et dimittas membrum non constrictum, donec quiescat, deinde itera stricturam.	What if something happens that requires correction, such as itching that occurs in the member: then you should need to immerse the member in warm water until the itching subsides, and do not constrict the member until the itching subsides; then reapply the bandage.
Quod si strictura iam mollificata est, et os iam remotum, et similia illis: tunc rectifica illud totum uirtute tua, et considera iterum.	If the stricture is already relaxed and the bone has been removed and similar things: then correct that entire thing with your power and consider it again.
Nam si nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad membrum, propter superfluitatem stricturae, tunc oportet, ut mollifices ipsum parumper, et dimittas ipsum aliquot diebus, donec currat ad ipsum nutrimentum, deinde stringe ipsum.	For if nutrition is prevented from reaching the member because of excessive constriction, then you should soften it a little and leave it for some days until it flows into the nutrition, and then tighten it.
Si autem non accidit infirmo aliquid eorum quae diximus, tunc non oportet, ut soluatur, nisi post uiginti dies, aut circiter hos.	But if nothing from what we said happens to the patient, then it is not necessary to release it unless after twenty days or around that.
Deinde suspendatur manus infirmi ad collum eius.	Then hang the patient's hand at his neck.
Et sit collum eius aequale, et custodiatur uirtute sua a motibus agitatiuis.	And let his neck be even, and it should be kept by his own power from movements that are stirred up.
Et fac eum dormire super dorsum suum.	And make him sleep on his back.
Et scias, quod haec fractura in triginta diebus, aut in triginta duobus diebus restauratur: et fortasse restauratur in uigintiocto diebus.	And know that this fracture is restored in thirty days or in thirty-two days, and perhaps it is restored in twenty-eight days.
Totum illud est secundum dispositiones complexionum, et dispositiones uirtutis.	The whole thing is according to the dispositions of humors and the dispositions of power.
¶ De restauratione fracturarum Manus.	Of the restoration of fractures Hands.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter 14.
Scias, quod pectini Manus, et nodis digitorum raro accidit fractura.	Know that fracture rarely occurs in the wrist and joints of fingers.
Et non accidit ei, nisi attritio multotiens.	And it does not occur unless there is repeated attrition.
Quando ergo accidit plantae fractura, aut attritio: tunc oportet, ut sedeat infirmus quadratus: et coram eo sit sedes secundum aequalitatem.	When therefore a fracture or attrition occurs in the foot: then it is necessary for the patient to sit square and before him be a seat according to equality.
Deinde pone Manum eius super eam extensam.	Then place his hand on top of it, extended.
Deinde extendat minister ossa fracta, et aequet ea medicus, donec quando coniunguntur coniunctione bona.	Then the minister should stretch out the broken bones and the doctor should equalize them until they are joined with good union.
Tunc oportet, ut ponat emplastrum et stuppam, si non accidat apostema calidum.	Then it is necessary to apply a poultice and dressing, if there is no occurrence of hot swelling.
Deinde pone astellam desuper secundum quantitatem loci: et tu iam inuoluisti eam in panno lini.	Then place a bandage on top according to the size of the area, and you have already wrapped it with linen cloth.
Si autem fractura est ad inferiora circiter uentrem plantae, tunc fac simile spherae ex panno: et praecipe infirmo, ut coartet super eam cum planta sua fracta: deinde stringatur cum panno longo.	If however a fracture is near the lower part of the foot around the abdomen, then make a similar sphere from cloth and instruct the patient to bend over it with their fractured foot: afterwards tie it with a long cloth.
Et sit astella ex corio, in quo sit lenitas, ut applicetur corium cum corpore plantae: et stringe eam, secundum quod oportet.	And make a pad from leather, in which is softness, so that the leather can be applied to the body of the foot: and bind it as needed.
Si autem fractura est ad exteriora, tunc oportet: ut ponas astellam desuper, et astellam aliam ab inferiori in planta: et sit manus aperta recta.	If however the fracture is on the outside, then it is necessary: to place a pad above and another pad below on the foot: and have an open hand straight.
Deinde pone stricturam, sicut reuoluitur manus: et extende inter digitos cum ligamento.	Then place a bandage as the hand is turned back: and stretch between the fingers with a strap.
Quod si accidat fractura alicui nodorum digitorum, tunc si est pollex, aequetur secundum quod oportet.	If it happens that a fracture occurs to any of the joints of the fingers, then if it is the thumb, it will be set as needed.
Deinde stringatur cum planta: et si amas, pone ei astellam rectam, paruam: ut eleuetur fractura, et non moueatur.	Then bind it with the foot: and if possible, place a small straight pad on it, so that the fracture is lifted up and not moved.
Si autem fractura est reliquis digitis, sicut medio, et indici, aut auriculari, et anulari, tunc aequetur, et ligetur cum digito sano qui sequitur eum: aut ligentur omnes secundum continuationem: et est melius.	If however the fracture is in the other fingers, such as the middle, ring, or pinky, then it will be set and tied to the healthy finger that follows it: or all of them are tied according to continuity: and this is better.
Aut pone super ipsum astellam paruam, sicut diximus in pollice.	Or place a small pad on top of it, as we said in the thumb.
Et considera in restauratione tua, et post ipsam dispositionem apostematis calidi: et oppone cum eo quod oportet, quando accidit aliquid ex illo, secundum quod iteratur eius narratio.	And take note of your restoration and after this arrangement apply a poultice warm: and oppose with what is necessary when something happens from it, according to the narration of its progress.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Coxae.	¶ On the Restoration of a Fracture of the Hip.
Caput XV.	Chapter 15.
OS Coxae multotiens frangitur, et declaratur sensui: quoniam conuertitur ad interiorem et posteriorem partem.	The hip bone is often broken and declared to the senses: because it turns towards the inner and posterior part.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, quod stringitur ligamentum supra fracturam, et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	And its restoration is done in such a way that one ligament is wrapped above the fracture, and another ligament below the fracture.
Et infirmus prostretur super faciem suam.	And the patient should be stretched out on their face.
Deinde extendat omne ligamentum minister ad partem suam secundum aequalitatem: et hoc, quando est fractura in medio ossis.	Then let the surgeon stretch out every ligament on his side according to equality: and this when there is a fracture in the middle of a bone.
Si autem est fractura propinqua radici Coxae, tunc sit ligamentum ad partem pectinis, ut cadat extensio ad sursum: et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	But if there is a fracture near the root of the pelvis, then let the ligament be on the side of the groin, so that the extension falls upwards: and another ligament below the fracture.
Et sic similiter si est fractura propinqua genu, tunc sit ligamentum propinquum genu, ut sit extensio ad inferiora.	And thus similarly if there is a fracture near the knee, then let the ligament be near the knee, so that the extension falls downwards.
Deinde aequet medicus os utriusque manibus suis, donec reducat ipsum secundum similitudinem figurae naturalis: et coniugatur os coniunctione bona.	Then the surgeon equalizes the bone with his own hands until he reduces it according to the likeness of its natural shape: and the bone is united by a good union.
Tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum et stricturam, si non accidit membro apostema.	Then it is necessary to place a poultice and binding, unless an abscess occurs in the member.
Quod si accidat in eo apostema: tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur apostema calidum, deinde redi ad curationem tuam.	What if an abscess occurs in it: then leave it for a few days until the abscess cools down, and then return to your treatment.
Strictura autem eius ita sit.	And the binding should be thus.
Oportet ut inuoluas super fracturam imema duram, id est, bindam: et dupla eam bis, aut ter: et remaneat ex ea superfluitas.	It is necessary to wrap something hard, that is, a bandage, over the fracture: and double it twice, or thrice: and leave some excess from it.
Deinde inuolue crus, donec perueniat calcaneus apud radicem natis.	Then wrap the leg until the heel reaches the bone of the ankle.
Et intromitte filum longum inter Coxam et crus prope genu ad inferiora, et ueniant extremitates fili a superiori parte duarum partium.	And insert a long thread between the pelvis and leg near the knee, downwards, and let the ends of the thread come from the upper part of both parts.
Deinde reuolue super Crus et Coxam quod superfluit ex alimema.	Then wrap what remains over the leg and pelvis.
Deinde pone super Coxam in loco fracturae ipsius astellas, et pone ex eis astellam unam super os cruris.	Then place on the pelvis at the site of the fracture small stones, and place one stone over the bone of the leg.
Deinde imple uacuitates inter crus et coxam cum pannis lenibus, ut aequetur strictura.	Then fill the spaces between the leg and pelvis with soft cloths, so that the binding may be equalized.
Deinde incipe cum strictura forti a medio super locum fracturae tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor.	Then begin to bind with strong bandages from the middle over the place of the fracture three or four times.
Et quanto plus elongaris cum ligamento a loco fracturae, sit strictura tua minor et mollior, et lenior.	And the more you stretch out with the ligament away from the site of the fracture, let your binding be less and softer, and more gentle.
Deinde intende ad duas extremitates fili, quod tu intromisisti inter coxam et crus.	Then direct yourself towards the two ends of the thigh, where you inserted what is between the hip and the shank.
Liga ergo cum utrisque tres astellas quae sunt desuper.	Therefore bind with each of the three threads that are above.
Deinde uade cum duabus extremitatibus fili ad inferiora, donec peruenias ad cauillam pedis.	Then go with both ends of the thread to the lower part, until you reach the ankle of the foot.
Et cum utrisque stringe etiam extremitates astellarum a parte altera: ut non remoueatur ligamentum ex loco suo.	And with each bind also the ends of the threads from the other side, so that the ligament is not removed from its place.
Deinde dimitte stricturam super illud, dum permanet, ita quod non accidat membro corrosio, neque apostema, neque inflatio, et similia eis.	Then release the constriction above it as long as it remains, so that there is no corruption of the member, nor swelling, nor inflammation, and similar things.
Quod si accidat aliquid ex illo.	If something happens from that.
Propera ergo cum solutione eius, et rectifica illud quod accidit inde totum, secundum quod diximus multotiens.	So then hasten with its removal and correct what has happened as a result of it, according to how we have said many times.
Si uero in osse est frustum ex osse quod pungat: tunc oportet, ut aeques illud, si est tibi possibile.	If however there is a fragment of bone that pierces the bone, then it is necessary for you to equalize it if it is possible for you.
Et si non, finde super illud, et remoue illud: et cura cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio, donec sanetur.	And if not, find something above it and remove that; and take care of the one whose previous recollection was mentioned until they recover.
Et quandoque stringitur haec fractura Coxae, praeter quod addantur ei astellae, sicut diximus in adiutorio et brachio.	And when this fracture of the hip is bound, besides what threads are added to it as we said in the aid and arm.
Verumtamen in restauratione eius taliter fracta, non accidit infirmo claudicatio.	However, in its restoration when thus fractured, it does not cause a lame person to limp.
Et si restauratur sola, praeter quod applicetur ei crus alterum, tunc necesse est, ut claudicet ille cuius est, semper.	And if it is restored alone, besides the fact that another leg is applied to it, then it is necessary for that one who has it to limp always.
Et scias, quod Coxa stringitur in quinquaginta diebus, uel additur parum, aut minuitur parum: totum illud est secundum diuersitatem complexionum, et reliquarum dispositionum.	And know that the hip is bound for fifty days, or a little added to it, or a little reduced from it; all this is according to the diversity of complexions and other dispositions.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Rotulae genu.	Of the restoration of the fracture of the kneecap of the knee.
Caput XVI.	16th Chapter.
Scias, quod Rotulae genu raro accidit fractura, sed accidit ei attritio multotiens.	Know that the kneecap of the knee rarely suffers a fracture, but it often suffers wear and tear many times.
Si uero accidit ei fractura, tunc non nisi aut fissura, aut foramen in partibus suis.	If it happens to him that he has a fracture, then not except by fissure or opening in his parts.
Et est illud cum uulnere, et absque uulnere.	And it is this with wound, and without wound.
Et statur super illud totum cum sensu.	And he stands over that entire thing with sense.
Et restauratio eius est ita, ut aequetur quod disruptum est ex partibus eius cum digitis, donec aggregetur, et coniungatur secundum quod possibile est ex aequatione et facilitate, et fabricatione.	And his restoration is such that what was disrupted in his parts with fingers will be equalized, until it is gathered and joined according to what is possible from equality and ease, and fabrication.
Deinde pone emplastrum ex farina sisami, uel molendini, cum albumine oui: et pone super ipsum astellam rotundam, si indiges illa: et stringe desuper strictura conueniente ad illud.	Then place a poultice made from sassafras flour, or mill flour, with egg white: and place on top of it a round bandage, if you need one; and tie securely over it a suitable binding.
Deinde considera omnes dispositiones quas narrauimus in reliquis fracturis: sicut apostema calidum, et similia illi: ita, ut opponas omni accidenti cum eo quod conuenit ei, donec sanetur.	Then consider all the dispositions which we have described in other fractures: such as a warm abscess and similar ones: thus, that you oppose every occurrence to him with what is fitting for him, until he is healed.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Cruris.	Paragraph on the restoration of a fractured leg.
Caput XVII.	Chapter 17.
Scias, quod Cruri sunt duo ossa, quorum unum est grossum, et nominatur nomine Cruris: et alterum subtile, et nominatur Focile.	Know that there are two bones in the leg, one of which is large and is called by the name of Leg, and the other is slender and is called Fibula.
Et accidit utrisque ex speciebus fracturae quod accidit duobus ossibus brachii: et propter illud fit restauratio eius, sicut restauratio brachii aequaliter, et operatio est una.	And it happens to both of them in the form of a fracture which occurs in two arm bones, and because of that, its restoration is made equally with the restoration of the arm, and the operation is one.
Quod si franguntur duo ossa simul, conuertitur Crus ad omnes partes.	If both bones are broken at the same time, the leg turns into all parts.
Et si frangitur os subtilius, conuertitur Crus ad anteriorem partem.	And if the slender bone is broken, the leg turns to the anterior part.
Et si frangitur os grossius, inuenis illud inferius: et est ex eis quae non occultantur tibi.	And if the large bone is broken, you will find it below: and it is one of those that are not hidden from you.
Deinde administra extensionem, et aequationem, et ligationem astellarum secundum illud aequaliter.	Then administer extension, and equalization, and bandaging with round bandages according to what is equal.
Verumtamen oportet, si fractura Cruris est fractura foeda, habens sethagie multa: ut sit extensio minor, et lenior alleuiatione tua.	However, it is necessary if the leg fracture is a foul one having many swelling spots that there be less extension and gentler alleviation through your treatment.
Et in Crure quidem est ex operatione quiddam super brachium: et est, ut quando tu aequas astellas, et comples omnem operationem tuam, tunc accipe duas fascias ex ligno pini, quod administratur in fabricatione solariorum quod ponitur sub tabulis: et fiunt ex spatulis palmae: et elige ex eis quibus est grossitudo parua, et neque sint ex minutis: et sit longitudo earum secundum longitudinem Cruris a genu usque inferius.	And in the leg there is something from the operation above the arm: and it is, that when you equalize the stars, and complete all your operation, then take two strips of pine wood, which is used in the making of windowsills that are placed under tables: and they are made from spoon-shaped palings: and choose among them those with a small thickness, nor be they minute: and let their length be according to the length of the leg from the knee down.
Deinde inuolue super unamquamque pannum duabus inuolutionibus secundum longitudinem eius.	Then wrap each one around with two wraps, second by its length.
Et pone unam partem Cruris a parte una, et alteram a parte altera: et sint ex genu usque inferius pedis.	And place one part of the leg on one side and another on the other side: and let them be from the knee down to the foot.
Deinde liga duas fascias in tribus locis ex duabus extremitatibus et medio.	Then tie the two strips together in three places, at both ends and in the middle.
Cum enim strictura prohibetur, Crus declinat ad dextram et sinistram, et stat statione bona.	For when it is tightened, the leg bends to the right and left, and stands in a good position.
Et iam quidem administretur cunabulum ex ligno secundum longitudinem Cruris, et ponatur in eo Crus, ut conseruet ipsum a motu.	And now indeed apply a splint made of wood according to the length of the leg, and place the leg in it, so that it may be preserved from movement.
Et plurimum quidem oportet, ut facias illud in fractura quando cum ea est uulnus proprie.	And very much indeed you should do this in a fracture when there is a proper wound with it.
Deinde considera Crus in omni die, et stude cum eo studio ultimo ab apostemate, aut inflatione, aut reliquis aliis.	Then observe the leg every day, and strive with utmost diligence to prevent suppuration, or swelling, or other things.
Si ergo accidit aliquid ex illis, tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur, si Deus uoluerit.	If then something happens from those things, then apply to it what is needed until it heals, if God wills.
De fractura ossium Pedis, et Digitorum.	On the fracture of bones in the foot and fingers.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter 18.
Calcaneo quidem non accidit fractura penitus.	Indeed, a fracture does not occur at all in the heelbone.
Ossibus uero Pedis accidit quandoque fractura, et Digitis parum etiam accidit fractura: et non accidit eis nisi attritio in pluribus dispositionibus.	However, a fracture does occur in the bones of the foot and fingers sometimes, and even more so in the digits; and it does not occur to them except by attrition in many dispositions.
Quod si accidit ossibus Pedis fractura, et uides illa ossa sublimari super se adinuicem, tunc ponat infirmus Pedem suum super terram praeparatam, sicut ambulans.	What if a fracture occurs in the bones of the foot, and you see those bones being elevated above themselves to infinity, then let the patient place their foot on prepared ground as one walking.
Deinde sta tu, et pone Pedem tuum super illud quod eleuatur ex illis ossibus: postea preme, uel calca eam: et aequa ipsam, donec redeat in locis suis.	Then stand you, and place your foot on that which is lifted from those bones: afterwards press or crush it: and equalize it, until it returns to its place.
Deinde pone emplastrum, et stuppam desuper: et pone sub uentre Pedis tabulam paruam, cui sint duo capita plana.	Then apply a poultice and spread plaster over it: and place under the belly of the foot a small plate with two flat heads.
Deinde stringe eam cum Pede strictura decenti, postquam tu inuoluis eam cum pannis, et reliquis quibus indiget.	Then bind it with a bandage fittingly tight, after you have wrapped it with cloths and whatever else it may need.
Cum ergo praetereunt ei tres dies, aut quatuor, tunc solue ligamentum.	When therefore three or four days have passed over it, then loosen the bandage.
Nam tu inuenies ossa aequata, siue sint fracta, aut sint dislocata.	For you will find the bones equalized, whether they are broken or dislocated.
Operatio ergo in eis est, sicut uides.	Therefore the operation is done on them as you see.
Si autem franguntur aliqui digiti, tunc restaura eos, et aequa ipsos secundum quod narraui tibi in restauratione digitorum manus.	But if any fingers are broken, then restore them and equalize them as I told you about the restoration of fingers on the hand.
Deinde pone digito tuo astellam secundum longitudinem digiti, et sit latior eo parumper: deinde pone sub Pede hanc tabulam quam narraui tibi, et stringe eam strictura decenti.	Then place a ring on your finger according to the length of the digit, and let it be a little wider than that: afterwards place this plate under the foot which I told you about, and bind it with a bandage fittingly tight.
Si uero quod frangitur ex ossibus est duo, aut tria, aut plus, tunc pone super omnem digitum astellam suae quantitatis, inuolutam in panno lini: et stringe tabulam in inferiori Pedis: et sit stans super unum capitum tabulae extra uentrem Pedis, ut teneat retentione bona.	If however what is broken from the bones is two or three or more, then place a ring of that size over all the digit, wrapped in linen cloth: and bind the plate to the lower foot: and let it stand on one side of the plate's head outside the belly of the foot, so as to hold good retention.
Et conuenit tibi, ut non obliuiscaris, quin consideres omnia quae dixi tibi in reliquis fracturis ex accidentibus quae diximus: et oppone omni accidenti cum eo quod oportet.	And it is fitting for you not to forget, but rather to consider all that I have told you about other fractures from the accidents we mentioned: and oppose every accident with what is necessary.
¶ De fractura Vuluae mulieris, et ossis pectinis, et uirgae uiri.	¶ On the fracture of a woman's womb, and of the pelvis bone, and of a man's spine.
Caput XIX.	XIX.
Quando frangitur Vulua mulieris, tunc fac eam sedere quadratam.	When a woman's womb is broken, then make it sit square.
Deinde inclina eam ad partem dorsi ipsius parumper, et teneatur retro.	Then bend it towards the side of his back a little, and hold it back.
Deinde impleat obstetrix Vuluam eius coto, donec impleat eam: et fiat in Vulua ex eo sicut sphera.	Then let the midwife fill his scrotum with the liquid until it is full; and let it be in the scrotum like a sphere.
Deinde concutiatur mulier, et eleua dorsum eius paulatim.	Then let the woman be struck, and raise her back gradually.
Illud enim cotum egreditur, donec fiat ante portam Vuluae sicut sphera, et os fractum redit.	For that matter, what comes out of the scrotum comes forth until it becomes like a sphere before the orifice of the scrotum, and the fractured opening returns.
Deinde pone puluillum super dorsum eius.	Then place a poultice on her back.
Quando ergo uult mingere, remoueat cotum cum facilitate, deinde mingat: et reduc ipsum secundum modum, quo intromisisti ipsum in primis: deinde redeat ad puluillum suum primum.	When therefore she wants to urinate, remove the scrotum with ease, then let her urinate; and return it to its original place, then go back to its first poultice.
Faciat illud septem diebus, aut circiter, os ipsum enim restauratur.	Let him do that for seven days or so, for the opening is restored.
Et si uis, accipe uesicam ouis, et stringe super foramen eius cannulam arundinis, et intromitte uesicam totam in Vuluam eius.	And if you want, take a sheep's bladder and tie it over the opening with a reed cane, and insert the bladder entirely into his scrotum.
Deinde suffla in cannulam cum uirtute, donec infletur uesica intra Vuluam, fractura enim redit.	Then blow into the tube with force until the bladder is inflated inside the scrotum, for the fracture returns.
Deinde impleatur cum coto, et stet aliquot diebus, secundum quod narrauimus, donec sanetur.	Then it will be filled with liquid and remain for a few days, as we have narrated, until it heals.
Et quando frangitur os Pectinis uiri, aut mulieris, tunc administra in restauratione eius, et ipsius aequatione illud quod narrauimus in osse Anchae.	And when the opening of the man's or woman's pectoral bone is fractured, then apply this in its restoration and equalization, as we have narrated, to the broken bone.
Et non occultatur rectum in his fracturis propinquis, quae parum contingunt, praecipue cui est quiddam studii, uel usus.	And the rectum is not obstructed in these nearby fractures that are slight and do not interfere, especially for one who has some knowledge or experience.
Et intellige librum meum istum multum, quoniam fractura ipsa significat tibi in pluribus dispositionibus uiam rectam in restauratione sui, et strictura sui: intellige ergo.	And understand my book thoroughly, for this fracture itself signifies to you in many dispositions a straight path for its restoration and correction: understand therefore.
In Virga autem uiri quando frangitur, accipe guttur anseris: et intromitte uirgam in ipso.	In the man's arm when it is fractured, take a goose's gullet; and insert the splint into it.
Deinde pone super ipsum inuolutionem ex panno, et inuoluatur, et dimittatur tribus diebus, aut circiter eos, et sanabitur, si Deus uoluerit.	Then place a wrapping of cloth over it and wrap it, and let it be for three days or about that time, and it will heal, if God wills.
¶ De restauratione fracturae ossium, quando est cum uulnere.	On the restoration of fractured bones with a wound.
Caput XX.	Chapter 20.
Conuenit ei cui accidit fractura cum uulnere, praecipue si est magnum, sicut os coxae, aut adiutorii, aut simile illi, ut properes, et phlebotomes ipsum statim: si attestantur tibi conditiones phlebotomiae, sicut praemisimus.	It is fitting for someone who suffers a fracture with a wound, especially if it is great, such as the hip bone or thighbone, or similar to these, to hasten and let blood immediately: if the conditions for letting blood are indicated to you, just as we have mentioned before.
Quod si uulnus effluit sanguinem, tunc oportet, ut properes ad abscisionem eius, ita ut puluerizes super ipsum zegi tritum: si non est tibi praesens aliud.	If the wound is bleeding blood, then you should hasten to apply a poultice to it, thus powdering over it with crushed vermilion: if nothing else is present for you.
Deinde incipe restaurare fracturam in illo eodem die: et non postponas illud, si non accidit apostema.	Then begin to restore the fracture on the same day: and do not delay it unless an abscess occurs.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte restaurationem eius usque ad diem nonum, donec sedetur apostema.	If a hot abscess occurs, then put off restoring the fracture until the ninth day, until the abscess subsides.
Et non appropinques ei in die tertio, et quarto omnino, nam tu faceres ei accidere accidentia mala.	And do not approach it on the third and fourth days at all, for you would cause evil consequences to occur.
Si autem os fractum est eminens super cutem detectum: tunc oportet, ut coneris reducere ipsum, et aequare ipsum manibus tuis cum facilitate et extensione parua.	If the fractured bone is prominent above the skin and visible: then you should endeavor to reduce it and equalize it with your hands with ease and a small amount of stretching.
Si autem non praeparatur extensio eius, et ipsius aequatio manibus tuis: tunc reduc ipsum cum isto instrumento.	If however the extension and equalization of it by your hands do not prepare themselves: then reduce it with this instrument.
Et est instrumentum quod fit ex ferro, cuius longitudo est quantitas septem digitorum, aut octo: et eius latitudo est secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And the instrument is one made of iron, whose length is equal to seven or eight fingers, and its width is according to the size of the wound.
Et propter illud necesse est medico, ut accipiat ex eis tria, aut quatuor secundum quantitatem qua indiget ad illud ex curatione in omni specie fracturae.	And for that reason it is necessary for the physician to take three or four of them according to the size he needs for the cure of any type of fracture.
Et sit rotundum: et sit in eo grossitudo parua, ut non duplicetur apud compressionem super ipsum in hora operationis: et sit acutae extremitatis, cui sit margo in extremitatibus suis.	And let it be rounded; and let there be a small thickness to it, so that it does not double upon itself under compression at the time of the operation: and let its sharp extremity have an edge on its ends.
Et sit superius eius ad grossitudinem ex medietate eius usque ad inferiora.	And let it be above his size to the thickness from its middle down to the lower parts.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Oportet in Hac Operatione, ut ponatur extremitas eius acuta curuata super extremitatem ossis eminentis: et impelle ipsum cum eo uice una, donec quando redit os et aequatur quadam aequatione.	It is necessary for this operation that the sharp end of it be curved and placed above the prominent bone; and push it with one movement until the bone returns and becomes equal in some way.
Conare ergo aequare extremitates fracturae adinuicem.	Therefore, make sure to equalize the ends of the fracture to each other.
Quod si extremitates eius fracta est subtilis, et non accipit eam instrumentum accaeptione bona, tunc opotet, ut incidas extremitatem illius ossis, donec instrumentum potestatem habeat eius.	But if the ends of it are fine and do not receive the instrument well, then it is necessary to cut the end of the bone until the instrument has the power over it.
Si uero non potes reducere eos cum eo quod narrauimus omnino, tunc incide ipsum cum eo quod conuenit ei ex Incisoriis quae diximus: aut serra ipsum cum una serrarum quocunque modo possibile est tibi.	But if you are not able to reduce them as we described entirely, then cut it with the instrument that is suitable for it from among those which we mentioned: or saw it with any saw that you can use in whatever way is possible for you.
Deinde rade illud quod remanet in osse ex asperitate et corticibus minutis.	Then remove what remains on the bone from its roughness and small flakes.
Cum ergo reducitur os, et inuenit infirmus post reductionem eius dolorem uehementem laedentem, tunc scias, quod os non rediit ad locum suum naturalem.	When therefore the bone is reduced and after its reduction the patient finds a severe and grievous pain, then you will know that the bone has not returned to its natural place.
Fac ergo illud.	So do it.
Nam tu confers infirmo iuuamentum magnum, cum completur restauratio tua quam facis ossi.	For you are bringing great relief to the patient when your restoration of the bone is complete.
Tunc submerge pannum in uino stiptico, nigro.	Then immerse a cloth in black wine that has been used for dressing.
Et proprie si est in aestate.	And especially if it is in the summer.
Et non ponas super uulnus caerotum, neque aliquid in quo sit oleum: ut non faciat accidere in ipso putredinem et corruptionem.	And do not place a poultice on the wound or anything that contains oil, so that it will not cause putrefaction and corruption to occur.
Deinde administra astellas in hora complementi tui a restauratione ossis.	Then administer stars in the hour that completes your restoration of the bone.
Et dimitte uulnus detectum: ita, ut incidas cum forficibus foramen in inuolutionibus secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And leave the wound open: thus, cut with forceps a hole in the swellings according to the size of the wound.
Et caue omni cautela, ne stringas uulnus cum fractura.	And beware with all caution not to tie the wound with the fracture.
Multotiens enim fecerunt istud stolidi medici: et fecerunt accidere super infirmos suos aut mortem, aut corrosionem, aut zuchem, id est, saniem.	Many times, indeed, foolish physicians have done this: and they have caused to happen over their sick patients either death, or rotting, or stinking, that is, suppuration.
Et sit strictura tua mollis, lenis, diuersa stricturae fracturarum reliquarum.	And let your constriction be gentle, soft, different from the fractures of other remnants.
Quod si uulnus est malum, aut est uulnus magnum, et times super ipsum quaedam accidentia mala quae narrauimus, et inuenis dolorem in loco suspensum: tunc non oportet, ut ponas super ipsum astellas.	For if the wound is bad or a great wound, and you are afraid of certain evil consequences which we have mentioned, and you find pain suspended in its place; then it is not fitting to put stitches over it.
Et fac eis inuolutiones ex pannis duris in loco astellarum, et stringe ipsum cum eis.	And make incisions with hard cloths in the place of the stitches, and bind it with them.
Cum autem est post diem unum, aut dies duos, et uides uulnus iam incipere, ut in eo generetur pus: tunc aufer desuper ipsum pannum quem posuisti super ipsum cum uino.	When however it is after one day, or two days, and you see the wound already beginning to form pus: then take away from above it the cloth which you placed over it with wine.
Deinde administra licinia, et unguenta cum quibus de consuetudine nostra est, ut medicemur uulnera: sicut unguentum tetrapharmacon, et similia illi.	Then administer licorice and ointments with which we are accustomed to treat wounds, such as the four-drug ointment, and similar ones.
Et conuenit tibi, ut soluas ligamentum.	And it is fitting for you to untie the bandage.
Et considera uulnus in omni die mane et uespere, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	And examine the wound every morning and evening, until it is consolidated and healed.
Et oportet, ut praeparetur membrum taliter, ut currat ex eo pus ad inferiora cum facilitate.	And it is necessary to prepare the limb in such a way that the pus flows out from it downwards with ease.
Quod si praetereunt uulneri dies multi, et non consolidatur, neque abscinditur pus ab eo: tunc scias, quod illic sunt satagie ossis parua.	For if many days pass over the wound and it does not consolidate nor is the pus cut away from it: then you will know that there are small bone splinters present.
Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.	Therefore it is necessary to inspect the wound with a probe.
Quot uero ex illis alsatagie sunt separata, remoue ea, et extrahe ipsa.	As many of those bone splinters as are separated, remove them and extract them.
Et quae ex eis sunt non separata, et pungunt membrum, et faciunt accidere dolorem, conare incidere ea, et auferre ea omni modo quo possibile est tibi illud.	And as for those that are not separated and pierce the limb, causing pain and suffering, try to cut them off and remove them in any way possible that it is within your power.
Quod si accidat uulneri zuchen, aut ekileten, id est, estiomenus, aut species alia corruptionis et putrefactionis: tunc oportet, ut opponas unicuique ex eis cum eo quod conuenit ei ex curatione, cuius praecessit narratio in capitulo suo.	If it happens that the wound becomes foul-smelling, or gangrenous, that is, putrid, or takes on some other appearance of corruption and putrefaction: then you must apply to each of these something suitable for its treatment, as described in its own chapter.
Et ex eo in quo oportet ut stet sermo meus, et cui facias praesentem mentem tuam quando frangitur os, et eminet super membrum, sicut os coxae, et adiutorii, et similia eis ex membris magnis, est, ut non praesumas attractionem eius, multotiens enim accidit ex illo mors, imo dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat.	And as for that in which it is necessary that my speech stand, and to whom you should present your mind when a bone breaks and protrudes above the member, just like the hip bone and similar ones from large members, it is that you do not presume its attraction, for many times death occurs because of this, rather let it be, until it putrefies.
Fortasse enim cadet per se post uiginti dies, aut triginta.	Perhaps indeed it will fall away by itself after twenty days, or thirty.
Tunc ergo cura uulnus, si uidetur tibi: et sinon, dimitte ipsum.	Then therefore take care of the wound, if you think fit; and otherwise, let it be.
¶ De curatione Nodationis in uestigio fracturae.	On the treatment of Setting-in after a fracture.
Caput XXI.	Chapter XXI.
Multoties accidit haec Nodatio in uestigio sanationis fracturae.	This setting-in often occurs in the pursuit of healing a fracture.
Praecipue, quae est prope iuncturas: et foedatur ex ea figura membri.	Especially those near joints: and it is disfigured from that shape of the member.
Et fortasse prohibet membrum ab operatione sua naturali.	And perhaps prevents the member from performing its natural function.
Considera ergo tunc, si nodatio est recens: administra in ea medicinas quae stipticitatem habent, sicut aloe, et olibanum, et myrrha, et sarcocolla, et acacia, et similia eis.	So then, consider if the setting-in is recent: administer to it medicines that have astringent properties, such as aloe, and frankincense, and myrrh, and sarsaparilla, and acacia, and similar ones.
Ita, ut accipias ex istis quasdam, aut omnes eas: et confice eas cum uino stiptico, aut cum albumine oui, aut cum aceto: et pone eas super nodationem in stuppa, et stringe eas super ipsam strictura bona.	Thus, take some or all of these, and mix them with astringent wine, or with egg white, or with vinegar: and place them over the setting-in on a poultice, and bind them tightly over it with good bandaging.
Et dimitte stricturam, nec soluas eam diebus multis.	And leave the binding in place, nor remove it for many days.
Deinde solue eam, et itera aliam, donec remoueatur nodatio.	Then loosen it and repeat another, until the setting-in is removed.
Aut stringe super ipsam laminam plumbi decenter.	Or bind a lead plate over it decently.
Plumbo enim est proprietas remouendi omne quod timetur ex membris.	For lead has the property of removing all that is feared from a member.
Si autem nodatio iam in lapidem conuersa est, et stricta est, et festine prouocat necessitas ad auferendum eam: tunc finde super eam ex superiori parte eius, et incide superfluitatem eminentem: aut rade eam cum quibusdam rasoriis, donec remoueatur: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	But if the setting-in has already become a bone and is hardened and firm, and there is urgent necessity to remove it: then find above it from its upper part, and cut off any excess that protrudes: or scrape it with certain rasps, until it is removed: and take care of it, until it heals.
¶ De curatione quando restauratur, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, non secundum naturam suam.	Of the healing when restored, and the member remains after it has been refined, not according to its natural state.
Caput XXII.	Here is the translation:
Quando restauratur fractura ossis, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, debile: tunc non fit illud nisi propter caussas multas.	When a fracture of bone is restored, and the member that follows it remains subtle, weak: then it does not come to be except for many causes.
Quarum una est, multitudo solutionis ligamenti et ligationis eius non secundum quod oportet: aut propter superfluitatem stricturae ligamentorum, donec prohibeatur nutrimentum currere ad membrum: aut propter multitudinem embrocationis superfluae in non sua hora: aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore infirmi, et debilitatem eius.	One of which is the multitude of ligament loosening and its tying not as it should be. Or because of excess tightness of the ligaments until nutrition is prevented from reaching the member. Or because of excessive embrocation at an unsuitable time. Or because of a lack of blood in the weak body, and its debilitation.
Et curatio illius est, cibare infirmum, et tenerum facere corpus eius, donec multiplicetur sanguis in eo.	And the cure for this is to feed the weak person and make their body tender until blood is multiplied in them.
Et administra balneum.	And administer a bath.
Et intromitte gaudium et laeticiam super eum.	And bring joy and cheerfulness to him.
Deinde pone picem super membrum: ut attrahat pix ad ipsum nutrimentum multum.	Then place pitch on the member, so that it may draw pitch towards itself to take in much nourishment.
Et assiduet embrocationem eius cum aqua tepida, donec currat nutrimentum, et redeat ad figuram suam naturalem.	And apply its embrocation with warm water repeatedly, until nutrition flows and it returns to its natural form.
¶ De curatione ossium fractorum quando restaurantur tortuose.	Concerning the cure of fractured bones when they are restored in a twisted way.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter 23.
Quando accidit membro iam restaurato post sanationem eius tortuositas, et eminentia ossi fracto, aut nodatio: et foedatur per illud forma membri, uerumtamen membrum non prohibetur ab operatione sua naturali: tunc non oportet ut recipias sermonem eius, qui existimat, ut frangatur membrum denuo.	When it happens that a member which has already been restored after its healing becomes twisted and the projecting part of the fractured bone or knot forms; and the shape of the member is marred by this, yet the member is not prevented from performing its natural function: then it is not necessary to take heed of the word of one who thinks that the member should be broken again.
Et iam fuerunt multi stolidorum medicorum et restauratorum, qui fecerunt illud in terra nostra.	And already many foolish physicians and restorers have done this on our earth.
Et haec quidem operatio est uituperabilis ualde, perducens ad mortem, uel timorem magnum, ut scilicet sit mortalis.	And indeed this operation is highly reprehensible, leading to death or great fear, so that it may be mortal.
Verum si claudicatio et nodatio sunt recentes: tunc oportet, ut embrocetur cum aqua tepida, in qua decoctae sint herbae mollificantes, sicut folia alteae, et radix eius, et mellilotum, et illis similia.	But if the contraction and knotting are recent: then it is necessary that it be bathed with warm water, in which herbs that soften have been decocted, such as tall grass leaves, and its root, and sweet melilotus, and similar ones.
Et fiat ei emplastrum cum emplastro mollificatiuo, sicut dyachilon decenter factum.	And let a poultice be made with a softening poultice, as is done for a tender eye.
Aut sumatur mucilago radicis alteae, et concutiatur cum adipe gallinae, aut oleo sisamino: et emplastretur cum eo.	Or the mucus of the high radish root should be taken and mixed with hen's fat or sesame oil; and it should be poulticed with this.
Aut sumantur ficus pingues, et terantur cum fimo columbino, et similibus eis quae nominantur ex medicinis diminuentes consolidationem.	Or figs that are ripe should be taken and pounded with dove's dung or similar substances which are called medicinal decoctions for breaking up consolidation.
Et quandoque soluitur nodatio cum fricatione assidua, antiqua, et leni, quae fit cum manibus humidis.	And sometimes the knot is loosened by constant, old, and gentle rubbing with moist hands.
Et administretur motus membri ad omnem partem in horis omnibus.	And movement of the member should be administered to every part at all hours.
Si autem tortuositas iam antecessit, et fortis facta est, et conuersa est in lapidem, et prouocata est necessitas ad curatonem eius cum ferro: tunc oportet, ut secetur superius eius, et soluatur continuatio ossis, et incidatur quod superfluit ex nodatione aut osse cum Incisoriis subtilibus: et administretur facilitas in illo cum sollicitudine et studio.	But if the curvature has already preceded and is strong and turned into a bone, and there is great need for its treatment with iron; then it is necessary to cut above it, and to release the continuity of the bone, and to remove what exceeds from the knot or bone with fine saws: and facilitate should be administered in that with solicitude and diligence.
¶ De sermone in Dislocatione.	A Chapter on Talking during a Dislocation.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter 28.
Dislocatio est exitus alicuius iuncturarum a loco suo.	Dislocation is the departure of some joints from their place.
Quare prohibetur a motu suo, et foedatur figura membri.	Therefore it is prevented by its own motion, and the figure of the member is disfigured.
Et facit accidere super infirmum dolores, et laesiones uehementes.	And causes great pains and severe injuries to happen above the weak person.
Quando ergo accidit alicui dislocatio, tunc oportet festinare ad restaurationem eius: neque tardet eam omnino.	When therefore dislocation occurs in someone, then it is necessary to hasten its restoration; and one should not delay it at all.
Nam si tardatur, apostematur locus, et fortasse cum eo reductio dislocationis.	For if one delays, the place will suppurate, and perhaps even the reduction of the dislocation will be lost.
Propter illud ergo non oportet, ut moueatur, neque extendatur in hora apostemationis eius.	On account of that therefore one should not move or stretch it during the hour of its suppuration.
Quoniam multotiens facit accidere spasmum, et dolores laedentes.	For it often causes a spasm and pains that cause harm.
Verum quando accidit illud, tunc oportet, ut properes ad phlebotomiam infirmi.	But when this occurs, then one should hasten to bleed the patient.
Deinde dimittatur, donec quiescat apostema.	Then it should be released until the swelling subsides.
Deinde embrocetur membrum cum aqua calida et oleo.	Then foment the limb with hot water and oil.
Deinde reducatur cum facilitate.	Then reduce it gently.
Et curetur omne membrum cum eo cuius rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And take care of every limb as if it were its own, so that the memory of it will return to its place.
Ego quidem iam ordinaui capitula dislocationis, etiam secundum quod praecessit in fractura, a superiori parte corporis usque ad inferiorem eius.	I have indeed arranged the chapters on dislocations, just as they preceded those on fracture, from the upper part of the body to the lower one.
¶ De cura dislocationis Mandibulae inferioris.	On the treatment of the dislocation of the lower jawbone.
Caput XXV.	Chapter 25.
Parum dislocantur duae Mandibulae nisi raro.	Two jawbones are rarely dislocated a little.
Et dislocatio ambarum fit secundum unum duoru modorum.	And the dislocation of both is caused by two modes.
Aut enim remouentur a locis suis remotione parua, et mollificantur parumper.	For they are either moved from their places by a small removal and are temporarily relaxed.
Aut dislocantur dislocatione integra, completa, donec mollificentur ad partem pectoris, donec currat saliua infirmi, et non possit tenere eam, neque possit claudere os suum, et inuoluatur lingua eius cum sermone.	Or they are dislocated completely and entirely until they become relaxed to the chest, until the patient's saliva flows, and he is unable to hold it nor shut his mouth, and his tongue is wrapped around his speech.
Quando autem dislocatio eius est parua, tunc redit in pluribus dispositionibus per se cum paucitate.	When however the dislocation of this is small, then it returns to its natural position with a few manipulations by itself.
Si uero est dislocatio completa, integra: tunc oportet, ut administretur reductio eius uelociter, et non tardetur penitus: et est, ut teneat minister caput infirmi: et intromittat medicus pollicem manus suae unius in radicem Mandibulae dislocationis inter os eius, si dislocatio est a parte una.	If the dislocation is complete and entire, then it is necessary to apply reduction quickly and not delay at all: and it is as if one holds the patient's head, and the doctor inserts his thumb of one hand into the root of the dislocated jawbone between his mouth, if the dislocation is on one side.
Aut intromittat duos pollices suos simul, si dislocatio est a duabus partibus.	Or he inserts both thumbs simultaneously, if the dislocation is from both sides.
Et reliqui digiti manuum eius sint extra, quibus aequet.	And the remaining fingers of his hand should be outside, by which he adjusts.
Et praecipe infirmo, ut mundificet Mandibulas suas, et absoluat eas ad manducandum ad omnem partem.	And instruct the patient to clean their jawbones and prepare them for eating in every direction.
Et medicus aequet Mandibulam, et impellat Mandibulam, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And the doctor adjusts the jawbone and pushes it until it returns to its place.
Quod si difficilis sit reductio eius, praecipue si sunt ambae Mandibulae simul: tunc administra uaporationem cum aqua calida, et oleo, donec fiat facilis reductio ambarum: neque tardes reductionem ambarum omnino, sicut diximus.	If the reduction is difficult, especially if both mandibles are simultaneously affected; then administer vapour with hot water and oil, until the reduction of both becomes easy. Do not delay the reduction of both at all, as we have said.
Cum ergo redeunt et aequantur, et clauditur os infirmi, et non mollificantur: tunc pone super eas puluillos pannorum, cum ceroto quod sit factum ex cera: et oleo rosato.	When therefore they return and are equalized, and the mouth of the weak is closed, and does not soften: then place on them woolen pads with wax that has been made from beeswax: and rose oil.
Deinde ligetur cum facilitate cum ligamentis mollibus.	Then it should be secured with ease using soft binding materials.
Et sit somnus infirmi super dorsum suum: et caput eius sit stans inter duo puluinaria, ut non moueat ipsum ad dextram et sinistram: neque conetur, uel cogatur masticare aliquid: imo ponatur cibus eius sorbitio lenis, donec quando remouentur dolores, et nodatur Mandibula: tunc comedat quod uult, et administretur illud cum facilitate.	And let the weak person sleep on their back: and their head should be placed between two pillows, so that they do not move it to the right or left: nor attempt, nor be forced to chew anything: rather, have them offered a gentle drink, until when the pains are removed, and the jaw becomes relaxed; then let them eat what they want, and administer it with ease.
Non laboret super operationem oris sui apud comestionem et potum, et oscitationem, donec nodetur Mandibula, et sanetur.	He should not strain himself over the operation of his mouth during eating and drinking, and yawning, until the jaw becomes relaxed and is healed.
Quod si difficilis fiat reductio duarum Mandibuiarum, quando dislocantur in hora aliqua, et non conuertuntur ad loca sua: tunc multotiens accidunt inde febres, et soda assidua: et fortasse soluitur uenter infirmi, et fortasse uomit choleram puram.	But if the reduction of the two mandibles becomes difficult when they dislocate at some time and do not return to their place; then many times fevers occur, and constant headaches: and perhaps the patient's bowels are loosened, and perhaps he vomits pure bile.
Cum ergo uides illud: tunc scias, quia est perditio, et multotiens moritur ille cui accidit illud in decem diebus.	When therefore you see this: then you will know that it is a loss, and that many times the one to whom this happens dies within ten days.
¶ De reducione dislocationis Furculae, et extremitatis humeri.	The reduction of clavicle dislocation and shoulder extremity.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter 26.
Furcula quidem non dislocatur ex latere intrinseco, propter continuationem suam cum pectore.	The clavicle indeed does not dislocate inwardly from the side, due to its connection with the breastbone.
Et dislocatur quandoque ad exteriora: et declaratur illud sensui.	And it dislocates sometimes outwardly: and that is declared by sensation.
Et restauratio eius est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat brachia sua.	And its restoration is, that the weak person lies on their back, and stretches out their arms.
Deinde coarta locum cum palma tua coartatione forti, nam ipsa redibit.	Then compress the place with your palm by strong compression, for it will return itself.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stringe eam.	Then place a poultice and small pills on top of it, and bind it tightly.
Extremitates uero eius quae sequuntur cubitum, et continuantur cum eo, non dislocantur, nisi raro.	Its extremities, however, which follow the elbow joint and are connected with it, do not get displaced, unless rarely.
Quod s dislocatur die aliquo: tunc oportet, ut reducatur et aequetur secundum quod diximus, et quod praeparatur tibi.	But if it happens to be dislocated on some day: then it is necessary that it should be reduced and set straight as we have said, and as you are preparing for yourself.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam.	Then place a poultice, small pills, and bandaging on top of it.
Et praecipe infirmo, adhaerere tranquillitati et quieti, donec sanetur.	And instruct the patient to adhere to tranquility and quietness until they recover.
Et cum hac eadem curatione reducitur extremitas Humeri, quando separatur etiam a loco suo.	And with this same treatment the extremity of the Shoulder is reduced when it has separated from its place.
¶ De reductione dislocationis Humeri.	Paragraph on the reduction of a dislocated shoulder.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter 27.
Scias, quod Humerus non dislocatur, nisi secundum tres modos.	Know that the Shoulder does not become dislocated except in three ways.
Quorum unus est, ut dislocetur ad partem titillici ad inferiora.	One of which is when it becomes dislocated towards the lower part of the titillium.
Secundus est, ut dislocetur ad partem pectoris.	The second is when it becomes dislocated towards the part of the chest.
Et fortasse dislocatur ad superiorem partem Humeri: et illud fit raro.	And perhaps it becomes dislocated to the upper part of the Shoulder: and that happens rarely.
Et non dislocatur ad posteriora, propter spatulam.	And it does not become dislocated to the back, due to the spatula.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora, propter neruos.	And it does not become dislocated to the front, due to the nerves.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur et egreditur ad inferiora uersus titillicum: praecipue in illis, quorum carnes sunt paucae.	And indeed it becomes dislocated and exits downwards towards the titillium: especially in those whose flesh is sparse.
Quoniam egrediur in eis uelociter, et ingreditur uelociter.	Because it goes out quickly from them and comes back quickly.
In illis autem quorum carnes sunt multae, est econtrario illius, scilicet quia egreditur cum difficultate, et ingreditur cum difficultate.	But in those whose flesh is abundant, it is contrary to that, namely because it goes out with difficulty and comes back with difficulty.
Et fortasse accidit quibusdam hominibus percussio, aut casus, et apostematur Humerus apostemate calido, et putatur propter illud, quia iam dislocatus est.	And perhaps it happens to some people a blow or a fall, and the Shoulder becomes inflamed with a hot apostema, and is judged because of that, since it has already become dislocated.
Oportet ergo, ut experiaris illud, donec stes super certitudinem eius, et tunc procedas in curatione eius.	Therefore, you must test it until you stand firm on its certainty, and then proceed with its cure.
Et cognoscitur dislocatio, quando est ad inferiora uersus titillicum: et distinguas inter Humerum dislocatum, et humerum sanum.	And it is known to be a dislocation when it is turned towards the lower parts; and distinguish between a dislocated shoulder and a healthy one.
Nam tu inuenis inter eos diuersitatem manifestam, et inuenis in capite Humeri concauitatem, et sub titillico apud tactum caput humeri quasi ipsum sit ouum: et non potest infirmus reducere manum ad aurem suam, neque mouere eam omnibus motibus.	For you will find a manifest difference between them; and you will find in the head of the shoulder a hollowing out, and beneath the titillic, at the touch, it is as if the very bone were an egg: and the infirm person cannot bring their hand to their ear, nor move it with all movements.
Et similiter, si dislocatur uersus pectus, aut ad sursum: tunc inuenis manifestum tactum, neque occultatur.	And similarly, if the dislocation is towards the breast or upwards: then you will find a manifest touch, and it will not be hidden.
Et huius quidem dislocationis fit facilis reductio, quando est recens, aut infirmus est puer.	And this kind of dislocation is easy to reduce when it is recent or the child is weak.
Et reductio eius est, ut eleuet minister manum suam ad superiora.	And its reduction is that you lift your hand upwards and apply gentle pressure.
Deinde pone tu pollices tuos sub titillico eius, et eleua iuncturam cum fortitudine ad sursum ad locum suum: et minister eleuet manum suam, et extendat eam ad sursum.	Then place your fingers beneath the titillic of it, and lift the joint with strength upwards to its place; and the minister lifts their hand and stretches it upwards.
Deinde ponat eam inferius, ipse enim redit uelociter.	Then place it downwards, for it will return quickly itself.
Si autem non redit per illud quod diximus, et sunt a principio quo accidit dislocatio dies multi: tunc oportet, ut balneetur infirmus in aqua calida, et administretur embrocatio quae mollificat et lenit, sicut si decoquantur radices alteae, et foenugraecum, et mellilotum in aqua, et administretur.	But if it does not return through what we said, and there have been many days since the dislocation occurred: then it is necessary for the infirm person to bathe in warm water, and to be administered a poultice that softens and soothes, such as if the roots of henna, foenugraecum, and mellilot were decocted in water, and administered.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et ponatur sub titillico eius sphera et lana, quae sit aequalis inter lenitatem et stricturam.	Then the infirm person should be laid out on their back: and a ball and wool should be placed beneath the titillic of it, which is equal between softness and tightness.
Deinde ponat medicus calcaneum suum super spheram, et eleuet caput humeri cum uirtute, et attrahat manum infirmi ad inferiora.	Then the doctor should place their heel on top of the ball, and lift the head of the shoulder with strength, and pull the hand of the infirm person downwards.
Et minister alius teneat caput infirmi, ut non moueatur ad inferiora: ipse namque redit statim.	And let another minister hold the head of the sick person, so that he may not be moved towards what is below: he himself returns at once.
Et si uis, reduc eum secundum modum hunc: et est, ut facias esse praesentem uirum qui sit longior infirmo, et stet a parte lateris, et intromittat humerum suum sub titillico infirmi: et eleuet titillicum eius ad superiora, donec sit infirmus suspensus in aere.	And if you wish, reduce him according to this mode: and it is, that you make the present man who is longer than the sick person, stand at the side, and insert his shoulder under the headrest of the sick person: and lift up the headrest of him towards the upper parts, until the sick person is suspended in the air.
Et minister alius trahat manum infirmi ad inferiora uentris eius.	And let another minister draw the hand of the sick person down to his lower belly.
Si autem infirmus est leuis: tunc oportet, ut suspendatur cum eo aliquid aliud, ut grauet ipsum: nam redit dislocatio statim.	But if the sick person is light: then it is necessary that something else be suspended with him, so as to weight him down: for dislocation returns at once.
Et reducitur etiam secundum modum alium: et est, ut figatur in terra lignum longum, cuius caput sit rotundum figura: sicut manica mortarii: quod non sit grossum, neque subtile.	And he is also reduced according to another mode: and it is, that a piece of wood be placed on the ground, which has a rounded head like the handle of a mortar: not thick nor too thin.
Deinde ponatur sub infirmo postquam ponuntur super caput ligni panni lenes: et infirmus sit stans secundum longitudinem ligni.	Then a soft cloth should be placed under the sick person after they are placed on top of the head of the wood: and the sick person should stand according to the length of the wood.
Deinde extendatur manus eius ad inferiora a parte altera, et extendatur corpus eius ab altera parte cum fortitudine: nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then his hand should be stretched out towards the lower part on one side, and his body extended from the other side with strength: for the joint returns to its place quickly.
Quod si difficilis sit eius reductio per omnia quae diximus, tunc utere hac cura: et est, ut accipias lignum cuius longitudo sit quantitas duorum brachiorum, et eius latitudo quantitas quatuor digitorum, et grossitudo eius quantitas duorum digitorum: cui sit caput rotundum, ut alleuietur introitus eius in profundum titillici, secundum hanc formam.	But if his reduction is difficult through all that we have said, then use this cure: and it is, that you take a piece of wood whose length is the quantity of two arms, and its width the quantity of four fingers, and its thickness the quantity of two fingers: which has a rounded head, so that it may be eased into the depth of the headrest, according to this form.
Deinde ligentur super caput rotundum panni lenes, ut non laedat lignum infirmum.	Then soft cloths should be wrapped over the rounded head, so that they may not hurt the sick person.
Deinde ponatur sub titillico infirmi, ut extendatur manus, aut brachium super lignum usque ad inferiora: et ligetur lignum super adiutorium et brachium et extremitatem manus.	Then it should be placed under the headrest of the sick person, so that his hand or arm may be stretched out over the wood up to the lower part: and the wood should be tied above the assistant and arm and end of the hand.
Deinde ponatur brachium super gradum scalae per latitudinem, et extendatur manus ad inferiora, et dimittatur reliquum corpus suspensum a parte altera.	Then place the arm above the step of the ladder across its width, and stretch out the hand to the lower parts, and let the rest of the body hang suspended from the other side.
Iunctura enim ingreditur statim.	The joint enters immediately.
Cum ergo completur introitus eius secundum quemcunque modum possibile est: tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico spheram aequalis quantitatis ex lana.	For when its opening is completed in any way that is possible: then you should place under the titillator a ball of equal size made of wool.
Deinde pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum olibano, et albumine oui super humerum totum, sicut reuoluitur desuper.	Then place the prepared poultice made from mill dust with aloes, and white of egg on the shoulder all over, as it turns over above.
Deinde stringe sub titillico strictura decenti: et reuoluatur ligamentum super emplastrum desuper: et annectatur manus eius ad collum ipsius, et dimittatur, neque moueatur manus eius septem diebus.	Then tie a bandage under the titillator in a suitable binding: and let the ligament be turned over above the poultice: and let his hand be joined to his neck, and let it be left still for seven days.
Et oportet, ut ponatur cibus infirmipaucus, donec confortetur membrum: quoniam est uelocius ad sanationem eius.	And it is necessary that a light diet be placed before him, until the limb is comforted: since it is more conducive to its healing.
Deinde ponatur amplior post septem dies, aut quinque, et ex ercitetur cum motu.	Then a larger one should be placed after seven days, or five, and exercise should be done with movement.
Si ergo firmatur et non mollificatur, tunc iam sanatus est.	If it is strengthened and not weakened, then he is already healed.
Si uero iunctura dislocatur multotiens, propter humiditatem quae accidit ei, aut propter caussam aliam: tunc oportet, ut administretur in ea cauterium cum tribus foraminibus, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo de cauterio.	But if the joint is dislocated many times due to humidity that occurs to it, or due to another cause: then it is necessary that a cautery be administered in it with three holes, according to what was previously stated in the chapter on cauterization.
Quod si fiat hoc totum, et soluatur ligamentum post septem dies, et non confirmetur iunctura, et reducatur emplastrum et strictura super ipsum aliquotiens, et non firmetur, et cadat, et non possit eleuare ipsum ad superiora: tunc scias, quod nerui eius qui sunt ad caput humeri, iam incisi sunt, aut extensi, aut mollificati: et scias, quod iunctura nunquam figetur in loco suo.	And if this is done entirely, and the ligament breaks after seven days, and the joint does not confirm itself, and the poultice and bandage are reapplied over it several times, and still it does not firm up, and falls, and cannot be lifted to the higher parts: then you will know that the nerves of the head of the humerus have already been cut, stretched, or weakened: and you will know that the joint will never settle in its place.
Dislocationis autem quae fit uersus pectus et mammillam, aut ad posteriora reductio, fit cum impulsione et extensione cum manibus: donec redeat, et administretur in ea reliqua strictura et cura, donec sanetur.	However, the dislocation that occurs towards the chest and nipple, or reduction to the back, is caused by a blow and stretching with the hands: until it returns, and further binding and care are administered in it, until it is healed.
Quod si accidat post sanationem grauitas in membro, et tarditas in motu eius, tunc utatur infirmus balneo multotiens, donec leniatur illa grauitas, et redeat ad naturam eius primam.	If a heaviness occurs after healing in a limb and there is sluggishness in its movement, then the patient should use a bath many times until that heaviness is alleviated and returns to its natural state.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Cubiti.	On the Treatment of Dislocation of the Elbow.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter 28.
Scias, quod iunctura Cubiti dislocatur cum difficultate, et similiter redit cum difficultate etiam: et ipsa quidem dislocatur ad omnes partes, et praecipue ad anteriorem, aut ad posteriorem.	You should know that the joint of the elbow is dislocated with difficulty, and similarly it returns to its place with difficulty as well; and indeed it is dislocated towards all parts, and especially towards the anterior or posterior.
Et eius dislocatio non occultatur tibi: quoniam est cadens sub uisu, et sub tactu, secundum quamcunque figuram dislocetur.	And its dislocation is not hidden from you; because it falls under the sight and under the touch, according to whatever shape it becomes dislocated.
Et quando coniungis cubitum dislocatum cum sano, declaratur tibi illud manifeste.	And when you join a dislocated elbow with a healthy one, it is revealed to you clearly.
Concauatur enim iunctura, et non potest duplicare brachium, neque tangere cum eo humerum suum.	For the joint becomes hollowed out, and it cannot double the arm, nor can it touch its own shoulder with it.
Et oportet, ut properes, et reducas dislocationem statim, antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And it is necessary that you hasten and reduce the dislocation immediately, before a hot swelling occurs.
Nam si accidit ei apostema calidum, difficilis fit eius reductio: et fortasse non sanatur omnino, praecipue quando est ad posteriora.	For if a hot swelling occurs, the reduction becomes difficult and perhaps it will not be healed at all, especially when it is towards the back.
Est enim deterior omnibus speciebus dislocationis, et uehementioris doloris eis: et multotiens descendit cum ea mors.	For indeed it is worse in all types of dislocations and more severe pain follows; and often death descends with it.
Et restauratio eius quando est ex eis quae possibile est reducere, est, ut extendatur manus eius cum duabus manibus: et brachium eius sit expansum, et manus medici sint supra cubitum et sub eo, et ipse impellat iuncturam cum pollicibus manuum suarum simul, aut cum radice palmae suae, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And the restoration of it when it is possible to reduce it is, that his hand be stretched out with two hands: and his arm be expanded, and the doctor's hands be above the elbow and below it, and he push the joint with the fingertips of his own hands or with the root of his palm, until it returns to its place.
Aut uero dislocatio est ad anteriora: tunc redit ita, ut duplicet manum cum manu sua, donec percutiat cum radice palmae suae cubitum qui est dislocatus.	Or indeed the dislocation is towards the front: then it returns in such a way that he doubles his hand with his own hand, until he strikes the elbow which is dislocated with the root of his palm.
Quod si non obedit dislocatio ad reductionem, tunc administra extensionem uehementem, fortem ualde: et est, ut extendant brachium duo ministri: et teneant ipsum duo ministri etiam, ut non remoueatur apud extensionem.	What if the dislocation does not submit to reduction, then administer a strong and fierce stretching: and it is, that two assistants stretch out the arm: and they also hold him so that he is not moved during the stretching.
Deinde reuoluatur brachium ad omnem partem postquam inuoluitur super manum eius pannus duplicatus longus, aut ligamentum latum.	Then let the arm be turned around to every part after it has been wrapped around his hand with a doubled and long cloth or a broad bandage.
Et quando tangit medicus manu sua iuncturam, inungat ipsam cum oleo: ut sit illud ex eis quae adiuuant in lubricitate iuncturae cum facilitate.	And when the doctor touches the joint with his own hand, let him anoint it with oil, so that it may be one of those things which assists and facilitates the smoothness of the joint.
Deinde impellat iuncturam impulsione uehementi, donec redeat.	Then let him strike the joint with a strong push until it returns.
Et post reductionem eius oportet, ut ponatur super ipsam emplastrum, in quo sit stipticitas, et exiccatio cum albugine oui: et stringatur strictura decenti.	And after the reduction of it, let a poultice be placed on top of it, having a quality of cooling and drying with a white ointment; and let it be bound tightly with a bandage that is fitting.
Et suspendatur brachium a collo infirmi: et dimitte diebus aliquot.	And let the arm be suspended from the patient's neck, and let him rest for several days.
Deinde soluatur.	Then it will loosen.
Si ergo firmatur iunctura in loco suo, tunc solue ligamentum ab ea, et dimitte ipsam.	If then the joint is set in its place, then untie the bandage from it and let it go.
Et si uides iuncturam non bene stringi, tunc itera emplastrum, et ligamentum, et dimitte ipsam diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	And if you see the joint not being tightly bound, then repeat the poultice and bandage, and let it rest for several days, until it is bound tightly.
Deinde solue ipsam.	Then release it.
Si autem accidit ei grauitas post reductionem iuncturae, et dispositio sit in motu: tunc administra humectationem in balneatione, et fricationem subtilem, et compressionem, donec liniatur, aut pone super iuncturam iliati, id est, natem arietis pinguem.	But if heaviness occurs after the reduction of the joint, and the setting is in motion: then administer moistening in bathing, and gentle friction, and compression, until it becomes smooth; or place on top of the joint a poultice, that is, a fat lamb's waxy coat.
Deinde ligetur, et dimitte ipsam super eam die et nocte.	Then let it be bound, and let it rest over it day and night.
Deinde aufer eam, et intromitte ipsum in balneum.	Then take it away, and introduce him into a bath.
Cum ergo sudat, tunc frica iuncturam fricatione temperata.	When he sweats, then rub the joint with moderate friction.
Deinde itera super ipsam aleliati uice una, et secunda, et tertia cum introitu balnei, donec leniatur.	Then apply to it a poultice of almond milk, once, and twice, and thrice, with the entrance into the bath, until it becomes gentle.
Et si uis, pone super ipsam stercus uaccinum, humidum, calefactum cum butyro, et stringe super ipsum.	And if you wish, place on top of it a warm cow's dung, moistened with butter, and bind over it.
Fac illud aliquotiens.	Do that thing some times.
Ipsa namque lenitur, et redit ad dispositionem suam.	It is indeed healed and returns to its natural state.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.	On the treatment of Almahassem's dislocation.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter Twenty-Nine.
Mahassem manus multotiens dislocatur, id est, iunctura quae est inter brachium et manum.	Mahassem's hand is often dislocated, that is, the joint which is between the arm and the hand.
Et reductio dislocationis eius est facilis.	And its reduction is easy.
Econtrario reliquarum iuncturarum.	On the contrary to the other joints.
Verumtamen oportet, ut uelocitas sit in reductione dislocationis eius in hora in qua dislocatur, antequam apostemetur locus: aut accidat in eo apostema calidum.	However, it is necessary that the speed of reducing the dislocation be in the hour when it occurs, before the place becomes inflamed; or a hot abscess forms.
Et reductio dislocationis in eo est, ut ponas Mahassem manus infirmae super tabulam, et extendat minister manum eius: et ponat medicus palmam suam super eminentiam iuncturae, et impellat eam, donec redeat.	And the reduction of the dislocation in him is, that you place Mahassem's weak hand on a table, and let the minister stretch it out; and let the doctor put his palm on the prominence of the joint, and push it until it returns.
Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manus, tunc sit positio manus eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manus eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manus medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.	However, it is necessary to consider whether the palm has already retreated into the hollow of the hand; then let the weak one place the back of his hand on the table for extension and reduction: and if the dislocation is proceeding towards the back of the hand, then the position of his hand should be inwardly on the table, that is, the inner part of his hand should be placed on the table, so that the doctor's hand falls over the prominence of the joint.
Si ergo redit statim, bonum est: et si non, tunc stringe eam cum emplastro sedante apostema: et dimitte ipsum, neque iteres illud.	If it returns immediately, that is good; and if not, then bind it with a soothing plaster on the abscess: and let him go, nor repeat that.
Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manus, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi, aut attriti.	For if it does not tolerate, nor can you proceed with its reduction after the days have passed, yet the joint remains according to its own curvature; and it does not harm the patient anything, except that the hand becomes soft and cannot grasp anything: then you will know that the nerves are cut or worn out.
Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.	Therefore there is no strength in it, except to be bound with a cautery near its fall.
Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.	And perhaps it does not matter that thing.
Cum ergo non redit Almahassem, tunc pone super ipsum emplastrum, quod narrauimus.	When therefore Almahassem does not heal, then place a poultice upon him, as we have described.
Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitetur manus.	Then it should be bound and left for five days: afterwards it will be loosened and left, and the hand should be exercised.
Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidat in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.	But if it is deprived of movement and some weight occurs within it: then soften it with warm water and friction a few times, until it is softened.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Digitorum.	Of the cure for dislocation of fingers.
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.
Quando dislocatur ex eis Digitus ad omnem partem, uel ex eis Digitus ad dorsum palmae, aut uentrem eius: tunc extende Digitum, et impelle dislocationem pollicibus tuis, donec redeat.	When a finger is dislocated from them in any direction, or a finger to the back of the palm, or into its hollow: then extend the finger and push the dislocation with your thumbs until it returns.
Deinde sustenta caput Digiti, et suspende ipsum uersus partem ad quam dislocatur, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	Then support the head of the finger and hang it towards the side to which it is dislocated, and leave it for two days.
Deinde suspende eum, et extende ipsum, donec aequetur rectus in illo die suo.	Then hang him and stretch him until he becomes straight on that day itself.
Cum ergo fuerit nox, liga ipsum secundum narrationem ipsam: et non cesses soluere ipsum in die: et exerce eum cum motu: et liga ipsum in nocte.	When it is night, bind him according to the same narrative: and do not cease to release him by day: and exercise him with movement: and bind him at night.
Fac illud diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	Do that for several days until it is bound.
Et similiter fac cum eo, si dislocatur ad uentrem manus: et liga eum ad partem ipsam, et fac cum eo operationem tuam primam, donec sanetur.	And similarly do the same with him if it is dislocated to the palm of the hand: and bind him to that part, and perform your first operation on him until he is healed.
Et similiter fac cum eo quando dislocatur ad reliquas partes.	And similarly do the same with him when it is dislocated to other parts.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Spondilium dorsi.	Of the cure for dislocation of the spine.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 31.
Quando accidit alicui Spondilium dorsi, aut colli dislocatio completa, aut remouentur Spondiles multae a locis suis: tunc non est in ea curatio, quoniam mors properat infirmo.	When someone suffers from the complete dislocation of the spine or neck, or when many vertebrae are moved from their places: then there is no cure for it, since death approaches the sick person.
Et signum illius est, quod egestio infirmi egreditur absque uoluntate, neque potest tenere eam: et multotiens mollificantur ex eo quaedam membra eius, aut duo crura eius, aut duo brachia ipsius, aut unum eorum: aut remouetur Spondilis una de loco suo.	And the sign of this is that the sick person's waste exits without his will, nor can he hold it; and many times certain members of his body become soft, or one leg, or two arms, or one arm: or a vertebra is moved from its place.
Multotiens enim remouetur, quod multotiens fit remotio earum ad quatuor partes.	Many times indeed is removed what many times is removed to four parts.
Illa ergo quae remouetur ad posteriora, nominatur Gibbositas.	Therefore, that which is removed to the rear is called Gibbositis.
Curatio uero eius est, ut consyderes tunc, si Gibbositas accidit a puericia: tunc non est in ea curatio, neque ex ea est sanatio omnino.	The cure for it is that you should consider this, if Gibbositis occurs from childhood: then there is no cure for it, nor is there any recovery from it.
In illa autem quae accidit a casu, aut percussione, aut similibus illis, iam dixerunt antiqui modos curationis sermone prolixo.	But in that which occurs by chance or striking or similar things, the ancient modes of treatment have already been spoken of at length.
Cuius plurimum non redit cum proficuo.	Of which the greatest part does not return with a good outcome.
Ego uero iam abbreuiaui ex illo, cuius parum excusat a multo eius ex propinquitate mea ad intentionem: et expositione mea qua exposui illud, et formaui instrumentum eius diuerso modo ab eo quo ostenderunt illud, et exposuerunt ipsum.	But I have already shortened it from what was said, which is a little excused by the proximity of mine to the intention: and my explanation which I explained that thing, and fashioned its instrument in a different way than they showed it, and exposed it.
Dico ergo, quod in gibbositate quae accidit ab anteriori parte, non est ingenium, neque sanatio ex ea.	I say therefore, that in Gibbositis which occurs from the front part, there is no remedy, nor recovery from it.
Et similiter in illa quae fit ad duo latera etiam.	And similarly in that which occurs on both sides as well.
Et non curatur ex eis, nisi illa quae accidit in dorso proprie, cum eo quod ego narro: et est, ut extendatur infirmus super faciem suam super podium aequale prope parietem: et expandatur sub eo stramentum humidum, ut non laedatur pectus eius.	And it is not cured from them, unless that which occurs on the back properly, as I narrate: and this is, to have the weak person lie over his face on a level platform near the wall; and to spread out beneath him a moist covering, so that he may not be hurt in the chest.
Deinde ponatur lignum rectum fixum in fouea in terra, in extremitate podii, circiter caput eius: et lignum aliud circiter pedes eius in extremitate altera podii: et minister teneat lignum, et sit non firmatum in fouea.	Then a straight piece of wood shall be placed and fixed in the frame on the ground, at the end of the platform, near his head: and another piece of wood around his feet at the other end of the platform; and the servant shall hold the wood and stand not firm in the frame.
Et minister alter teneat alterum.	And let the other servant hold the other one.
Deinde inuolue super caput infirmi, et sub titillicis eius ligamentum lene, firmum: et extende extremitatem ligamenti ad lignum quod est apud caput eius: et liga ipsum in eo.	Then wrap it over the head of the weak person, and beneath his temples a soft, sturdy bandage; and extend the end of the bandage to the wood that is at his head; and tie it to it.
Deinde stringe ligamentum aliud supra anchas eius, et supra genua ipsius, et apud cauillas eius.	Then bind the other bandage above his ankles, and above his knees, and at his calves.
Deinde aggrega ligamenta omnia, et liga ea in ligno altero quod est apud pedes eius.	Then gather all the ligaments and tie them to another piece of wood that is by his feet.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem ligni ligamentum, et non remoueantur duo ligna ex locis suis in quibus sunt fixa: uerumtamen non sint firmata, sicut diximus.	Then let every assistant stretch out the ligament to the piece of wood, and let the two woods not be removed from their places where they are fixed: yet let them not be fastened as we said.
Et medicus ponat palmas suas super Spondilem cum fortitudine, donec redeat: aut ponat super eam tabulam.	And the doctor should place his hands on the spondilus with strength until he returns: or place them on it a table.
Deinde annectat super tabulam pedes suos, donec redeat.	Then attach his feet to the table until he returns.
Si autem non redit per hanc curationem, tunc accipe tabulam cuius longitudo sit circiter tria brachia.	But if he does not return through this treatment, then take a board whose length is about three arms.
Et caua in pariete de quo diximus quod est prope infirmum, locum in quem ingrediatur extremitas tabulae.	And make an opening in the wall of which we spoke, which is near the patient, to the place where the end of the board will enter.
Deinde pone medium tabulae super Spondilem.	Then place the middle of the board on the spondilus.
Et ponat pedes suos medicus super extremitatem alteram.	And let the doctor put his feet on the other extremity.
Et stringat bene, donec coartetur Spondilis, et redeat ad locum suum.	And let him tie it well until the spondilus is compressed and he returns to his place.
Deinde si uis, operare cum torno quod inuoluitur cum manu tua: et est, ut figas in terram apud caput infirmi in postremo podii duo ligna, quorum longitudo sit brachii unius: et apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.	Then if you wish, operate with the lathe that is wrapped around your hand; and it is, to fix two pieces of wood at the head of the patient on the last step, each being one arm's length: and at his head on the last step two pieces of wood.
Et sit longitudo quae est inter omne lignum palmus unus: et iam factum est in omni loco foramen, in quo currit tornum: et firmetur lignum omne in terra multum, ne moueatur omnino.	And let the length that is between all the wood be one palm; and already a hole has been made in every place where the lathe runs: and let all the wood be firmly fixed in the earth very much, so that it may not move at all.
Et intromittatur lignum rotundum: et est tornum in quo reuoluitur ligamentum in duobus foraminibus duorum lignorum.	And let a round piece of wood be inserted; and the lathe is where the ligament is twisted around two holes of two pieces of wood.
Et in extremitate eius est foramen, in quo firmatur lignum, cuius longitudo est palmus cum eo quod reuoluitur: et in duobus lignis aliis est similiter illius.	And at its end is a hole where the wood is fixed, whose length is one palm along with what is twisted; and similarly on two other pieces of wood.
Deinde stringe ligamenta quae strinxisti in pectore infirmi torno quod est apud caput eius: et ligamenta quae strinxisti in cruribus eius in torno quod est apud pedes eius.	Then tie the bandages which you have tightened on the patient's chest at the point that is near his head: and tie the bandages which you have tightened on his legs at the point that is near his feet.
Deinde stet apud omne tornum minister, qui torqueat manum suam cum licinio, cum quo reuoluitur tornum: et medicus aequet Spondilem, secundum quod diximus.	Then stand beside every turning post attendant, who twists his hand with the lever, by which the turning post is turned: and the doctor adjusts the Spondyle, as we have said.
Haec est forma torni, quae sequitur.	This is the form of the turning post that follows.
Deinde postquam redit Spondilis, et aequatur locus, tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum exiccatiuum cum albumine oui.	Then, after the Spondyle returns and the place is adjusted, it is necessary that you put on a drying plaster with egg white.
Deinde stuppam.	Then bandages.
Postea pone supra emplastrum astellam ex tabula, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, aut circiter eos.	Afterward, place a plate from the tablet above the plaster, whose width is three fingers or thereabouts.
Et longitudo eius quantitas quae capiat locum Gibbositatis, et super partem Spondilis sanae.	And its length should be as long as to cover the place of gibbosity and above the sound part of the Spondyle.
Deinde ligetur cum ligamento quod diximus.	Then it is tied with the bandage which we mentioned.
Et utatur infirmus nutrimento subtili, donec sanetur.	And the patient should be nourished with subtle food until he is healed.
Quod si remaneat quiddam eminentiae in loco in fine sanationis: tunc oportet, ut administrentur medicinae quae mollificant, et leniunt, cum administratione tabulae quam narrauimus tempore longo.	But if something remains of elevation in the place at the end of healing: then it is necessary that gentle medicines be administered and used, along with the application of the plate which we described for a long time.
Et iam administratur in illo lamina plumbi.	And now a lead plate is applied to it.
Et quandoque accidit eminentia in postremo Spondilium dorsi: et putatur per eam dislocatio, et est illud os quod iam eminet.	And sometimes it happens that there is elevation at the last vertebra of the back, and it is thought to be a dislocation through it, and that bone which now protrudes.
Quare non oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei cum hac medicina: fortasse enim accidere faciet mortem.	Therefore it is not necessary to make an assumption about him with this medicine: perhaps it may bring about death instead.
¶ De curatione Anchae dislocatae.	¶ On the cure of a dislocated rib.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter 32.
Scias, quod iuncturae Anchae, et iuncturae humeri, non accidit, nisi dislocatio tantum: neque accidit eis quod accidit reliquis iuncturis ex remotione parua, et concauitate.	Know that the joints of the ribs and the shoulder blades do not occur unless there is a dislocation only; nor does it happen to them what happens to other joints due to slight removal and concavity.
Et iunctura quidem Anchae dislocatur secundum quatuor partes.	And indeed, the joint of the ankle is dislocated according to four parts.
Quod est, quia dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	Which is because it becomes dislocated in front and behind.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur ad interiora: et parum dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	And indeed, it dislocates mostly towards the inside; and a little towards the front and back.
Et curatio dislocationis eius ad interiora, est: quia quando tu coniungis crus infirmi sanum cum infirmo, est longius: et est genu eius eminens plus quam sani, et non potest infirmus duplicare pedem suum apud inguen: et est locus qui sequitur inguen apostematus apostemate calido, propterea, quod caput coxae iam peruenit illic.	And the cure of this dislocation towards the inside is because when you join the weak leg to a healthy one, it is longer; and his knee is more prominent than that of the healthy person, and the infirm cannot double his foot at the groin: and there is an inflamed swelling following the groin due to a warm aposteme, since the head of the femur has already reached there.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad exteriora est, quod sunt accidentia eius contraria istis accidentibus.	And the sign of it for whom the dislocation occurs towards the outside is that they experience events contrary to these events.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad anteriora, est, quia expandit crus sanum secundum complementum: uerumtamen non duplicat ipsum absque dolore qui est in genu: et si conatur ad ambulandum, non potest super illud ad anteriora: et retinetur urina eius, et apostematur inguen eius, et apud ambulationem est calcatio eius super calcaneum.	And the sign of it for whom the dislocation occurs towards the front is that his healthy leg expands according to its complement; yet he does not double it without pain in the knee: and if he tries to walk, he cannot step over it to the front: and his urine is retained, and his groin becomes inflamed, and during walking there is a pressure on his heel.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad posteriora est, ut non expandat genu, neque possit duplicare ipsum antequam duplicet inguen: et est crus eius etiam breuius altero: et inguen est mollificatum, et est caput coxae apud locum ilii.	And the sign of it for whom the dislocation occurs towards the back is that he does not expand his knee nor can double it before doubling his groin: and his leg is also shorter on one side; and his groin is relaxed, and there is the head of the femur in that place.
Reductio uero huius dislocationis specierum est, ut consyderes tunc, si dislocatio est uetusta, quae iam antiquatur cum habente ipsam.	The reduction of this kind of dislocation is when you consider then, if the dislocation is old and has already become worn out with the one who has it.
Deinde si tu administres reductionem eius, et remanet secundum dispositionem suam: tunc non est in ea curatio omnino.	Then if you administer its reduction and it remains according to its disposition; then there is no cure at all.
Non ergo oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei penitus.	Therefore it is not necessary that a presumption be made for him entirely.
In illo autem cuius dislocatio est recens, et est ex una specierum quatuor dislocationis: tunc propera ad hoc, ut uoluas iuncturam, et extendas ipsam ad interiora et ad exteriora, et moueas eam dextra et sinistra: fortasse enim redit, et non indiget alia cura.	However, in the one whose dislocation is recent and belongs to one of the four kinds of dislocations: then hasten to do this, that you will bind it together and extend it towards the inside and outside, and move it right and left: perhaps it will return, and he will not need another cure.
Si autem non redit hoc modo, tunc oportet, ut praepares ministrum fortem, et extendat crus eius ab inferiori parte: aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento, quod ligetur super crus eius supra genu: et minister alius extendat manum eius desuper, ita ut intromittat manus suas sub titillicis eius.	If however it does not return in this way, then it is necessary to prepare a strong servant, and have him stretch his leg from the lower part; either with his hands or with a strap that will be tied above his knee on his leg: and another servant should stretch his hand over it, so that he inserts his hand under the pubic bones of his.
Deinde stringat cum ligamento leni super radicem coxae, et teneat extremitatem ligamenti alterius.	Then let him tie with a strap smoothly above the root of the hip joint, and hold the end of the other strap.
Et sit extensio eius aut ab anteriori parte inguinis ad partem furculae, aut a posteriori ad partem dorsi.	And let his extension be either from the anterior part of the groin to the forked part, or from the posterior part to the back part.
Et sit extensio eorum omnium uice una, donec eleuetur infirmus cum corpore suo a terra, et remaneat pendens.	And let all their extensions be one by one, until the patient is lifted up with his body from the ground and remains hanging.
Et haec enim species extensionis est species communis specierum quatuor.	And this kind of extension is a common form of four kinds.
Si ergo redit dislocatio cum eo quod diximus, est bonum: et si non, tunc necesse est omni speciei illud quod dicam de curatione propria.	So if the dislocation returns with what we said, it is good; and if not, then it is necessary to use the proper remedy that I will say.
In reductione quidem eius propria quando dislocatio est ad interiora, oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super latus suum sanum.	Indeed in the reduction of his own proper method when the dislocation is to the inside, it is necessary that the patient be rolled onto his healthy side.
Deinde ponat ligamentum super radicem coxae, in eo quod est inter caput coxae, et locum qui est sub inguine.	Then let him place a strap above the hip joint, in the part that is between the head of the hip and the area below the groin.
Deinde extende ligamentum ad sursum a parte inguinis ad altiorem partem corporis, ad partem furculae.	Then let him stretch the strap upwards from the part of the groin to the higher part of the body, to the forked part.
Deinde accipiat minister alius fortis brachia eius, et minuat locum grossum coxae infirmae, et extendat ad exteriora extensione uehementi.	Then let another strong servant take hold of his arms and reduce the large area of the weak hip joint, and stretch it outwards with a violent extension.
Iam enim redit ad locum suum.	Now indeed he returns to his place.
Et haec species est facilioris reliquis speciebus curationis, qua reducitur hoc membrum.	And this kind is easier than the other kinds of cure by which this member is reduced.
Si autem excusatur super te, et non obedit tibi ad introitum cum hac specie curationis omnino: tunc oportet, ut ligentur duo pedes infirmi simul cum ligamento forti, leni, super duos calcaneos, et super duo genua: et sit longitudo cuiusque a compare suo quantitatis quatuor digitorum: et sit crus infirmum extensum plus altero quantitate duorum digitorum.	But if it does not obey you and is not brought in with this kind of cure entirely: then it is necessary to bind the two legs of the patient simultaneously with a strong, smooth strap over both heels and both knees: and let each be extended more than the other by a quantity of two fingers.
Deinde suspendatur infirmus super caput ligni, quod sit in domo: et sit longitudo eius a terra quantitas duorum brachiorum.	Then the patient is suspended over the wooden head, which should be in the house; and its length from the ground should be equal to the span of two arms.
Deinde praecipe iuueni forti, ut muniat caput coxae: et suspendatur cum infirmo inuenis alius: et impellat iuuenis alius, muniens coxam cum fortitudine, nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then instruct a strong youth to support the patient's head with his hips; and another youth should suspend himself along with the patient; and the other youth should push with all his strength, supporting the hip, for the junction will return to its place quickly.
In reditione autem eius propria, quando est dislocatio ad exteriora, oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super podium, secundum quod narrauimus in habente gibbositatem.	However, when the dislocation is to the outside, it is necessary that the patient lies on a platform, as we have described in the case of having a hump.
Et stringatur ligamentum super crus eius, infirmum proprie, et super pectus eius.	And let the ligament be stretched over his leg, properly his own, and over his chest.
Deinde ponantur duo ligna, unum apud pedes eius, et alterum apud caput ipsius.	Then two wooden boards are placed, one at his feet, and the other at his head.
Deinde ponatur lignum additum in medio podii, fixum bene: super quod inuoluti sint panni humidi, ut non laedat infirmum: et sit lignum inter coxas eius, ut non attrahatur ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then a wooden board is placed in the middle of the platform, fixed well: over which wet cloths are wrapped so as not to hurt the patient; and let the board be between his hips, so that he is not drawn down towards the lower parts during extension.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem suam, et medicus aequet reductionem manu sua.	Then every attendant should stretch out to their own side, and the doctor should equalize the reduction with his own hand.
Si ergo obedit ad reuersionem, erit bonum.	If it then obeys the reversal, it will be good.
Et si non, pone super ipsam tabulam, et preme ipsam, sicut diximus in gibbositate, aequaliter.	And if not, place on top of it and press it down, as we said in the case of a hump, evenly.
Verumtamen oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	However, it is necessary for the patient to lie on his healthy side.
Et quando dislocatio est ad anteriora, tunc oportet, ut extendatur crus infirmi uelociter: et est secundum hanc eandem narrationem super podium: et ponat medicus palmam manus suae dextrae super inguen infirmum.	And when the dislocation is to the front, then it is necessary for the patient's leg to be extended quickly; and this should be done according to the same account on a platform: and the doctor should place his right hand palm downward on the patient's thigh.
Deinde coartet ipsum cum manu altera, et cum illa coartatione pone ipsum extensum ad inferiora ad partem genu.	Then he should compress him with one hand and with that compression place him extended downward to the lower part of the knee.
Et si dislocatio est ad posteriora: tunc non oportet, ut extendatur infirmus ad inferiora, et sit eleuatus super terram: imo oportet, ut sit positus super rem duram, sicut oportet, ut fit etiam si dislocatur ancha eius ad exteriora, secundum illud quod diximus de accubitu eius super duas anchas: et est super faciem eius, et ligamenta extensa: secundum quod diximus nuper.	And if the dislocation is to the back: then it is not necessary for the patient to be extended downward, and he should be lifted up off the ground: rather, he should be placed on a hard surface, as is also fitting if his ankle dislocates outside, according to what we said about his lying on two boards: and it is over his face, with the ligaments stretched; just as we have recently said.
Et oportet, ut administretur compressio cum tabula etiam super locum ad quem egreditur iunctura, cum completur reductio secundum quod oportet.	And it is necessary that compression be applied with a board also over the place from which the joint protrudes, when reduction is completed as needed.
Et signum reditionis eius non occultatur tibi: et est, ut extendas duo crura infirmi: et quando uides ea aequalia, et infirmus stringit crus suum, et expandit ipsum absque excusatione: tunc scias, quia iam redit membrum, secundum quod oportet: tunc coniunge duas coxas, et pone emplastrum, et stringe cum imemati, id est, rota: ita, ut non moueatur ancha ad aliquam partium: et adhaereat infirmus quieti tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	And the sign of its return is not hidden from you: and it is, that you extend the two legs of the weak one; and when you see them equal, and the weak one tightens his leg and expands it without straining: then you know that already the member returns as needed: then join the two hips, and place a poultice, and bind with a mat, namely, a bandage: so that the swelling does not move to any part; and the weak one should remain quiet for three days or four.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et emplastrum, et compara crus cum altero: tunc si uides ea aequalia in statu, tunc scias, quod dislocatio iam firmata est: absolue ergo infirmum ad ambulandum.	Then release the bandage and poultice, and compare the leg with the other; then if you see them equal in condition, then you know that the dislocation has been set right; therefore, free the weak one to walk.
Et si uides aliquid mollificationis: tunc redi, et emplastra illud, et stringe illud secundum stricturam tuam primam: et dimitte illud etiam tribus diebus.	And if you see something relaxed; then go back and apply a poultice to it, and bind it according to your initial binding; and leave it also for three days.
Deinde solue illud et fac ipsum tardare in ambulatione super utrumque aliquot diebus, donec confortetur bene.	Then release it and make it lag behind in walking on both sides for a few days, until it is well strengthened.
¶ De dislocationis Genu.	Of the Dislocation of the Knee.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33.
Genu dislocatur secundum tres modos.	The knee is dislocated in three ways.
Dislocatur ad exteriora, ad interiora, et ad inferiora, scilicet ad posteriora.	It becomes dislocated outwardly, inwardly, and downwardly, namely, posteriorly.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora.	And it is not dislocated forwardly.
Et signum dislocationis eius, est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut applicet crus suum ad coxam suam.	And the sign of its dislocation is, that you force the weak one to put his leg against his hip.
Si autem non adhaeret cum coxa: tunc scias, quod Genu est dislocatum.	But if it does not stick with the hip: then you will know that the knee is dislocated.
Et restauratio omnium modorum dislocationis eius est, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum, ita ut iam extendat crus suum si potest super illud, et adhaeret dorsum tuum ad faciem eius: et pone pedem eius inter pedes tuos.	And the restoration of all its dislocation modes is, that you make the weak one sit straight, so that he may extend his leg as much as possible over it, and stick his back to your face: and place his foot between your feet.
Deinde adhaerere fac Genu eius cum palmis tuis, et recta eas inter digitos tuos super Genu eius.	Then attach his knee to your palms and straighten them between your fingers over his knee.
Deinde applica cum palma tua duo latera Genu eius cum fortitudine.	Then apply with your palm the two sides of his knee with force.
Et minister alius extendat pedem eius, donec redeat Genu ad locum suum.	And have another person stretch out his foot until it returns to its place.
Et signum reditionis est, ut adhaereat crus cum coxa in lenitate, non laboriose.	And the sign of return is when the leg adheres to the hip in gentleness, not with difficulty.
Deinde emplastra ipsum, et adhaerere fac crus cum coxa.	Then bind him and attach his leg to the hip.
Deinde liga ea simul cum uitta tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then bind them together with a bandage for three days or four.
Deinde solue ea.	Then loosen them.
Et non utatur infirmus ambulatione aliquot diebus, donec sanetur.	And the infirm person should not walk for several days until he is healed.
Si autem recusatur tibi reductio eius, tunc administra extensionem fortem cum ligamentis, quorum praecessit narratio in curatione anchae, donec redeat.	But if it resists you, then apply strong stretching with bandages, as was previously described in the treatment of clubfoot, until it returns.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Calcanei.	About the cure of a Dislocation of the Heelbone.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter 44.
Calcaneus quandoque remouetur remotione parua, et quandoque dislocatur secundum complementum.	The heelbone is sometimes displaced by a small displacement and sometimes dislocated according to its full extent.
Et dislocatio eius fit, aut ad interiora, aut ad exteriora.	And the dislocation occurs either towards the inside or towards the outside.
Et signum dislocationis eius est, quod uides Calcaneum inflatum, procedentem ad partem ad quam dislocatur.	And the sign of its dislocation is that you see the heelbone inflated, proceeding to the side to which it is dislocated.
Curatio autem remotionis eius, est facilis reditionis: et est, ut extendatur cum facilitate cum manibus, et aequetur, donec redeat.	And the cure of its reduction is easy and simple: it is to stretch with ease with your hands and align, until it returns.
In curatione autem eius quando dislocatur secundum complementum, oportet, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum: et teneat ipsum minister fortis ualde a posteriori parte dorsi eius, in medio ipsius.	And in its cure when it is dislocated according to its full extent, it is necessary that you make the infirm person sit straight and have a strong attendant hold him from behind at his back.
Deinde tene tu cum manu tua dextra pedem eius a superiori parte eius, et cum manu tua sinistra ab inferiori parte pedis eius loco cauillae.	Then take hold of his foot with your right hand from the upper part and with your left hand from the lower part of his foot, as if grasping a strap.
Deinde trahe pedem ad tecum manu tua dextra.	Then pull his foot towards you with your right hand.
Deinde cum sinistra duabus uicibus.	Then with your left hand on both sides.
Deinde extende cum sinistra, et impelle pectus pedis cum dextra uersus crus absque labore.	Then stretch with your left and push the shin of the foot with your right towards the knee without effort.
Fac illud bis, sicut narrauimus.	Do that twice, as we have told you.
Deinde impelle pectus pedis ad crus in uice tertia, et tu trahis cauillam.	Then push the shin of the foot towards the knee in the third position, and you pull out the hair.
Si ergo redit in uice una, aut in duabus secundum hunc modum, et uides pedem aequatum, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera operationem super ipsum: quoniam ipse redit.	So if it returns to its normal position, or slightly bent, according to this method, and you see the foot is equalized, it is good; and if not, then iterate the operation on it, since it will return.
Si autem prohibetur tibi reductio eius cum eo quod narrauimus: tunc fac iacere infirmum super dorsum suum super terram, et fige paxillum in terra firmatum ualde, ut cadat inter coxas eius: et tu iam inuoluisti super ipsum pannum, ut non laedat infirmum.	But if its reduction is prevented from happening as we have told you, then make the patient lie on his back on the ground and place a small block of wood firmly on the ground between his thighs: and you yourself have wrapped a cloth over him so that he does not hurt.
Deinde accipiat minister coxam eius: postea extendat minister alter pedem, aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento quod liget super collum pedis.	Then the attendant should take hold of his hip: afterwards, the attendant should stretch out the other foot, either with their own hands or with a band that binds over the ankle of the foot.
Deinde extendat omnis minister contra extensionem comparis sui: et paxillus sit stans inter duas coxas infirmi retinens eum, ut non attrahatur corpus eius ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then the attendant should stretch out against the stretching of his own companion: and the block should stand between the two hips of the patient holding him back so that his body is not drawn towards the lower parts during the stretching.
Deinde aequet medicus dislocationem manibus suis, et minister alter teneat crus sanum ad inferiora.	Then the doctor should equalize the dislocation with his own hands and the attendant should hold the healthy leg down towards the lower parts.
Nam dislocatio redit cum uelocitate.	For the dislocation returns quickly.
Quando ergo redit dislocatio, et declaratur tibi sanitas reditionis eius: tunc pone emplastrum et stuppam, et stringe ipsam cum ligamentis firmiter, et liga pedem cum ligamento ad crus.	When then the dislocation returns and is declared to you as a sign of its reduction: then apply a poultice and bandage, and bind it firmly with bands, and tie the foot with a band to the leg.
Et oportet, ut caueas uel timeas de neruis, qui sunt supra calcaneum posterius, ut non sit ligamentum super eos uehemens, et laedat eos.	And it is necessary that you beware or fear the nerves which are above the posterior heel bone, lest the bandage be too tight and harm them.
Deinde dimitte ipsum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then let him go for two days, or three.
Quod si mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum: deinde solue ipsum in die tertio, aut quarto: et prohibe infirmum ab ambulatione quadraginta diebus.	Which if the bandage becomes soft, bind it again: then release him on the third or fourth day: and forbid the patient from walking for forty days.
Si uero conatur ambulare ante illud spacium, non fit securitas quin dissoluatur super ipsum dislocatio, et corrumpatur, et non recipiat post illud curationem.	If indeed he tries to walk before that space, there is no security but that dislocation will be dissolved over him, and it will be corrupted, and he will not receive any cure after that.
Quod si accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc oportet, ut administres in sedatione eius illud, in quo praecessit narratio nostra in alio loco ex curatione, et embrocationem, donec remoueatur.	But if an apostema hot occurs to him: then it is necessary that you administer to him that which our previous narration mentioned elsewhere in the cure, and a poultice, until it is removed.
¶ De dislocatione Digitorum pedis, et cura.	On the Dislocation of Fingers of the Foot and its Cure.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter 35.
Oportet, ut aequetur quod dislocatur ex eis cum extensione pauca absque labore: et illud quidem non est difficile, imo est facile.	It is necessary that what is dislocated from them be reduced with a little extension without labor: and indeed it is not difficult, rather easy.
Si autem dislocatio est in quibusdam nodis dorsi pedis: tunc oportet, ut faciat sedere infirmus pedem suum super locum aequalem terrae, aut super tabulam: et est stans sicut ambulans.	But if the dislocation is in certain knots of the back of the foot: then it is necessary that the patient should sit with his foot placed on a level spot of ground or on a board: and he should stand as though walking.
Deinde tu sta, et pone pedem tuum super illud quod eminet ex illis iuncturis.	Then you stay, and place your foot over that which protrudes from those joints.
Deinde calca illud cum pede tuo cum uirtute, donec redeat, et uideas ipsum iam aequatum, et non appareat in loco eminentia.	Then press that with your foot with force, until it returns, and you will see that it is now straightened out, and does not appear in its former prominence.
Deinde pone sub uentre pedis eius tabulam quae capiat pedem totum, cui sint duo capita.	Then place a board under the sole of his foot which takes up the whole foot, with two ends.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti tribus diebus.	Then bind it tightly with a suitable bandage for three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et fac quiescere eum ab ambulatione diebus multis, donec stringatur et securetur a reductione.	Then loosen it and make him rest from walking for many days, until it is bound and secured by the reduction.
¶ De speciebus dislocationis cum uulnere uel fractura.	On the Kinds of Dislocations with a Wound or Fracture.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter 36.
Quando accidit aliquid ex illo, et conaris curationem eius, et ipsius restaurationem, multotiens succedit mors: et propter illud non oportet, ut praesumat super curationem eius, quod est huiusmodi, nisi qui est prudens in arte longi usus, misericors, pius, tardus, non audax, neque praesumptuosus: et ut utatur in incaeptionce medicinis quae sedant apostemata calida tantum: et dimittat infirmum diuino iudicio.	When something of this kind happens and you attempt to cure it and restore the patient, death often ensues many times: and for that reason one should not presume over its cure, unless he is skilled in art through long practice, merciful, pious, slow, not rash or presumptuous: and let him use medicines that cool apostemata hot only: and leave the patient to divine judgment.
Nisi uideas, aut speras salutem a perditione cum lenitate aegritudinis, et in quo apparet quiddam spei.	Unless you see, or hope for salvation from destruction with gentle illness, and in which something appears as hope.
Conare ergo reductionem eius statim in principio rei, antequam accidat apostema calidum.	Therefore, bring about the reduction of it immediately at the beginning of the thing, before a hot abscess occurs.
Si ergo redit membrum, secundum quod uolumus, tunc administra regimen quod sedat apostema: et cura uulnus cum eo quod conuenit ei ex unguentis desiccatiuis.	If then the member returns, as we wish it to, then administer a regimen that calms the abscess; and care for the wound with what is suitable for it from drying ointments.
Quod si dislocatio est cum fractura, et accidunt in osse satagiae separatae, tunc conare ablationem earum, et fac in illo quod diximus in aegritudinibus simplicibus ex eo quod praecessit in locis earum.	But if there is a dislocation with a fracture, and the separated splinters occur in bone, then try to remove them, and do what we said for simple illnesses in those places beforehand.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, et custodi teipsum ab introitu in uiam timoris: secundum quod praecessit praedicatio mea tibi.	And beware according to your own virtue, and guard yourself from entering the path of fear: just as my previous prediction has been to you.
Nam illud est melius tibi apud Creatorem tuum, et magis permanens ad gloriam tuam, et magis saluum tuo corpori apud illos in tuo tempore.	For that is better for you with your Creator, and more enduring to your glory, and more wholesome to your body among them in your time.
