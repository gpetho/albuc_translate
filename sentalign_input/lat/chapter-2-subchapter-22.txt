On the treatment of Alcomnati.
Chapter 22.
This condition called Alcomnati is merely pus that collects in the eye, resembling descending water, but it is not actually that.
And the method of treating it is to have the patient sit on a prepared or straightened seat.
Then take his head in your hands from both sides, and move it until you see the pus descending to the lower part before your eyes.
Then let it settle, and not descend further, and the vision will clear: and the patient will see things as he saw them before: if it does not descend downward, know that it is water.
If, however, the descent of the pus is not achieved with the method we mentioned, then have the patient sit between your hands.
Then take a fine spatula, and make a small incision with it above the corneal membrane near the junction of the conjunctiva with the corneal layer at the top, until the pus flows out.
When it flows out, then instill in the eye warm water mixed with honey: or water in which you have already boiled fenugreek and honey: then treat it with the remaining treatment until it is healed.
