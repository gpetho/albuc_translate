CHAPTER FORTY-SIX.	Chapter 48.	0.60720426
When pain occurs in some limb due to a fall or a blow and the pain becomes chronic and medical treatment has no effect upon it, you should cauterize it with the punctate cautery.	When pain occurs in certain limbs from a fall or blow, and that pain persists for a long time, and treatment with medicines is ineffective: then it should be cauterized with a pointed cautery.	0.7931788
In each case the cauterization should be in proportion to the size of the limb, its strength or weakness, and the chronicity of the pain and contusion in it.	And the cautery for each limb should be sized according to its size, and its delicacy, weakness, strength, and the location of the twist and pain from it.	0.70817065
If it is cured at the first cauterization, good; otherwise repeat the cauterization.	If it heals from the first cauterization, it is well. If not, then repeat the cauterization.	0.92186666
For it is customary for these pains to move from one part to a neighbouring part, and you must follow them with the cautery till the patient is cured.	Because it is customary with these pains that they shift from one limb to another nearby. Therefore you should pursue them with cauterization until the patient is healed.	0.9342956
