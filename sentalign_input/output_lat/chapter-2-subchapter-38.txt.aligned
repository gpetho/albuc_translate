There often sticks in the throat a bone or fish-bone or something else.	Often, a bone, a fish spine, or something else adheres in the throat.	0.8918836
After you have depressed the tongue with the instrument in the full light of the sun, so that what is stuck in the throat is made as conspicuous as possible, you should then remove whatever can be seen and comes into view.	Therefore, it is necessary to extract whatever is visible, upon which your sight falls, after pressing the tongue down with an instrument in the sunlight, and it will become clear to you what is in the throat.	0.74517393
But when it is not visible to you, and lies hidden in the throat, you should make the patient vomit before the food in his stomach is digested, for often the object comes out with vomiting.	And if something does not appear to you and is hidden in the throat, you must induce the patient to vomit before the food is digested in the stomach. For perhaps the attached object will be expelled by vomiting.	0.82434773
Or let him swallow a piece of turnip or a heart of lettuce or a morsel of dry bread; or take a marine sponge, dry, and tie it on a thread; then let him swallow the sponge and when it reaches where the sharp body is then quickly pull on the thread.	Or let the patient swallow a piece of turnip, or a lettuce root, or a small morsel of dry bread; or take a piece of soft, dried sea sponge, tie it with a thread, and then let him swallow it. Then, when it reaches the place where the spines or the bone are, it will be extracted and come out.	0.8826928
If it does not come out by the methods described, in this case employ an instrument made of lead, thus.	If it does not come out with what we have mentioned, then use a lead instrument in this shape.	0.80189186
It should be a little thicker than a probe, with a crook at its extremity.	Let it be slightly thicker than a rod, and at its end, let there be a curve, which is easily inserted into the throat, and let the patient keep his head elevated.	0.5011394
The patient himself should introduce it into his own throat gently; he should raise the head backwards and take care not to touch the larynx lest coughing be aroused. And let him remove therewith the bone or sharp body.	And let him avoid touching his epiglottis to prevent coughing, and let him press with it against the bone or spine, or the physician may insert it with his own hand.	0.6524042
Or else let the doctor introduce it with his hand (although it is better if the patient himself introduce it, since he knows the site of the obstruction) and push it down and then draw up his hand with the instrument; all this according to the way it presents itself to him, till it is removed.	But it is better if the patient inserts it himself, since he knows the location of the attached object, and he should push it downward or pull his hand with the instrument upward, in the amount prepared for him, until it is expelled.	0.7582139
