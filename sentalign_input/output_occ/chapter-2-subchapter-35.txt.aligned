Sometimes an abscess resembling a small nut occurs under the tongue, preventing the tongue from performing its natural functions; and very quickly it grows large until it fills the mouth.	Sometimes there occurs under the tongue a swelling resembling a small frog, which hinders the natural movements of the tongue; sometimes it grows so as even to fill the mouth.	0.86997926
And the procedure for it is that you open the patientâ€™s mouth seated facing the sun and examine the abscess.	The operation for it is to open the patient's mouth in the full light of the sun and inspect the tumour.	0.81410384
And if you see it is dark or black, hard, and the patient does not feel it, then do not touch it because it is cancerous.	If you see that it is dark or black, and hard, and the patient has no sensation in it, do not interfere with it, for it is a cancer.	0.8966557
And if it is leaning towards whiteness, in which there is moisture, then you place the hook in it, and cut it with a thin blade, and cut it in all parts; and if blood comes to you during the operation, then you place powdered vitriol on it until the bleeding is stopped.	But if it is inclined to be pale and has fluid in it, put a hook in it and incise it with a fine scalpel and free it all round; and if haemorrhage hinders you while operating apply pounded vitriol to it till the bleeding stops.	0.8152736
And then return to your work until you have completed it, until it is washed with vinegar and salt; and treat it with other remedies until it is healed.	Then proceed with your work till all is extracted; then let him rinse his mouth out with vinegar and salt. Then give all the suitable treatment till healed.	0.83170253
