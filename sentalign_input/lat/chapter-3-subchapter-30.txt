On the treatment of dislocation of the vertebrae of the back.
Chapter 31.
When someone experiences a complete dislocation of the vertebrae of the back or neck, or if many vertebrae are displaced from their places, then there is no treatment, as death quickly approaches the patient.
A sign of this is that the patient’s stool passes involuntarily, and they cannot control it; often, certain limbs are weakened as a result, or both of their legs, or both of their arms, or one of these; or a single vertebra is displaced from its place.
Often it is displaced, and displacement frequently occurs in four directions.
Thus, that which is displaced backward is called a hump.
The treatment for this is to consider, if the hump appeared in childhood, then there is no cure, and no recovery is possible at all.
But in cases that occur due to an accident, blow, or similar causes, the ancients have already described lengthy methods of treatment.
Most often, this does not return with success.
However, I have now shortened that, whose small portion excuses much of it due to my closeness to the aim; and in my explanation in which I set it forth, I have crafted its instrument differently from the way they presented and explained it.
Thus, I say that in a hump which occurs at the front, there is no treatment or recovery from it.
And likewise, for one that occurs on both sides as well.
Of these, only the one occurring on the back itself can be treated by the method I describe: the patient is stretched face down on a level platform near a wall, with damp padding spread beneath him, so his chest is not injured.
Then place a straight piece of wood fixed in a hole in the ground at the end of the platform near his head, and another piece near his feet at the other end of the platform, with an assistant holding the wood without fixing it in the hole.
And another assistant holds the other.
Then wrap a soft, strong bandage over the patient's head and under his chin; extend the end of the bandage to the wood near his head and tie it there.
Then fasten another bandage above his hips, above his knees, and at his ankles.
Then gather all the bandages and tie them to the other piece of wood near his feet.
Then let each assistant pull their respective bandages toward the wood, and the two pieces of wood should not move from their places where they are set, although they should not be fixed, as we mentioned.
And the physician should place his palms on the vertebra with strength until it returns, or place a board on it.
Then he should press down on the board with his feet until it returns.
If it does not return with this treatment, then take a board about three arm-lengths long.
And carve a spot in the wall, which we mentioned is near the patient, for the end of the board to fit into.
Then place the middle of the board over the vertebra.
And the physician places his feet on the other end.
And press firmly until the vertebra is compressed and returns to its place.
Then, if you wish, work with a winch that turns by hand: and set two pieces of wood in the ground near the patient's head at the end of the platform, each one arm-length tall; and place two pieces near his head at the end of the platform.
And let the distance between each piece of wood be one palm; and a hole has been made in each place, through which the winch operates; each piece of wood should be firmly fixed in the ground so that it does not move at all.
Then insert a round rod; it is the winch on which the bandage is wound through the two holes in the two pieces of wood.
And at its end is a hole in which a piece of wood is fixed, one palm-length, and likewise in the other two pieces of wood.
Then tighten the bandages you fastened on the patient’s chest with the winch located near his head, and the bandages on his legs with the winch near his feet.
Then let an assistant stand by each winch, turning it with the handle that rotates the winch, while the physician aligns the vertebra, as we have described.
This is the structure of the winch, as follows.
Then, after the vertebra returns to place and the area is aligned, apply a drying plaster with egg white.
Then apply wool.
Afterward, place a splint of wood on top of the plaster, about three fingers in width, or around that.
Its length should cover the area of the hump and extend over the healthy part of the vertebra.
Then fasten it with the bandage we mentioned.
And let the patient consume a light diet until he is healed.
If some prominence remains in the area at the end of healing, then softening and soothing medicines should be applied, along with the use of the board we described, for an extended period.
At this point, a lead sheet is applied there.
Sometimes a prominence occurs at the back of the vertebrae of the spine, and it is thought to be a dislocation, but it is actually just a bone that now protrudes.
Therefore, treatment should not be attempted with this remedy, as it may cause death.
