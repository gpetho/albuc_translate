of dropsy We have already mentioned in the division the characteristics of dropsy, and how the collection of water is made, and the signs of each type, and the treatment that is done with medicines, and the one that is treated with iron: it is only eclites; and one should not touch with iron in these two types: namely, tympanites and yposarche, because it is a deadly thing; so when you treat this type of dropsy called "eclites" with medicines, and the treatment does not work, then see if the patient is weak, or if he has another disease besides dropsy, such as cough and looseness of the belly and similar things; then do not touch with iron, because there is doubt; and if you see the patient has strong vitality, and he has no other disease besides dropsy alone, and he is not too young nor too old, then you should proceed as follows: lift the patient upright in your hands, and the assistant presses the belly pushing the water to the lowest part of the chest, then take the pointed spatula in this form: and it should be sharp on both sides and pointed, but not so penetrating that it can reach the intestines when it is inserted, and cannot injure them;	When you have been trying medical treatment for this kind, for ascites, and your treatment is ineffectual, then consider; and if the patient be in a low state or suffer from other disease beside the ascites, such as cough or diarrhoea or some such, then beware of attempting operative treatment since it will be of uncertain outcome. But if you see that the patient has plenty of strength and suffers under no other complaint beside the dropsy, and is of neither tender nor advanced age, then the operative procedure in this case is for you to place the patient, standing, before you, with an assistant behind him to apply manual pressure to his abdomen and push the fluid down into the pelvis. Then take a pointed scalpel of this shape, sharp along both sides, long, and very sharp at the end like a scalpel, but slightly stubby so that in operating you do not reach the intestines and damage them.	0.8162693
then see if the dropsy is formed towards the intestines: then you must cut above the belly three fingers width below the navel; and if the dropsy is due to liver disease, then the cut should be on the left side of the belly three fingers; and if it is for the spleen, it should be on the right side, and the patient should not lie on the incision so that the fluids do not flow to that weak place;	Then consider; and if the dropsy arises from the region of the intestines then you should make an incision three fingers' breadth directly below the umbilicus, above the pubes. If the dropsy arises from disease of the liver, let your incision be three fingers to the left of the umbilicus. If it arises from disease of the spleen, let the incision be three fingers to the right. Moreover, the incision must not be on the side which the patient wishes to lie on, so that the superfluities may not flow to the damaged part.	0.9036759
at the top is the blade, so that when the instrument reaches the water, it descends immediately on the instrument; then empty half or a third of it, because if you empty more than necessary at that time, perhaps the patient will die from the loss of his life force, or he will faint, or he will approach death;	Its extremity may be cut to the shape of a writing reed like this; the upper end of it is supplied with a ring. When the instrument reaches the fluid, the fluid will at once pass down into it. Evacuate at one time only a moderate amount of fluid; for if you evacuate more than you should at a time, the patient may die through a dissolution of his animal spirits, or he will undergo a fainting that is next door to death.	0.7311878
but empty according to the amount of his strength, and according to what the conditions of the patientâ€™s strength signify, and his pulse; then remove the instrument and retain the water, and it is retained now by the skin that stops the hole that is on the sac, which I mentioned, that you pierce in this manner; then reinsert the instrument the next day, if you see the patient tolerating it, and draw out a small amount of water;	But let out such quantity of fluid as is proportionate to his strength and as is indicated to you by the patient's condition: the strength of his pulse and the goodness of his colour. Then withdraw the instrument and keep (the rest of) the fluid in. For it will be immediately held back by the skin that closes the opening in the peritoneum, which, as I have told you, must be perforated in that manner. Then repeat the use of the instrument another day if you see that the patient can tolerate it, and withdraw again a small quantity of fluid.	0.868334
do this for a few days, and be careful not to rush so that only a little water remains. And if you have doubts about the patient, and you leave a lot of water in him, then treat him with burial in hot sand, and with a lot of sweating or baths and in the sun, and prevent him from drinking; and treat him with drying medicines until he is healed, and cauterize over the stomach and over the liver and over the spleen after the extraction of the water, as I said before.	And do this daily, watchful and on guard against error, until there is only a trace of fluid left. But if you are afraid for the patient and leave a large amount of fluids treat him by burying him in hot sand, and by heavy sweating in the bath and in the sun, and letting him go thirsty; while you treat him with drying medicines, till he is well. He should also be cauterized on the abdomen and on the liver and spleen after the paracentesis, as I have previously described.	0.8977425
