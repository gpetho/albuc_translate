Chapter Sixteen on the Reduction of a Fracture of the Leg	CHAPTER SIXTEEN. On setting a fracture of the leg.	0.7332372
The leg has two bones, one thick, called the tibia, and the other thin, called the fibula. They are subject to the same types of fractures as the bones of the arm, and therefore their treatment is the same as the treatment of the arm, and the procedure is one.	The leg consists of two bones. One of them is thick and is called 'leg bone' (tibia). The other is slender and is called 'fire-stick' (fibula). Both of these are liable to the same kinds of fracture as occur in the two bones of the forearm, therefore the repair of them will be like that of the arm, and the operation is one and the same.	0.89054793
If both bones are broken, the leg will turn in all directions.	If both bones are broken together, the leg will turn in all directions.	0.97960305
If the thinner bone is broken, the leg will turn forward.	If the fibula is broken there will be a forward deformity of the leg.	0.7245525
And if the thicker bone is broken and it happens from below, it is something that is not hidden from you.	If the tibia be broken, and that low down, it will be obvious to you.	0.5368477
So use extension and alignment and tying splints according to that, except that if the fracture of the leg is severe with many fragments, the extension should be less and lighter, and be gentle in your effort to treat it.	But it will be necessary, if the fracture of the leg be a serious one with much fragmentation, for the extension to be gentler and lighter; and you must employ the utmost gentleness in setting it.	0.71407396
In the leg, there is something extra in the procedure compared to the arm, which is that when you have aligned the splints and finished all your work, take two thin strips of pine wood, which are used in leveling rooms, that are placed between the cracks of the planks, or they can be from palm leaf ribs, or similar, and choose from them those that have a little thickness and are not thin, and let their length be the length of the leg from the knee to the bottom.	The operation on the leg involves one more process than that on the arm, namely, that when you have set the splints and have finished the task, you should take two strips of pine wood such as are used for roofing upstairs rooms, being put in the gaps of the planking, or they may be palm stalks; pick out such as are somewhat thick and not too thin; they should be as long as the leg from the knee down.	0.8376989
Then wrap a cloth around each one twice along its length, and place one on the leg and the other on the other side, and let them be from the knee to the bottom of the foot.	Then wrap each of them in a cloth folded into two longitudinally, and put one on each side of the leg; they should reach from the knee to the extremity of the foot.	0.8639037
Then tie the two thin strips in three places, at the ends and the middle, for by this restraint the leg is prevented from tilting right and left and is well stabilized.	Then tie the two strips in three places, namely at the two ends and in the middle; this binding prevents the leg from bending to right or left and it will be held in a good straight position.	0.9126551
A wooden gutter may be used along the length of the leg and placed in it to protect it from movement, and it is most important to do this in a fracture, especially if it is accompanied by a wound.	Sometimes a 'gutter-splint' is used, made of wood according to the length of the leg; the leg is placed in this and it keeps the leg motionless. This is particularly necessary in a compound fracture.	0.7474974
Then check the leg every day and take great care of it for swelling or inflation or any of that, so whenever anything of that happens, treat it with what is necessary until it heals.	Then carefully examine the leg every day and use the utmost care to guard against effusion or swelling or other like things; and when anything of this sort happens employ the means to meet the case until it heals.	0.88247347
And the leg bone heals in thirty days or so.	The bone of the leg mends in thirty days or so.	0.90263855
