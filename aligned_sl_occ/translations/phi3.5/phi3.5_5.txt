Oh children, you have completed this book of mine, which is the latest in medical science, as I brag about it here and through my expositions and declarations, showing that you understand what concerns me most - that portion from surgery where an operation takes place today.
When the operation is exhausted in our region and at all times of complete privacy, while you observe me closely; until only small descriptions remain from ancient texts that I have changed to these errors and healings methods hereby stated – which are now closed clauses and lengths of knowledge gained.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
May be the reason why no artisan from his hand is absent in our time, for medicine has become long and it's necessary now that its practitioner be trained in anatomy as known by Gaius within these days; knowing the joints and separations of their bodies—the bones, nerves, and sinews along with their names, pulsating veins and quiet ones, plus all locations where blood is refreshed.
Through Aqua Ypocrates' guidance, it may be in this small work and mostly within the field of medicine.
May we already have told you about that in the entrance of this book; who does not know what has been told to us regarding anatomy, will stumble into error if they haven'thy seen much of those things themselves, as are formed within this science and through its knowledge and experiments.
Here is the line-by extralanguage translation:
Here comes another doctor who prescribes that the patient drink a stone from a home which had been processed in his state; this stone was large and came into view, whereby they extract it using a tool from the bladder, causing death of that person by the third day.
And you have already called for it to be removed from there, and because of the great size of the stone and the positioning within the spleen'dictated by its location that led directly to death.
And another doctor received the pay of our duke as compensation for surgery, and brought forth a black instrument which was fractured in his thigh; due to the surgeon's ignorance, he mended the bone on the ground using stiff pillows and bedposts, without allowing breath.
Here is the line by line translation:
And they called for him, and used tools to untie the ligaments, achieving calmness and relief from their pains.
Even though decay had been confirmed in the limb, so it could not be restrained and did not cease to travel within the body as long as the malady persisted.
And another doctor pierces an abscess and it ruptures within days; meanwhile its wickedness grows as the lord of that person.
The cause is that the head'thycture must be purged for melancholic humor which does not come to it all over but affects only the member where suffering has taken hold from now onwards:
And for these reasons, men are required that the operation be arranged in two parts: one associated with health and another where there is risk involved in major decisions.
And when there is water within this free place where the encounter and fear occur; it becomes necessary for you to keep watch over the water and take care of that area so that the limbs do not become frightened or dishonest (perhaps meaning deceptive in nature).
So take up your weapons with solicitation and for the protection of God, and your illnesses are strengthened and secured.
Here comes the translation line by line into English:
Guinea yclept in some moons is called. Not a physician can be bad, for they will not call themselves by that name.
And you have already delved into this book for the second time three chapters deep.
Begins the division of the free area, starting from the primary section. The ordered first chapter within the body'supremacy, in terms of instruments and irons for caustics, what is necessary herein required on its part.
La division of the second partition. The second chapter on cauterization and perforation, as well as pills, poultices, and the extraction of herbs for them, has been ordered in all forms of instruments.
The third part of restoration and displacement, as well as the care for twists and mixtures directed towards these issues within the body'se capacity: head inside the weight (body), and forms of instruments arranged by their heads.
When you examine the quality of that particular cautery and its non-essential parts, and where it is forbidden to use a cauterization.
So it is said that the discourse on the quality of cautery and its obscurity is long and elaborate, subtle by science, secretly discussed; they speak widely about their subjects, and I have enough to understand them for a lengthy discussion.
And thus it is said that the pointed cautery comforts all parts of the body universally, except for two types of materials from which they are made: these are tail ends or extremities of their substance.
In the complex tail and dry matter; they find that certain implements are beneficial for it therein, others contrary to those, which instruments are not suitable in this illness caused by dampness due to its quality and aridity—the nature of the focus is also likewise characterized by these qualities. It's necessary when dealing with such dry-matter affliction that water be drawn out; for it follows from their properties, as well as the condition itself being one of both dampness and dryness requires moisture to heal what has been extracted therewith.
Here comes the medieval medical treatise to translate line by line:
Through the speech of that person, I have already discovered some things for myself.
Even if the tool for withdrawal has not yet been used and that which is already exposed to cautery during today' extrication exercise, understand their complexity as human beings and how diseases manifest in them, including causes of those illnesses and incidents therein.
May occur in other complexities as well; it is not out of fear but primarily due to cold sweats and damp humors, for which all doctors agree upon treatment with cautioning needles in those areas.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
May the medicine' extricate reach that which has lain in his limb and with firm force bring it back to health thereand also promptly remove from illness, bringing strength swiftly into its weakened state of recovery.
May the focus (possibly referring to a treatment method), due to its sublimity and noble substance, does not suffice; we have known it through experimentation and long-term study in the art of healing concerning the truths about causes; therefore, you are excused from this lengthy discourse. Until now, only servants (or practitioners) acquainted with these treatments know how to remove illnesses effectively using them on limbs or during expulsion for purge purposes—a philosophical demonstration shown in the speech which sharpens our understanding of pains.
And if wise ones say that it is best to perform cauterizations and breaks at the most favorable times of early spring,

So do not sit in your knees or feet, people and common physicians estimate them as such that to this illness healed by cauterization, it'n’t completely removed all at once; therefore they pause the effects of that curative procedure.

Even the common talk may be about medical instruments' handling at the end of treatment, and it is not what I understand here that can fully comprehend or find out how these tools are used in medicine or by other causes beyond my knowledge.
The cause is contrary to water; I understand that the last remedy of medicine in some illnesses is only when they administer healing herbs at certain times, and this treatment provides relief from the cause, which we apply ourselves directly therein. And when these are the remedies that doctors use according to what is commonly understood by common people and others among physicians,

The First Chapter (literally translated from Latin-influenced medieval language):
The form of this cauterization is as follows: initially command the malady to be expelled through medicine in three or four days, depending on how much pressure you apply and what age the patient is used to being treated at.
Return the command of their head to its position with a razor, and place that segment between your hands on an elevated board so as not to have it touching your chest.
Return your hand'thy fingers over the bridge of thy nose between their pillows. Whenever the patient' extricates themselves from their bed at night (as they arrive), signs will indicate that place is trying to resist them; now apply heat therapy using this very tool for treatment.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: E propósito daquele sob o local sentado em tentativa, a enfermidade desce, que é a onde a tíbia se torna constrita gradualmente, e você gira esse objeto.
Return your hand and observe the location, and if you find that part of the bone has come out through the open space (where there may be existing fracture fragments), raise it up to the amount shown by the iron piece described earlier; otherwise, return your hand back to where the metal is located. If already chilled/cold, enter so as to see what portion of the bone was exposed during its removal.
Return (and) apply a small amount of salt and dissolve it over the location, letting it act for three days.
Return your hand over his chest, where that which has been crushed by the focus lies within it. Return care for the place where the snake'thyserm is inside until it heals.
And when the patient has urinated (diysero that is), they put a belt on their waist (miaels geta le bra), so it's better and more beneficial for them.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: And those who are bleeding within their throat and have had some points made inside the bone, they should be burned with cauterization (and) have the cauterizations placed where there is already sclerosed part of the bone.
And if it is necessary for him/her (the patient) to urinate because of bone weakness, then provide proper care and treatment.
Here come others with the lancets to penetrate and enter into the bone, within which they already find it hardened by previous insertion of similar instruments, this is how small apothecaries practice their craft. E from that location exhales the breath of the head.
If there has been an outflow for long periods, and it is healed within that time frame.
May I not see all these kinds of cautery tools for everyone, but only to those in this house according to fear; and as long as your head is illuminated by the sun'thy gaze (eye sight), which we have witnessed here on other members mainly when it comes from the patient’s malady.
The translation of this medieval medical text from a language similar to Latin, Italian, Spanish and French would be:
Second Chapter (Assuming "Capitol" refers to a chapter
Of or related to the points of care for that section/chapter, possibly discuss
When in that entire section/chapter it becomes chronic and prolonged pain within the bowels, using knives and hooks as well as lanceforks (a type of surgical instrument), with an emphasis on treatment rather than mere removal; if moreover this portion of the belly is highly formed by bone in nature; then such cauterization done with a particular lancet should also be applied to that part. Return that over the patient's head for cauterization, while ensuring the spinal cord is not cut open. Cut the ribcage and expose its thickness as recorded and seal it with a cauterium in the lower part of the back where it has been applied, which is also the place where draping (ventose) takes place—this is the location being referred to. And press your hand firmly without finding the bones, for when the humors invade heavily causing great pain different from that of other caustic instruments used on the head.
Here they apply this cautery in its place, for when the cautery is applied to these corns on the head and back, it also applies that which has been used at the spot of the scalp; this is how things are done here.
Capital terrain.
Of ancient non-antidotal cautery treatment.
When severe pain occurs in the head or when it is tension-like and enters into the brain ventricle, both extracts are taken by medicine for treatment of diseases; without this knowledge you will not improve, there are two types of cauterization available: either medicinal combustion therapy with a specific medicine, or iron.
May razors be used in medicine to grasp a sponge of asphalt and remove the limbs from both heads, respectively. And you will apply the location of pain on one'thy hand with a hidden lance in its place where it lies concealed underneath your neck bone.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
And care for it within which has been healed.
If you come, apply some of the hot poultices that you have written down in your treatment booklet for medicine-burning treatments.
In this manner of caustic treatment, it is with iron as the form:
And when the head of him is like a closed clamp with some curved part in which he rests at his place, and there are small beads for decoration as well.
Return the pause over the location of pain and hold your hand—so that it is not drawn out, which has just happened—and slowly turn the small iron back to its speed gradually.
If the amount of fluid that has accumulated due to obstruction at the base of the bladder is what makes up its content, then place your hand over it so that the artery does not get compressed further, thus preventing urine flow.
Here is the line-by-line translation of the medieval medical treatise:
If you go forward, perform a cauterization on the extremity of the lancet according to the treatment without delay; be careful not to cut into an artery during this procedure in the current limb.
Capital quarter (Assuming this refers to a specific time
Caustic treatment of ancient emigrants. This phrase suggests that the text might be discussing historical medical practices for treating complications or injuries associated
When you treat ancient emigrants, taking into account what has been said about their healing and the divisions of illnesses mentioned beforehand—and neglecting proper care, there are times when not enough remedy from either the first cauterization in medicine or that for fomentation (which refers to a treatment involving heat) is applied; you indicate over where this pain lies along long lines — which may be its seat. Thus place your hand on it gently and use steam, penetrating with vapor inside cracks caused by the cautery needles within bone tissue—and return through openings made in ceramicware (pottery), allowing heat to reach that area once again: this ensures a restful period during which you can warm it internally via moist steam.
However, it is necessary for you to guard against the continuous movement of the jaw, which grinds its teeth during chewing, and prevent damage to the ligament associated with that joint, as well as avoiding spasm in those nerves.
If it is about the custody and caution of blood flow from an artery that expands, there is fear in this expansion, mostly for those who do not know what causes it and does not study or investigate; then perform the operation on them with care.
When time for recalling the flow of sanitation accidents in accordance with our guidelsetup comes to this place.
If you feel from this illness that the current treatment is not sufficient and your head (cold location) becomes unbearable, then cauterize there at once where we have previously mentioned, while taking care of what'thy body requires to heal within.
If you come, administer the same caustic that we have prepared in the head of steam iron for two cloths, and this is a better treatment hereby provided.

For alleviating joint pains in the hands, they perform cauterization. This suggests that medieval physicians used heat or burning techniques (cauterization)
When in the hand there is pain due to cold and wet causes which require treatment for these reasons as well as another form of care mentioned herein; thus they do not amend or alleviate it with fire (heat), but this very one that I have outlined, known by its puncture nature, serves. Here the speaker is emphasizing a specific type of cauterization—likely involving some sort of pinpoint intervention rather than direct heat application for treating pain in hands caused by cold and wet causes according to medieval medical understanding or practice.
This line translates as: This puncture is applied with fire (ignition), and it's administered throughout the entire hand area similar to how a spinning wheel rotates, or along any paths if pain occurs in parts of the body other than where originally targeted. Herein lies an indication that when performing this specific type of cauterization—puncture with fire as mentioned earlier —the practitioners would distribute it over all areas affected by joint pains (likely referring to hands, based on context), employing a methodical approach remin Additionally extend your hand treatment with the punctures of the joint in question, ensuring you touch each location where pain is being tested or experienced by yourself carefully and deliberately (implying self-care).

Cauterization of bruise and it is not only through spices that come by way of the veins but according to what we have said in divisions of diseases." In this line from a medieval medical treatise, there's an indication that cauterization (a practice used historically for wound healing) involves more than just using spices delivered through blood vessels. It references previously established principles or classifications regarding illnesses within the text — suggesting these

When you treat that herb of bruise and purgation without hindering your cautery treatment, make sure to take three cautions while performing the procedure on abdomen: one must use a golden lance (possibly for precision cutting), secondly apply small temples gently therein involved with spiritual aspects or ceremonial importance (implying an element of ritualism common in medieval medicine as well as mysticism and faith practices), third, your lips should kiss the region to convey healing intention." This line reflects a nuanced approach combining practical steps for applying cautery — likely referring herein not just to physical intervention but also invoking spiritual or emotional elements associated with treatment. The use of "golden lance" suggests precision and possibly sanctity in the act, while kissing indicates an intention-based aspect crucial to medieval healing practices beyond mere medical application.
When you pause the pointed cautery for the contrary parts of the diseased area, there is relief only in the healed portion of that area.

When apoplexy (stroke) is outdated and the remedies we have mentioned apply only if your physician does not prescribe treatments for this condition when it isn's feverish, then perform these four types of cauterization: over all parts of their head; at points where there may be heat in that area (presumably suggesting areas around the skull or scalp); similarly as we have mentioned before; and also on the ears. The action of the cautery is said to be caused as described.

Return rest for pace; it is worthy of sheep'dictum bordering on treatment with wool remedies (implying that returning the position and applying warmth or a poultice made from animal materials such as wool might be beneficial). Heat it on the forehead moderately warmed for measure; this relieves them when they are suffering in there (suggesting that applying a warm compress or heating pad to the patient's forehead can provide relief during their pain). Return it over in bed at the head's warmth location (the heat source like an heated pillow or blanket), and lay your hand within to prevent being scalded while warmed up thereby ensuring safe application of temperature therapy for pain relief, consistent with medieval medical practice.
Apply it to the sinew of the waist throughout the week as part of overall treatment within which you are healing; or if desired, anesthetize that small pointed point on your wrist according to what is necessary therein (indicating a specific type of cautery for numbing pain), but first make sure it's wet with equal amounts so the brain does not get affected. This line suggests regular treatment and potential localized application of anesthetics or therapeutic measures, as well as careful attention to preventing harm while conducting such procedures in alignment with medieval medical understanding focused on humoral balance (the concept that excesses can cause disease).

When the abdominal parts are agitated and exposed to humidity, they become digestive and retaining organs (the stomach and intestines), which is why treatments with medicinal hands do not confuse but rather demonstrate these functions as a form of healing. Moreover: when disturbans suffer from the manifestation of such internal heat through their symptoms, they receive cauterization using great instruments for treatment in both the stomach and large intestine (colon), along with four other specific types of minor caustic tools—each used to treat different conditions as follows:

Regarding the cautery of gout and joint pain:
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
So when gout is healed by the touch of a physician and there are no more pains left untreated, then apply treatments with forceps.
When you are cauterizing that which is eliminated in the circulatory channel of the joint between foot and calf, using specific cautery tools designed for this purpose.
This is where this tool (the olive knife) exists:
If it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then use a pointed cautery for that purpose. If pain enters the joints or other constricted areas and there is motion within them, then treat that area with one of three or four caustic applications made for this purpose throughout all parts involved in this treatment.
If there is need for more cauterization with these instruments and you do not press your hand too hard on the instrument previously used before now (implying a tool like forceps), then only send out the examination sponge from undernethy, that's all.
If pain enters into the joint and both knees, then administers the treatment we have mentioned in our chapter.
If the pains are only in the hips and waist alone, then it is called sourness; when this turns like a wheel within its channels, pierce those two lines.
If there remain pains in the head, then make an incision on the circumference of each node and over the palm' extrication point;
If joint or muscle pain comes on during the day at times in the legs or arms, then doctors will perform cautery on all parts of these assistants (helpers).
And if the gallbladdigon is not purged by a good diet and medicine intake, provided that there exists such regimen, God helps.

When the artery is blocked, it's not possible in those constrictions to remove the blockage itself unless one of four methods are used: using cautery where we need blood flow restoration (and when done so, limbs become combustible and further restriction occurs), or extraction when no longer extractable; if there is a ligature tied around it with strong bandages made from linen stuffed into cardboard boxes for structural support—or those clogs are maintained over the patient by medicines that continue to restrict blood flow, these must be kept firmly in place on the chest.

When the acid humors accumulate, they rest upon those veins which are above the chest bone and do not cause discomfort in any way for medical treatment; at times the belly swells up like a badger's walk and its hair stands on end as if it were crawling with ants.

When cleansing arrives and continues, and the humors of malaute expand in little balls (or droplets), and their regard is relieved, and the ulcerated eyelids and brows are covered with hair, and there is sharp pain at the top of the head before it extends outwardly continuously, you know that these accidents do not come from moisture-laden veins coming down from body parts divided by injury.
And the best cure in these cases is to command the humors, and by means of that same one incision at the site on the forehead where it enters into the right temple (and insertion thereof within left temple; entering bone; holding your hand from the jaw joints which are used for chewing), until its discovery.
Remove all moisture or dry cloth from between the patient's lips and the crack of their thin skin or linen, respectively. And up above there are pus and blood in the veins, which is why it prevents further abscess formation.
When the putrefaction has decreased and blood begins to rise in the liver (starting from within), take care that this excess is removed with an exsiccated remedy, as when you apply two parts of flour made from wheat and four parts of beeswax melted together. Apply it externally on these wounds using their own pus. Additionally, administer internally in accordance to the flesh'dictates (i.e., its natural needs).
From what is provided in the text above, it appears that this passage
When treating fluid accumulation (edema or swelling) in the hands:
Totally because it is in the fingers (the source of the issue), one of four kinds: either a mineral or like its appearance; or iron and glass, as with these materials, copper and lead are used; or fluid-like causes such as water mixed with vinegar/wine, along with their appearances—or perhaps an animal.
So when blood flows in the ear or appears similar to those causes that do not fit within it and stops flowing into the ear, if you see the bleeding, then administer its removal, and make the swelling conformable according to treatment, and apply pressure with your hand over where draining occurred, observing the course of drainage. Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
If there is not relief yet, then apply gentle suction with the designated instruments for which this method serves as follows:
If it is an obstruction (foreign body), then do so; otherwise, administer its removal gently under careful observation twice a few days apart.
And if there is not an opening in the body, then make and insert a bone conduit into the extremity of the channel within the artery' extrinsic to it, sealing with wax and oiled linseed oil so that nothing but the conduit protrudes. And if it is necessary to take out from below (the belly), where they have been restrained with water for too long that we are recounting today, do so carefully and firmly.
If not for the treatment in this manner, take some warmth or cold device upon which their joints are pressed with a certain amount of force and pause it at the end of the limb, then wrap it snugly around that point treated. Return that into the hollow of the artery for ease and remove the thorn from moisture therein.
So if all causes that we have discussed do not suffice to open the gate (or entrance), then apply such an operation or treatment as will alleviate the abscess and spasm.
When managing such an issue that you sanction the malaute of the vena saphica and extract it according to the manner of the vertu of them, place your fingers between yours hands where they meet (the wrist area), turning the auricular into the divisions above, creating a small fissure in the cartilage of that auricle, holding down any greases there. Here comes the first source sentence to translate: When the figure of the moon'se crack reaches the stone (the patient's bone), and if that very same time you have an instrument ready for treatment; apply it at this moment, quickly fix the fissure therein, and take care of it until healed.
If the cause of swelling in the joint is due to grease that you believe and inflate it, then administer care and removal; but if you do not obey my advice, take a gentle touch under this manner: And administer that which was taken from his joint where it has been extracted, into its cavity (which is the knee), using an applicator for it to be absorbed therein.
Even when you think that it is already moistened by the breath of ardor, and stop there in resting pains, do not remove those hands holding them here or below where they make small cuts or gestures subtly, for then we are distracted from extracting it.
May be in the water whereby/which enters through the groin into the cavity of one's belly, and completes this space within their chest, at which point if diverted elsewhere (implying an issue with urine flow), it becomes; otherwise, take pebbles or stones according to its length, place them in the focus on that part where water enters/flows through one's groin, and have the patient insert a stone from this collection into their own groin area. Then step onto any of these placed stones with either foot as percussion is performed over another such stone positioned upon it for therapeutic effect. So that all the water remains inside where it is put (or allowed).
So that all the water remains inside where it is put (or allowed). And when the water has flowed into the orifice that you grasp with paper or gourd, place one end of it in the aureola and extend the other within where its flame is burning to heat up the patient' extrême.
Here comes the first sentence: E prop met i altregon e fai acqua tante veghe entro che tutta l'acqua sia foro-getada, e straz quel canula agussio co desus es dite de la peyra extraordinaria.
When an animal is dragged out of that place if it's a small one, may pull and push gently as we did in the division; when it's from a large one causing pain in the abdomen, then administer its extraction by force and cutting instruments, removing all other potential causes present within the hernia.
When pus generated in the artery comes out during extraction and you do not comfort your treatment of that which we have mentioned before regarding division and flow of fluids without providing relief for your care, then pay attention to the artery when exposed to sunlight.
And if there appears any cause of worms here, extract that with gentle or subtle hands, and if no such cause is found, take a thin catheter drawn from below; this will be the form of treatment. Here enters the subtle part under the armpit according to the quantity that suffers into the malady; and apply sucking with that object at it, making moving motions constantly until all the worms have come out through their holes (or orifices).
May you not obey my advice during the treatment session? Then close and seal off in the canula tube with wax as we have discussed; administer these that have already been refined for use against parasites, avoiding any escape through the administration tracts.
And if it is your effusion that allows you to introduce the remedies into this vessel, which form of tool does this belong to? E thereof is made of silver or lead, quickly struck in it a small piece, and placed on the chest.
So it is that when they press in the region of the catheter'dictor, herein lies their necessity. If you wish, take the wand and wrap it gently around the patient's limb, place oil or honey in the cavity of their chest (or any herbal tincture from these medicines), which is in your finger – that very one! Insert this same ray into below the wound area quickly to express out what has been drawn up with it.
When it is encapsulated in the auricle (ear), then it has been cut at its base with a small flame or fire point. Guard your hands so that what you extract in the beard is not excessively cold, for the remedies of the beard do not tolerate too much chill.

The phrase "de curacio de opula ossa auriculares" translates to "care for the bony ears." This
Translation: Some children experience pain in the belly caused by substances (possibly pus or flesh) that are not present within their bony ears; this condition is sometimes felt at the root of the earlobe, which lacks proper covering, and occasionally even in parts further down. Here "opula" refers to an accumulation such as fluid or foreign material inside a body part (in this case, possibly related otitis media where fluid can collect behind eardrums), causing discomfort that manifests physically—though not directly within the ear bone itself ("aurelha"), but at its base and potentially in other areas. The ancient text suggests an understanding of internal bodily afflictions presenting with external symptoms, highlighting a holistic view on medicine even back then.
When you cause pain in the lower part of him/her (the patient), which does not compress clothing, it is one of the major difficulties for difficult recovery.
In that situation where you pause the tail of the malady at the waist and look upon it there: So if you see an obvious swelling, grasp that subtle part of it which is its form.
If the limb in which it is small has one sharp and the other not, and the sinews are of two claw-like lengths to ensure that they do not injure the phalanges (fingers).
And if the abscess is caused by flesh (or body tissue) that has erupted in the armpit or thigh, then cut it out with delicate and violent actions until all the flesh is removed.
If the swelling is in the groin area of the armpit, then gently insert your finger and heat that spot with gentle fire until it warms up there; place some warmth into the chest region of the armpit.

When the nails of our hair are adjusted with cold and old methods, they become sources for illnesses similar to tears incessantly and soothing palms and linen within which this is caused by touching oneself; treated through four maneuvers: or cutting at its focus point (with a sharp tool), or as acute medicine according to what it says on the cautery chapter, or adjusted with intention and suture for inspection/correction purposes, or using threads which is described.
And so you stop the flow of blood in the wound; take your left hand and place it over the eye lid (palpebra), if converted already happens - as directed by us: insert a needle where the thread inserted from our part, pierce through with that same needle undernethy hairs [pelo], within which there are no fur — neither of eyes nor body overall. Once done so, pull back and adjust this pin to convert it into light (ray).
Return to the part of the eye lid where hair meets skin at attachment by spine inside major tear duct; and quickly remove the lashes with powder or cloth from under the eyelid, place your finger over it as if holding a feather quill.
Mayhap the figure depends on how much evaporation there is from under the eyelids, and among men, this varies greatly; it's those individuals who have a significant amount of secretion in their eyes that experience greater softening according to the quantity present.

Otherwise, it's not treated.
Return the stitches of the fields within three to four days and take care of it properly.
If you wish, stitch the wound and treat that which expels and tightens up, for when it is removed from the eye lid, seal off with the child'thy bandage and apply additional layers; perhaps suturing will be better Thus so do I address these ancient healing methods.

If it is not possible to open the wounds, then have needles with thread and put that in the figure's heat source where there are threads; place another needle on the major tear duct, another on the lacrimal membrane folding downwards, adjusting those fingers so they stand at equal height, lift your hand upward to elevate this area of healing as we have recommended together.
And adjust the patient'thy lips with wax for stitching, and heal that which is inside of them.

You have already inserted into the extremities of several parts, where you hold the threads.
When one adds any subtlety under what excesses arise from the eye'dictum (implying that we are dealing with an issue related to fluid imbalance affecting vision), and compresses the cannulas of several divided parts affected by rigid constriction, do so gradually over a few days; for when the spinal column suffers due to strictures as neglected or denied treatment (or becoming too tightly constrained without proper intervention), it will relax within that time through its own means.
If it is late, then strike the thighs with force and carefully ensure that the patient rests so they can heal.

When you care for arising pains that are accompanied by acute illness and cannot heal without intervention; it is not within the body itself but outside, where cutting away (surgically removing) all moisture allows exposure of bone beneath which otherwise would be hidden. Here we can see a clear directive in ancient medical texts to remove excess fluids from an area that has experienced trauma or injury ("aposematia"), presumably as part of the healing process, likely for reasons related to reducing swelling and promoting recovery by exposing bone structure directly below where there is inflammation.
And when you discover the bone and times of its decay or ruin, it is thus that this thing takes form:

Place the first needle where the eyelid starts at the joint below and move it upward according to arrangement; position the second doubled thread from under the lacrimal part of the eye lid in its place so that both can penetrate their respective locations following your plan, tightening as necessary there.
Return and place the needle above the warm linen inundated with water, allowing it to enter where there is blood flow.

Here some measures unite the entire divided part within the cloth beds of wound (interpreted as "the treatment encompasses all parts of the injury"), and they are made with a delicate sponge that washes away from inside what is in the wound, carrying moisture to the epidermis layer deep down, bringing it outwards. Here each term aligns more closely with Old Spanish medical terminology:

The phrase translates to: "This illness that is called arthritis (arthronitis) is not just any disease, it's one where the joint seems as if stretched and dipped in water." Here 'arthronitis' might be an old or regional term for a type of inflammation affecting the joints. The description implies that this condition causes painful swelling similar to being overstretch
The translation of the complex medieval medical treatise excerpt is: "For this illness that arises in action, you make the humors separate on a heated apparatus and apply your head there with two hands (and possibly more), placing it where you perceive the disease as having its origin among the joints. You then dry them so they do not descend further into decay or exacerbate inflammation; at this point, even light pressure is applied to address these origins of illness within your body." Here 'malaute' likely refers to a bodily fluid thought responsible for health and sickness in humoral theory. This explanation shows how medieval physicians believed certain practices could influence the balance of fluids (humors) inside their patients, with specific actions tailored towards addressing joint-related discomfort as they understood it at that time.
If it does not fall into place (or if water doesn'thy descent), understand that there is water involved.

This complex sentence from a medieval medical text likely advises against direct contact with an area of pain or injury, suggesting that pus ('motos') and other harmful substances may be present due to neglect (lapsing) in timely diagnosis. The mention of 'iron pricks' might refer metaphorically to sharp symptoms like headaches from skull injuries which can attract the presence or worsening effect of these detrified ('motos').

When teeth are esteemed above all natural parts of the body they tend to be more so in women and especially revered individuals (holy persons); thus consider this: if a dent is nothing compared with other human teeth, then it's clear that there can neither be excision nor bandaging from them.

When bloodletting is medically administered as part of the healing process in medicine and does not cause discomfort to you, consider that it may be appropriate for treating hemorrhage within an abdomen wound; thus take the tongue depressors we have provided.
So if you experience a sankey-swallowing sensation again, extract that small or subtle movement delicately.
If it is not possible to extract from there, then take a concave cannula and insert that into the groin of the malady, placing your pause in the indentation of the cannula with a heated iron rod (making sure that the sycgenia is dead and held within the groin for the duration of the water bath), thereby restraining it completely.

When they come here with sickness (meaning patients arriving at the clinic or hospital), it is another aspect of suction therapy for that person which involves carbons being burned in a vessel, and within this same container there's an opening; hold below where you are performing suction. And pull their mouth back to keep suction from entering further when you know the suction has reached the wound area—where they feel pain (the specific location of the patient’n discomfort).
If not already done, then repeat the subfumigation movements, and prevent the humors in the body from drinking (absorbing liquids), eat salty and acidic foods, and do not drink water, as it is necessary that this regimen be followed.

In this line from the medieval medical treatise, it appears to discuss how various parts of speech ("apostemas") are moved in a special manner as remembered by some function or action within "this text" (referring backwardly). The exact translation may be nuanced due to archaic language use:
Here are the translations line by line:
The second intervention is directed to the places where pains occur in the body, for when an abscess appears on the head, it is different from an abscess that occurs at the joints; and each of them requires a specific operation.
When some of these things, which are not punctured but rather indicate the disease in those places and complements to them, come into view;
So other appendices that are dislocated when they're crossed and aren'thy mature according to their complement, akin to those attached at joints; an appendix becomes part of the juncture when it enters into its circuit within this body, corrupting the ligaments or nerves of that particular juncture. Thus becoming painful; if delayed beyond maturation in any member (protruded viscera), perforation occurs there and does not heal naturally due to incomplete digestion until you reach the abdomen's appendix, causing a fistula or abscess which is untreatable here. May you know the hour of the puncture for the abscess, and so it is when it ripens.
E understand that it matures when the pain subsides and fever ceases, and reduce the decrease of speech and heartbeat, strengthen the head of abscession, and other symptoms.
When you know where the entry point for drainage of abscess and purulent discharge from treatment of inflammation is,
Through puncturing deeply into the flesh or limb, if instruments penetrate in parts of muscles or feet and in areas where tendons are located within joints (of bones), at last it arrives everywhere else that is not visible when reflected; this occurs primarily there. In these reflections, use a puncture according to the corresponding body part.
When the abscess is in the flesh, we must perform its incision within which the digestion of it has been confirmed once or twice (as needed), provided that if you pierce through this area now, both the limbs and mouth become hardened with dullness, and their depth increased.
May your aplications be made according to the flesh'dictions or of what is needed by that part which ingests it.
When you administer a small puncture, and for large or wide incisions as the size of the apastmas dictates:
And among the instruments for when the cecum is wrenched and wounded with blood that has begun to clot, when it hurts from hunger pangs or where there are bladder stones and boils, then...
From those who are seated on their seat and have three angles; they sit like the shape of a fir tree'dictor (perhaps referring to an exaggerated or distinct form), with legs shaped similarly as prayer beads(possibly indicating elongated, slender forms).
In those places where they administer round and crescent-shaped medicines, resembling them (to the patients).
May it not be possible for someone to bear with those shallow surface appendices that you pierce through; they should only penetrate as much on the surface.
When the abscess is large and has collected pus already, do not attempt to extract all of it at once; take out some from that area today, place more inside tomorrow, and continue removing larger portions according to gradual reduction until fully drained—these actions have been extracted.
E most often the malady is due to black bile or menstruation in a woman, young girl, or elderly person; their spirit moves towards exit of illness, and they expire because of the sickness—here you operate on them.
Guard this great caution, and place your incisions where you pierce these thorns; make sure to avoid contracting illnesses, and consider whether the pus of the thorn is scanty or a flat layer – if so, administer what was given by ancient healers for it or cauterize as needed. If however, the thorn wound is large, and there are fissures in your incision site, stop at any point within these ruptured areas until we meet again.
If in the abscess there has been detachment of part of the colon or that area has become concave within its circuit, then cover it with wool cloths soaked in water when you have taken off your clothes and put them on again; keep damp for three days. After this time, process those parts to cure what fluid comes out from the bandages where they are healing.
May you experience bleeding during your operation, then administer cold water and apply pressure on the areas where blood vessels are dilated continuously; place a towel over that spot of continuous flowing blood.
If you continue the flow of bile (choler), then take care with the regimen and treatment, as I have recommended in this book and on division.
If it is winter time and the place of sores (ulcers) is a location for muscle contractions, then cover them with powder made from vine leaves or oil caulkings, and press those onto the spots.
If it is summer and the locations are carnivorous, then when you pause pulpils at the beginning in water and oil as we have said before, do so until the fresh day comes upon us, and when that time arrives, cover up the ulceration and cleanse away any residue thereof for your patient' extricating what has entered into them.

The translation of this medieval medical text, which appears to blend elements from Latin and other Romance languages such as Old Spanish or Occitan, would be:
When joint pain occurs in the neck and these pains are caused between them, it is their own clothing that gets affected by this swelling (scrofulosis), along with lymph nodes and apatemyal nods; they accompany each other when examining such cases.
Here come the ingredients of these stones are motes (grains), some of which are stone-like and contain moisture, and those among them that are harmful and not cured by care.
So in that good disposition of the treatment, whereby the color produced is proportionate to the color of the navel and spread throughout the entire body without being attached to nerves, veins, or arteries nor prolapsing (meaning it doesn't come out), as you have carefully inserted therein a superficial segment from above the line of .G. down to the line of .B., observe that part completely and remove small fragments with one incision at a time if necessary, similarly how we described in our apostilles on the crown (of head).

So return to your operation within which you have completed it.
Return now inquiry about what has entered into the intestines or abdomen and cleanse those areas accordingly: if there is any other small swelling (scrofula), investigate it herein and purify that place.
If it is in the state of severe scrofulosis and not already excised from its place within the patient'se body, then remove that scrofulosis therefrom. Based on my understanding of Latin, Italian, Spanish and French languages, here is a rough translation for the medieval medical treatise:
And complete the patient' extrication with wax taken from Egyptian honey and take care of it as well.
If you decide on that swelling completely, then make sure the lips of your fingers and knives are pressed so tightly that not even a surplus is necessary.
May it be that you will again notice an excessive protrusion due to the greatness of the swelling caused by the scrofulus; understand its cause and treat accordingly, applying stitches where directed.
E from those scrophulas that contain moisture, it penetrates here at your site of ripening and stops the surface perforation made by what you placed below her foot, similar to how we have described.

In those who have inserted cauterization in the mouth or with tongue or two forked instruments when the illness is not in the throat, take haste to remove them from the section of spit so that it does not bleed out (the bloodletting), which occurs due to sharp percussion.

E dictum of Albucasis that which we have recommended is but the explanation whereby arteries already swollen by apendicitis (appendix) are inflamed within the colon and its intestine has been compressed into death, with these parts becoming dry through intervention; their blood flow stops so they can breathe in fresh air upon some respiration, thus being saved from death.
For water to command the evil out that is inside it must be consumed for three days, and so we order this food/drink accordingly, and take care of it until its healing.

Also direct the scraping wheel around the whole umbilical circle above where you have applied pressure with the scraper; extend the perforated suture across each part that was touched by it and place yourself between their bodies directly upon these areas underneath, while extending your arm outwards towards both sides along what has been tapped. Also position control over strength or weakness in those parts affected by apostema to where tendons attach at the great joint; adjust as necessary within its circuit around which ligaments are present near bone structure and cartilage movement (ligamentous elasticity).

The emphasis seems to be on acknowledging
This line points out that the only cure for lead poisoning (alusions are made here of heavy metals absorbed from water sources) is not found in any other antidote such as those associated with thyme or timpani herbs, but solely through althi. In this context, "althi" likely refers to a specific remedy believed capable at the time—the effectiveness and actual substance of which we may need further historical understanding (Medieval medical treatise interpretation). Here they are expressing that only one particular treatment with thyme or similar herbs
When you have treated the seafood-associated tympanist (which may refer to a condition related or caused by waterborne elements) as part of your medicine and it does not interfsere with other medications like lead, then consider that if there is relief in the ear symptoms after this treatment—or perhaps another malady associated with seafood elsewhere in body such as stomach or intestines—you must guard against using iron-based remedies because of fear over potential harm (Medieval medical treatise interpretation). Here, it indicates a concern for balancing the use of various natural elements and their interactions when treating different illnesses during that period. The term "ferr" likely refers to minerals or metallic components used as medicinal agents in medieval times ("temor es sobre aquo"), emphasizing caution due to potential risks (Medieval medical treatise interpretation).
If you again inflate the patient's abdomen excessively and it is not another illness but simply water getting out in great amounts at once, neither child nor elderly person can withstand this operation.

With proper puncture into the bladder where the stone has reached and is in the water place, here begins our intervention. Return that outwardly and insert an instrument of which this is its form. It appears to be a source sentence describing the tools and techniques for treating certain conditions. Translation into English would go as follows:
And when the instrument is inserted into him beyond his exterior layer (the subcutaneous tissue), as soon as it touches that area, draw out its fluid quantity by the appointed time; if you remove more than what should be taken during this hour and thus disrupt his body's resolution according to his spirit animal, then inflict five blows on him with a suitable instrument for death.

Additionally, it speaks of curing (remedying) this condition with linen dressings ('enguent diafinicon'), which should be placed within that area while healing occurs. This suggests a traditional practice where post-procedure care is essential to recovery ("sanat"). The reference to "enguent egiptoica" indicates the
In this sentence related to handling harmful (maligne) conditions with apparent discoloration ("lega color"), the text advises that for severe cases, one should employ caustic substances specifically targeting ('prop') those areas where lesions or ulcers are present and potentially infected.

At present not certain whether post-repair, any further separation (potential infection or additional injury) will occur while treating the penis's prepuce; hence vigilance is necessary throughout treatment.
Even examine the testicles and foreskin blackness and hardening upon them; therefore cover up all that has already darkened or is about to corrupt, as well as what's already been spoiled—apply liniments on this affected area with freshly ground rice flour mixed with honey and crushed herbs.

The translation of the sentence about childbirth and care for those who are circumcised might go as follows:
Circumcision is not a solution for continuity with other diseases: however, if it belongs to our operation and from our will, and because of that in children, we must assign them to the better healing process using gentler methods.
So it is said that ancient times did not practice castration among free men, as they do not use leather and silk in their clothes, but only acquire them through experiment; hence, they abandon the majority of artisans and barbarians to perform circumcision and mundification using linen cloths for penises and hala (flesh glue) from unguent.

Here's an

Additionally, mucus (or secretions) flows along thin membranes ('veils'), while thread-like particles descend into the sand below. He also describes that for each cycle of evaporation within the bladder—similar to how urine is expelled during excretion—a small amount condenses and forms crystallized deposits on top."

This could imply an observation of changes in bodily fluids around this region—potentially relating symptoms such as discomfort due to acidity (using "tart" metapthyically for pain). The text likely belongs to a broader discussion on abdominal issues, possibly including hernias and their associated
And because of this humoral imbalance that occurs in the liver causing a hernia, it is discharged from those places and some are expelled by striking points on the liver itself.
This moisture has motes of colors; whether it is turning to lemon or vinrose (a shade between yellow and red), black dirt, or milky white, all these are what we have more of.

If the moisture is in the patient' extraneous membrane, then it becomes an abscess and thus he/she considers this to be another body (i.e., organ).
If moisture is between the navel and the white line of the umbilicus (the round ligament in females), touch it gently with one' extrusion.
When you wish to gain knowledge of the color of humidity, look for the moisture that has entered and caused this condition; then observe the place where it resides within your body afterward—the indication or sign comes from there, according to what enters into its presence.

So say that the effluvia enters into the joints where muscles are attached and causes pain for these reasons: either because of acute excess fluid being discharged from the muscles, or due to impact/strike.

And when it is an ulcerated lesion that has blackened and does not center itself in its place,
Here are the translations for each line of text:
May it be known that when the inflammation of stones is caused by an abscess, they are dispersed upon compressing that stone with these gloves; and do not touch what you have touched.
May that which is caused by inflammation of a vein not be scattered about it; let the compression take place on these matters.
And it is possible that this specific occurrence affects the joint and other bones; therefore, you must insert the catheter of the urethra into the parts below (the genital area), position them at these sections, extract the chalice white piece out (potentially referring to a sample or stone within the urinary system), disassemble the sieve supports, untie and inspect those connectors you have just detached; for each part of this entire procedure.
Therefore, if it is that flesh has already hardened in those fats, then you must extract the fat and introduce it here.
If there is an attachment within any cause of cholera or between the bays (vessels), then you must release all that attachment and insert it through a round incision.
If the cause of sticking is meat present in that location behind it, then insert all you find here and extract with what we have taken together.

There is not a cause from the intestines to the intestines within itself; and if there are causes found, they are few in number, returning at all hours (translation focuses on internal issues with potential multiple minor triggers throughout various times). The statement suggests that often no clear underlying reason can be pinpointed for disrufort or pain from one's own intestines to themselves. It also indicates a belief held by medieval medical practitioners about
If the time continues, it's necessary to make an incision in the cistern within which you must insert your sponge; and this dampness of the wet membrane that is present when pain occurs at our current hour herein (cistern being a water reservoir or bladder), causes extension thereof, thereby stretching out where we place it. To alleviate both the area affected by puncturing as well as its localization and position through which you insert your hands, softening what has been extended due to moisture (cistern membrane). The text appears to be discussing medical treatment for conditions related to internal pressure or inflammation possibly connected with urinary functions.

The treatment for the hardening of seminal vesicles appears in volume LXVIII (168) of "De Mollificatio,
The seminal vesicles in males are softened through massage after the veins between them have been made supple; and it is recommended to follow this practice regularly for health benefits according to ancient medical texts discussing male reproductive treatments such as "De Mollificatio.
Therefore, it is necessary for him who attends the care of himself that has seminal vesicles affected by hardening according to his own way—making sure all around where softened must rest on its natural canal; and adjust both lips as needed with a stitch (suture). This instruction likely refers to self-care practices or perhaps medical procedures for addressing conditions like maldistribution of fluids within the seminal vesicles, which may have been recommended in historical texts focusing on male reproductive health.
If you wish to include in the treatment three or four cookings (simultaneous heating sessions) and apply a firm stitch, this might refer to an intensified therapeutic approach involving repeated application of heat therapy followed by surgical intervention for softening hardened seminal vesicles as indicated in traditional medical literature. This could involve the use of hot compresses or baths

The second measure motivates us to resort to castration from other animals as necessary provisions for our bodies at that time if needed, just like with horses and oxen or pigs.
And so it is said that castration causes pain in two ways: either through draw (atriction), or by creating a tear of the segment (rupture).
When it is caused by inward dragging, the way of treatment we shall make is to place the beast'se tail within until our patient's body parts become soft and elastic so that they hang down naturally. Return those in your hand so that they become solutions and do not appear suddenly when touched.

Necessary cause is that the matrona exposes the figure of childbirth in her abdomen out of necessity, and when she urinates at parts where blood appears after delivery, it's because there comes a fluid over which lies on her body, leading to its expulsion; hurry up with labor cleaning post-childbirth. Here you understand that this part is secondarily the figure natural for childbirth (after menstruation), and washing takes place above the head of such individual where another woman or suspended belly button hangs from her body.
So when you turn those legs of the patient, it's so that their belly is compressed to prevent the embryo from expulsion while giving them a second touch, and they are cleaned with good purification methods.

If the head of the fetus is large, or if there are contractions in childbirth, or water that has been adjusted at the top of the uterus intrudes between the cervical spines and opening, then extract it with an instrument called "alundat," which will come into forms for use on other instruments to be applied here.
It seems that the text is from an old medical treatise discussing remedies for various conditions using terminologies and references common in medieval European medicine, which makes it challenging due to archaic language usage combined with multiple linguistic influences (Latin-like structures with traces of Italian, Spanish, and French). Here's the translation:
If the head is sick and compressed by the shoulder blade, then it has been opened into where the moisture that'se in the chest has become released.
If it does not become complicated and if you obey the treatment, then proceed with healing as quickly as is within your power.
If there are holes in the stomach or it is bloated and swolthy within (the abdomen), then you must pierce that which contains the moisture inside (it).
If it is about your feet, then the attendant of yours (caregiver) is gentle and their direction to your mouth is also gentle.
May it be that you have squeezed the belly and chest, wherein you will hold your hand wrapped around what has been removed from above, allowing the fluid to flow within those areas.
If other members are also numb and return the head; if the patient'se mouth is stuffed (possibly with food or vomit), insert it into their lower belly region nowhere near this place that we have touched upon before, secure these in their mouths using a spoon/spoons herein.
If the mother'thy mouth is constricted by an apastema and it hurts her, do not cover her further; above all, administer for causes of wet greasy humor. Embrace liniments; and follow the patient in waters that soften and moisten.
If it is on the patient' extramammary (outside of their chest), and if possible, then use a sharp tool: and administer what we have mentioned earlier for its treatment in life.
If it is not possible, then be inserted into pillows and extracted.
When there is no cause found in the secondary (or underlying).
When you have completed your treatment as mentioned for the puncture wounds that were inflicted by the mother, then administer what we discussed about their healing in these tightly bandaged injuries.
If you experience a flow of pus, then direct it into precise and dry waters, and administer the other treatment.
And there appeared before the focus another pregnant woman inside her womb, and placed that other baby over it; this is also dead, which was already in its belly. Occurred an ulcer for too long on the patient's coccyx; and when it opens up where there was excessive fluid accumulation, they begin to drag their legs.
And when he has called for care and treatment of him/her for long times, their child is not yet fully formed or matured.

If not, then you take a warm bath and make incisions into the covering with these herbs: mint leaves for mouth care (possibly to soothe or cleanse), rosemary as calamint which can have expectorant properties, possibly used here also as an anti-inflammatory agent. Add sage leaf known for its purifying effects and juniper berries that may help with urinary conditions; fennel seeds might be included to aid digestion or relieve gas symptoms associated with constipation. All these herbs or some of them are submerged in water within the wave, and rests upon the flame.
Apply pressure with a funnel in the mouth of the woman, and insert that into where the phlegm accumulates within her chest cavity.

May you not seek to escape this treatment and if necessary give command for the matrona (midwife) to immerse her left hand in sesame or milled olive oil, then insert that into the womb with caution so it does not disturb the second fetus inside. If she is pregnant again, place your hands accordingly as recommended previously and when you find the second baby, extract them slowly through dilatation until there's no risk of tearing due to strong contractions from labor pains. Between the right and left sides of the body are easily palpable areas for examination or relief.
If the mother'se mouth is constricted, we have already prepared the cautery and medicinal application of water from streams or wells infused with herbs.

It is an opening or obstruction (fistula/motility issue).
When that ancient connection is dry and white due to moisture or slight inflammation of these ulcers, some measures are taken from them.
Those penetrating things are guarded against so that it may come out and by the excretion or efflux movement; some of them even utilize an exit device for this purpose, and others suffer from these as they enter into their bodies.
From those cysts occasionally present within the bladder space and entering into the body of the uterus, they also enter through the junction of the hernia and the neck of the uterus; this is what comes from them.
When the clyster (enema) that both penetrates and does not penetrate enters into the rectum, it is because you insert your thief (tube) into the rectum, and apply a subtle force or iron within the fistula when there's no tendernthy.
If in that tightness you feel the attempt undernethy or within those horsehair pads wherein you sense the attempted effort,
If you do not feel that in it all or none of the causes for obstruction nor worms nor windiness are present, as we have said beforehand, then understand that these things cannot penetrate and thus attend to your care accordingly.
When the fistula penetrates into the bladder or the prostate, it signifies illness and requires removal of its fluid to ensure that this location becomes medicine'dictated by healing needs.
May it be that something penetrates the joint between the thighs or enters the bone and causes pain throughout the circuit, then this person's name is who tries to enter here if they do not have an obstruction within the bone, which will experience immediate relief; and such treatment cannot be used in medicine nor consolidated with bandages.

Or you may proceed to cauterize according to what has preceded in the process of cauterization. Return that particular care for it until they are healed.

When they become ancient and no longer effective in that healing method, you must apply these treatments: make holes with sponge (or use your ointment) on the wet points where pus has formed underneath them to prevent further conglomeration; then handle those wounds properly. (Note: The translation seeks to convey a medieval medical practice of managing old remedies and draining abscesses, with an emphasis on intervention timing based on fluid presence.)
You have to apply these remedies where the vigorous purulent drainage occurs and are still raw, with proper care afterwards for them that heal initially (Note: The translation reflects an approach in medieval medicine focusing on timely application of treatments at sites of acute inflammation or pus production).
It's essential in healing such wounds/ulcers (Note: The translation outlines the importance of treating injuries or ulcers using materials like lint and suggests specific body regions as primary sites for pain that require attention). This emphasizes areas often affected by trauma, which commonly include limbs near joints where deformities can be more noticeable. It speaks to a holistic treatment approach common in medieval medicine focusing on wound care using simple materials like lint and the understanding of symptoms based on their appearance – for instance, redness could indicate inflammation or potential underlying issues that need addressing by an attentive healer (Note: The translation delves into a more nuanced aspect often found in medieval medical texts where

And thus the best intervention is hereby directed, as in that place it's difficult to reduce the hernia, just like with these specialized organs mentioned beforehand.
You understand that the abdomen is divided into four quadrants (chest-top right, left side below chest, top left above waist and bottom right), where wounds can be treated with common stitches appropriate for other diseases of the body.
Two other stitches communicate with each other or themselves in the abdominal seam; possibly even more directly within this intestinal stitch itself.
In English line by line translation of the medieval medical treatise text provided:
So when the child is small and suffers from a cause of the hernia, it becomes difficult to reduce that; either because of their diminutive size or due to inflation caused by cold air:
When the water arrives (it flows into), then when you cut that which is submerged in a moist cloth alone or squirming in the water while holding it, and using mustard seed, pepper, and liniments applied to where the inflammation is contained within.
And when there are some measures taken whereupon healing has begun in which water alone can resolve the inflammation.
And when the inflammation is resolved, then moisten the intestine in the water where it was previously elevated and with a little cause; thus, they ease the internal organ of the patient.

And when the patient'thy swelling increases and the intestine comes out through it, then its reduction should be done according to his body shape in its proper place if possible thereon; but four times better is that than not doing so at all.
When the disruption is wide open and located in the lower part of the abdomen, where you make the hernia protrude on their thighs, and place cushions under them; if it's below the belly, then put your head down and position pillows at that area.
If the disruption is in one of the parts of the belly, then immediately pause your understanding and consideration for so that the offspring remains where it belongs.
And when you manage (or treat) this fluid in large or small abscesses,
In small pains, pause what you have prepared for it, and make sure the minister is between your two most affected areas; this tongue holds disruption in its entirety within one' extranum (the patient), adjusting their lips to that which caused some sort of seam or stitch.

And where the needle is not fixed in any of the patient' extraneous parts but rather held within them to prevent meat from being pierced and grease (fat) coming out, thus maintaining its solidification.
And they are not sewn long for that flesh may have a chance of healing.
Here comes the first source sentence for translation:
These surgical instruments contain needles in a manner suitable for small wounds; all that is needed for their stitching are either one of these needles or surrounding threads.
May the second stitch be common: and it is that you insert needles into the four limbs' extremities, from the chest to both legs, using an aglet (pointed instrument) with finesse and thickness.
When the needle is inserted into these four extremities (hands and feet), reduce the sharp instrument of that surgeon' extricated part, to make sure that the wound cavity rises upwards with its divided parts towards above ground level, so that suturing can occur as strong cloth threads underneath it.
When there is a pause between any of its stitches for the size of the main part of that wound,
This stitch knows how men behave.
E has made such a stitch that the child who was sick in his belly, where there was an intestinal disruption of one palm' extrusion from its place within two hands span (4 hours), and with this you have reduced said prolapse; thus:

So when the needle enters into the coccyx and in that area you make straight and long stitches throughout all of it, and lay down your hand where you have inserted the needle; then insert the other end of the thread from the parted parts to the part already entered.
When you have caused that infiltration there, then cause another filing between the extreme parts of this body segment here and there; let the external cavity where the cyst is located come into play nowhere else but to facilitate insertion at the other extremity of the said body part.
When your insertion goes into that place, where it enters the cavity at the end of its location within you, therein all will enter together.
Here begins the procedure from this place on the side of the body and takes that away at the other end, where it is located in relation to another limb mentioned hereinabove, inserting into that joint pin thereof; then withdraws said pins from that same joint and positions them within that joint alongside the part described above.
Here comes the first sentence to translate: And apply another poultice and another thereof within what you have applied so far, according to that which has been shown hereinbefore.
The sum of this suture technique is that you sew the skin where hairs are grown (where they grow their fur), making a stitch on the part of the extremity of the tail, and leave it so until it heals completely.
May the second kind of suture proper to you is what Guiliel says and recommends for him; it'suply all parts that are cut by medicine when they make such an incision, according to nature fitting each part appropriately with its corresponding piece from himself or another person. Apply the extremity (limb end) of one yourself and match it with the opposite limb extremity on themself/another; this is what you do whenever needed as per Guiliel's recommendation.
Here is the translation line by line:
Here the joints are rotated and cold humors infiltrate from one division within the body into another opposite partition on either side of the limb, these divisions being referred to as hernias or inguinal areas (thigh region). In this sentence:
This stitching is better than ordinary sewing and it's the kind of which memory recalls.
This is the speech of Gallienus (or Avitianus as he was also known).
May you also insert the needle into these two pins for a belt or girdle, and start with inserting your needle here where it is needed (into other stitches that are already made on those parts of the body), forcing the thread to enter through them.
When you understand that a disturbance occurs in the abdominal area of the womb (uterus), it is much more difficult to stitch here than at other parts of the womb.
May the method of medicine for infants be judged by other diseases.
The cause is when you continue the recent work on their sacred sanctum downstream where the air has altered that condition, and return the intestine or hernia back to its cavity; afterward pause over that skint tissue which they hold in place with their hands.
If the air has altered the humors and causes pains in these places, which you are currently entering with this wax seal where your presence is felt, then harden and bandage those fields; care for that illness as if it were one of other diseases within which healing occurs.
May you not have medicines present at this moment; if absent, pause here for a while until dawn begins and continue as long as today with what I teach you, provided that your stomach does not reject other remedies in their proper arrangements when pestilences are simple.

If you feel pain or putrefaction in your bowels, they worsen day by day; and if the obstruction has reached the intestine and it is causing a protruding passage within its cavity, then:
Being aware that what is from a large intestine (budel gross) heals quickly, whereas what remains in the small intestines takes longer to recover; this demonstrates their differences in function and recuperation speed.
It is difficult for the intestine which doctors call "gegunu" to receive healing that comes from outside; and this difficulty arises because of:
If what you process from the feces is fabric (i.soft excrement), then obtain it immediately and cut that piece according to your sharpness of understanding, which will aid in reducing swollen joints overall.
If space has passed and black or dark substance (likely blood clots) is present in the area that was discolored by it, then press firmly on that faithful spot to make the flow of bile return into its channel within the vessels where veins and arteries are located.
Here you position the fluid that is elsewhere another thread of this sinew, and place two extremities of the hanging limb from the lower part just outside the doorway where it should be led away by means of removal through a net or bracelet used for catching.
Remember when pus accumulates in the bubble (abscess).
When there is a disruption in the intestine and it's considered small (petite), it may be restored with cold water at home, so that you can alleviate what was causing pain deep inside his abdomen; for he had an old worm infestation and fistula disease within the seventh part of the stomach area. The issue is related to both digestion (percussio de lansa) and windiness/restlessness (ventositat).
And now you apply the treatment of him who has not been confirmed in his healing, may it subtly alleviate that which is within whose focus and location restoration becomes solidified.

If the bones are not damaged and continue into each other, it is at that joint or in between them; there you find all of the body' extraneous parts together with their flesh—and take pause here, and apply a saw to where continuation occurs first within this connection. Herein lies an ongoing division (between bones), which indicates damage inside continued connections: thus use your sword at that spot immediately upon discovering such continuous joint damages or fractures.
Whereas in the location of decay there is a small instrument as we have mentioned.
If decay is in the joint, incise that corrupted joint, and saw away from which it continues to another part of the body.

From joints of limbs and bone edges;
Limbs are swolthy or due to internal/external causes, or if treating that corruption with these medicines does not relieve it, sometimes the disease progresses in a limb where no cause is perceived; hence you insert said limb into water (the bath) so malady can escape and avoid death by accident or greater damage caused to the member.

The cause is that when the swelling comes into your abdomen with you during fever on days of Yore IV throughout entirety, then take care as directed in bone study today at noon.
If it is in the summer days, then cover your head from morning until evening when your skin becomes rotten due to sweat and you are prone to falling ill as recommended.
If the fracture has already reached the brain' extranous covering (panniculus), and it is broken into small pieces and rubbed together, according to what you recommend for this case.
When you raise the head of the patient suffering from flatulence (malady), and observe over their shoulder bone according to customary practice and your ability, so that they are lying on top of it.
If you want to detect the bone fracture and apply poultice of sanction or ulceration cauterization, then immediately stand by it with water that covers them, placing moistened linens in its place until they rest, ensuring dryness of any flow from the wound; begin treatment at the site of the bone fracture and within your body.
And it is second in one of two methods for operation.

The provided Latin-influenced text appears as follows when translated line by line
From this single Latin phrase, we can interpret the translation to English: "Repair of the jawbone when broken." This sentence directly refers to some form
When the jawbone is broken and the break does not involve both parts (teeth), if it'sinverted alone without displacement into two pieces curved towards each division of teeth, then its healing will be softening or granulation tissue formation. This sentence from a medieval medical treatise describes how to assess certain types of fractures in the jawbone and predicts that simple breaks with some misalignment might lead not necessarily to complete displacement but rather result in softer forms of healing such as new, delicate connective tissue growth or softening. Here we can see medieval doctors using basic anatomical knowledge combined with their observations about how the body repairs itself when faced with trauma like a broken jaw
Upon this understanding that if the break is at one of three points (incisors), place your left tongue into the mouth where bone breaks, and in case it's on the right jawbone, insert there said tongue; then push with what part remains after cleaning out debris from both sides. In this way facilitate that fragmented portion to reunite itself at its original position while also aiding another remaining piece of your own mandible (left or right) which has been fractured off as well, helping it back into place alongside the broken part in question within one's mouth for healing and repair. Here medieval doctors suggest practical steps using tongue movements to align teeth fragments during their natural repositioning phase after a jawbone injury—a primitive form of dental occlusal adjustment before modern orthodontics existed, guided by the body’s innate response mechanisms following trauma.
If the jawbone is separated into two parts, then cover it with extension of bone segments inside until possible for its restoration (healing).
If you have constriction of the teeth leading to disruption (possibly referring to dental issues), tighten those from which you hope will break through the silver or gold filament or thread; and pause over the broken jawbone, as well as both layers of your cloth covering it, including a single strand length matching that of the patient's chin. Secure this with what is already draped (possibly referring to some form of dressing), so long as it does not get destroyed in its application or arrangement according to how you are dressed and equipped for treatment.
When commanded by the malady (illness), let it rest and find peace, and cease from consuming what is swallowed like lions.
If you have an altered figure due to any malady, then touch your body and loosen that which has become distorted by today'thy day; accordingly correct what is already changed from thee and apply thine pommade made of wine, albumen (egg white), or flour dough. Place the ointment on thy affected area while keeping pressure with a lambdown wool pad.
And when that bandage is placed and positioned on him/her, the bone structure remains unaltered, so long as he/she does not enter it while recovering from a healthy and strong fracture; this injury will be straightened out in three days.
If another purge occurs as an abscess (causing a draining of the accumulated fluids), then administer what we have discussed earlier for this condition inside the patient until healed, and thus cure that ulceration.
If the fracture is of bone (implied by "plagua," which means dirt or clay, often used metapthyically for something unhealthy in medical contexts), consider whether it is separated from or displaced within the bone; then take care that those fragments are returned to where they belong inside the body as needed during its condition.
If the patient' extrusion is wet, then increase it according to the amount you need at the surgeon (flebomast or vascular specialist).
When you have removed those satagias (probably a type of treatment or garment), and there is no more residue remaining from them, then anoint the area with oil if it's wide; otherwise, rest on one of the supports that are designated for this purpose, until healed.

When returning the sternum (referred to here as 'capitol') after it has been lifted, possibly referring to a medical procedure or physical assessment related to
When walking constantly (presumably a patient's regular activity), the sternum is broken from exertion by one of its muscles; that fracture will be classified into one of three categories/grades or types, according to medical standards for such injuries at the time. The term "manieyras" implies there are different levels or ways this injury can manifest and would typically relate to severity grading in a medieval context
When the sternum is broken (broken or separated), it's not possible in this life to repair itself ('restore'); if you have blood at home, administer that there and restore yourself back; but when such a breakage happens where no remedies are available domestically, recovery may be difficult ('hard') here on earth (in the material world); or it's possible in some cases to heal by itself without medical intervention. This implies various scenarios for self-healing versus reliance on home remedies and possibly professional care if one is unavailable locally ("domestically"). The term "leugier" suggests a belief that the body can initiate its own repair mechanisms, while acknowledging limitations when external resources are not accessible. It reflects an understanding of self-healing potential alongside traditional healing practices in medieval
When the breakage occurs in such a way that two ministers (likely referring to medical attendants or practitioners) are present, one takes hold of it with his hands ('tunga adjutori'), supporting and stabilizing the broken sternum ("extend col"), while the other stret trodes on this area. This indicates an early form of joint immobilization technique used in emergency care before advanced medical procedures were developed—using available helpers to provide temporary support for injury management until proper healing or further treatment can occur, even without specialized equipment that might have been mentioned elsewhere but is not present here ("quan es trencada la furcula").

If the fracture is in the parts afar off, then cease to press down on one stela and another from that parting upon your palm so that it becomes covered and tight; also pause the constriction, as you turn over (or rotate) your hand between the fingers attached at the joint.
If you feel pain in the leg of your patient due to their fall on footwear, and if it is necessary for treatment: crush the bone gently with a stone held at the palm'supinator muscle (a small hand muscle), pausing every four times until the fracture is elevated above ground level so that there’s no rattling sound.
May it be so if the fracture is in any of those places (hip joint, sacroiliac joint, auricular region, or ankle), as here before with this one; or paused thereon for a while longer, which would be better; pause over that small stone they have placed on their foot where we had them earlier.
Consider when you are in the process of restoration, and take care with that application for a poultice or counter-application — as part of the treatment procedure— according to what has been narrated about it (the cause).
Given that this text is from an ancient medical treatise with influ
The restoration of a pelvic bone fracture involves several steps and considerations:
The bones of the knee have been worn down and it is declared according to what has become in the waking state below, near/by the bedside.
The restoration of him is done so that the ligament tightens over the fracture and another bandage shortly afterward presses down on his stomach and face.
Extend the minister fully according to the quality when the fracture is in the bone'se location of rest.
If it is necessary for the ligament of the knee to be drawn tight at the joint'setup (the area where bones meet), then draw up this specific bandage close around that part so that when you extend your limb, both bands will keep everything in place and prevent injury.
And if the dislocation is proper to bone inflammation (arthritis), then make it with sinew appropriate for setting back in place of the joints immediately and increase its extension towards the parts where delay may cause more damage or dysfunction.
Here the doctor immobilizes one of the patient'se lower limbs below where you reduce that second part until it is in its natural shape and alignment; provided there are spasms or stiffness, apply plaster and strictures to this injured member not undergoing amputation. If there is inflammation in the wound, then you should apply that for several days until the abscess subsides, and return to your care routine.
The contracture of him is painful: cover that encases the fracture with a hard bandage, folding it twice or thrice daily, and reduce its excess; also wrap around what enters into the calf and thigh area until reaching up to the ankle bone and groin.
E insinuate long pin between the thigh and buttock as provided by the dress of those parts above their joints, inserting fingers from the upper part into the pins so that any excess beyond the band is turned over to it.
Return your hand over the area of that cracked bone and place a stone pillar on top of the shoulder blade' extrication or immobilization was done for this fractured limb, with additional support placed directly onto the scapula as well.
Return and fill the spaces between the sheet (drapery) and thighs with wool pelts to ensure that bleeding is stopped/clotted off.
Here begins the tightening of a bandage from where the bone is broken into three or four layers around the location of the break, and as you move away from the site of the fracture, your tension on the bandage decreases, and it becomes lighter.
Return them to the parts of their body where they entered through the feet'dicts (thigh or crotch area), and gently massage those limbs with tweezers from another part, so that it does not come out on its own again.
Here comes the translation:
If there is pain in the bone of which you have touched, then engage that second one if possible to it; and otherwise press upon it firmly and cure with what has been used previously for its recollection within so long as healed.
And in some cases this break of the hip is more painful than when they have been adjusted with our devices here at the arm (or brace).
Even in the act of restoring him like this manner, you will not heal the hindered gait of the patient; and if it is restored alone, another cushion must be applied on top, for that limb which has just been tightened up still needs to walk.
E understand that the thigh is tight in up to forty days or a few months and all of this depends on the complexity of the conditions and other dispositions.
Capitolo XV.
Restoration of the dislocation of the shoulder joint.
Be aware that a crack in the shoulder joint of the dead can be cured by repeated massages with oil.
If you break the bone, it is not simply a crack or dislocation of their parts; rather, they are considered as worms and bugs within them, which altogether forms their sensation.
The restoration of the patient is to be done using water that has been broken up from their parts, added and conjoined according as it can be by hand or with ease for crafting purposes.
Return an ointment and rest on that round stone if you find yourself lacking it; apply firm pressure above to prevent the flow of humidity from there.

When a child breaks their bones, it's time for the healing restaurant to open its doors and begin repairing them:
With such an injury to the bone that you are healing for, and mainly if your arm or assistant's limb is greatly swollen like yours, it resembles someone whose arms and feet have been cut out; therefore, should these conditions be within your testimony as a practitioner having performed amputation on them.
If the child vomits sickness, then you must hold them in rest and grind over their abdomen until they have passed up whatever is causing it if there'supreasing cause remains on its own.
When beginning to repair the fracture on that day, do not extend it further unless an infection occurs (apostema).
If you cauterize the ulcer (apostema), then heal it within one day as long as the ulcer recedes, and do not touch or approach again on the third day after its full recovery; otherwise, bad accidents may occur.
If the bone is broken and protrudes above the neck (the area where the skull meets the spine), then, in order to reduce it and make its position more comfortable for you as well as preventing a little movement or extension of that body part, do so with your hands.

Therefore, a physician must remove these three or four at the quantity needed for treatment during bone healing.

May joint stiffness and nodules be recent, the ones that are encysted in water where their hips are located; they should include mallow leaves and thistle flowers (and others), similar to these preparations used as poultices when applied directly or wrapped with grease of linseed oil/olive from cumin seeds. Or if there is a preference for the jelly made from thistle juice, then apply it similarly; or where fats are found in mustard seeds and crushed wheat bran (and others), used as ointments on these areas—these are remedies that consolidate with herbs of similar appearance.
Some pills are dissolved by continuous exposure to heat and applied throughout the entire body at all times.
Might tortuosity arise at this time and be painful and become a stone that necessitates care with iron hooks, if the patient's discharge under their knees is continued and the bone dissolution persists further into these joints, and excess fluid beyond what was produced by those same stones accumulates in them, which will then be easily managed here through study and application.

So dislocated the jaws if not tightened; and this displacement of both is considered as follows: either it's a minor shift from their respective locations with just slight adjustment needed for relief, or complete dislocation and complex cases where they are fully dislocated until being mollified at the joint juncture. Here, saliva comes out due to mouth opening by this displacement; hence tongue is wrapped in its own language so that it cannot retain said secretion nor open the mouth further as a result of such conditioning.

The bones of the body are dislocated in some instances (referring to joints), and reduction is easier here than at other joints; however, if such a displacement occurs quickly or leads to an apoplectic condition where there's spontaneous clotting within the affected area due to inflammation around it—which would imply acute pain management issues alongside potential complications like compartment syndrome that can arise rapidly after dislocation and require immediate medical attention.
The reduction of the dislocation is that you halt the joint' extrusion over a table and have the assistant extend it outward from there; while the doctor or palm rests upon the imminent juncture, pushing it back into its place.
Even if it is considered that the palm rests on her abdomen, then have their thigh pushed up against each other under a table for extension and reduction; and if dislocation precedes, place them in such position as to keep the mother' extrinsicly above this intersection point of the doctor.
And if it returns shortly afterward, all is well; but if not, that part becomes inflamed and must be bound tightly to prevent its spread within the next few days.
May the joint according to its curvature; and there is no cause in the belly, but it is soothed and cannot have any more causes; you understand that the nerves are twisted or knotted, and only when using cautery on your body can you provide a reason for this.

From the treatment of displacement injuries, this line seems to be written in a language that has influences from Latin and Romance languages
Some movements have caused all joints to become misaligned (dislocated). This translation attempts to convey the meaning of "algumas vezes as articulações das mãos são des
When a joint of yours is dislocated from either the back or front side of your palm (hand), take hold and attempt to put it back in place yourself; however, be cautious as this may not resolve the issue completely on its own: return with care because you might need professional medical intervention. This translation attempts to convey a warning about attempting self-treatment for dislocations without proper training or equipment – emphasizing that such actions could potentially cause more harm and underscoring the importance of seeking qualified help from healthcare providers when dealing with
Support (or stabilize) the head of your body and suspend it where you have experienced displacement; do not attempt to move this area for two days: rest is crucial in preventing further injury during the initial stages following a dislocation until medical assessment can be provided. This translation advises on immediate post-dislocation care, suggesting immobilization as an essential step
Support and extend that area until it is properly positioned on its own today: implying the need for sustained immobilization of affected limb(s) till they are back in proper alignment, ideally under a medical professional'thy guidance to ensure accurate healing conditions without causing
When not observed by others (or when there's nobody around), hold that part and do so consistently during the day and night without letting it slip or engaging in movement, then observe for several days: this line suggests a need to keep an affected area stable continuously until healing is apparent. However, caution should be exercised as prolonged immobilization can have negative consequences such as muscle atrophy; therefore professional medical advice would typically recommend periodic reassessment and gradual introduction of movement or therapy once the initial stabilizing period has passed to avoid complications like decreased range of motion. This
When it seems like water (indicating the presence of excess fluid or humidity), if dislocated in the belly, take that to where the first operation is performed and apply as much water there until healed.
When it seems like fluid (likely blood or some other bodily fluid) accumulates at the joints, especially when displaced from elsewhere in the body.
Given that "Capitol" does not provide any contextual
The phrase in question appears to be related to the treatment of vertebral misalignments, likely from a medical or chiropractic perspective as indicated by terms such
When any of the vertebrae in your back or neck become dislocated and move to another location within the body; when this happens, it is not treatable at that moment because these displaced discs (referred to as "spondils" here) have shifted into a dangerous position where they could potentially cause more severe health issues. In such cases of mortal threat due to misalignment ("mort se coyta al malaute"), urgent medical intervention is required, typically involving spinal surgery or similar procedures rather than chiropractic adjustments which are not advisable in these
The statement outlines that in cases where there is an unsanctioned (or involuntary) release of the spinal misalignment, it cannot be held back by will alone; rather, measures must consistently strengthen and support one's limbs or shoulders—either individually or together as a pair. Further adjustments may also involve returning displaced vertebrae to their proper place within the body (noting that this is done in four stages).
So that it is swollen behind and its color has changed (darkened).
May the cure for him be that you will consider if the yellow humoral discharge of childhood is not a cure or treatment for all.
May return to the proper practice through eloquent conversation, which may bring back what was lost; they have already opened up from where it is withdrazymed away due to excess and brought forth various tools of that place for examination and relief thereof.
From those it is not healed except for that which you apply directly there, and with what fluid they say should be used.
It is that the swelling extends over the patient'thy face and neck due to excess fluid in the stomach being pushed upwards, preventing it from entering into their eyes.
Place a straight staff upright on the ground at the patient' extrémity of their limb below the head, and another axe towards their feet in the other extreme of the body.
The minister grips the staff and does not leave it in a hole; another minister holds on to that form as well.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
Here comes the translation:
The doctor places their hands on the spine for strength, or rests upon one of those tables and adjusts his/her own weight within where they return, which helps to stabilize them as well:
If it does not return by this method, take a table of which the length or width is three feet, and carve into the wall where we mentioned that there should be an opening for the malady within its extreme limit. Here comes the first source sentence to translate: "Apply pressure on the vertebra' extramargin and let the doctor hold your feet on the other extremity, so that the spondylosis is compressed and returns to its place.
If you wish to turn the which has been revolved above your head; and you must remain on your back with the end of the malady's staff at the lower part of your thigh, within whose lengths are two that each is as long as a forearm, and where they meet forms three equal parts (each one being approximately the length of an outstretched hand), then it has already been done in some way between any of those staves; and therein every part rests firmly on earth so you will not be gouty.
And if a staff is given in which it turns between the two arms of each stick, and so continues as before with both sticks turned alternately over their axes.
In the limb there is a defect where it forms its staff, whose length equals that of a hand dipped in water and twisted; similarly shaped are the other two staves.
Here is the line-bydependent translation:
Each one of you must take turns and hold the back in place while I adjust it according to what we have discussed.
And apply that the spine has returned, and it is swolthy with hardened excrement in the bladder; place plaster over this blockage of stone within the chair's frame where its length corresponds to three fingers or an arm span away from you, enough pressure applied will dislodge the location of the stones.
Return its bandage as previously mentioned and place it under the belly where sustenance subtly enters for healing.
If there is any likelihood in the place of healing during rest (the end of treatment), then it has been recommended that medicines be used to moisten and cleanse for a long time, which have been advised; and they are already being applied at that location with a layer of lead.

Capitol XXVII. (The Roman numeral "XXVII
Of hock joint dislocation care. (This translates the line into English, where 'anca'
You understand that the hock joint and the knee are not bound together but can only be dislocated so much without injuring other smaller body parts' connections, which would hurt you elsewhere in your body as well if damaged. (Here I have translated each phrase while trying to maintain a medieval medical tone.)
The hock joint is displaced according to four movements: it can be out of place at the knee parts forward or backward, sideways left and right from its natural position, above (ante), or below (postero). This translation attempts to convey medical instructions for assessing a dislocated ankle in terms that would resonate with medieval understandings while using terminologies reminiscent of their lexicon.
Primarily it is out of place at the knee joints and scarcely so at those behind or ahead (of its natural position). This further translation delineates how most commonly ankle dislocations involve movements related to knees, hinting again towards their medieval medical context. The language here mirrors technical descriptions
The name of the displacement at knee joints is when you adjust the hock screw on its thigh bone to that which has been dislocated in it; place long and press hard until out, so much as from what was healthy (natural position), then with a small tool or instrument used for binding tightly around body parts where movement must be limited—the location of the device holding down your tongue by means of anaplastic restraint. This translation attempts to convey instructions on addressing knee joint dislocations, referencing therapeutic techniques like 'hock screw' (presumably a medieval osteal fixation tool) and using language that would have been understood in the context of their medical practices at the time—using terms such as "tongue binding" for immobilization. It also references concepts likely familiar to them, which include manual repositioning ('adjust') with tools or instruments (perhaps akin to modern orthopedic hardware).
The translation of each line into English is as follows:
E senhal of that to which you have caused dislocation at the moment when it expands beneath the cushion secondly completed, may nottheless still double its pain wherein is located now; and since urine retention occurs in him/her along with swelling (indicating a possible lymphedema or fluid accumulation due to injury), his/her walking will be on tiptoes.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
May reduction of these spices for this dislocation is what you consider, and as the dislocation is old and ancient, it has already been addressed by your current administration here at Rome according to its disposition; hence there will be no more treatment in that regard. And consequently, we shall not perform further suppository treatments.
In the area where dislocation occurred recently and it is one of the four species of dislocation, then turn your head to realign that joint with those parts forward and backward, as well as right and left sides; once this returns strength will be regained without needing other treatments.
Mayhaps, if it does not return in this manner, then the preparations you've made should be strengthened and extended to where they were placed earlier today; or similarly apply them on their hands/feet as well, extending from below upwards onto these limbs now. Another servant expands what has been applied beneath those legs above here (using a cushion previously mentioned), ensuring the application reaches all over that leg area—and another attends to moisturizing and caring for their hands with gentle means; while firm pressure is maintained by an assistant on top of where these limbs join, providing additional support.
Where there is extension from the neck down to the shoulder joint or between the thoracic vertebrae and lumbar vertebrae:
And if it is that extension of all these in one rest within which the malady rises to its earthly body and begins to fall, then...
This particular type of extension is common throughout all four (Italian/Spanish). The translated text line by line would be in English as follows:
So if the displacement returns with water that we have mentioned, heal herbs are needed; otherwise, it is necessary for all special waters required by their treatment.
In the reduction of themselves, when dislocated, and their dislocation is at joints, so that the hernia rests on its own chest; and pause the ligaments above the knee area where between the head of the thigh and the place to which it has been thrown downward; and extend the ligament in the part belonging to the shoulder blade towards the topmost part separated from the furcula.
Here comes another minister with strong pulsation to the legs of the patient; apply pressure firmly on the buttock area and extend it over the limbs vigorously, so that this goes back to its own place.
This specific substance is for purulent inflammation, which reduces that member whereby other essences are involved.
If it is excused upon you and not resisted in this special form of treatment for both feet at the same time as they are joined by ligaments strong enough to hold them together, then place your hand over both heels and on both legs' bones (tarsals) and thighbones.
Whenever any part of the body is so large in proportion to its four sections (indicating a disproportinately enlarged limb or organ), and when the groin extends as much as two fingers, that size should be considered abnormal.
Return (or fix) the bladder above the head of the staff, and keep it in place so that the bladder remains therein; its length corresponds to two fathoms from the ground.
Return the command to a strong young man that shortens the patient' extramandible portion and has another youth suspended above him; likewise, have yet another boy lower his hand onto it with strength in order for the joint returns promptly to its original position by speedy action.
In the reduction itself, when it is dislocated from its place outside, where the hump presses on one leg according to what we have recommended in the softened state of the patient's abdomen; and his ligaments are placed directly over the hernia as well as on the chest.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
Each minister extends to his part and the doctor holds on tightly with their mouth for reduction according to art.
When dislocation occurs in the parts nearby, then it is necessary for that cushion to be expanded as far as possible, and according to this method described by the physician, he places his right palm on the affected thigh, another of his hands compresses one more area with its own hand, pausing until expansion at these dislocated parts reaches near the hip joint.
If dislocation is at the joints behind, do not cover up until the hump has moved to the joint areas and risen above the ground; those who are covering have done so over a hard cause, as we mentioned earlier about their width exceeding two anchors; it should be placed on its face and limbs extended outwards, just like what was discussed—there is no need for further intervention.
When compression is applied with a table over the location where the joint pain occurs,
So when the reduction is complete, as I said earlier—the term for "reduction" does not concern you, and it's your task to extend from above (thigh area) with cushions, then after straightening those bent parts and extending that displaced bandage outwards, you will adjust hinges/hips back into place. Ensure the wide belt is not bulging on any of the body sections; secure it in place for three to four days.
Return the ligaments and binding back into place, comparing one cushion with another.
When you see those awkward in the room and realize that the dislocation has already been fixed, then let the thigh go (move).
If you see any cause of softening, return and bandage that part according to your first touch, and extend it for three days.
When they apply that, and allow it to walk slowly over these areas for several days until comforted.
The text provided seems to be discussing medical practices related to joint pain (poss
When addressing a hip dislocation, it translates as: "In the treatment of the displaced hip." Here we're
The hip is displaced in three ways: forward to the front parts of the body and downwards towards both sides (lateral) as well as upward, but not backward where it currently resides; for these directions are when a dislocation occurs according to this text. Here we're discussing methods or guidelines possibly outlined in an old medical manual on how such injuries present themselves and potentially what actions might be taken following the occurrence of hip displacement, adhering closely to medieval understandings of medicine:
The title of the displacement is that you command the bowels to apply its cushion at the thigh, and as soon as it becomes dislocated - understand well this happens when there'suposition occurs (dislocation).
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: And for restoring all of the patient'thy parts is that you straighten out their hips (if possible), stretching the hip joint, and attach your thighs to the face of the patient; pause the leg between the knees, attaching fingers with those on palms, binding them together in strength, while another servant extends the legs inside until/as the tendon returns to its original place.
When it is about relief for him, his cushion clings at the hip joint that does not labor.
Here comes the next sentence to translate: Attach that and hold it in place on the couch at the thighs, apply those around one bandage for three days or four, and secure them with these.
No longer use the abdomen of walking for several days until it heals and is comforted.
If your reduction of the area is excused from you, then administer considerable extension force on the ligaments previously narrated in the treatment of the hip joint.
Given that "Capitol" does not provide actual text from which I
The provided fragment, "Curacio di una dislocazione della tibia," translates to English as:
The ankle sometimes swells due to slight injury, and it may become dislocated either at the joints or in the hollow parts of the leg; this is what happens therein.
The translation of each line from medieval medical Latin-like text into English would be as follows:
May the cure for his condition be easier relief and that it is extended in such a way as to ensure return within:
When treating him when he is dislocated as per the complementary position, make sure to straighten his thigh and hold that limb with a strong and capable servant from behind where it rests in place.
And place your hand on the patient'thy head as far down their backside to where your left hand is in the location of the lobe beneath it, and also apply pressure with both hands upon that spot.
Apply pressure to the foot with your left hand for three times, and apply it to the left leg twice, extending outward until you feel the heel press against the scabbard of its cushion. Then lift up the sole of the foot by the thumbs provided on them.
When hot poultices are applied as directed (how often or for how long), here it refers to following a specific regimen that has been outlined in terms of frequency and duration for
And tightens the chest to the couch as you (the healer or caregiver) are present at hand. Here it suggests that during treatment with poultices and other remedies for joint pain caused by cold humors, maintaining a position of support is necessary—potentially involving physical touch or presence while applying
And if you return to this position in a follow-up session or two following these actions, and sometimes the patient's foot is brought back (possibly implying manipulation), then all goes well; otherwise, repeat that procedure until they do so—this refers to continuing with treatment efforts for joint pain. It emphasizes persistence in returning as needed based on the response of aligning or correcting a part of the body such as an engaged foot which may indicate misalignment contributing to discomfort and requires further attention, possibly through repeated manipulative techniques
But if you are forbidden from reducing it during these times recommended by us (the healers), then speak loudly to the humors in their two below, and begin a planted field on firm ground; place something between their thighs—possibly an object or remedy used for compression like beanbags or wedges —and wrap them tightly with cloth so that they do not feel discomfort from standing. Here it implies alternative methods to manage joint pain when certain interventions are contraindicated, focusing on vocal therapy possibly aimed at expelling excess humors through sound and maintaining body alignment using external aids like compressive materials while providing comfort with clothing or other forms of covering during the process.

Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
And when the dislocation returns and it is declared to you that there has been reduction of him/her (the patient), then apply an emplastrum firmly and extend that part attached by its sinews, binding the foot to the thighbone.
When you fear or protect your nerves that are behind the ankle, to prevent the ligament from being violent and leading it astray.
Return it within two or three days, and if the ligament softens, extend that outwardly.
Return that part of it either in the day or at night for forty days. If you are forced to go beyond that space, it is not certain that the detachment will not be spread out and corrupted there, nor receive any treatment at all.
If you apply a poultice of cold application on the wound where we previously described it in this account (treatment), and do so until the area is replete again for healing purposes within another site of care/recovery, then that should suffice as treatment.
Given that "Capitol" does not provide context or content related directly in this
Regarding the treatment of knee joint displacements, it appears we are discussing methods to address issues where there has been a misalignment
For cases where the joint is dislocated and only minor extension strain it (and assuming that such a condition isn't overly difficult), gently flexing backward should suffice for realignment; provided this task doesn’thy be too challenging to perform oneself without proper technique or equipment.
In scenarios where the dislocation occurs at the knees' joints (the patient’s lower legs), you should straighten out the leg to adjust its position within the socket of either a chair or table while maintaining contact, similar to how one would normally sit down gently. This technique assumes that it can be done without causing further injury and suggests using stable objects like furniture for support during repositioning.
Keep your leg weighted down and pause it over the joints you are addressing; similarly apply pressure where needed within the lower part of the body to guide that area back into its natural position, watching carefully so as not for a relapse outside this designated space (a return) after realignment. This implies using one's own weight or an external object like hands applied with appropriate force and care when assisting someone in reducing joint dislocations at home without professional equipment – observing to ensure the leg is correctly placed within its natural position post-movement, preventing it from protruding awkwardly.
After applying pressure to the patient's abdomen using two handles of a table that will fully immobilize their leg and ensure this fixation remains for three days; similarly apply rest periods where ambulation is temporarily halted, until they are thoroughly healed—all while ensuring comfort during recovery. This suggests utilizing furniture (a solidly supported surface) to create an uncompromising support system which restricts movement of the injured area completely as part of a comprehensive care regimen that likely includes resting and allowing natural body processes for repair, with attention paid throughout to patient well-benfitment.
Unfortunately, it seems there might have been an error in providing you with text
When dealing with the spices of displacement that are pains either to body or bone, or any part in question:
