of the chilblains that come on the feet Very often it happens that on the outside of the feet a malady arises which is called "corn" according to our understanding, and it is a large, misshapen thing that injures the foot.	On the cauterization of corns, inverted and otherwise. This disease, which is something hard paining the foot, very often occurs in the soles of the feet.	0.5461665

Fire cautery is done by heating a cautery iron like a vaulting rib, and it should be made of good iron of a size that it can enclose the corn on all sides, and that it has thin edges; then place it hot upon the corn, and turn your hand all around the corn until it reaches the bottom of the corn; and leave it thus for three days until it begins to discharge pus; then make a poultice of wild mallows ground with salt, and leave the poultice on all night, and the corn will fall off and be uprooted.	The actual cautery is to heat a hollow cautery like a vulture's quill, made of iron, narrow of edge, of such a size as to surround the corn all round. Then put it, hot, on the corn and rotate it till the cautery reaches the root of the corn; and let be for three days to draw the pus; then apply a plaster of wild mallows ground up with salt, and leave the plaster on one night; then it may be drawn out with its root.	0.9051728
Then treat the area with an ointment that generates flesh until it is healed.	Then treat the site of the wound with stimulating salve till it heals.	0.82269347
Do this one after the other, until you have extracted all those that are on the body, then treat them with ointments that generate flesh.	Treat them in this manner one after another till you have accounted for all of them. Then treat the site of them, after eradication, with stimulating ointments.	0.72556484
