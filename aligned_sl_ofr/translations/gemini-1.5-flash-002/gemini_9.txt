O you, very dear sons, I have completed for you this book which is the last of the science of medicine together with its completion, and I have made the end through its explanations and through its declarations. And it came to me in a vision that I should complete it for you with this treatise, which is a part of the work of hands, that is to say "surgery".
And because the work of hands is weak in our region and is completely and utterly neglected, the science is lost and fragmented, and nothing remains of it except the brief descriptions in books of the ancients that hands have moved. And from this has come error and vanity, and intentions are obscured and the science is distanced.
Now it seems to me that I want to revive it together with the ordering of this treatise according to the way of exposition and declaration and abbreviation; and I will include the forms of the cautery irons, and of the other instruments of the work with the addition of their explanation and preparation, as is necessary.
And for the reason that no good master craftsmen are found in our time, the art of medicine is diminished. And it is necessary for him who undertakes it to excel in the science of anatomy, as Galen says, so that he knows the arrangement of the limbs, and their forms and connections and separations, and has knowledge of the bones and nerves and muscles and their number, and the course of the moving and resting veins, and the place of their origin.
And for this reason Hippocrates says that the name without the work is much, and with the work is little; and similarly in the art of surgery.
We tell you in the introduction to this book that whoever is not knowledgeable of the things said before, let him beware lest he fall into error and kill men;
as I have seen many times several of those who meddle in this science and abandon themselves without knowledge and without experience.
For I saw a foolish surgeon who cut an abscess of scrofula in the neck of a woman, and cut the arteries of the neck; because so much blood flowed out that the woman fell dead in his hands.
And I saw another surgeon who extracted a stone from an old man, and the stone was large; so he removed with it a piece of the bladder, and the man died within three days.
And I had already been called to treat him, and I saw the condition of the patient and the size of the stone, and I knew that if he were cut, he would die.
And I saw another surgeon who took into his care a duke of our land who had a broken leg, and with the fracture there was a wound;
and the surgeon, full of ignorance, pulled the fracture through the wound to the stars with strong force, and left no lint on the wound, and left it thus untreated;
and he commanded him that he should not unbind it;
and it remained thus until the leg was all swollen and the foot, and came to ruin.
I was called to come to him, and I hastened to come to unbind the leg; and when I had unbound it, it was at peace and felt no pain.
But nevertheless the corruption was already confirmed in the limb, and I could not heal it;
and the corruption did not cease to spread through the limb until the limb was entirely lost.
And I saw another case where an inflamed abscess broke open, and then became inflamed through the malice of its nature.
For a cancerous sore, when it is pure of melancholic humor, it is not fitting that one touch it with iron unless it is in such a place that one can entirely remove what is corrupted.
And therefore, dear son, it is necessary that you know that the work of hands is divided into two divisions: that is to say, work where there is peril in many conditions;
and I will show in each place of this book where there is fear and peril.
Therefore it is necessary that you guard yourself, so that foolish people cannot speak ill of you.
So take up your arms cautiously, and undertake your patients lightly and firmly, and use the best method so that through the grace of God you come to salvation and are praised;
and leave the frightening illnesses to grave seriousness;
and remove your arms from that which makes you doubt, and have faith in yourself so that you may pass from this world to the other in glory.
Galen says in some of his admonitions: Do not undertake a bad illness, lest you be called a fool.
I have devised this treatise according to three chapters.
The first chapter is of fire cauteries and of cauteries of sharp medicine, and the chapter is ordered from the head to the feet;
and of the forms of instruments, and of the cautery irons, and of all that is necessary in the work.
The second chapter is of cutting and piercing, and of cupping and wounds, and of the extraction of arrows, and similar things;
and the chapter is ordered and the forms of the instruments.
The third chapter is of restoring dislocations and torsions, and similar things;
and is ordered from the head to the feet, and of the forms of the instruments.
Before we remember the work, it is necessary that I speak of the quality of the help and the harm of each complexion.
I say that the qualities of help and harm are the longest speech and subtle science and the hidden secrets;
and of this many of the wise spoke, and agreed on this;
and their words suffice me little, for I fear the length.
I say that cautery universally helps every complexion where there is matter, except for two complexions: that is to say, a hot complexion without matter, and a dry complexion without matter.
In a complexion that is both hot and dry with matter, some debated and said that cautery is a great help; and others said the contrary: that cautery is not good for illness that comes from heat and dryness. For the nature of fire is hot, and a hot illness should not be cured by heat, nor by dryness;
and he who said the contrary said that cautery greatly helps a hot and dry illness that comes in the bodies of men. For when you compare the body of man and its moisture to the complexion of fire, you find the body cold.
And I agree with this statement. For I have found it so sometimes by experiment.
And yet, let no one meddle with it except he who has proven it, and who knows by long use the chapter of cauteries, and the diversity of the complexions of men, and the dispositions and the causes of their illnesses, and the occurrences and the space of time;
of other complexions we have no fear, especially in cold and moist diseases. And all the physicians assembled and agreed on the cautery.
And know, son, that cautery with fire is among the secrets of cures, and of greater benefit than cautery with burning medicine.
For fire is simple, and it comes only to the member which is cooked, and harms no other member except very little.
Burning medicines spread from one member to another, and bring to the member diseases of difficult healing; and perhaps kill the patient.
Fire, because of its power and the goodness of its substance, does not do this, unless there is superfluity.
And this I have found by experiment and by the length of service and study that I have devoted to the art, and it was based on the truth of things;
and therefore I apologize for the length of the speech, for I do not wish to withhold from you the secret which is contained in fire, and the quality of the work, how it expels the diseases of the body, as the philosopher says in demonstrating; now receive it in your thoughts.
And know, son, that they agreed on when cauterizations should be performed, and chose spring.
And I say that cautery is suitable at all times, because the harmful occurrences are overcome with the help of cautery; and especially if the cautery is for necessary, strong and urgent pains that cannot wait until greater harm comes to the limb.
And never think, dear son, as the foolish doctors do; for a disease that is cured by cautery does not return; and they say so;
and they say so; but it is not as they think, because cautery is only a medicine that changes the complexion, and dries the humors that are the cause of the pain, and is better than a medicine because of the speed of its effect, and because of the virtue of its work and its mastery.
And it is possible that the disease sometimes returns according to the complexion of the patient and the location of the disease and its virulence;
and superfluities are gathered there by the ingestion of food and similar things, unless cautery is administered in a place where there is little superfluity and moisture, such as cautery of the teeth for pain, and similar things, and such pain does not return; but this happens rarely.
And many people do not understand why cautery is called the last resort of medicine, and it is true;
but they do not believe that cautery is useful after medicine, but their understanding is false, and cautery is the last resort of medicine because when we administer various treatments for a disease and they are ineffective, then we administer cautery, and it works.
Then it is clear that cautery is the last resort of medicine, not according to the understanding of the foolish.
The ancients said that cautery with a golden instrument is better than with iron, and they did not say this falsely, but because of the quality of gold and the high value of its substance;
and they said that the cauterized area does not become putrid, but that is not true, for I have tested it, and have found that it is true in some men;
and cautery with gold is better than with iron, as they said. And yet when you heat a gold instrument, you do not know when it is hot by the color of the gold, and it is immediately cooled;
and if one heats it too much; they do so with fire; and thus there are enough impediments.
Now I have arranged this chapter from the head to the feet, so that the way may be easier to find.
This cautery is good for moisture and coldness in the brain, and there are two that are made because of an illness that is called "soda," and because of many humors that descend from the head to the eyes and ears, and because of a multitude of dreams and toothache and sore throat, and likewise for all illnesses that come from coldness such as paralysis and soda and apoplexy and similar illnesses.
The form of this cautery is that the patient be purged with a purgative medicine cleansing the head for three or four nights, according to what the strength and age and habit of the patient can endure; and then shave the patient's head.
And then make him sit cross-legged between your hands, and place his hands on his knees;
afterwards, place the root of your palm on the root of his nose between his two eyes; and let your middle fingers be where it will bleed, then heat the cautery which is called "olivare", of which this is the form: And place it on the spot marked with ink, and move it downwards and inwards, little by little, turning your hand; then lift your hand quickly, and observe the area to see if you see the bone a little; and if you do not see it, repeat the cautery until you see the bone as I have told you;
afterwards take a little salt, and put it in water and moisten cotton in it, and place it on the area, and leave it for three days;
Afterwards, apply cotton moistened in butter; and leave it on until the burn is healed; Afterwards, treat the wound with the ointment called "tetrapharmacon", until it is healed.
And the ancients say that the longer the wound remains open, the more it purges; and therefore it heals better.
And some of them say that one should leave the cautery on so long that part of the bone is burned, and then one removes what is burned from the bone, and it is healed.
And others say that one should leave the cautery on so long, and apply it so strongly that one burns away from the bone as wide as the whorl that women put in their spindles so that the humors may easily go out;
and one should leave the wound open a long time; afterwards one should treat and dress it.
And these two methods of cautery do not seem to me to be good at all, except in some cases where there is cause for fear;
and more it seems to me that I should leave it;
for the head is weakened by the continuous discharges of nature, as we testify in other members;
and similarly when the patient's head is weak by nature, and the first kind of cautery is safer and gentler for me, and of that I make use, then together with salvation.
When chronic pain comes to the whole head, and lasts a long time, the patient should use herbs and pills that are called "cochie," and head purges and oils and plasters; and if cautery is performed as we have said before, and it does not help. Take care if the patient's head is of strong nature, and that it is not too cold; then cauterize below that cautery a little as we have said above. Afterwards, make a cautery on each horn of the head down to the bone, as we have said before, and make a cautery in the place that is called "vessels"; and that is the place where cupping glasses are applied; and lighten your hand so that you do not reach the bone: the patient feels much greater pain in this cautery than in the others, and I will speak of it elsewhere;
and it is necessary that the cauteries of the horns be more subtle than those with which one cauterizes the middle of the head, and this is the form:
of the head cautery When a sudden pain comes to a part of the head, and the illness extends to the eye, and the head is purged with purifying medicines, and the other treatments that I have described in the division of illnesses have been done, and none of this helps: then I make cauteries according to two methods, that is to say with a sharp medicine and with fire.
The cautery of sharp medicine is that you take a slice of garlic, and remove the peel and cut it a little at the two ends, and then slit the temple where the pain is in such a way that you can place the slice of garlic under the skin;
and when it is placed, bind it tightly and leave it so for twelve hours; and then unbind it and remove the slice of garlic, and leave the wound so for two or three days; then apply cotton soaked in butter until pus comes out.
Afterwards cure it with ointment until it is healed;
and if you wish, do this with some burning medicines that I have written in the twelfth treatise on burning medicines.
The iron cautery is according to this manner. Heat the cautery of which this is the form:
And it is called "closed" because the head is made in the form of a bell or it has a little curvature, and in the middle a small opening;
and place it on the painful area, and hold your hand and turn the iron a little lightly, until half the thickness of the heart is burned;
and lift your hand so that the artery does not burn, which is outside, and an abundance of blood flows.
Afterwards, put cotton in salt water, and apply it to the area for three days; then apply cotton soaked in butter, and then treat the area with ointment until it is healed;
and if you wish to cauterize this migraine with the cautery which is called "cultellare", use the point, and be careful not to cut the artery in this migraine which is not old.
of migraine
When you treat a migraine as we have said before in the divisions of diseases, and it does not improve, and you see that the cauteries previously mentioned of medicine and iron are not sufficient, then you must heat the cautery which is called "cultellare" until it is white;
and bleed thus on the aching area a line half a finger's length, and remove your hand once, and be careful that you do not cut the artery and that you do not go down to the bone;
and beware of the mandible which moves when one eats, and the nerve should not be affected so that it moves and that spasms do not come to the patient, and beware of the flow of blood from the artery when it is cut, or cutting causes great fear and especially to him who does not know it, and who is not learned and experienced; and leave the work half-done;
but I will tell you how to stop blood when the artery is cut, and I will show you the place where it is appropriate in this book.
And if you see that this cautery is not sufficient for the illness, and the patient is suffering, cauterize him in the middle of the head as we have said, and treat the wound until it is healed;
and if you wish, administer the cautery that we have mentioned in the chapter on the extraction of the artery, with the cautery which has two knives; and this cautery is better than that one and more helpful.
of the earache from cold
When pain comes to the ear from cold, and solutions and other treatments that we have mentioned in the division have been applied, and the pain does not cease, then heat this cautery which is called "points," of which this is the form:
Afterwards, prick all around the affected ear, or around both if the pain is in both, and move slightly upwards from the root of the ear after you have marked the place of the swelling; and let there be ten pricks around each ear;
afterwards treat the area until it is healed.
Of the torture of the mouth
A torture which ought to be cured by cautery is nothing but that which arises from phlegm, as we have said in the divisions of illnesses;
and do not perform cautery on those similar [ailments] that come from dryness and spasm of the nerves.
When you treat this type of torture which arises from phlegm, with bloodletting and purges and gargles, and this does not work, then you must cauterize the patient with three cauteries: one at the root of the ear, and another a little outside the temple, and the third at the joining of the two lips;
and place the cautery in the part that appears healthy, and make the cautery towards the top of the ear a little below the horn of the head, and another in the temple as long as a thumb; and leave the cautery on until half of the thickness is burned;
and this is the form of the cautery:
And it is similar to the curette that we have shown before, but it is a little more subtle and the knife should be a little thicker;
after, treat the place as I have said before, until it is healed.
When apoplexy is old and you treat it as we have said, and it does not improve, and the patient does not have a fever, then make four cauteries: two on the two horns of the head, and one in the middle of the head, and one in the place that is called "vessels" as we have said before, and the last cautery on the mouth of the stomach;
and let it be treated as we have said before.
of lethargy
For this illness, it is necessary to give the patient large herbs and pills that cleanse the brain;
after shaving the patient's entire head, and applying to the occiput the mustard plaster which is described in the treatise on plasters;
and this is the manner of the cautery: if you do it as I have said.
If he is healed thus, it is good; and if he is not, make three cauteries in the middle of the head descending to the neck, and let there be the space of one thumb's breadth between each cautery;
and cure it like the others, and if you wish to add, and the patient is able to bear it, make one cautery in the middle; and if necessary, two others on the two temples, and cure it until it is healed;
and let the cautery be that which is called "olivare," as I have said before.
It is necessary that the head be cleansed of herbs and what we have said before;
after shaving the patient's head, then make a cautery in the middle of the head and on each temple, and one behind and three on the spine of the neck;
and if you need more, and the body is moist and the patient is suffering, and the illness is severe, make four cauteries on the spine of the back; and leave them until the deepest part of the heart is burned, and lift your hand; after treat it until it is healed, and it should be the cautery that is called "olivare" that we have said before.
of epilepsy
Epileptics should not use fire cautery except those who are phlegmatic, and it is necessary to first purify the brain of humors and other treatments that we have mentioned in the section when the patient is large and suffering enough to take medicine.
And if it is a child who cannot endure it, make him gargles and mastications purifying the brain often with good foods;
after raising the head in the middle, and make one cautery there as we have said before, and one cautery on the vessel, and on each temple; and if the patient is strong and able to endure it, make cauteries as I have said for one who has paralysis and bodily weakness, on the spine of the back and neck, and let the cauteries be olive-shaped according to the manner I have described.
If the patient is a child, make one subtle cautery according to this method:
When, due to melancholy, the superfluities or humors are corrupted and the phlegm is thick, then cauterize with such cauteries as we have described for one who has paralysis.
And if, due to melancholy, the superfluities incline towards melancholy, and the patient's body is moist, then give him something to drink to cleanse the brain, according to what has been said earlier in the division.
Afterwards, shave the patient's head; then make a well-made linen compress, like a circle, and place it on the head;
and let the patient sit cross-legged, and be well supported on all sides;
then apply the liniment, and old sheep butter is good; and warm it gently over a fire, so that the finger, if one puts it in, can bear it; then empty the circle inside onto the head, and let it cool;
and do this for the patient once a week along with other good treatment, until he is healed.
Or if you wish to cauterize it, make several points across the whole cautery.
This method of cautery moistens the brain evenly;
and then apply cotton moistened in butter and chicken fat.
of the water of the eyes When water first comes to the eyes by the signs that I have mentioned in the division, then begin and give the patient something to drink that cleanses the head, and keep it from all moisture, and make him sweat in the bath several times fasting.
Afterwards, instruct him to raise his head, and cauterize him in the middle of the head, and make two cauteries on the two temples if the descent of the water is to both eyes together, or one if the descent is to one;
and with the entire cautery cut all the veins and arteries that are below the heart, and let the cautery be long according to the width of the temple;
and beware of excessive bleeding, and if you see too much blood flowing, then staunch it with such power as you have.
And I will teach you in the extraction of arteries and in the incision the precaution how you will staunch it;
and sometimes a cautery or incision is made under the two bones at the back.
and one sees that it is from cold phlegmatic superfluities, then make for him the cautery that I have said at the beginning of the water descending to the eyes: I cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries on the two temples, and two cauteries or incisions under the two bones; and if there is need for more, then cauterize him wisely above the eyebrow with one small cautery.
When you treat him according to what we have said in the division, and he does not improve, then give the patient to drink three nightshade berries; after raise the head, and make a cautery in the middle of the olive-shaped cautery; and make two cauteries with the cautery that is called "clavilis" above the two eyebrows, a little below the hair;
and beware of the artery that you do not cut it.
And this is the shape of the cautery that is called "clavilis":
When the eyelid is softened by illness and moisture, then cauterize it with this cautery that is called "olivare". of which this is the shape:
And if you wish, make two cauteries above the two eyebrows as long as the eyebrows are;
and do not leave the hand there except until the third part of the eyelid is burned, according to the manner that I have said.
of the hair that pricks the eye Sometimes it happens that the hairs of the eyelids are turned inward, and prick the eye, and cauteries are made there according to two methods: that is to say, of fire, or of a burning medicine.
For the fire cautery, instruct the patient to let the hairs grow long and even; and if they prick at their base, hold the eyes steady so they do not move until they grow.
When they grow and are even, then put the patient in your care; then draw on the skin with the eyes a figure like the leaf of myrtle, and let the beginning of the mark be near the hairs;
then put cotton moistened in egg white and parsley poultice on the eye, then heat the cautery of which this is the form:
Then cauterize over the figure that you have marked little by little many times, so that the flesh is burnt in that place;
and the sign of the success of the work is that you see the skin retracted, and the hairs raised at the puncture of the eye;
then lift your hand, and leave it so for three days, then put cotton moistened in butter there until the burn is gone; afterwards treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if afterwards the hairs come, and the skin is softened then begin the cautery again on that same place, as you did before;
and if the hairs are weak, then cauterize it until the skin is raised to its natural place, and is even, and the hairs do not prick the eye.
The cautery of burning medicine is that you instruct the patient to let the hairs grow until they are long and even, then make from parchment the shape of a myrtle leaf;
then take of French soap and quicklime, of each one-third, and grind them well together; and do it quickly, so that it does not cool, then spread it on the shape that you have made like the myrtle leaf, and put it on the skin; and if the illness is in one eye only, then one should operate on one, and if in both, likewise; and place under the eye cotton moistened in egg white;
and the patient's head should be on your lap and put your index finger on the medicine, and press it gently and move it every time the patient feels the medicine biting, for it bites like fire.
When you have done this for a long time, remove the medicine with your finger. And when the biting sensation has passed, lift the membrane of water, and look to see if you see the membrane raised as if it were raised by the constraint of fire or by incision; and if it is so, it is well.
If not, put more medicine on the place where the medicine has not worked, until your work is even, and your eyes are focused;
then put on cotton soaked in butter until the burning sensation has subsided, afterwards treat the place with the ointment which is called "dyafenis" and others, until it is healed.
And if it is necessary that you guard your work carefully so that none of the medicine falls into the eyes.
And if the skin becomes soft afterwards, and the hairs prick at the eye, repeat the medicine on that place which is softened by the skin properly, as you have done before; afterwards treat it until it is healed;
and this is the shape of the myrtle leaf:
And know that the eyes of men are diverse in size, and according to that should be your restraints;
and the right way should not be revealed to him who studies this art.
of the treatment of fistula by cautery
When you treat a fistula as we have said in the divisions of diseases, and your treatments do not benefit, then it is necessary that you cauterize it in this manner.
Instruct the patient to place his head in your lap; and let the assistant hold his head between your hands in such a way that he does not move, nor shake his head;
afterwards place moistened cotton in egg white or in parsley juice on the eye;
then heat the cautery which is like this:
and is shaped at the head like a vulture's feather, together with which is the cautery;
if you wish, let it be pointed from one end to the other, and if you wish, let it be like a tent;
but however, this one which is shaped is better for your work.
Then press the fistula if it is open, and draw out the corruption, and dry it; and if it is closed, then open it, and draw out the matter;
then apply the hot cautery strongly, and hold your hand to the cautery at the part of the nose above the eye, so that your hand does not waver; and put the cautery in the fat of the eye, and corrupt it.
If you reach the bone with the cautery at the beginning, it would be good. If not, repeat the cautery once more, and again if you need to, and leave it for three days;
afterwards apply cotton soaked in butter, and treat it with drying ointment until it is healed, and if forty days pass and it is not healed, apply a corrosive watery medicine until the bone is uncovered; and treat it according to what comes in its chapter.
And there is a method of cauterizing a fistula that some of the ancients described. Understand the fistula, and cut the place; afterwards place in the fissure one thin cauterizing iron of which this is the form: and it is made to the quantity of a third of a lead weight; and hold your hand with the cauterizing iron firmly, and the patient must not move at all, lest the molten lead run into his eye;
and it is necessary that one place on the patient's eye cotton moistened in egg white or in water:
the lead thus burns the place of the fistula, and heals it by marvelous health.
And if the fistula is healed by the cautery that we have described, that is good. If not, then it is necessary to administer a perforation to the nose, and to return the fistula to the body of the nose according to what is necessary in its proper place.
of cracks in the lips Very often cracks appear on the lips which are called "chaps," and especially on the lips of children.
When you treat these cracks with what we have said in the divisions, and the treatment is not effective, then heat a small knife cautery according to this form:
And apply it quickly to those cracks until it reaches the bottom;
afterwards treat the place with cerate until it is healed.
When an abscess appears in the root of the throat, or in the uvula, or on the palate, or at the roots of the teeth, after it forms pus and breaks and is aged and becomes a fistula; and you treat it as we have said in the divisions, and it does not improve: then you must have a cautery according to the size of the fistula; after the opening or hole of the fistula, and hold your hand until the heated iron reaches the bottom of it, and the furthest part;
and do so once or twice, after treating it as we have said in treatments, until it is healed;
and if it is healed thus, it is good; and if not, then it is necessary to uncover the place and remove the corrupt bone, according to what you will find in its chapter.
When the gums are softened by moisture and the teeth move, and you treat it with medicines and it does not work, then place the patient's head in your lap; then heat the cautery whose form will come later in such a way that you place a chain on the tooth;
and put the hot cautery inside quickly, and hold your hand until the patient feels the heat reaching the root of the tooth;
then lift your hand and reapply the cautery according to your will;
afterwards let the patient fill his mouth with salt water, and hold it for an hour and then spit it out.
And in this way the tooth that was loose is strengthened, and the softened gums are constricted, and the corrupt moisture is dried.
Of the toothache
When toothache comes from coldness, or there is coldness or worms, and medical treatments are ineffective, then cautery is necessary in two ways: and cautery with butter and cautery with fire.
Cautery with butter is such that you take cow butter, and put the end in an iron or bronze spoon; then take cotton and wrap it around the point of a tent, and moisten it in boiling butter, and put it on the aching tooth quickly and hold it until it is cooled;
and thus do it often until its virtue reaches the root of the tooth, and if you wish, moisten wool and cotton in cold butter, and put it on the aching tooth, and put hot iron on it until the fire reaches the end of the tooth.
The cautery with fire is such that you take an iron or bronze rod, and it should be thick so that the fire does not reach the mouth of the patient;
then heat the cautery, whose shape will come later, and put it on the tooth and hold your hand until the cautery is cooled;
do this often, for the pain will be removed that same day or the next.
And it is necessary that the patient fill his mouth with good butter at the time of this cautery, and then rinse it strongly;
and this is the shape of the cautery:
And make a cautery of whichever head you wish, and according to what you have the power for;
and this is the shape of the chain:
of the scrofula When the scrofula are of phlegm and cold moisture, and are not responsive to digestion by medicines, then heat the cautery head, of which the shape follows, and it should have two openings for the fumes to escape on the other side of the cautery;
and apply the hot cautery to the abscess once, or twice if necessary, until it reaches the bottom of the abscess;
and if the abscess is small, apply the cautery according to the size of the abscess, and leave it so for three days; and apply cotton soaked in butter until the burn is healed;
afterwards treat the area with ointments and tents until it is healed.
When humors overcome the channels of the lung, and especially when this comes from a cold constitution, then the patient must first be purged with laxative medicines;
afterwards apply a cautery to the root of the throat, and be careful not to go down to the throat, and not to burn near the heart but only a little.
Afterwards apply another cautery to the joint of the neck at the top of the spine, and let it be the cautery which is called "clavile," of which we have the form before;
and treat the place as we have said before until it is healed.
When all the illnesses of the lungs are from cold moisture, and the patient has neither fever nor dryness, and the illness is chronic, apply two cauteries to the clavicle in empty places; and one other cautery in the middle of the breast between the two nipples;
and let the cautery which is called "clavicle" be according to the form which is described above.
And if you wish, make a cautery by pricking with the whole cautery which is called "points," of which the form is given above for the illness of the ears;
and let the points be up to thirty, or thereabouts.
After, cure the place according to what is said above, and let the cautery have three rows according to this form:
And for this reason the cauteries are lighter, because you make three at a time.
of the dislocation of the shoulder
When the head of the shoulder is dislocated due to moisture, and it is reset but cannot stay in place, repeatedly dislocating with slight movement as we have experienced, then you must first reset the dislocation. Afterwards, let the patient be supported on his back and on his side; then lift the heart which is inside the pericardium with the fingers of your left hand;
and if the joint is dislocated internally, heat the cautery which has two points, as is the form here:
and cauterize the heart until it pierces to the side, and the figure of the cautery would be similar to four cauteries;
and for that reason a cautery with three points is made, so that the figure of the cauterization is six cauteries;
and the points are according to the thinness of a tent peg, and this is the form of the cautery which has three points:
And sometimes one point is added to it, so that there are eight cauteries.
Afterwards, apply the cautery with crushed parsley and salt; afterwards, make the patient rest, and the limb should not be moved for a long time until it is well strengthened.
And if it is dislocated above, which happens rarely, then apply the cautery on the thickness of the clavicle cautery, or many cauteries by pricking.
For the joint is closed, and the moisture is removed, and the patient is healed.
When cold and much moisture come into the stomach to the point of altering its complexion, and catarrh multiplies in it, and the customary methods of treatment are of no use, then the patient should be laid on his back, and stretch his legs and arms. After this, make three cauteries: one under the armpit, by the breadth of a finger, with the entire clavicle cautery, and two cauteries on the outer sides such that the shape of the cauteries forms three angles, and there is such space between them that they are not joined together when they discharge pus;
and let the cauteries be so deep that they reach the two parts of the heart, and let the shape of the cauteries be according to this form without addition:
And if you wish to cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form;
and he who fears this cautery, cauterize by pricking and bleeding on the stomach at one point according to the amount you wish to draw blood; then cauterize with the entire cautery which is called "points".
After the treatment of the cure that we had before, until it is healed.
When pain in the liver comes from cold and moisture and great flatulence, so that it is far removed from its natural complexion by superfluities; and the patient is treated with what we have said in the divisions, and it does not benefit him, then it is necessary that the patient be bled on his arm; and make three cauteries according to this form and this figure and this quantity on the liver, outside the hypochondria, where the ribs of a man come;
and let there be a space between each cautery the thickness of a finger; and let the cauteries be lengthwise on the body, and do not press your hand too much on the whole cautery;
and let only half the heart be burned, and let the patient be upright on his feet;
and if he cannot, let him be lying down, and extend his legs, and raise his arms;
And if it is your will, cauterize these cauteries with the cautery knife, if you are skillful and wise in the art, and beware that you do not burn the whole heart, for you would dry up the whole body; and that it does not reach boiling, for the heart is very delicate there, and know this for certain.
When there is an abscess in the liver, and you wish to know if it is in the flesh of the liver or in the membrane: if it is in the flesh, the patient does not feel very strong pain;
and if it is in the membrane, he feels excruciating pain.
And then when this treatment weakens the eyes, it is necessary that the patient be supported on his head;
and then bleed from the place where the abscess is, and then heat the cautery which is similar to a ray, of which here is the form: And cauterize with the cautery until the core is burned, and it comes down to the sheath, until the puncture is completely healed;
after the treatment according to the treatment of the issues until it is healed;
and it is not necessary that anyone use this cautery except one who has studied for a long time in the art of medicine, and by whose hands these diseases have been cured sometimes.
Then he can boldly work, and yet it seems to me that it is better to leave it.
Of the cautery of pleurisy.
The ancients said that for pleurisy one should make cauteries of the roots of aristolochia, and in this manner: Take a long root of aristolochia, the largest you can find, and let it be dry, and let it be as thick and as long as your fingers; and grind it in oil, and apply it to the fire, and cauterize; one cautery between the collarbone and the neck, and two small cauteries a little lower down in the part that is below the chin;
and two cauteries between the fifth rib and the sixth, slanting slightly backwards; and one cautery in the middle of the breast, and another above the stomach, and one between the two shoulders, and two on the two sides of the breast, outside the cautery that is between the two shoulders;
and do not press your hand, but act openly as if smelling.
And some ancients said that some people use a fire cautery similar to a razor, and heat it and place it between the ribs until it reaches that abscess; and the pain leaps out, as we have said in the case of the liver abscess.
But in this operation there is fear that the patient dies immediately, or a fistula develops which cannot be healed.
of the mouse
When you treat the disease of the mouse [presumably referring to a type of ailment] according to what we have said in the divisions of treatments, and it does not help, then there are three kinds of cautery which are all good.
Of which one method is that you make three or four cauteries, in a line according to the length of the mouse [ailment], according to the figure of the liver cautery that we have described before;
and do not press your hand on the whole cautery, and let the patient often lie on his back;
and another method of cautery is that you heat the cautery which has two nerves, as we have shown in the dislocation of the shoulder;
and lift the heart which is located at the mouse [ailment], or where the patient's pain comes from towards the left, and let the elevations with which you lift the heart be along the heart, along the length of the body, and let the cauteries be along the width of the body.
Afterwards, insert the two burning nerves until the heart is pierced on the other side, and then pull out the cautery, and thus there will be four.
And if you wish, cauterize with the whole cautery with three nerves.
After the treatment, when it has discharged pus for a long time, and this is better than the other treatments mentioned above.
Cautery is of no use for a dropsical person, except in the manner which is called "asclytes".
When you treat it according to the methods we have described in the divisions, and your treatment does not help, then you must make four cauteries around the belly, and one on the stomach, and one on the liver, and one on the spleen, and two on the back along the spine, and one near the breast; and let the cautery be very close to the thickness of the heart.
Afterwards, leave the cautery open to discharge pus for a long time, and do not neglect the treatment of the patient after the cautery; and healing will be hastened, and the two intentions will be together with God's help.
The shape of the cautery for the belly should be the peg which we have previously shown; and that for the back should be olive-shaped, according to what is shown above.
When the feet are swollen in one who is dropsical, and are full of citrine water, it is necessary that you cauterize on the back of the foot between the little toe and the ring finger; and lift your hand with the cautery without turning.
And do not enter too deeply, lest the citrine water be burned, and let the cautery be according to this form:
Afterwards, make on the two legs two cauteries on each leg at the tip of the little toe; and let the cauteries be long, one below the knee in front and the other behind, in the middle of the leg;
and leave the cauteries open a long time without dressing, so that the water may flow out;
after the treatment of the other treatments that we have mentioned.
When looseness of the bowels comes from cold and moisture, so that the retentive and digestive powers which are in the stomach and in the intestine are weakened, and cannot be cured by methods of treatment; and you see the patient is well-bearing and of strong constitution, then make a large cautery on the stomach according to what has been spoken of above concerning the cautery of the stomach, with a circular cautery; and four small cauteries around the navel, along with one small, pointed cautery, and two cauteries on the hips.
And if you see abundant moisture and the patient suffering, then make a cautery on the wrist, and one cautery on each flank, and two small cauteries on the stomach near the large one, for the treatment is beneficial when there is good assistance.
Of the treatment of hemorrhoids
When hemorrhoids are in the fundament, one or more, and are old and are of large, cold, and moist corrupted humors, and are treated as we have said in the sections, and it does not help, then make cauteries: three on the spine of the back, those that are completely outside below the armpit little by little in a triangle, and one cautery below the navel two fingers;
and if you think that his stomach is cold, and the food does not digest, and one sees the face swell, then make one large cautery on the stomach, as it is said above, and another on the liver, and another on the spleen with the whole cautery spatula; and leave the cautery open a long time. After, cure the place until it is healed.
When you cut the thelul, heat the cautery which resembles a razor, and then put it, all burning, on that cut thelul; and leave your hand there until the cautery reaches the origin of the vein, from which the blood flows;
do this once or twice, and if there is much thelul, cauterize each one as we have said; afterwards cure with beneficial ointments until they are healed;
and if you cauterize with a large cautery on alchatim, it will have greater help.
When the patient cannot tolerate incision or opening, which we will describe in its place, such an illness arises that it cannot be healed except by cautery.
When a fistula develops in someone, and it is old and discharges pus and corrupted moisture, you should probe it entirely with a thin tent, and ensure you know exactly how deep the tent goes.
Then heat the cautery, which resembles a razor, and insert it into the fistula according to the depth the tent entered, and repeat the cautery until the rotten and corrupted flesh is burned, once, or twice, or three times, according to the need;
and beware of burning the nerves which are within, and the large veins.
If the fistula goes to the body of the bladder and the intestine, beware of these areas, and do not apply the fire except to fleshy areas, and remember that it is not penetrating;
Afterwards, treat the area until it is healed, and if the area is sealed, and the materials have been removed for a long time, then know that the area is completely healed;
and if the materials are not removed, know that the area is perforated, and the bone at the bottom is corrupted; and thus like one of those that we will mention in its place.
When cold pain comes to the kidneys, and from great flatulence, and he does not desire a woman, then you must cauterize him above the kidneys on one side and the other with the cautery iron that we have mentioned before;
and if we cauterize him in the middle, there will be three cauteries in a line, and they will provide greater help.
Of the bladder When the bladder is soft and weak from cold and moisture, so that the patient retains urine, then cauterize him on the outside over the bladder, where the hairs of the groin begin, one on the right and one on the left, and let each cautery be as long as the width of a thumb;
and make one cautery on the outside of the back, or two if you need it;
and let the cautery be peg-shaped according to the aforementioned form.
When the womb is cold and moist, and does not allow conception, and the flowers (menstruation) are corrupted and their timing delayed; and when they come, she feels great pain: then it is necessary that three cauteries be made around the buttocks, as we have said in the cautery of the bladder, and two cauteries outside the back;
and let the cautery be with a nail, as we have said.
When the viscous humors descend to the hip joint, and because of this it moves from its place, and the sign is that the thigh is longer than the other when measured together;
and the place of the separation is found empty, then you must cauterize the patient over the hip joint with one cautery resembling a circle, and bleed in front of the place around the joint as it turns, so that the joint is within the circle;
and let the cautery be like that with which one cauterizes the stomach.
And if this cautery is not present, make three cauteries of olive size, and let the cautery be as deep as all the others;
and treat it until it is healed.
of the hip pain When pain comes in the hip joint, and it is from cold and moisture, and the patient is treated with what we have said in the division and the treatment is ineffective, and the illness is old: then you must purge the patient of the gross humors with fetid pills, or other similar good pills. Afterwards, apply a cautery;
and the manner of the cautery is according to two methods: that is to say, with burning medicines, and fire cautery.
Fire cautery is done in many ways, of which one is this:
that you cauterize on the hip bone three triangular cauteries according to this form, and make them deep and large, and let there be between each cautery the thickness of a finger, and let the cauteries be olive-shaped;
sometimes a cautery is made in the middle on the head of the hip, wherefore there are four according to this form:
And if you wish, cauterize it with the circular cautery that we have mentioned before in the dislocation of the hip;
but do it in such a way that the circle contains the whole hip, and all the thick parts of the flesh are burned.
And this is the method used in sciatica, when the pain is in the hip, and does not reach down to the thigh or leg.
And if it reaches the thigh and leg, make two cauteries where the patient says the pain is, and one cautery above the ankle four fingers, on the left side a little;
and let the cautery be knife-shaped, and let the thickness of the flesh be burned;
and if the patient feels that the pain extends to the toes or nearly so, cauterize where he feels the pain three or four points with the cautery which is called "points". And if necessary, make more for him;
and if he knows that the pain is below the knee towards the thigh, make a cautery with a knife-shaped or circular cautery, and take great care in all your cauteries that you do not leave the cautery on so long that you burn the nerves and the large arteries, and that you do not cause the patient greater harm and contraction.
And I myself have seen many who have made a cautery on the ankle of the foot, and left it on so long that the leg was entirely swollen, and the foot also, and the whole foot was pierced and corrupted. After a bowel movement from which he died.
And if the pain is in two places together, make a cautery in one and in the other, according to this manner.
And the wise men said, in the cautery of the hip, of which this is the manner, make one such iron and let it be at the head as thick as a hazelnut, or a little less, and let it be between the ribs and let it be from one rib to the other in width the quantity of a thumb's knuckle;
and let the ribs be open on two sides, and let them be also like knots, and let there be a well-made iron handle;
and this is the form:
And let it be heated until it is all red and glowing, and then put it on the hip joint that is ill, and let it be turned on the healthy side;
and cauterize it once with a round cautery and leave it for three days; and then make a plaster of butter, and leave the wound open a long time; after the treatment with ointment until it is healed.
Albucasis says that we use little of this cautery because of the fear of its effect, and we see few who use it;
and yet it is one of the good cauteries, for those who can endure it, and where it is appropriate.
The cautery of burning medicine is that you make an instrument with notches into which the edge of the door descends, and let it be of bronze or iron with a long side, and in height it has two inches, and between each has the quantity of the thickness of a finger; and let them be open outside and above, and join together according to this form:
Afterwards, place the box on the hip of the patient lying on his healthy side, and press your hand very much on the box of the hip; afterwards pour between the two circles of hot water which has been heated in the fire one pot, and let it remain one hour, and let the patient suffer the heat and burning from it.
For there is found a burning as of fire;
and when the burning is past, lift your hand with the instrument and lift the hip from the warm water, and leave it thus three days, and apply butter until that which is black from the burn is removed; and leave it three days so that the pus may be drawn out;
and this would be the last aid after the treatment with ointments until he is healed.
And if the pain has extended to the thigh or to the leg, make for him an instrument that holds water according to what you have done to the hip equally;
and this is the manner of hot water, and I have written it in the treatise on the rectification of medicine. Take alkali and quicklime, as much of one as of the other, and grind them together, and put them in a new pot. where there is a small hole outside so that the point of a razor can enter it;
where there is a small hole outside so that the point of a razor can enter it; and place on that pot another pot well sealed, and put on top alkali and lime and sweet water, until there is about two fingers above the powders when you have pressed it well with your hand;
and leave it thus until water descends and drips into the sealed pot, then take all that water, and pour it over lime and alkali as before.
And then it will be very strong water and is administered in many medical operations and in cauterizations of other members.
For it does the same work as fire, and there are other medicines with which one cauterizes the hip well, such as tesisie and honey and anacardi and lime with soap, all these things mixed together.
And Galen tells us of a cure by which a man was cured of hip pain and sciatica, and he praises it greatly, and says that no other cure was done, and that he was healed at once when this cure was performed, and he was bathed as he teaches afterwards.
And he says in this manner that you take fresh and dry green litharge, and grind it very finely with one ounce of fat, and put it on the hip and thigh and leg where the pain is, and bind it;
and leave it for three hours, and according to the amount that the patient no longer feels the burning.
And then make him enter the bath until his body is slightly warmed, and make him enter the bed, and the pain will all leave and he will be healed.
And know that no one should use a cautery of such medicines, unless it is after the evacuation of the body.
And Dioscorides says that when the sciatic vein is cauterized with goat dung, it helps greatly;
and the cautery should be done in this manner. Take wool and soak it in old oil, and place it on the hollow which is between the thumb of the foot and the other which is called foscile.
Afterwards take dry goat dung, and heat it in the fire until it is charcoal, and put it on the wool, and leave it until it is extinguished;
and do it again in the same way, and do not cease to do so until you think by feeling that it reaches to the hip, and that the pain is ceased;
and this manner of cautery is called "goat cautery".
of the pain of the back
When pain comes to the back, either from a fall or from a blow or from too great an evacuation, or from similar spread cold matter, in none of these instances is cautery worthwhile, except for that which comes from the infusion of cold matter.
It is necessary that after the patient is purged of fetid pills or other similar things, that three lines be marked with ink on his back, where the pain holds, and in each line five cauteries or more according to the strength and the quantity that the patient can endure;
and let the cautery be done according to the cautery which is called "points";
and if you wish, make three cauteries or four with the medium nail cautery according to this form:
Many times this illness comes to small children, and the sign of the beginning is that they have shortness of breath when they rise, and fear; and you find in the last spine of the back and in us the appearance that comes upon the other spines.
When you see this and you wish to cure it, cauterize it with the circular cautery according to this form. So that the cautery touches each part of the spine equally.
And if you wish, cauterize around the spine with the pointed cautery II or III lines, and let the points be close to each other.
After, cure the place until it is healed according to what we have said, and beware that you do not apply cautery to a gibbosity that is in a spasm of the nerve.
Of the pain of the joints
When joint pain is from moisture that is spread to each limb of the body, and when pain comes in the feet, which the physicians properly call "podagra," and when it is from a cold cause and cures by medicines cannot cure it, then it is cured by cautery in this manner:
Make many cauteries around the joint of the foot, and let the cauteries be olive-shaped according to this form:
And if there is need that you cauterize on the surface of the foot, make a cautery there, the whole cautery that one calls a "point". And if the pains come down to the knees and to the other joints, and this happens many times, make cauteries on each knee, three or four cauteries on each side, with the whole olive-shaped cautery;
and if you need more, make more, but do not hold your hand there any longer than until the thickness of the skin is burned.
And if the pains descend to the knee and to the back, administer the cautery that we have described in its chapter.
And if the pains are in the hands, make points around the wrist, two lines;
and if any pain remains in the fingers, make points on each joint and on the hair of the hand;
and if the pains reach the elbows or the shoulders, cauterize each part, and give good care to the patient and administer medicines.
For if you give him good care and purge phlegm, he will be healed with God's help.
When a rupture occurs in the groin, and the bowels descend into the scrotum, and this is recent, it is necessary that when you treat it, he should not eat that day; and that he use things that loosen the bowels, so that the feces descend from his belly;
afterwards make him sit on his back between your hands, and tell him to hold his breath until the bowels are replaced, and push them back with your fingers, and make an incision below the rupture on the pubic bone, and with a mark that resembles half a circle above the body;
then heat the cautery of which this is the form:
until it is white and gives off sparks. Then replace the bowels in their place; and the assistant hold his hand above so that they do not return;
and spread the patient's thighs well, and place a cushion under him and a servant on his thighs, and another on his chest who holds his hands;
then place the cautery on the mark with your whole hand, and hold it straight and hold it until you reach the bone, and if you do not reach it the first time, then begin again another time until you reach the bone; and guard yourself subtly that the bowel does not protrude when you do the cautery; that you do not burn it; and that the patient does not die because of this, or other harms.
And know that when you do not reach the bone with the cautery, your work is worthless.
And it is necessary that the cautery of children be small according to their size, and of adults also large according to their size;
after three days, treat the cauterized area with butter until the burn is gone;
afterwards, treat it with other ointments until it is healed, and the patient lies on his back for forty days until the wound is well sealed;
and it is necessary that his nourishment be light for a long time, so that his bowels do not move when he is urged to go to the privy.
And after forty days, when he wants to get up, apply a well-made bandage, and keep it on for forty more days;
and let him have good rest, that he works little and guards against too great repletion of drink and food, and too loud laughter;
and when he has followed this instruction he is entirely healed.
And I will describe the treatment of cutting in its chapter.
When ruptures occur in other bellies and are known, and you see that they are not growing, then make a cautery with the cautery iron according to its size, and let a third of the heart be burned; after the treatment according to what we have said;
and some of the ancients have said that one should cauterize it with a three-angled cautery iron according to this form:
but first mark the place with ink and make a line across the width above the rupture, and another outside, and hold your hand in the middle with the whole cautery iron.
But the first cautery is lighter and milder.
of old pain in any limb When pain comes in any limb, from a fall or a blow, and that pain lasts a long time, and the treatment of medicine is of no use, then it must be cauterized with the cautery which is called "points," and let the cautery be according to the length of the limb and its smallness and its weakness and its strength and its location of twists and its pain.
If he is healed by the first cautery, it is good;
if not, begin another cautery on top of that one, for such is the custom that it must move to the limb that is close to it, wherefore it is necessary that you make the cauteries until the patient is healed.
Lepers are sometimes helped by cautery with great help, and likewise the illness that comes from the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy.
When you see it needing cauterization, take heed if the illness is at the beginning, and if it is cured according to what we have said in the division, and does not descend or remain, and you doubt that the corruption may overwhelm the whole patient, then make five cauteries on the head: one in the middle of the head at the nape, and another towards the forehead at the hairline; and two on the two temples, and one behind on the nape;
and leave your hand there until the cautery reaches the bone, and until the scabs come out so that the vapors of the gross humors can escape;
and cauterize on the temple according to what is described above.
And if the leprosy is spread everywhere; and it is manifestly apparent, then you must cauterize it with the cauteries we have described on the head, and one cautery on the bridge of the nose, and two cauteries on the spine of the neck, and six cauteries on the spine of the back, and one large one on the rump and another nearby, and two on the two shoulders; and two on the buttocks, and two on the breasts, and one on each joint of the hands and feet, and on the hollows of the hands;
and beware of the nerves that are on the heel, that you do not burn them;
and sometimes one makes a cautery on the bone of the wrist, and another on the bone of the stomach, and another on the liver.
And know that the more cauteries you make, the more help you give, and the more it benefits;
and know that the sick person does not feel any pain from the cautery as healthy people feel it, because the body is already entirely corrupted.
And it is necessary that the cauteries be large and small according to the limbs and joints, according to what you will find in the shapes of the irons.
After, cure the place with barley flour mixed with honey and other cures until it is healed.
When swelling comes in any limb and is treated with medicines and oils and plasters, and it is not healed, then make cauteries on the limb according to the size of the limb;
and let the cautery be somewhat deep in the thickness of the flesh; then cure it with ointments until it is healed.
And sometimes a cautery is made on the hand and on the foot and on the back, at the exit of the nerve that moves the limb, and thus the swelling is removed;
and yet let no one meddle with it unless he is knowledgeable of the limbs and the exits of the nerves moving the body.
When the illness that is called "albaras" is old, and the devices of medicine are of no use, then cauterize it with a cautery a little deeply, according to the thickness of the heart, until the whiteness is removed, and its color is changed;
then cure it with flour of vetch and lentils with rose oil and plantain leaves, and pigeon blood and swallow blood, of each one part; and let it all be mixed together, and bound with a cloth, and let it be aired in the place until it is healed.
The cure of cancer by cautery
When cancer comes at the beginning, and you wish to stop it, then cauterize it with a cautery that resembles a circle, all around the edge of the cancer.
And nevertheless the wise men say that one should also cauterize in the middle of the cancer;
and yet that does not seem good to me, for I fear that it will be ulcerated and corrupted, and I have already seen that happen sometimes;
and a more straightforward thing is that it be cauterized around, with the cautery that is called "circular", as we have said in many cauteries.
When someone has an illness which is called "adubelati", and it is slow to mature either because of the superfluity it produces or because of the age of the patient when he is decrepit (that is to say, very old) and he has little blood, or because of the season; and you see it hasten to mature: then cauterize it around with many small, pricking cauteries; afterwards leave it thus. For it will hasten to mature.
And if you see it pierce with the whole cautery, then heat the cautery of which this is the form:
And place your hand in the middle of that illness which is called "adubelati" until the cautery has pierced the heart, and let the cautery be such that the patient feels it externally in such a way that the course of the corruption is alleviated.
Afterwards cure it until it is perfectly healed.
There is another kind of illness which is called "corrodens", and it is nothing other than a consumption of a limb, for it eats the limbs just as fire eats dry wood.
If you see this illness in a place that can withstand cautery with fire, then heat the cautery pins, small and large, according to what is needed for the place where the illness is;
After cauterizing on all sides until you eradicate all the corruption, and nothing of it remains, so that all that is corrupted is removed.
And then leave it for three days, and apply to the cauterized places crushed sulfur with oil until the burns from the fire are removed, and all the corruption.
Then treat with ointments that generate flesh.
And if you see after three days that healthy flesh does not grow, that is good;
and if not, then repeat the cautery on what remains of the corrupted areas.
And this ailment has sometimes been cured with a sharp medicine instead of fire cautery;
but still, fire cautery is of greater help, and I have already described the treatment with a sharp medicine in the section: take it when you need it.
of the swellings that come on the feet Very often it happens that on the feet, from the outside, a disease arises which is called "clos" according to our understanding, and it is a large, foul thing that injures the foot.
And the cautery for this disease is according to two methods. That is to say, cautery by fire, and cautery by hot water.
Cautery by fire is that you heat a cautery iron as if it were a goose feather, and it should be made of good iron in a measure that it can encompass the nail on all sides, and that it has fine edges;
afterwards put it, all hot, on the nail, and turn your hand all around the nail until it reaches the bottom of the nail; and leave it thus for three days until it begins to shed pus; then make a plaster of wild mallows crushed with oil, and leave the plaster on all night, and the nail will fall and be uprooted from its roots.
Then treat the area with flesh-generating ointment until it is healed.
And if they are inverted outwards from the body, and this often happens in hands and feet, then you must apply a cautery of hot water; and it is in this manner: take a chain of brass or iron, or a goose feather, and place it on the nail and the althelul, that is to say, warts; and place the chain so that it encompasses it entirely, then place a little hot water on it, and hold your hand well, and press your hand turning so that the edge of the chain reaches the root of the nail, and the hot water can find a way deep to the root;
and let the patient suffer the burning of the hot water a little for an hour; then leave it thus, and it will be uprooted entirely with its roots.
Do this one after another, until you have eradicated all those that are on the body, then treat them with ointments that generate flesh.
When someone trembles from coldness of the nerves, or from quartan fever or other, you must make four cauteries or four on the spine of the back, one cautery between each spine; and one cautery on the feet, and one on the stomach with the olive cautery;
then the trembling will cease, and the healing of the cold illness will hasten.
Sometimes there appear on the outside of the body boils, or foul pustules, which come from large corrupted matters.
If so, when they appear, one must cauterize on each head of the pustule: a subtle cautery of myrtle wood, of which the point is held in the fire, or of the root of long birthwort, or with a lenticular cautery.
And sometimes they are cauterized at the beginning when they appear, in this manner, and they cannot grow any further, but the superfluities from which they come are broken up, and they are healed;
but it is necessary that this be done after the evacuation of blood.
Often there are great flows of blood from the artery which is cut in the wound that comes from a burn, or in the incision of an abscess, or in the cautery of a limb, and similar things; and it is a very difficult thing to staunch.
And however when this happens to someone, quickly put your index finger on the wound of the vein, and press hard until the blood is calmed under your finger, and no drop comes out anymore;
then put in the fire several small and large olive-shaped cauteries until they are all red;
then take one, either large or small according to the wound and the place where the artery is broken, and put the cautery on that vein where you hold your finger, and hold the cautery there until the blood is stopped.
And if it bursts forth when you lift your finger from the vein, and the cautery is extinguished, quickly take another of the cauteries which are in the fire.
And do not cease to do this one after the other until the blood is stopped;
and be careful that you do not burn the nerve which is nearby, and that no other harm comes to the patient;
and know that when blood flows from the artery, one cannot easily stop it, especially when the artery is large, unless it is by one of the four methods that we have mentioned: either by cautery, or by extraction when it is not treated, or by tight binding with thread, or by medicines applied which have the power to stop blood; and let it be tied and squeezed tightly.
He who attempts to staunch the bleeding by tightly binding with cloths or by applying burning things, or other similar things, will find little or no benefit.
And if this happens to someone and he does not have a surgeon or medicine present, he should place his index finger on the wound of the vein as we have said, and press firmly until the bleeding is stopped above the wound and above the vein; and not move the finger, but wet it with cold water often, that it be very cold until the blood is congealed and thickened and stopped;
and then do what he needs to do with cauteries and medicines.
We have told you in the first chapter all illnesses in which it is necessary to use fire cautery, or burning medicine, and the occasions, and the causes, and the instruments, and the forms of cauteries;
and I placed that chapter from the head to the feet, and I will go in this chapter by the same method so that one finds more easily what one wants.
And before I begin this, dear son, it is necessary that you learn that in this chapter there is more peril and fear than in the first of cauteries, and therefore greater caution is needed.
For in the work of this chapter there is often evacuation of blood in opening a vein, and in the incision of an abscess, and in the treatment of wounds, and in the extraction of arrows, and in the incision of a stone, and similar things; where there is doubt and fear, and death comes to many.
And I warn you that you do not undertake folly. For many kinds of people come for treatment. some come who are so afflicted with their illness that they die easily because of the frenzy they find in their illness, and because of the severity of its malice; and of these one must be afraid.
And of these there are some who give you their senses, and say: Wait, I am healed"; and the illness is spiteful.
It is not fitting that you consent to those who come to you who have this manner, but place greater trust in your honor than in your greed, and do not work foolishly but wisely on that which you are certain, and from which you can have profit and praise;
and use prognostication and indication in the treatment of your patients to which salvation is turned;
and that will help you to acquire good reputation, and glory, and memory of praise.
Dearest son, Our Lord grant you good understanding and righteousness, and may He inspire you with the holy inspiration of His hand, amen.
Now I have ordered this chapter in sections, according to what is before, or the chapter on cauteries, which I have described to you from head to foot, so that you may find more easily what you will need.
Know that this illness often comes to children at birth, and when the midwife pulls the child's head too hard;
and sometimes it comes from a hidden cause that is unknown.
And I never saw this illness except in children, and for all those I have seen, death hastened; and therefore it seems to me that I should leave the work in such treatments.
And I saw a child whose head was full of water, and the head swelled each day until it could not support it;
and the moisture grew so much that he died, and this moisture is gathered under the bone on the dura mater, between the brain and the bone;
and the procedure is such that if the moisture is between the brain and the bone, and the abscess is small, that you make a large incision in the middle of the head;
and let it be as long as two fingers, so that the moisture flows;
and here is the form of the spatula:
If the moisture is more abundant, and the abscess is larger, then make two incisions in the manner of a cross, according to this form:
And if the moisture is under the bone, and the signs that you see the sutures of the head open on each side, and the water spurts out when you press it from the inside with your hand, and this is not restored to you: then you must make three incisions in the middle of the head in this manner:
And after the incision, draw all the moisture out. Afterwards, dress the incisions with cloths and powders, and apply wine and oil, and leave it so until the fifth day;
then undress it, and treat the wound with tents and ointments, and let the head be bandaged evenly, and give the patient dry meat, little by little, until the limb is strengthened and healed.
And another method of incision is that you observe where the size of the abscess appears, and the collection of water;
for sometimes it is in front; sometimes behind; sometimes on the right; and sometimes on the left.
Therefore, cut where the abscess appears, and the collection of water, and cut according to your ability;
and beware that you do not cut the artery; and a flow of blood comes, so that the patient dies from the flow of blood and the evacuation of moisture.
When someone has an illness called "catarrh" in the eyes or chest, and the illness is long-standing, and medical treatment does not help, then the final treatment is cautery, along with cutting the two arteries.
Therefore, when you wish to cut them, the patient should throw back his head; then rub the area with a rough cloth until the arteries appear, then the patient should constrict his neck with the whole cloth; then look where the vein beats, and the locations of the one and the other are behind the ears, and they are somewhat hidden;
then mark the places with ink, then cut one and the other with a sharp spatula on two sides, until the cut reaches the bone, and this should be across the width of the head.
And if you wish, place the spatula under the artery and cut above it, cutting as if with two fingers across.
And when the vein is cut, the blood spurts upwards continuously.
And if the artery is not felt, you must measure the space of three fingers, then mark with ink and cut down to the bone;
and the amount of blood to be let out is six ounces, and perhaps a little more or less, depending on what the patient can endure, and the repletion of the artery;
then look at the wound: if there remains on the bone a point of the sheath, cut it so that no abscess forms there, then bind the wound tightly and treat it with ointment until it is healed.
of migraine When chronic migraine occurs, and acute catarrh, due to the moisture of the tears and the heat in the temples and an ancient raging toothache and similar things, and it is treated with various medical remedies and none of this helps, then we bleed the arteries of the temples and cauterize them, as we have recounted.
And the manner of their extraction is that the patient should raise the hairs of his temples, and attend to the artery that appears in the temple, for it appears well by its beating, and is little hidden except in some men who are too cold;
and if it is hidden, let the patient constrict his neck with some cloths, then rub the area with some rough cloth, and bathe the area with warm water until the artery appears clearly; then take the spatula of which this is the form: then lightly scrape the skin until you reach the artery, then draw it upwards with forceps, and separate it well from the tissues that are underneath it on each side;
and if the artery is thin, turn it with the point of the hook, then cut it from that part according to the quantity of two fingers. For if it is not cut, the blood will not flow completely.
And draw off six ounces of blood, down to three;
and if the artery is large, it is necessary that you tie it in two places with a strong double silk thread, so that putrefaction does not come before the closing of the wound, and excessive bleeding occurs;
then cut the excess which is between the two ligatures at that very time, and then, if you wish, cauterize it with a cuticular cautery to the bone until the edges are cut;
and this is the lesser work, if the patient does not have a fever and is of a warm complexion. For cautery helps to dry up the humors: therefore it is of greater help for humors.
Where it is necessary for the extraction of arteries that one fill the place with old cotton and place on top well-made tents;
and when they are untied, let it be treated with dry medicines that cause flesh to grow, and with tents, until it is healed;
and if blood flows from the artery as long as you work there, hasten to cauterize it, or fill the place with vitriol and press it with your hand so that the blood is stopped; and if you do not have that present, put your finger on the place until the blood is congealed, and rinse the place with cold water until the blood stops, and let it be extracted as it should be;
And there should be one finger's breadth of thickness between the two knives, and then when you have marked the two places, and you place the burning iron on until it reaches the bone, and cut the vein in two places; and let them be separated between the two ends, for it is not completely sealed by this cautery all the way through;
and this is the form of the cautery:
and that which is milder and easier in the extraction of the artery is that you cauterize the vein with this cutting cautery on two sides, but the cuts should be thick to retain their heat longer. For when the instrument is too thin, it retains its heat less.
of tears When the tears from the eyes are descending from the veins that are on the top of the head, and no medicinal treatment helps, and you see the face of the patient redden, and he feels throbbing in the forehead like trembling; and his eye is swollen and moist so that the hairs of the eyelids have fallen out, and the eyelids are heated and burned by the heat of the tears, then this treatment is necessary. And the ancients called it "contused treatment," and it is that you make the patient who has this illness shave the hairs that he has on his forehead, then make three incisions on the forehead equally along the length of the forehead;
And the ancients called it "contused treatment," and it is that you make the patient who has this illness shave the hairs that he has on his forehead, then make three incisions on the forehead equally along the length of the forehead; and let one of the incisions be like two fingers in the middle of the forehead going down to the nose, and the other two at the two temples above the eyelids, and beware of cutting the arteries that are on the two sides above the eyelids;
and keep your hand away from the junction of the two jaws, and let each wound be the size of three joined fingers across;
and have ready a piece of sponge and many cloths to wipe away the blood, then place the sharp spatula on the two sides of which is the shape:
from the incision that is towards the temple to the second incision; and scrape all the flesh that is between the two incisions to all the surface that is on the bone, then do likewise from the middle incision to the other second, and then remove this spatula. then place in the first incision the instrument which is called "cultellary", and it is very sharp on one side, and on the other side is smooth, not sharp, and this is the shape:
And place the cutting side towards the flesh next to the heart, and the smooth side towards the bone, and put it in until it reaches the middle incision.
And cut all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes until the incision is continuous to that which appears from the heart, and then likewise do in the middle incision to the other end;
and then draw out the blood equally, and press the place for the blood taken;
then put in each incision a tent of old cotton, and put on cloths moistened in wine and oil and vinegar, and watch that hot abscesses do not come there;
and on the third day untie the ligature, and apply a great quantity of warm water, then treat it with basilicon ointment with rose oil, and other treatments with which one treats wounds, until it is healed.
When someone has an acute catarrh habitually, and you see the eyes watery and small, and weakening the sight, and the eyelids burned; and the hair falls out, and in the head there is sharp pain, and the patient sneezes; then know by these symptoms that this matter and that catarrh comes forth from many veins, and the best treatment that there is, is this.
And it is that you instruct the patient to raise his forehead, then make a large incision in the middle of the forehead, and another of about one finger wide. And begin from the incision of the left temple to the right temple, and let the incision reach the bone; and keep your hand away from the nerves of the temples that move when eating;
and when the bone is uncovered, wipe away all the blood with a sponge, and then separate the two lips of the incision and place old cotton and linen tents there; then bind on cloths moistened with wine and oil, and beware of a hot abscess;
when it is removed, you must rub the bone until flesh begins to grow there, then treat it with drying things, which cause flesh to grow.
In this manner: take two parts of wheat flour, and four parts of colophony, and make a plaster; and apply it to these wounds to make flesh grow everywhere.
of the stuffing of the ears
All that falls into the ears is one of four things: either grains, or an animal, or a mine stone or something similar like iron; or seeds, such as lentils, beans, peas; or flowing things such as water and pus and similar things.
When a stone or other kind of thing falls into the ear that does not adhere to the ear, nor grow in the ear, put the ear in the sun.
If you see the stone, instill a little violet oil or sesame oil, then proceed with extraction; and make him sneeze with hellebore, and plug his nostrils when the sneezing comes, and place pieces of cloth or wool around the ear; and hold the ear upwards.
Often great strength comes from this treatment;
and if strength does not come, then administer extraction with fine forceps, of which this is the form:
If it leaps out with the forceps, it is good;
if not, then administer extraction with a fine hook of small curvature;
and if it does not leap out by this, then make a chain of bronze and put the head of the chain into the hole of the ear firmly, and stop that which is around the chain with soft wax so that the wind cannot enter with the chain; then pull it out forcefully, for very often it comes out as we have said;
and if it does not come out in this manner, then take birdlime, and place it on some instrument which is sharp for doing this, and put a bit of cotton around it; then press the birdlime onto the stone or whatever it may be, and pull it out.
And if it does not leap out by all these things that we have said, then hasten to split the ear before a hot abscess and spasm come;
and the manner of the splitting is that you first bleed the patient from the cephalic vein, and draw out blood according to the measure of his strength, then make the patient sit between your hands and turn his ear upwards, and make a small split at the root of the ear by the fat or the dependent area; and let the split be like a crescent moon, until you reach the stone, then remove it according to your ability, and suck it out quickly with your mouth;
and cure it until it is healed.
And if it is a grain that is inside and it swells, administer extraction;
and if it cannot come out, then administer a thin spatula according to this form: and administer incision of that grain.
But do not do this when you think that the grain is moist because of the moisture of the ear, until you have made many pieces;
then extract it with fine tweezers and suction, as we have said, so that the extraction is easy.
Then in the water that falls into the ear, the patient should first use sneezing powder, and fill the ear with old cotton. And let him lie on that same ear where the water is. If it leaps out because of this, it is good.
If not, take many stones, according to the length of your little finger, and light, and heat them a little in the fire; and let the patient put one in the opening of his ear, and jump on it with his feet on the other side, and strike with another stone on the stone which is in the ear; and do not cease doing this from stone to stone until all the water comes out, and thus it will leap out entirely;
and if you wish, take a reed, and put one end in the ear, and take the other end with fire until the most of the reed is burned;
then do likewise with other reeds until all the water comes out, as we have said of the stone.
In the extraction of the beast, if it is of small body, like a flea and similar things, cure it as we have said in the division;
but if it is of large body that one can feel it, then administer extraction with tweezers; and this is the easiest thing to remove that is in the ear.
In the extraction of worms lodged in the ears, when you cure it as we have said in the division and in the treatment of distillations, and the cure does not help, then you must look at the ear in the sun: if any worms appear there, then draw them out with fine tweezers, and if they do not appear, then take the cannula of which here is the shape:
And let it be narrow below and wide above. And put the finest end into the ear according to the amount the patient can tolerate, then suck strongly on the whole cannula; do this often until all the worms come out.
And if they do not obey in coming out, then stuff around the cannula with cotton as I have said for the stone;
and if they do not jump out as we have said, then administer distillations which the ancients have tested in killing worms, and you will find them in the treatise on distillations;
and so distil your oils and your medicines into the ear with this instrument, of which here is the form as you see: And let it be of silver or of bronze, narrow below with one small hole, and open above for distilling;
and to press the distillation inside with a well-made bronze instrument for this, and if you wish take a razor and wrap cotton neatly around the point; then pour your oil or your juice, and what you wish of your medicines, into the reed, and let the reed be in the ear;
then put the razor inside with the cotton, and press your hand moderately until the oil is distilled or completely in the ear; and let the patient feel it inside, and let the distillation be heated a little over the fire before it is distilled into the ear; and take care that it is not too cold, for the medicine would not be so good.
Of the deafness of the ears
Some children are born who have no opening in their ears;
and this same thing happens to men by the stopping of a wound, or of flesh growing inside the ear, and this stopping comes sometimes deep into the ear, so that one cannot see it;
and sometimes the opening is slightly obstructed, and one sees it well.
That which comes deep within, so that one cannot see it, is of difficult healing in many conditions, and in that which one sees, it is necessary that you put the ear of the patient in the sun; and look inside: if you see the obstruction clearly, then work with all this spatula of which here is the form:
And let it be sharp and cutting in front and behind, completely smooth, so that it does not injure the ear;
if the obstruction is of raw flesh or body of the ear, then hold it with fine tweezers, and cut it lightly, until that flesh is completely removed.
And if the obstruction is deep in the ear, then take a thin, light rasp and heat it a little in the fire, then put it into the body of the ear.
If you feel the obstruction from which the patient feels pain in hearing, pierce lightly, and be careful not to injure the nerves of the ear;
then put into the ear a tent according to the width of the opening, and moisten it in Egyptian ointment. Do this each day until the wound is healed, or take a tent and moisten it in rose water, and sprinkle on powdered vitriol;
and if you see the ear swollen, then you must remove the tent and insert another tent moistened in a cerate made of rose oil and wax, until the swelling is removed; then treat it until it is healed.
And if a flow of blood comes, then dip a sponge and cloths in cold water, and put it on the ear, and use other treatments that stop the flow of blood which are in the treatment of distillations.
This hailstone that comes in the eyelids when they are moist and dry, then you must stretch them with forceps and pincers, and cut it with a spatula from its roots; then put crushed vitriol on the place.
And if blood flows out, cauterize it with a fine lenticular cautery, and cauterization after incision is better;
and often they return, when something remains of their roots; and when they are cauterized by fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
of the hail Often, things appear in the eyelids that resemble hail in shape and hardness, and because of this, this disease is called "hail," and it is a collection of thick moisture in the eyelid above and below; the procedure is as follows:
the procedure is as follows: observe whether the hail moves from one side to the other, and this is easy to know;
then make an incision, then lightly scrape each part, then grasp it with forceps, and cut it.
If you cannot cut it without piercing the eyelid a little, it will not harm the patient;
and if the wound is large, close it with a suture, and treat it until it is healed;
and if it is small, do not use force, for ointments will quickly restore it and generate flesh.
And if the hailstone descends inside the ear towards the upper part, invert the eyelid, and extract the hailstone with forceps, and cut and press on either side;
and if the eyelid is separated by the incision, it does not matter;
and when the hailstone is removed, wash the eye with salt water, and treat the area with flesh-generating remedies until the patient is healed.
of the fat of the eyes Exinach is a grease that is generated in the webs of the eyelids, and this happens more to children than to other people, and it greatly harms their eyes, and they get cataracts in the mornings, and they cannot look at the sunlight because tears rush to their eyes;
and therefore they lie on their faces constantly, and sleep thus, and their eyelids under their eyebrows are moist because the swelling and appearance are covered by the exinach which appears in the eye. And when you press the area with your fingers and feel the exinach between them.
And the manner of the work is that the patient puts his head in your lap;
and then take a linen cloth, and prepare a tent in the manner of a circle according to the quantity that contains exinach of each part, then put it on him; and press with your fingers on one side and the other, so that the exinach is gathered in the middle of the circle;
then cut in the middle of the moisture with a sharp spatula a slit of the width, and it should not be larger than the wound that one makes to the opening of a vein;
and cut the skin deeply until you reach the exinach; and in many situations exinach comes from the slit, according to the form of a piece of white fat.
Then extract it all in one piece with a piece of lint cloth between your fingers on the outside, and turn your hand to the right and to the left until it is loose;
and be careful not to push into the slit, that you do not come with the whole spatula all the way to the eye, that you do not injure it.
And if the exinach does not appear at the beginning of the slit, slightly enlarge the slit a little until it appears;
then extract it as we have said, then moisten cloths in vinegar and water, and apply to the place, and bind with bandages.
And there are some men who grind salt and apply it to corrupt that moisture which has remained.
Then treat it until it is healed.
And if a hot abscess appears at the place, treat it with soothing plasters until it is healed.
of the hairs of the scrotum When hairs grow in the scrotum that are not natural, and are thickened, they harm the eyes and cause various diseases, such as habitual watering and softening of the scrotum and albuginea, to the point that it causes destruction of the eyes;
and the treatment is according to four methods: either by cautery with fire, or by a sharp medicine as described in the chapter on cautery, and it is done either by incision and suture or by cauterization, as I will explain.
It is necessary that you place the head of the patient on your lap, then turn the scrotum towards your left hand;
If it is turned, that is good; if not, then put a needle with thread on it; and let this be near the edge of the scrotum where the hairs grow near those hairs, and pull the thread over it with the scrotum, and turn it back to its proper position;
then cut in the part under the scrotum, under the joined hairs, with the cutting spatula, from the large tear to the small one;
then pull out the thread, and place under the scrotum a small tent of cotton and cloth, then mark on the scrotum a figure of an arch, like a myrtle leaf, and however it is necessary that the figure be according to the quantity that you want to raise the scrotum which is divided for all.
And if there is someone who needs to cut a large quantity of the scrotum according to how the scrotum is softened;
then cut with the spatula on the two lines that you have marked, and begin from the large tear down to the small one; and let one of the incisions be near the natural hairs in the thickness of a root, then put the onion in one of the two angles of the heart, then peel it all;
then bring together the two lips with a suture of a needle with a fine wool thread, and wipe away the blood, and cut off the superfluity of the threads above the two eyebrows with some sticky substance, if you want to do this;
and if not, then do not worry about it, then leave the suture and the threads for three or four days;
then treat the wound without suture with drying and constricting things, for the paper rises at the bottom of the wound and its joining, but the suture is better (as the ancients said), and this is work without fear; and there is another method:
and there is another method: and it is that you mark the paper with a figure which is like a myrtle leaf, as we have recounted, at three inches apart according to the form which is here:
then cut what is above with small, equal forces according to the form which is here:
And if you are not able to hold the tongs, and the thing is not even, then take a needle with one thread, and put it in the middle of the figure; and put one other thread near the large tear, and the second thread near the small one, and bring together between your fingers the threads equally;
then lift your hand evenly, and lift all the skin on which you have marked, as we have recounted, then bring together the two lips of the wound by stitching, and treat it until it is healed;
and if an abscess comes to your incision, then soothe it with cerate and similar softening ointments;
and sometimes it happens that the hairs of the wound are turned inward;
then you must use what we have said about the incision;
but the stitching in one and the other is more skillful.
The treatment of cankers is according to this form: and that is that you turn the wound and cut it inside according to what I have said, and then make two cankers by art, and two fine threads as long as the wound and as wide as the spatula is; and cut at the two ends of the two parts where you hold the threads;
then carefully join one and the other above what protrudes from the wound of the eye, and tightly pull the two cankers of the two parts; and leave it thus for some days, and the skin which is tightened will die and wither and rot, until it falls off by itself.
If it is slow, then cut it with force, then cure it until it is healed;
and when the wound is healed, and the membrane is lifted, and the hairs will no longer prick;
and this is the shape of the two cankers that you will make according to this figure, and according to this quantity of length and width:
the procedure is such that you take a fine needle, and thread it with a soft and fine silk thread; then join the ends and knot them subtly, and let the length of the threads be one palm long;
then arrange in the cavity another fine silk thread briefly, and knot the ends of the thread;
then let the patient put his head in your lap;
and let it be near the sun so that the work is clear, for it is a subtle and delicate work, then put the needle with the thread into the root of the added hair, and make it pierce the skin quickly until you draw it above the natural hair;
then pull the hair up to the cavity, and put that hair into the cavity, if there is one or two or three or more;
then withdraw your hand until the hairs come out with the cavity into the skin along with the natural hair.
And if the cavity is pulled and the hairs do not come out with it, then pull the cavity downwards with all the thread that you have placed there, until the cavity comes out of the hole above and you see it with the vision of your eye;
then you will pull the cavity and the thread, and close the eye and leave it closed for two or three days, until the hair heals in its place and the flesh grows over it;
and if the hair is small, accompany it with a long hair from the natural hair, and let it grow with that one or you leave it, until it is lengthened and then remove it.
of the corruption of the eye When this illness which is called "aleacrati" or corruption comes to the eye, there are two kinds:
one natural, and the other unnatural.
And it happens suddenly from a wound, or a cut or a cautery, and by similar things.
And the manner of working on it is that you split that suture, and separate its lips, and put linen tents inside, and bind it until it is healed;
and it is not necessary that you use in its treatment things that dry and constrict. For if you do this, the illness returns worse than before;
but work with softening things, such as fenugreek; and rosewater or mallow and linseed cooked, and diachylon ointment melted in some oil, and wrap a tent, and cure it with this.
And the treasure of your cure is that you take care that it does not heal according to the form it was before;
and these works that we have mentioned are nothing but remedies for this illness, that it may not return according to the form it was before.
This illness which is below, which is truly called "axacrati", and is natural and accidental.
The accidental [occurrence] comes from a wound and from a fissure and from a cautery and from similar things;
and the method of working on it is that you take a needle, in which there is a double thread, and stick it into the flesh, and make it pierce from the left tear duct as far as the right, so that the thread comes out at two ends of the flesh;
then stretch the flesh above with the needle, and cut it with a spatula one finger wide. And if the shape of the papule returns as it should, it is good;
if not, take a rasp and put it in the fissure, and turn the papule, and make two incisions on the sides inside the papule;
and let the ends of the two incisions be at the two angles of the incision that you have cut, and make an angle so that when they are joined, the shape is like the shape of a letter which is called "Greek I";
then remove that flesh, according to the quantity that its sides are sharp beneath, of that which follows the papule, then join the two separated parts, and sew them with a woolen thread;
then cure it with what we have said of softening medicines and tents, until it is healed.
And if the disease comes from a fissure or suture or cautery, then you must make a full incision under the hairs of the papules, and according to what is above; then separate between the two lips with a tent, as I have said;
then separate between the two lips with a tent, as I have said; and the work must be done according to the form of the disease, for it is very diverse in form, and wise masters apply their skill with all their power how to restore the form to its natural shape;
and the patient himself, according to what is needed in work and instruments in various situations.
When this adhesion happens to many men in such a way that the papule above is adhered to the white of the eye, and cannot move or perform its natural functions, then you must insert the point of a razor under the papule and lift it up;
and extend it with pincers, until you cut what is attached with a fine spatula, which is neither too sharp nor too blunt, so that the patient cannot suffer the too sharp spatula injuring the eye;
and let your incision, with which you scrape that adhesion, be light, so that the papule returns to its natural form;
and is healed all that adhesion, and sometimes they make in the eye salt water, and wash it with fresh water, and with eyewash;
then place between the papule and the eye a linen tent, and place on the eye wool soaked in egg white; and after the third day use of the eyewash and soothing things until it is healed.
Know that the corner is according to two manners: it is nervous and similar to a hard membrane, and another which is not nervous, but is similar to congealed white moisture, so that when one touches it with iron and thinks to grasp it with pincers, one cannot;
and both forms begin towards the large tear duct, and grow little by little until it covers the whole sight and all the light and movement of the eye.
And the manner of the incision is that the patient puts his head in your lap, then opens his eyes; and lift the eyelid with your hand, then grasp the growth with small, double forceps, and extend it upwards; then take a needle, and put on it a horsehair, or cow hair, or ox hair, and a strong thread; and double the point of the needle a little and stick it into the growth, and pierce it with the whole needle, and tie the growth with a thread and extend it upwards, and scrape with the hair the side of the growth that follows the pupil and the silk with the hair down to the head, then cut the remainder at the root of the tear duct with a fine spatula and small forceps, and leave the natural flesh at the tear duct, so that the flow of tears is not affected by the incision;
and sometimes the growth is extended only with the hook and thread, as we have said; then scrape it with a smooth spatula of which this is the form:
And be careful that the spatula does not touch and break the fleshy membrane, and that the pupil is not pierced;
and after the incision, drop into the eye a little crushed celery seed and litharge eye-salve, and leave it until the next day; then treat it as needed until it is healed.
And if the nail is not sensitive, and you cannot insert the needle, and the probe cannot enter, often this type of nail is cured with medicines;
and they grow as I have recounted in the section, and if you see it growing, open the patient's eye, and take a light, slightly sharp spatula according to this shape: And scrape the nail thinly, and if you see that it diminishes somewhat and the erosion approaches it, then instill from your mouth into the eye an eyewash made of litharge, and red eyewash, and crushed celery seed, and plug the eye until the next day;
If nothing is obstructing the eye, such as a hot abscess, then leave it, and first cure the hot abscess until it is healed, then resume the procedure as before, until it is healed.
then resume the same procedure until it is completely removed.
And if the appearance of the flesh of the tear duct harms the eye greatly, then suspend it with a hook, and cut a part of it, but not all, so that the tear duct is not damaged;
then instill red eyewash, which is made from litharge.
In the eyes of some men, sometimes red flesh grows, and covers the pupil and spreads over the eyelids and turns them inside out, and it resembles a pomegranate rose;
and the procedure is that the patient puts his head in your lap, then opens his eyes, and you pull all that flesh with hooks suitable for this, and support it firmly;
then cut the top layer of flesh, and keep cutting with a razor to the end, and be careful that you do not injure the eye during the procedure;
and let the incision be with the spatula that we have mentioned in the incision of the nail and for small growths from which one removes the sebaceous matter, as the illustration after this chapter demonstrates;
and when the incision is complete and all the flesh removed, apply crushed celery seed oil or distil red copperas and similar corrosive medicines there, and put cotton on the eye with egg white, so that it is protected from a hot abscess;
and if anything remains, and the hot blood overwhelms you, and you fear a hot abscess, leave the eye and treat the abscess with things that soothe a hot abscess;
then return to your work until it is healed, and thus do when flesh is added to the eye in this manner.
However, it is necessary that you alleviate the treatment of each weak eye by natural means; and by accidental means, with iron instruments;
and do not put your hand to any of these operations until you see that this member can tolerate that operation.
There are red veins that are located on the eye, and they hinder its function and weaken the eye always.
It is necessary then first that you look if the eye, in which the sebel is, is strong, and there is no other illness besides the sebel; then treat it in this manner:
Instruct the patient to place his head in your lap, then carefully cauterize those veins with the ointment according to your skill, and let the ointments be finely divided according to this form:
And let there be two ointments by degrees in one body according to this form:
then carefully cauterize those veins, and wipe away the blood one time after another, until you see those veins removed from the eye;
and be careful not to injure the eye with the tips of the spatulas, and do this work at midday before the sun, and be very diligent in your work so that you cut only those veins;
and when you have done this, then instill green and red eye drops to corrupt what remains of the pus.
And if you are not able to remove all of it at that time, then apply a plaster to the eye of things that soothe the pain of the eyes, and leave it for a few days until the pain is subsided and the hot abscess is certain, then begin again in this manner which is before until it is healed;
and this is the form of the cautery:
The Arabs call a fistula "arissati":
When you treat it with cautery and with a burning sharp medicine as I have said before, and it is not healed,  then there is a device whereby you incise above the abscess, where it should mature, and draw out all the moisture that is there, until the bone is uncovered.
And when the bone is uncovered, and you see the corruption and blackness, then scrape it with the instrument of which this is the form;
and it is called "rough head," and it should be made of Indian iron with a round head, and should be pointed like a file as it is in the present form:
And place it on the place of the corrupt bone, then turn it between your fingers, and press your hand a little until you know that that corruption is removed;
and do this several times, then restore the place with drying medicines.
If the place is healed, and flesh grows there, and the body of the bone is healed, and remains so for forty days, and it does not renew itself and is not abscessed, and no bad accident occurs, know that it is healed;
if not, there is no other means than to return the fistula to the opening of the nose according to this form: and it is that you uncover the bone a second time with iron, and with sharp medicines, and when it is uncovered then take a drill according to this form, and let the head of iron have three angles, and the shaft be tapered to the head as you see here:
then place it on the bone near the tear duct, and move your hand away from the eye a little, then turn the drill completely until it pierces the bone and the patient feels it because the wind comes out if he holds his hand over his nose;
and then restore the place with dry medicines, as I have taught you, and when the flesh grows and the place hardens, the matter goes to the nose; this is easier for the patient.
When the eyes are completely open and there is no obstruction or reduction in the nose, you must bind the patient;
then cleanse it, then apply cupping glasses or scarification without wounding to draw out the humor, then apply to the eye a liniment made of acacia, aloe, incense, and sarcocolla, and then compress the eye, and bandage it with cloths and strips;
and the manner of the cloths is that you take soft cloths, and double each one four times, and then place one over the other according to the amount the eye needs;
then bind it tightly over with a firm bandage, and repeat the cupping to draw out the humor without wounding;
then remove the cupping glasses and leave the eye compressed day and night, and if the liniment softens, you must compress it very tightly;
then remove the liniment after a day and night, and if you see the eye recovering, it is good;
if not; then repeat the plaster and cloths and the liniment and the cupping glasses until it is healed.
Of the rupture of the uvula. When disruption comes to the uvula, then it opens, and there comes forth paper-like things like grains of resin, and it is frightful to see;
then if you see it split, the procedure is such that you insert a needle into the root of the lower part up to the upper part, then insert another needle where there is a double thread from the side of the tear; and pierce it there, and leave the first needle in place;
then cut the place of the double thread and tie a part of the uvula around it, and pull it well, then remove the needle and apply wool soaked in egg white;
and leave it until the thread falls off with the uvula, then treat the area with comforting things until the wound is healed;
and sometimes the wound is constricted by the uvula on each side with a circle of cloth, until it is healed.
And if the eye shows a great swelling, pierce it with a thin spatula that reaches the bottom of the eye, and let the albuminous moisture flow out and the eye descend, and enter immediately;
then remove it until it is healed.
This illness which is called "alcunnati" is nothing but a swelling which gathers in the eye, resembling descending water, and it is not water;
and the manner of the procedure is that you make the patient sit on a prepared and straight seat, then take the head between your hands on two sides, and move it until you see the swelling come to the top to your eyes; then let it be pierced, and let the light not descend and be obstructed, and let the patient see things as he was accustomed;
and if it does not descend below, know that it is water, and if the descent of the swelling is not as we have said.
then make the patient sit between your hands, then take a thin spatula and make an incision on the corneal membrane a little by continuing the conjunctiva with the corneal membrane and the cornea, until the swelling comes out;
and when it is out, then instill warm water mixed with honey into the eye, or water in which fenugreek has been boiled and honey, then it should be treated with another treatment until it is healed.
of the eye waters We have already described the types of eye waters and what is necessary for piercing them; then work according to the health.
It is necessary that you make the patient sit between your crossed hands, away from the light of the sun, and bind the healthy eye and squeeze it very tightly;
then place the paper of the eye in your left hand if the eye is left, or in your right hand if the eye is right;
then take in your right hand, if the eye is left, the instrument which is called "almagda", or in your left hand, if the eye is right;
then place the point of the instrument near the cornea by the thickness of a ray in that white of the eye at the part of the smaller tear duct, then push the instrument which is called "almagda" skillfully, and turn your hand until it pierces the white of the eye, and feel that the almagda reaches the empty thing;
and it is necessary that the measure of the almagda's path be at the depth of the measure of the space which is from the pupil to the end of the blackness; and that is the cornea of the eye;
then you will see the bone in that membrane because of the clarity of the corneal tissue, and then place the instrument to where the water is, then press it out under one path after another.
if the water descends immediately, the patient sees before him and the instrument in his eye.
Afterwards, rest a little, and if the water rises the second way, put force with the instrument, and when it is inserted and it does not rise, extract the almagda slightly by turning your hand little by little;
and then put a little rock salt in water, and bathe the eye in it. Then put on top of the eye pledgets or wool soaked in rose oil and egg white, and bind it with a healthy eye.
We, and those of our time, apply crushed cumin with egg white.
And if the almagda cannot enter the eye because of its hardness, for there are such men who have very hard eyes, then you must take the instrument which is called "alberit", of which this is the form:
And then pierce only the conjunctiva, and do not go too deep, but make a subtle opening, then put in the almagda, as we have said;
and upon completion of the work, prepare for the patient a suitable sleeping place, in which he sleeps on his back in a dark place;
and let him be free from all movement, and let him take light foods, and let him not move his head neither to the right nor to the left, and let him be bound according to his condition until the third day;
then unbind him in that same dark house, and test his sight, and make him see some things, and then put the bandage back on until the seventh day;
and it is not necessary that you do this at the time of the treatment or immediately after the incision, but it is necessary that you delay this, because the water rises quickly.
If a hot abscess occurs, that you unbind the eye before the seventh day, and treat it with something that soothes the abscess;
and when it is calmed, then unbind the sight and put on his face a linen cloth to cover it for some days, and let him always be in that dark house.
And then let him go out of the house little by little, and return to his usual activities;
and know that no disciple should interfere in this case. And a man came to us who was from Iraq, who told us that in his country they made almond paste, from which they suck the water, but still I never saw any in our land, nor did I ever read of it in the books of the ancients; and perhaps it is a new thing.
And these are the likenesses of the forms of almond paste, so that those who do not know them may see them;
and they should be properly of bronze: And let their heads be of this same subtlety, and the last in three sharp angles.
Sometimes various fleshy growths arise on the nose, some of which resemble scorpions with many legs;
and there are some where there is deeply rooted flesh of a livid color, and there is soft flesh of a good color. In that then of these fleshes which is soft, and not deeply rooted, you must cause the patient to sit between your hands against the sun;
In that then of these fleshes which is soft, and not deeply rooted, you must cause the patient to sit between your hands against the sun; and open his nostrils, and apply the onion to those fleshes, and pull them out; then cut what you can grasp with a thin, sharp spatula on one side, until you know that that flesh is entirely removed.
And if any remains that cannot be cut, then open it with all the subtle instruments lightly, so that nothing remains; and if blood overwhelms you, or a hot abscess, then treat it as is necessary;
and if it is malignant abscesses, then hurry and cauterize it until the blood is stopped and all the flesh is removed, then apply either vinegar and water or wine. If the nose bleeds, and moisture comes down to the palate, know that it is healed;
and if moisture does not flow as it should, know that there is new flesh on the bone above, which the instruments cannot reach to cut:
then you must insert a somewhat thick linen thread, tied at both ends, with a finger's width or less space between each knot; and let the patient put the end of the thread in his nose as much as he can, and pull it gently until it comes through the nose into the mouth;
and often children do this at school, and it is an easy thing for one who wants to do it;
then hold the end that comes through the nose in one hand, and the other end that comes through the mouth in the other hand, and pull them one after the other, sawing at the knots which are on the thread.
Do this until you see that the knots have corrupted that flesh, then pull out the thread, wipe away the blood, and moisten the thread in Egyptian ointment, and put it back in the nose as before;
do this three days or more, until the ointment corrodes all that remains of the flesh;
and then put a lead canula in the nose for a few days until it is healed, and if it needs drying medicines, then use them;
and this is the form of the instrument for purging the head, with which one distills oils and medicines into the nose:
And let it be of silver or bronze, resembling an open lamp, like a canula, and the conduit likewise;
and if you wish, make a closed canula, and let the instrument be full to purge the head;
and have a handle at the head to hold it when one heats the oil or any liquid.
of the flesh above the nose
Many times a disease called "telul" arises at the head of the nose, and grows and becomes large continually, until it is a frightening thing to behold;
and therefore it is necessary that you cut it at the beginning, and remove it entirely, then apply the cautery or burning medicine to the place;
and if one delays cutting it until it is large, then take care if it is hard, of a livid color, and insensitive:
then do not touch it with iron, for it is a cancerous abscess, for when it is cut sometimes, great harm comes to the patient;
and if the abscess is soft to the touch, not livid in color, and you see that it can be entirely cut, then empty the patient and cut it without fear, and treat the place with drying and astringent things.
Know that when a solution of continuity occurs in one of these cartilaginous structures, it benefits little, except in some men.
Therefore, when this happens to someone, see if the wound is fresh with all its blood; and then bring the two lips together with a suture, then treat it until it is healed;
and if the lips are already separated on one side and the other, you must scrape all the parts of their edges until they bleed, then bring the two lips together with a suture, and bind it, and sprinkle on powder of dragon's blood, and ground incense; and put over the powders a piece of strong plaster or other soldering plaster, and leave it until it falls off by itself, then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
The method of suturing is that you bring together the edges: or with needles, as we have said in the suturing of the belly; or with thread, as I have shown you.
of abscesses of the lips
In many men there occurs within the lips a hard abscess, similar to grains of vetch, some smaller and some larger;
then you must turn back the lips, and incise on each side, and grasp it with forceps and cut it in each part;
then fill the place after the incision with crushed vitriol, until the blood is stopped;
and then wash it with vinegar, and treat the place with drying things until it is healed.
Many times there grows on the gums added flesh, which the ancients call "albulus";
then you must hold it with tongs, and cut it at its root, and let the wound or blood flow;
then put on the place crushed vitriol, or other astringent and drying powders;
and if that flesh returns after the incision, and this often happens, then cut it a second time, and cauterize it: then it will not return after the cautery;
Sometimes, gathered at the roots of the teeth, inside the mouth between the gums, are ugly and rough scabs; and sometimes the teeth are black and yellow and worm-eaten, until the corruption reaches the gums, and the teeth are foul-smelling;
then you must make the patient sit between your hands, and his head should be on your lap, and clean the teeth or the scabs appearing, until nothing remains; and so do with the blackness and the greenness, and the yellowness and the other stains, until they are cleansed;
and if one removes what is there at the first scraping, that is good; if not, then begin again the second and third day, until you have cleaned everything;
and know that the teeth need various forms of instruments for cleaning, according to what the work demonstrates, because the scrapers with which one cleans the outside of the teeth have other shapes than those with which one cleans between the teeth; and these and other forms should be prepared and with you.
It is necessary when you treat a toothache that you delay extraction as long as you can, for one should not do this; for it is a very high substance until one has no excuse for extraction.
Then, when the patient is compelled to extraction, it is necessary that you are certain of the aching tooth. Often the pain deceives the patient, and he thinks that it is in a healthy tooth, and has the good tooth extracted; and yet the pain does not depart because of this, until the bad one is extracted, for we have already seen this happen to these healers;
and when you are certain of the aching tooth, it is necessary that you scrape around the tooth with a very strong spatula to protect the gum on all sides;
then move it with your fingers or with fine forceps little by little, until it is well loosened, then firmly attach the forceps; and let the patient's head be securely between your knees, and hold it well so that it does not move.
Afterwards, extract the tooth straight without breaking it, and if it does not come out easily, take one of these instruments and insert it inside from each side gently, and move it as you did before.
And if the tooth is pierced and decayed, it is necessary that you fill it with rags where the holes are; and extract it carefully with forceps, so that it does not break during extraction;
and it is necessary to work very wisely around the gum to loosen the tooth.
And I warn you well that you do not break it, and that a part remains, and that greater pain than the first returns to the patient because of the wickedness of the root.
And beware that you do not do as the ignorant surgeons do, who through their haste and boldness sometimes break the tooth, and do not achieve what we have recounted;
but sometimes bring about, because of this, great sickness from the roots that remain, or from the tooth that they break, as we have often seen;
and when the tooth is drawn, wash the place with wine or vinegar and salt;
and if a flow of blood comes, which often happens, apply crushed vitriol to the place;
and if that is not effective, cauterize it.
The shapes of the instruments with which one first moves the teeth should have long points and thick handles, so that they do not bend when you draw the tooth;
and these are the shapes: And let them be of thick members so that they do not bend when pulling, and let them be of well-made iron, and let them be toothed to hold firmly.
of the root of the teeth When the root remains during extraction, you must apply cotton soaked in butter to the area for one or two days, until the area is softened, then place the forceps called "algefri," whose head resembles a bird's beak;
and let them be made inside like a file, and this is the shape:
And if the roots do not want to come out with these forceps, you must uncover the flesh all around the root, and use the instrument called "althali," that is to say, a lever, of which this is the shape:
And let it be strong and thick so that it does not break, and if the root comes out through this, it is good;
if not, use all the instruments, whose shapes come next:
And one uses this instrument which has two prongs, of which this is the shape: and other instruments which are in front in the shape of teeth, and of this instrument which resembles large forceps, of which this is the shape:
And let this instrument be strong so that it cannot break, and know that there are many instruments with teeth; and also other instruments, which are not counted;
and the wise and subtle master finds his own instrument, according to what his work and the illness shows him, for there are such illnesses where the ancients taught no instrument because of the diversity of cases; and if one breaks a piece of the cart or other bones, or if it rots, then he looks for the instruments which are necessary, which I have told you, and he uses the gestures, of which this is the shape:
And let them be thick and strong to hold the bone, so that it does not escape, but that he can hold and remove it;
and then restore the place with appropriate medicines, and if there is rot in the bone, and it is small, then scrape it with this instrument:
When the teeth appear not according to their natural form, and the shape is ugly, and especially in virgin women, then you must know if the tooth is behind the tooth, and is not in the right place, and one cannot pull it or file it:
then shave it; and if it is loose along with the tooth, then take this instrument of which here is the form, and it is similar to a small beak, and let it be of iron and sharp at the top:
And cut it little by little over several days because of the hardness of the tooth, and so that you do not move the others, and if it is apparent that one can file it, then file it with a file such as this is the form:
and it is like the file with which needles are made;
and file the tooth little by little over several days lightly, so that it does not move until it falls;
then plane it at the end with some kind of scraper, and if the tooth is too sharp and it hurts the tongue, then it is necessary to file the roughness until it is even, so that it does not hurt the tongue nor corrupt the speech.
When the front teeth loosen, either by percussion or by falling, and the patient cannot press on what he chews without their falling out, and you have treated them with astringent medicines, and this is of no use;
then it is necessary to restrain them with a gold thread, for silver thread turns green and rots, but gold never changes;
and let the thread be medium, neither too thick nor too thin, according to the size of the space between the teeth;
and if you wish to straighten the teeth, take the thread and double it between two healthy teeth, then place the ends between the loosened teeth, if there is one or more, until you skillfully reach a healthy tooth on the other side; then begin the covering again to the point where you began, and pull your hand subtly and skillfully, so that it does not move;
and let your ligature be at the root of the tooth so that it cannot escape.
Then cut the ends of the thread with pliers, and join them, and place them between the healthy tooth, and place it so that it does not injure the tongue;
and then leave it tied as long as it can remain, and if it loosens, or the thread breaks, tighten it with another thread;
it will remain and serve thus its entire time, and this is the form of the teeth and the manner of the arrangement of the two healthy teeth, and of the two moved ones, as you see:
And when the tooth falls out, one puts it back in its place, again and again, as we have said;
and let no one interfere who is not wise and patient, and sometimes one makes the form of a tooth from cow bone, and one places it in the place where it is lacking, and one tightens it as we have said, and it remains and serves thus for a long time.
Sometimes this ligament which comes from under the tongue is natural, that one is born thus; or by accident of a healed wound;
and the procedure is such that you open the patient's mouth, and have his head in your lap, and lift his tongue;
then cut the nervous ligament widely, so that the tongue is freed from its constraint, and if there is hardness or a knot, and this is from a sudden wound, then insert a hook and cut widely that ligament;
and take care that the incision is not too deep, because of the artery which is below;
and when you have done, bathe the place with rose water and vinegar, or cold water, then place under the tongue a linen tent;
and let the patient dress it every night, so that the wound cannot close.
And if a flow of blood comes, put crushed vitriol on the place; and if the blood overcomes you, cauterize it with the lentiginous cautery, which is good for this; then treat it with other treatments until it is healed,
and if you see it of a dark or black color or hard, so that the patient does not feel it, do not touch it, for it is cancer;
and if it is tending towards a whitlow, and there is moisture, apply onion juice, and open it with a fine spatula, and clean it from one side and the other; and if the blood overcomes you in your work, apply crushed vitriol until it is stopped, then return to your work until you remove all the pus;
then clean the place with vinegar and salt, and treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
of the abscesses of the throat Sometimes there come in the throat swellings which are called "godath", and they are properly called the two tonsils, and when you treat them, as we have said in the division, and they are not healed, then take care:
if this abscess is hard, of little feeling and of a dusky color, do not touch it with iron.
And if it is red and the root is large, do not touch it with iron, also because of the flow of blood; but leave it until it is ripe, and then you will open it, or it will break by itself;
and if it is of a round white color, and the root is thin, have the instrument prepared for cutting, but first see if the warm abscess rests and is calmed.
Then make the patient sit before the sun, and his head should be on your lap, and the operator opens the mouth and the assistant takes it between his hands, and presses the tongue down with the instrument, of which this is the shape;
and let it be of silver or of thin bronze like a knife:
When you press the tongue with this instrument, and you see the abscess, then take the hook and insert it into the tonsil, and pull it out upwards as much as you can;
and pull out some of the membranes with it, then cut it with the instrument, of which this is the shape, which resembles tongs; and however the ends are curved, and one towards the other, and are very sharp, and is made of Indian iron or bronze:
And if you do not have this instrument present, then cut it with pliers, of which this is the shape: And let it be sharp on one side, and blunt on the other;
and when you have cut one of the almonds, then cut the other in the same manner, and after the incision let the patient gargle with warm water, and vinegar and water, and if bleeding occurs, let the patient gargle with water, in which pomegranate rinds have been boiled, or myrtle leaves, and similar things, until the bleeding is stopped; then treat it until it is healed;
and sometimes other abscesses arise in the throat besides the two almonds, then cut them in the same way as the two almonds equally.
And I treated a woman of an abscess which had formed inside her throat, that is to say, a small abscess;
and it had almost completely closed the whole throat, so that the woman could not breathe because the passage was blocked, and could neither eat nor drink, and would have died if she had remained thus for one or two days.
And the abscess had risen so much that it had forced out two veins through the two nostrils.
I hastened then at once, and inserted a probe into one, then pulled it forcefully out, and drew out a large portion of pus;
then I did likewise in the other nostril, and opened her mouth and pressed her tongue;
afterwards I inserted the probe into the abscesses, and cut a part of it, and only a little blood came out; and thus the passage of the woman's throat was cleared, and she immediately began to drink water and then wine, and I did not cease to cut away that abscess for a long time;
and the abscess repeatedly grew again, and filled the place that I had emptied, until it was very large;
then I cauterized it inside the throat: thus it remained without growing;
and I departed from those parts, and I do not know what God did with her after me.
of the grape (or uvula)
When catarrh descends to the uvula, and it is swollen and long, it is called "perpendicular";
and if it is thick and round below, it is called "uve".
When it is treated as we have said in the division, and the treatment does not help, and you see that the heat of the abscess is subsided, and it is thin, then you must cut it;
and that which is round and gathered and not long; and it is bloody or of a dark color or black, then you should avoid cutting it. For there is great danger to the patient.
Therefore, when you see it, according to the manner that I have said, of its whiteness and its length, you must have the patient sit before the sun, and press the tongue with the instrument of which we have made mention before; then insert the small probe into the uvula, and pull it downwards, and cut it with one of the two instruments that I mentioned in the incision of the two tonsils.
And you must not cut more than the excess that is beyond the natural limit;
for if you cut more, you harm the voice and speech;
and after the incision, use what we have said in the incision of the two tonsils, and treat it until it is healed.
And if the patient fears the cutting, then you must use a method of cauterization so that he feels no fear.
And the manner of cauterization is with sharp fire. And it is that the patient puts his head in your lap, and then you press his tongue with the instrument that we have mentioned in the chapter on cauterization, and cauterize with boiling water, so that it is neither too thick nor too thin; and use the end of this instrument, of which this is the form:
And it has at the head a cavity where one puts the medicine, like the bowl of a spoon, and puts the instrument with all the medicine on the uvula;
and the patient lies on his side, so that the saliva and mucus run from his mouth away from the medicine, so that it does not go down into the throat and injure it;
then hold your hand with all the medicine and press it on the uvula, the amount of half an hour, until you see it turn black and the burning from the medicine is calmed;
and if you wish, take cotton and wrap it around some instrument, and moisten the cotton in the medicine, and put the instrument with all the cotton into the throat above, until the cotton touches the uvula;
and do this often, until the cauterization is complete, then leave it dry, and it falls off after four or five days.
And if you need to repeat the cauterization with the medicine, then repeat it, and after the cauterization wipe around the uvula with cotton dipped in butter, and clean what is around the medicine;
and let it be sprinkled with cold water, and be treated with gargles until it is healed.
This treatment is safer than incision, or than cautery;
if it is treated by fumigation in this manner, take calamint and hyssop and origanum and rue and chamomile and vervain and similar herbs, and combine all or some of them in a pot, and add vinegar, and bring to a boil;
and the pot should be well sealed with strong clay, and inside the pot there should be a perforated instrument in this manner: And let it be of silver or bronze, and let one of the ends be placed in the patient's mouth so that the vapor rises to the uvula through the throat, until the uvula is cauterized;
afterwards repeat it often, until the uvula dries, and be careful not to do this at the beginning of the onset of a hot abscess, for many things may happen; and do not do this except at the decline of a hot abscess.
And if this instrument is not present, take a tube and put inside its end an eggshell, so that the patient's mouth does not get too hot; for the eggshell does not allow the vapor to harm the mouth, and this is a good treatment and also a cure.
Many times a bone or fish spine, or something else, sticks in the throat;
then you must pull out what you can see, and press the tongue with the instrument towards the sun, so that you see the thing move;
and that which is not visible to you and is lodged in the throat, you must make the patient vomit before the food is cooked in the stomach; by chance the thing will come out backwards through vomiting;
or the patient swallows a piece of sponge, or a piece of navel, or a lettuce root, or a piece of dry bread; and tie a thread to the sponge, and then swallow it; and when it comes to the place, it will stick, and then pull it out;
and if it does not come out by what we have said, take a lead instrument according to this form:
And let the instrument be curved at the head so that it may more easily enter the throat, and have the head raised high; and beware that you do not touch the epiglottis, lest a cough come upon him, nor thrust the bone inside;
and it is better that the patient insert the instrument, because he knows better where the thing is stuck; then push it down, or pull it out with the instrument equally, until it is out.
Of the leech in the throat
Sometimes the leech is medicated, as I have said in the division, by the cure of medicines; and when that does not help, then look into the throat of the patient in the sun, then press his tongue with the instrument that I have told you.
And if you see the leech, pull it out with a small hook, or with fine tongs that are suitable for this.
And if that does not work, take a horsehair, and put it in the throat of the patient, then put a hot iron to the end of the hair, and do this often. And let the patient drink water every day.
Then take a full glass of cold water, and open the mouth, and pour it in without swallowing, and move it with your hand often; and as soon as the leech feels the water, it falls off.
And if it does not fall off as we have said, fumigate the patient with asafoetida, with the instrument that I have described in the fumigation of the uvula;
do this many times, for it will fall off without delay.
And the method of fumigation is that you take a pot in which there are live coals, and the pot is covered with a lid pierced in the middle, and in that hole is the end of the instrument;
then throw in your fumigation, and the patient puts the end of the tube in his mouth, and closes his mouth so that the smoke does not escape, but comes down to the leech;
and the leech will fall off immediately, and if it does not fall off, repeat the fumigation many times;
and let the patient suffer thirst, and eat salty and bitter things, and drink no water;
and then it will be necessary for it to come out forcefully through this treatment.
And the shape of the instrument with which one pulls out the leech, when one can see it, is similar to curved tongs to be inserted into the throat; and resembles a bird's beak, and has a roughness like a file, so that what it grasps, it cannot let go;
Many kinds of abscesses exist, according to what is remembered later on in this book about one and another, and they differ in perforation and in size;
and this is in two ways, one of which is in its very appearance, and in what it contains of moisture.
And the second way is because of the places where they are in the body.
For an abscess of the head is different from one of the fundament, and an abscess in a fleshy place is different from one which comes in the joints, and each has its own treatment.
And there are abscesses which one should not pierce, until the boil is ripe according to its completion;
and there are some that it is necessary to pierce when they are grown, and do not ripen according to their completion, such as abscesses which are near the joints.
For when an abscess comes near the joints, and one leaves it until it is rotten around, by chance the ligaments and the nerves of the joint are corrupted, whereby this is the cause of contraction in that limb.
Or the abscess is near the principal member, and if you delay the perforation until it is ripe, it will harm the principal member;
or it is near the fundament, then one pierces it before it is ripe;
and it is not fitting that you pierce an unripe abscess without completed digestion, except that which is near the fundament, lest it rot deeply and become extended inwards, and a fistula develop there; and cannot heal in a long time.
And it is necessary that you know the time for the perforation of the ripe abscess according to its completion, and that is when the pain is lessened, and the departure of the fever, and the lessening of the pain and redness, and of the throbbing and sharpening of the head of the abscess, and the other signs;
and it is necessary that you make the perforation in the most dependent place of the abscess, and where it appears softened;
and let the perforation be along the body, and if the abscess is in the hands or feet, or in joints and near nerves and arteries, and in all similar places where there is no bending. In those that bend, along that limb.
And when the abscess is in a fleshy place, it is better that you leave the perforation until it is confirmed in completed digestion, as we have said.
For if you pierce it before that, the body of the venom will be extended from it, and it is full of much filth; and perhaps the lips and the depths of it will harden.
And if there is any abscess that is pierced according to the width of the body, according to what the limb needs.
And it is necessary that you make small holes in small abscesses; and in large abscesses, large holes, and many slits according to the resemblance of the size of the abscess;
and there are such abscesses where it is necessary to cut to the heart, and to cut; when it has become like a rag, and is mortified, it is necessary to do as one does with buboes:
and there are some that are split into three angles, and there are some that are cut like a myrtle leaf, like abscesses of the angles;
and there are some where one makes a round incision, and other incisions and similar cuttings.
Those which have no head, like a soft superficial abscess, it is necessary that you pierce it completely;
and it is necessary when the abscess is large, and it has collected much pus, and you pierce it, that you not draw out all the pus at that time, but draw out a part; then stuff the abscess until the next day, then draw out something again; do this many times gradually, until all the pus comes out;
especially if the patient is of weak constitution, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an old decrepit man. For the spirit sometimes leaps with the exit of the pus, so that by chance the patient dies, and you do not perceive it.
Therefore approach this chapter with great caution, and when you have perceived your abscess, clean the wound, and see if the wound of the abscess is small; and if it is a full incision, apply tents of linen or old cotton; and if it is a large abscess, and there are many openings, then you must insert a tent into each one so that they meet each other;
and if you have cut a part of the skin in the abscess, and you have shaved around it, then you must fill it with old cotton or linen scrapings without moisture, and bind it until the third day;
then remove it, and treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if bleeding occurs in your work, apply cold water and vinegar, and wet a cloth, and apply it to the bleeding area many times.
And if the bleeding persists, administer treatment and care, and the powders that I have mentioned in other places in this book, and if it is winter, and the place where the abscess is is very sensitive, then you must apply tents and cloths soaked in warm wine and oil;
and if it is summer, and the place is fleshy, then you must apply cloths soaked in water and oil, or in cold wine and oil, until the third day, as we have said;
and then open the abscess and clean it and treat it, as is necessary, until it is healed.
And this must be known universally in the treatment of abscesses:
I have told you how one should proceed with the treatment of abscesses, and here is the chapter.
In the scalp come small abscesses, and there are kinds that are in webs, like the yolk of a hen's egg, and there are many similarities.
There are some that are fatty and such where there is moisture like pus;
and there are some that are hard and stony to the touch, and there is no doubt if the artery does not oppose it.
And the work of the incision is that you probe with the instrument that is called "entromissoire," of which the form comes next, what thing it contains.
For if it contains moisture, then open it lengthwise from above.
And when the moisture is emptied, scrape it clean without leaving anything of the skin which contains that moisture, for it returns again when one leaves anything there;
then dip cotton in Egyptian ointment, if it is present; if not, in water and salt, and apply it to the wound, and leave it until the next day; and that will drain what remains from the night.
And then repeat the cotton, as before, the second day, and the third, until you know well that nothing remains from the night;
then treat the wound with a suitable ointment, until it is healed.
And if the abscess contains thick matter, cut it lengthwise, according to this form; and put in your unguents, and scrape it from all sides, and use all your skill to draw the matter out where it lies;
and if the artery opposes you, then do what I have told you afterwards.
And also do the same for an abscess if it is stony, and in cutting and treating it as I have told you.
And the incision on a stony and moist abscess is easier, because they contain little blood. And if there are some of these abscesses on the head where there is no moisture, and of those were the abscesses that I cut on the head of an old woman;
and I found the abscess like a hard, rough, and white stone, and could not break it; and if one had struck it, one would have as well made a wound as with a stone.
In other abscesses occurring on the head, except those that come at the heads of children and at the roots of the ears, the opening should always be at the lowest point, so that the pus may escape;
and treat them as is necessary.
Often these abscesses occur in the neck, and under the armpits, and in the groin, and sometimes they occur elsewhere on the body, and are many, and are intertwined with one another.
And each scrofula is properly within its own compartment, like the nut and the abscess of the head, as we have said; and the appearances of these scrofula are many.
and the appearances of these scrofula are many. There are some that contain moisture, and there are malignant ones that do not want to obey health.
In that one then which you see of good disposition to the touch, and is similar in color to the body, and moves on every side and is not close to the nerves of the neck nor to the artery nor to the conduit, and is not deep;
then you must cut it from above, and peel it from each side, and extend the two lips of the wound with hooks, if you need them, as we have said in abscesses of the head;
and pull it little by little, and be sure that you do not cut the nerve or the vein, and let the spatula not be sharp or cutting, lest the hand slip, and do not go too far, lest you cut what you should not.
And if you cut the vein or the artery, and this does not allow you to work, then put in the wound crushed vitriol, or some powders that staunch blood, and bind the wound; and leave it until the abscess is calmed, and the wound is softened, and begins to fester.
And when the bleeding is stopped, then return to your work, until you have completed it;
then seek with your index finger if there remain any small scrofula, cut and cleanse them.
And if there is a large vein at the root of the scrofula, it is not necessary that you cut that scrofula at its root, but tie it with a strong double thread, and let it fall off by itself, without harm;
then fill the wound with old cotton dipped in Egyptian ointment, then dress it.
And if you cut the whole scrofula, it is necessary that you bring together the two lips of the wound, and sew them immediately, since there is no remaining superfluity because of the size of the scrofula. then you must attend to cutting its root, and pull it out, and sew it as we have said.
then you must attend to cutting its root, and pull it out, and sew it as we have said. Those scrofulas which contain superfluity, pierce them where they appear ripe;
and pierce it like that which was said before, depending, then apply tents with ointment and similar things, so that it consumes that which remains of the corruption; and when the wound is well cleansed, then treat it with an ointment generating flesh, until it is healed.
The ancients said and spoke of the incision of the throat; but I never saw anyone in our land who did it, and this is the writing of their words.
For those who have quinsy, it is necessary that the slit of the throat which is called "epiglottis" be opened; and that one not do it by this means, because all the veins and the lung of the patient are near those who have a hot abscess in the mouth, or in the throat or in the two tonsils.
When the illness is in the channel of the lung, it is necessary to cut the epiglottis to avoid the loss that comes from strangulation.
Therefore, when we wish to cut the epiglottis, we must cut it below three or four circles a small slit across, between the two circles or by the amount of the slit in the syfac, not in the cartilage;
and that place is so suitable for the section of the epiglottis that there is no flesh, and the vessels are far away.
And if the master is fearful, it is necessary that he extend the skin of the throat with the hook, then cut the skin until he reaches the channel; and avoid the blood vessels, if you see anything, and then cut the syfac, as we have said;
and it is demonstrated by the section of the phlegm of the channel which leaps forth through the place which is broken, and by the lack of voice;
and leave the wound open a while.
And when the hour has passed in which strangulation is feared, bring together the two lips of the wound of the throat, and sew it all alone without the cartilage;
then administer medicines which cause flesh to grow, until it is healed.
Albucasis says that one should not do this until the throat is completely blocked, and the patient is judged to be dying, and the breath fails him. Then cut the epiglottis because the patient cannot breathe, and he breathes through the wound, and thus is saved from death;
and for that reason the ancients ordered that the wound be left open until the malice of the illness has passed, and it passes in three or four days. And then they ordered the wound to be sewn and treated, until it was healed;
and I will tell you what I saw. I saw that a young lady took a knife and plunged it into her throat, and cut part of the channels of the lung;
and I was called to treat her, and found her as good as dead.
I uncovered the wound, and found the blood which had issued from it, and I knew well that she had not cut a vein or a duct except the throat, and the wind issued forth through the wound.
I hastened, and sewed up the wound, and treated it until it was healed;
and nothing happened to the young lady except that she was hoarse, and afterwards returned to her normal state;
therefore I say that in the cutting of the epiglottis one need not fear.
This abscess is called "hernia of the throat," and is a large abscess the color of a yolk, and is very common in women;
and it is of two kinds: natural, and accidental;
the natural one has no remedy.
And the accidental one is of two kinds, of which one resembles fat to us, and the other kind resembles an abscess which comes from an artery to us; and there is fear, and it is not necessary to operate with hot iron except in that which is small, and prove it and search it with the whole probe: if you find it like a nut of fat, and it does not adhere to any vein, cut it, as one cuts nuts, and draw it out with its covering, if there is any; and search well around, and cure it as is necessary, until it is perfectly healed.
Many kinds of nuts there are, of which I will tell all the similarities;
And now it is necessary that I tell all the difference which is between a nut and a boil.
I say that a boil is heat and fever holding, until the boiling is past, and the putrefaction is complete; Then the fever and the heat subside.
With the nut there is neither heat nor fever nor pain, and it contains a cyst, which is its own sac and is according to the color of the body, and begins as a swelling, and becomes large;
and they are according to two appearances, either greasy, or moist, and many colors are as I have said in the division.
It is necessary, when you come to the treatment of the boil, that you first examine it with the instrument which is called "probe," according to what its form will show in the chapter which follows.
And the manner of the examination of the boils is that you take the moistest place that you find in the boil, and turn your fingers little by little, until you know that the instrument has reached the core, then that it be according to the size of the boil;
then withdraw the probe, and take heed to what comes out.
If running moisture flows out, what color it has, examine it as I have said of the other boils;
and if after the probe no moisture comes, know that it is hard, then cut it in a cross, and take it with forceps, and lightly scrape it on each side and watch the layer in which it lies so that you draw it out whole with the boil;
and if you cannot draw it out whole, then draw it out in pieces so that nothing remains.
For if anything remains, the boil returns many times;
and if a little remains, and the blood bothers you, fill the wound with some sharp corrosive powders, and cleanse the wound, and apply things that soothe a hot boil, and treat it with other treatments until it is healed;
and if the boil is large, sew the two lips of the wound, and treat it with that which generates flesh.
and if the throbbing vein is bothersome or something else hastens you, and fill the place with crushed vitriol, and let it sit two or three days, until the wound festers, and the boiling of the blood subsides; then return to cut away what remains of the boil.
Here are the forms of the instruments used, and they are of three kinds: large, medium, and small;
and there are three square ones which are called "albaret", and one which is called "breb", and there are three kinds of them: large, medium, and small, to encircle the abscesses of fistula;
and are like the needles with which one sews sorcerers, and are of yellow brass, or of iron, or of silver, and those which are yellow are worth more, and are more proven with black lead to encircle the curves of fistula;
and are of three kinds: large, medium, and small, according to the size of the width of the holes.
The shapes of the hooks are very similar, as you see here:
and there are hooks which have two curves of three kinds also;
and there are hooks which have three curves, and are also of three kinds;
and there are hooks which have two curves, and hooks of only one curve, and are of three kinds;
and all these are necessary in their place.
The heads of those with which one cuts are sharp, and there are some which do not cut except on one side, with which one scrapes the flesh, so that one does not cut the vein or the nerve;
and of these intromittents, the blades are enclosed in handles, so that the patient does not feel them in the opening of abscesses;
and they are of three kinds: large, small, and medium, as you see;
and one uses them only in fleshy places, such as legs, and arms, and breasts, and in the armpits, and in similar places;
and sometimes one makes another small instrument, similar to a quince-seed, according to this form, with which one stops blood: and one sometimes places it in the place which is healed by cutting veins and arteries, and sometimes round according to this large form:
Sometimes the breasts of some men swell when they begin to be corrupt, until they resemble women's breasts;
and remain ugly and swollen, and whoever wants to cure them, must cauterize according to this form from this line b. down to g.: then scrape the fat, and fill the wound with flesh-generating medicine, then bring together the two lips of the wound with suture, and treat it until it is healed;
and if the breast droops downwards, and is softened by its size as happens with women, then split it in two parts above, by two similar incisions; so that one is connected to the other at the end of each, so that the larger line contains the smaller according to this form, from this line b. to line g.; then scrape the skin that is between the two lips, and remove the fat, and apply what we have said of sutures and powders, and what is necessary in the treatment, until it is healed;
and if it is not healed, or the incision is not completely made, because the patient will not rest, or because of the flow of blood, then you must fill the wound with cotton soaked in corrosive ointment; and leave it until it consumes the remainder and the fat, then treat it until it is healed.
These abscesses that come under the armpits are kinds of hard scrofula where there are ribs, and some contain moisture.
Those then which contain moisture must be cut according to this form, from line b to line g: And when all the matter that is in the abscess is emptied, fill the wound with old cotton, and leave it until the next day, then remove all the cotton, and treat with a suitable ointment until it is healed.
And if the abscess is similar to scrofula, incise it as we have said in the incisions of scrofula, and if the wound produces matter, apply cautery as we have said before.
When the artery is broken, and the skin above is sealed, an abscess often forms, and the same happens with an inflamed vein and abscess;
and one recognizes it thus when it is due to the artery, the abscess is long and deep; and when you feel it with your fingers, you feel a throbbing;
and when it is due to the vein, it is round and outwardly apparent;
and it is folly to cut this abscess, especially when it is under the armpits and in the corners and in the neck and in many other places, and is very large. It is necessary then to avoid the iron treatment, and the one who is in charge should avoid it also, and in that which is an arterial swelling, cut through the skin lengthwise;
then open the incision with hooks, and carefully separate the artery from the tissues, until it is uncovered;
then place a needle underneath it, and make it pierce to the other side, and draw the artery with a double thread in two places, according to what I have taught you in the extraction of the two arteries that are in the temples;
then prick the place that is between the two ligatures with a lancet until the blood that is there comes out, and the abscess is emptied;
then apply the treatment that I have ordered, until the ligatures fall off; then treat it with an ointment suitable for it, until it is healed;
and if the abscess is near the vein, then you must hold with your hand as much of the abscess as you can along with the skin, then place the needle under the place that you are holding with your hand, and make it pierce, and let there be a double thread, so that you draw it out from the other side; then tie the abscess, as I have told you, with a ligature on one of the two sides at the two ends of the thread;
and if you fear that the threads might come out, then insert another needle with a thread under the whole abscess at the incision of the first needle, and draw the threads out in four places;
then cut the abscess so that the excess comes out, then cut the excess from the heart and leave that which is bound;
then put on a cloth moistened in wine and oil, then administer treatments of tents and ointments until it is healed.
Just as abscesses occur in the artery and the vein, abscesses occur in the nerves when they are injured, or by excessive work, and similar things.
And this happens more often in the shoulders and fingers and in all places where there are joints, and it is a serious abscess, and its color resembles the color of the flesh, and is in many instances without pain;
and when it is squeezed strongly, the patient feels pain, and it is not deep in the body, but under the skin;
and it moves well in all directions, and does not go forward or backward, or down or up, and the one that is in the joints should not be cut with iron: by chance, contraction might result; and the one that is on the head or on the forehead, pierce the skin with a spatula.
and the one that is on the head or on the forehead, pierce the skin with a spatula. If the abscess is small, hold it with tongs, and cut it at its root;
and if it is large, lift it with a hook, and peel it, then remove it and close the wound with suture, and treat it until it is healed.
Sometimes it happens in the belly and nowhere else, and it is a disease that is called "fungus" because of its resemblance, and its root is thin, and its head large;
and there are some small and very large ones;
and I saw a man who had two in his belly which were more similar to fungi than anything else, and there was no difference, and they were white, and had a thin root, and were split, and moisture constantly flowed from them.
I cut them and found one weighing eighteen ounces, and the other six and a half, and the procedure in the incision is that you observe if the patient is moist, and the color of the swelling is white and moist and of thin root; if so, cut it with a wide spatula, and have the fire cautery at hand.
if so, cut it with a wide spatula, and have the fire cautery at hand. For in cutting, there often comes too great a flow of blood, and if the blood overcomes you, then hasten to cauterize;
and if you see the patient frightened and fearful of the incision of the iron, take a well-made lead thread, and bind the swelling with it as we have said, and leave it for two days;
and then restrain it, and do not cease to tighten the lead thread until it cuts the swelling, and it falls away without effort;
and if the roots are large, there is fear in cutting even because of the belly, but you can well cut half of it, then cauterize it so that it does not return;
then treat the wound, and be careful not to cut the small growth which is of dark color and little feeling and milk-like appearance.
For this is an infected abscess, and I will come to the treatment of canker later.
when the swelling comes out forcefully If the appearance of the swelling comes from cauterization of a wound or a fissure of the fascia, and is on the belly and some of the swellings come out, as happens in other ruptures, or of blood flowing from veins or arteries according to what is before, or from flatulence;
and if it is through the rupture of the fascia and the protrusion of the bowel, the color of the abscess is similar to the color of the body, and it is light, without pain, and shows various discharges. And if it is due to the protrusion of the intestine, then it is more diverse, and when one presses it with one's fingers it retracts, and then returns, and perhaps it is scarred, and increases greatly upon entering the bath and through hard work.
And if it is due to moisture, it is a light thing, and it appears well when you press it with your hand, and does not constrict.
And if it is due to blood, the abscess appears large and hard through these signs, and is fixed according to a quantity; and if it is due to flatulence, it is soft to the touch, and the procedure is that you observe whether the appearance is due to arterial blood, or venous blood, or flatulence.
and if it is due to flatulence, it is soft to the touch, and the procedure is that you observe whether the appearance is due to arterial blood, or venous blood, or flatulence. Then you must leave the treatment. For there is doubt and fear, as I told you in the chapter on abscesses, because of the artery and the vein.
And if the appearance is due to the intestine or bowel, then you must instruct the patient to hold their breath and lie completely straight, then bleed from the surrounding area; then instruct him to lie often between your hands, then go around the area you have marked with all the spatula, then stretch half of the abscess upwards with the large hook; then tie it around with a strong thread, or a cord of strong silk firmly, and let the knot of the ligature be loose;
then open the half of the abscess stretched above the ligature, and put your index finger there, and search for the intestine; if you find it caught by the ligature, then untie it, and put the intestine outside the belly;
and if you find the bowel, then take it with the hook, and cut off the excess;
and if the artery or vein opposes you, then go carefully around, then return to your work and take two needles, and put two strong threads in them, and put the two needles around what you have done in a cross that you make pierce;
then tie the abscess in four places above the needles, and if you wish, remove the needles, and leave the place until it festers, and the dead flesh falls off by itself; or you cut it when it is thin and rotten, then treat it as necessary, and finish the abscess as we have said;
or you cut it when it is thin and rotten, then treat it as necessary, and finish the abscess as we have said; and draw out the blood or moisture that you find, then treat the place as necessary, and sew up the place.
of the cancer We have described in the division the types of cancer, and how one should work on it with medicines, and how one should avoid the iron treatment;
and we say that cancer grows in the marrow, and there is great caution in its treatment, and the ancients said that when cancer is in a place where it can be excised, such as cancer that is in the breasts, and in the thigh, and in similar places, and one should remove it entirely when it is in the beginning;
nor did anyone ever heal it before me.
And the procedure, when it is in a place where it can be removed, as we have said, is that you purge the patient of black bile sometimes;
then make him bleed if he has manifest repletion, then prepare the patient in a good place to perform the operation;
then apply your ointments to the ulcer, and shave the hair from all sides, and remove it from all sides without leaving anything;
and let the blood flow completely, and wipe the area well with your hand or something, and if the flow of blood prevents you from incising the artery or vein, cauterize it until the bleeding is stopped; then treat it with another treatment until it is healed.
Of dropsy We have, I said in the division, the appearances of dropsy, and in what manner the gathering of water is made, and the signs of each appearance, and the cure which is done by medicines, and that which is cured by iron:
and one should not touch with iron in these two appearances: that is to say, tympanites and hyposarca, for it is a deadly thing;
therefore when you treat this appearance of dropsy which is called "eclites" with medicines, and the cure does not help, then see if the patient is weak, or if he has another illness besides dropsy, such as fever and looseness of the bowels and similar things; then do not touch with iron, for there is doubt;
and if you see the patient of strong virtue, and he has no other illness but dropsy alone, and he is neither too young nor too old, then you must work thus: lift the patient straight up on your hands, and press his belly, pushing the water to the lowest part of the chest, then take the spatumile espinous according to this form: And let it be sharp on two sides. pointed, and yet not so sharp that it can reach the intestine when inserted, and cannot injure it;
then see if the dropsy is swollen towards the intestines: if so, you must make an incision above the buttocks, three fingers directly below the handle; and if the dropsy is due to liver disease, then your incision should be on the left of the buttocks, three fingers;
and if it is due to the spleen, then it should be on the right, and it is not necessary that the patient lie on the incision lest the superfluities run to that weak place;
then pierce all the skin with the instrument, and push it in, and lift your hand with the whole spatula between the skin and the fascia as in flaying, to the size of a fingernail or thereabouts;
then pierce the fascia until the spatula reaches the empty space, and that is the location of the water, then draw it out, and insert this instrument of which this is the shape: And it is similar to a fine silver tube, and is made of bronze or light iron, and has at the lower part one small hole; and on one side, three holes; and two on the other side, and one on the other;
and the head is shaped like a pen, and this is the shape of the incision with which scribes cut the pen:
at the top is the handle, so that when the instrument comes to the water, it immediately descends on the instrument;
empty then half or a third part, for if you empty more than is necessary at that time, perhaps the patient will die from the loss of his vital spirit, or he will faint, or he will approach death;
but empty according to the quantity of his strength, and according to what the condition of the patient's strength signifies, and his pulse;
then withdraw the instrument and retain the water, and it is retained immediately by the heart which stops the hole which is on the surface, of which I have spoken, that you pierce in this manner;
then restart the instrument the next day, if you see the patient tolerating it, and draw out a small quantity of water;
do this for a few days, and take care not to continue until there remains only a little water.
And if you are doubtful about the patient, and you leave too much water, treat him with a hot sand bath or burial, and by profuse sweating or a bath and in the sun, and abstain from drink; and treat him with drying medicines until he is healed, and cauterize the stomach, liver and spleen after the extraction of the water, as I have said before.
Sometimes children are born without an opening in the penis, or the opening is small, or it is not in its proper place.
Then it is necessary that he be pierced immediately with a very fine spatula, according to this form:
Then place a thin lead tube in the opening, and tie it and keep it there for three or four days; and when he wants to urinate, the tube should be removed, and he should urinate, and then it should be replaced;
and perhaps it is not necessary, for the urine that comes forth will not let it remain closed.
In the case of those whose opening is small, it is treated with the lead tube, as we have said, and it will widen.
Those who do not have the opening in its proper place are injured, for some are born with the opening at the tip of the penis, wherefore they cannot urinate unless they raise their penis upwards; and cannot procreate because the matter cannot reach the testicles, and this is a serious illness.
And the manner of the operation is that the patient lies often on his back, then they straighten the head of the penis and cut it like the shaft of a feather, so that the opening falls in the middle, as it should;
and be careful of the bleeding which often occurs there, and if it happens, stop it with what stops blood, and treat the wound until it is healed.
of the pustules of the penis Often these whitlows appear on the penis, and it is an unsightly appearance of flesh;
and there are malignant and non-malignant ones;
you must take them with a fine needle and cut and clean them all, then apply moistened cotton with Egyptian ointment; then treat it with diafinicon ointment until it is healed.
And if the whitlow is malignant, of a foul color and festering, then you must apply a cautery.
When you have cut it, and if the whitlow is on the penis, and part is inside the skin and part outside, then you must first remove the whitlow that is inside; and when it is healed, then treat the outside.
For when you treat it together, the penis is not assured that it will not be pierced, and blackness and corruption come to the penis and the testicle;
it is necessary to remove all that is black and corrupt, then apply a plaster of honey and flour made from pomegranate bark and vetches, then treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
And if a flow of blood occurs, apply the lunar cautery according to this method:
The cautery helps with the two conditions together: that is to say, to the flow of blood and to the corruption;
and if the head of the penis is corrupt and retracted, it is necessary that you insert a lead cannula into the urethra, and the patient urinates through it;
and when the skin is constricted at the head of the penis, which happens to those who have not been circumcised, or which happens due to a wound or abscess, then it is necessary that you scrape it with a sharp instrument, until the ligature is loosened, and the head of the penis is freed on all sides;
and if it is a serious matter to remove this, then you must scrape it with a spatula a little from the head of the penis and the skin;
then separate gently the two parts, and place a thin linen cloth moistened in cold water between them, so that it does not constrict again.
Circumcision is not a separation of continuity like other wounds; however, when we perform this operation of our own will, and properly on children, it is necessary that we perform the best work, and the easiest for healing.
I say that the ancients did not describe the circumcision of their children, for they do not use it in their law, and we have nothing but what we have acquired through experience.
For I have seen the greater part of the masters and surgeons who performed circumcision around the glans, and forcefully, and with a whole scalpel;
the heart would flee because there are two membranes, and by chance one cuts the upper one and the lower one remains. Now it must be cut, and the pain is doubled, and for the cleansing which is of the glans, the tip of the member is not ensured;
and in the cleansing of the prepuce, by chance the iron escapes, and they spoil the work, and many times they arise thus that they do not need cleansing and I have seen it.
Of the cleansing which is done forcefully with the entire length of thread, I have found the goodness of the experiment, for the forces cut just as well above as below.
For when you press your hand, you cut equally in one single time; but that the thread be well tight around the skin;
and the manner of the first operation is such that you make the child think, if he understands, that you are only tying the thread around the penis, and then make him happy in every way that you can;
then make him stand straight between your hands, and hold the threads between your hands or under your feet so that the child does not see them, nor any of the instruments;
then put your hand to the penis and breathe on the heart, and pull it upwards until the head of the penis is inside; then cleanse it well of the filth that has gathered there, then bind the marked place with a double thread, then tie it below, one knot to another knot;
then cleanse it well of the filth that has gathered there, then bind the marked place with a double thread, then tie it below, one knot to another knot; and hold it with two fingers for the second hour at the little finger and the index finger, and cut between the two ties, then quickly remove the heart and pull the head of the penis; then let the blood flow little by little, for that is the best; and put powder on it, and on the powder a cloth glued with a cooked egg yolk tempered with rose water, mixed with good and fresh rose oil, and leave it on until the next day, and treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
The form of the forces for the cleansing is this:
the two ends should be sharp and cutting, and the ends should be as large as the handle, equally:
The error of the cleansing is when the pus flees the incision;
then you must spread it with your fingernail, so that the place forms an abscess;
and cut it evenly, and if you cannot hold it with your fingernail, then hold it with tongs, and then cut it.
And if three days pass, and what is beneath the penis is swollen, leave it until the heat of the abscess is subsided, and lightly scrape it;
cut it as much as you can move, and guard the part of the penis, it will not harm it at all.
Then treat the place of such a wound with powders, which we have described in the treatise on powders, and if one cuts too deeply and it goes to the top, it will not harm at all;
then treat it, as we have said, until it is healed.
Of the retention of urine
The retention of urine is from obstruction by stone, or congealed blood, or bowel, or raw flesh, or similar things, which we have described in the division;
and if the urine is not released, and you see that the retention is due to a stone which is in or near the neck of the bladder, then the patient must be bent over on his knees; and his feet should be placed on his back, and he should extend his belly from the upper part of the back, and the patient should hold his breath as much as he can; and then the neck of the bladder is constricted to express the stone upwards, because of which the urine is released;
and if it does not come, as we have said, and the patient feels great pain, then you must administer extraction with the instrument called a "syringe", of which this is the form:
and it should be of fine silver, lightly hollowed, like the quill of a bird; and the tube should be half a palm long, and narrow at the tip.
And the method of urine extraction is that you take a double thread, and tie a small amount of wool or cotton to the end, and insert the end of the thread into the syringe;
and cut off the excess wool and insert it to the end of the syringe, then anoint the syringe with oil or butter and egg white, and have the patient sit on a seat, and moisten the bladder and penis with warm water, olive oil and oil.
then gently insert the syringe into the penis, until it reaches the root of the penis, then bend the penis upwards towards the belly;
then push the syringe forward to the bladder, and the patient will feel it reach the empty space, and this is not done according to this order except because the passage where it goes is tortuous;
then pull the thread with the wool little by little, and the urine follows the wool, then pull it out forcefully, and let the urine flow;
and repeat with the syringe until the bladder is emptied, and the patient is relieved.
When scabs or blood come into the bladder, or corruption is gathered there, and you want to instill waters and medicines, do so with the instrument which is called a "clepsydra," and this is its form:
It is closed, and it has three openings: two on one side, and one on the other, as you see;
and the fitting through which the medicine flows should be such that it stops the penis well without addition, so that one can draw out the moisture, and introduce when necessary;
and when you wish to put your medicines into the bladder, place the head of the catheter in the moisture, and pull at the tube which is inside;
you will draw the moisture with the catheter, and then strongly push the tube back inside; then the moisture will enter, and will reach the bladder immediately, so that the patient will feel it;
and this is the form of the subtle clyster with which one clysterizes the bladder:
And it is of silver or of pewter, and the head is higher;
and below is a hole where the liquid falls;
then take a sheep's bladder and put in it the liquid with which you wish to clysterize the bladder, then tie it firmly between the two holes with a good double thread, and gently heat that liquid over the fire;
then put the head of the clyster into the penis, then squeeze your hand on the bladder with all the liquid gently, until the patient feels that the liquid has reached the bladder;
and if you do not have a bladder, then take a piece of parchment, and make a circle from it, and pierce it roundly all around; then put a strong thread in these holes, then assemble the circle as one assembles a bowl, and put inside what you wish of oil and liquid and water, and tie it to the instrument;
and do as you did with the bladder, pressing with your hand until the liquid reaches the bladder.
of the stone
We have already discussed, in the division, the types of stones, and their extraction along with medicines;
and I have discussed the difference between the stone generated in the kidneys, and all the signs, and which stone one should operate on by cutting; and in the bladder, and in the penis;
and I will tell you clearly and briefly.
I say that the stone which is generated in the bladder happens more often to children, and it is a sign that the urine leaps from the bladder similar to water in its subtlety;
and sand appears, and the patient scratches his penis, and it hangs down many times, and then becomes stiff; and in many of these, the anus leaks;
and the healing of children is easy until they are four years old, and it is very difficult in the elderly, and it is moderate in young adults, in those who are between youth and old age;
and the cure is easier for those who have a large stone than for those who have a small one.
And when we come to the treatment, it is first necessary to cleanse the patient with an enema, to remove all the feces that are in the intestines. For it sometimes hinders the retrieval of the stone.
Then take the patient by the feet, and lift and move him downwards, so that the stone descends to the bottom of the bladder, and sometimes protrudes from the upper place;
then make him sit between your prepared hands, and his hands should be under his thighs, so that the bladder is entirely inclined downwards;
then seek and touch it inside;
If you feel the stone in the space, hasten now to cut into the stone.
And if it does not fall completely to the touch, moisten your index finger with oil from your left hand, if the patient is a child, or your middle finger, if the patient is a young adult; and put it into his rectum, and seek the stone, and when you feel it with your finger, bring it to the neck of the bladder;
then press with your finger, and push it outside where you wish to cut.
And instruct the assistant to press the bladder with his hand, and instruct him to lift the testicles with his right hand, and with his left hand remove the skin which is under the testicles in the area where the incision is made;
then insert the sharp spatula, of which this is the form: And cut between what is between the testicles and the rectum, not in the middle but to the left side of the scrotum;
and it should be directly over the stone, and your fingers should always be at the rectum, and the incision should be across so that it is wide on the outside, and narrow inside, according to the size of the stone, and not too large;
perhaps press with the finger that is at the rectum, so that it comes out without effort;
and know that there are stones which have angles and edges; then it is difficult to remove;
and there are some which are smooth, similar to an acorn, and round, of which the removal is easy.
Therefore, for that which has angles and edges, make the incision larger;
and if it does not come out, it is necessary that you pull it out with forceps which are like a file at the head, to move the stone so that it does not escape; or you place underneath it a thin instrument curved at the head;
and if you cannot extract it thus, slightly enlarge the opening, and if the blood flows, constrict it with vitriol;
and if there is more than one stone, first place the largest at the neck of the bladder, then cut above, then pull it out, and the smaller ones afterwards if there are more.
And if it is very large, it must be sawn, and a larger incision made. For two things happen to the patient: either he dies, or the urine constantly leaks because the place cannot heal;
but nevertheless try to pull it out, or break it with forceps, until you remove it in pieces;
and when you have completed your work, fill the wound with incense and aloe and dragon's blood, and bind it, and put on top a cloth moistened in oil and wine, or in oil and rose water and cold water, to soothe the hot abscess; then raise the patient's head, and do not untie the bandage until the third day.
And when you untie it, rinse the place very well with oil and water, then treat it with diafinicon ointment and basilicon ointment, until it is healed.
And if hot abscesses and corrosions appear in the wound, and blood clots in the bladder, and the urine is retained because of this, which is known in this way that it comes out with the urine without jumping: then put your finger in the wound, and extract that blood, for if it remains there, it will run to the bladder, and rot it;
then clean the wound with water, vinegar, and salt, and help it in every way that you know, until it is healed;
and it is necessary that every time you treat it, you bind the two thighs together, and apply the medicines to the place.
And if the stone is small, and it is in the urethra, and lodged inside, and the urine cannot come out; then treat it in the way I said before, that you cut it many times, and one is excused from the cutting by this treatment. I have already proven this so.
Take an iron drill according to this form and let it be three-angled, fixed in a firebrand:
then take a thread and tie it around the penis below the stone, so that it cannot return into the bladder;
then put the drill into the penis lightly, until it reaches the stone; and turn the drill with your hand in the stone little by little, until you can pierce the stone on the other side;
then the urine will come immediately, then press your hand on what remains of the stone which is inside the penis. Then it is immediately broken, and jumps out with the urine, and the patient is cured;
and if you cannot do this because of anything that prevents it, then tie a thread under the stone and another above, then cut the penis towards the stone between the two threads, then pull it out, and untie the thread, and cleanse the congealed blood which is in the wound; and treat it until it is healed.
of the stone of women
It rarely happens that a stone is generated in women, and if it happens sometimes, the cure is difficult, and is forbidden for three things:
one is that perhaps the woman is a virgin;
and the second is that one cannot find a knowledgeable woman who reveals herself to the doctors, especially when she is chaste.
And the third reason is that perhaps one cannot find a woman well-skilled in this art;
and the fourth reason is that the stone in a woman is deeper than the stone in a man, wherefore a deeper incision is necessary, and there is great danger. And if necessity demands it, then you must take a well-knowing midwife, and one scarcely finds them, and if you do not find one, then seek at least a clever chaste surgeon;
and present her with a wise woman experienced in the lives of women, or a woman who knows something of the art, and instruct her to do what you command her regarding the examination of the stone; and look very carefully if the woman is a virgin:
and look very carefully if the woman is a virgin: then she must insert her finger into the rectum and search for the stone;
and if she finds it, then she should press it beneath her finger, and instruct her to put her finger into the vagina of the patient, and press her left hand firmly upon the bladder.
If she finds it, then she must move it gradually from the entrance of the bladder downwards, until it reaches the root of the thigh;
then cut above the stone at the root of the thigh towards the middle of the vagina, where it is usually found, and the stone is felt in that part; and do not move her finger above or below the stone, and let the initial incision be small;
and do not move her finger above or below the stone, and let the initial incision be small; then put the instrument into the incision; if you feel the stone, enlarge the wound until the stone can come out, and know that there are many kinds of stones:
that is to say, small and large, rough and smooth, long and round, and those which have branches.
so know their similarities to know the outcome.
And if the blood overcomes you, put crushed vitriol on the place, and hold it for an hour until the bleeding is stopped;
then return to your work, until the stone is out, and have the instruments that I have told you about in the extraction of stones from men to help you in your work;
and if the blood overcomes you, and it is from the artery which is cut, put the powder on the place and restrain it with tents and bandages, and do not begin again, and leave the stone and do not extract it, lest by chance the patient die; then treat the wound.
And when the heat of the blood is calmed, and the place is cleansed, then return to your work, until the stone is out.
A watery hernia is nothing other than a gathering of moisture or white humors, which is beneath the skin of the scrotum, containing the testicle;
and it is called "syfac," and sometimes it is properly in the membrane of the testicle, so that one thinks that it is another testicle; and it is the skin of the scrotum between the white humor that we have mentioned;
and this happens only rarely. And the generation of this hernia is from weakness that comes to the testicles, and this matter is spread.
And sometimes it comes from a blow to the testicles, and this humor has many colors: or it is a color tending towards jaundice, or it is without red, or black, or watery white, and this happens more;
and these are the signs to know this gathering, for if it is in the white sheath that we have mentioned, the abscess is round, somewhat long like the shape of an egg, and the testicle does not appear, for it is covered with humor all around.
And if there is humor in the proper tunic, the abscess is round with part of an egg, and therefore it is thought that it is another egg;
and if the humor is between the skin of the testicles and the white sheath, one feels it well;
therefore when you wish to know the color of the humor, test it with the completely inserted probe, of which the form is shown above. According to what comes out after the probe, judge what is inside.
And when we cure it with iron, it is necessary that the patient be bled according to his strength and the repletion of his body;
then he is placed on his back, on something a little high, and many cloths are placed under him;
then sit on his left, and instruct the assistant to sit on the right, and extend the rod to one of the two ribs of the heart, towards the testicles;
then take a sharp knife, and cut the skin of the scrotum lengthwise to the handle, and let your incision be completely straight, separating the skin of the scrotum to the white fascia, and carefully scrape it according to your ability;
then pierce the watery fascia with one large hole, and drain all the water, and then apply your ointments, and stretch the fascia upwards;
and do not touch the testicles themselves, but only the fascia; cut all or some parts of the side very thinly, because if you do not cut it skillfully, the water will return;
and if the testicle jumps out during your work, put it back in place when you have completed the work on the fascia;
then join the two lips of the scrotum with a suture, then treat it like other wounds, until it is healed.
And if you find the testicle corrupted by another illness, you must tie the suspensory vessels, fearing the flow of blood;
then cut the testicle with all the suspensory ligament, and remove the testicle, and treat it as we have said.
And if pus is collected in two parts together, know that these are two branches; then cut the other part as you did the first equally, then wipe the blood, and put in the wound wool soaked in rose oil;
then cut the other part as you did the first equally, then wipe the blood, and put in the wound wool soaked in rose oil; and put outside other wool soaked in wine and oil, and put it over the two testicles, and put over it doubled cloths, and bind it all with the bandage which is according to this form:
Then take two cloths, and fill them with lint according to this likeness and let them be joined by sewing at the top of the breeches, and one of the ends should reach from the bottom to the back, and the other to the part of the groin;
and the other two ends over the two buttocks, and let the whole bandage be fastened in the buckle of the breeches;
and sometimes this branch is treated with cautery instead of an iron incision, and that is that you take a thin, knife-like cautery, and cut the skin of the testicles, and let it be heated as we have said, so that the white layer containing the water is uncovered;
then take the cautery according to this form, and pierce that layer with the points, and scorch it with this hot, thin cautery:
And cut it in every way that you can, until you have eradicated it all;
and take care that the fire does not touch the testicle;
and know that this operation is safer; and more careful to prevent bleeding, and gentler than cutting operations;
and if anything opposes you, whether abscess, bleeding, or something else, then treat that which opposes you, according to what has been said before.
And if the patient is fearful and does not want to undergo this operation because of its horror, then administer perforation, as I tell you, and it is that when you are certain by the signs that we have mentioned that watery humor is present, then have the patient sit on a raised seat; then pierce the abscess in the lower part with a spatula as wide as possible, and make the perforation along the length of the body;
and let the opening be wide, so that all the water may flow out;
then put cotton on the place, and bind it, and let the remaining water drain, then treat it until the wound is healed;
and if the white cloth does not allow the water to escape from the opening of the wound, then you must insert a feather or the instrument with which one draws water from dropsical patients, the form of which is given above;
and slightly enlarge the wound, and know that the water returns and collects after six months or thereabouts, and when it is collected as before, and thus the patient will spend his days.
Know that in the incision of this branch there is fear in many situations, wherefore it seems to me that it is better to leave it;
and I will tell you the procedure and the symptoms of the abscess.
I say then that many abscesses arise in the body, and especially in the testicles; and this is due to many causes.
That is to say, by an excess of acrid and watery humor, which is spread to the testicles, or from percussion;
and the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body; and it does not cause pain, and is a serious abscess;
and perhaps some abscesses are serious, dangerous, and suppurative, and of a livid color, and sometimes come from an artery, or from vein inflammation.
When it is from an artery, it is known by the disposition of the hot abscess, when you press it with your fingers; and you must not touch it.
That which is made from vein inflammation is known by its disposition upon expression by touching with the fingers, and one can well make an incision upon this type, and upon other sores; and it is that you cut the heart of the scrotum, then extend the testicle upwards, and draw the tunic away from the white membrane, and free the suspensory ligament from all parts of the testicle.
If the testicle is already adhered to the surrounding flesh, then you must draw out the testicle, and cut it;
and if it is attached to the membrane, or to that which is within the vessels, then you must free all that membrane, and cut it roundly.
And if the origin of the flesh is at the rear location, then you must cut it all away, and extract the testicle, as we have said.
And when your work is completed, fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine, then treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
This is an abscess enveloped in a covering similar to a bud, with softening of the testicles, and the patient moves with difficulty when he walks;
and the cure of this illness is almost as frightening as the one before, and yet we will tell you how to treat it, according to what the ancients did.
It is necessary that you make the patient sit on a raised seat, then put the suspensory of the testicles down to your fingers, with all the vessels that are close to the penis, and let the master hold them and stretch them greatly;
then cut with a wide, sharp spatula across the vessels, until they are uncovered, and then scrape on each side, as we have said in the extraction of the arteries that are in the temples;
then insert a needle with double thread, and tie it at the first place where the pus came, and tie it again at the other end; then cut them in half straight, along the length of the body, and draw out the corrupted fluids;
then treat the wound like the others where you apply a bandage, so that no vessel is cut that nourishes one of the testicles;
for by this no harm comes, and if pus comes to all the vessels, then it is necessary to remove the testicles with all the vessels; so that the testicle does not lose its nourishment due to the incision of the vessels, and dries up and cannot be helped.
The occurrence of this hernia is by the incision that occurs in the diaphragm, or the distension on the abdomen in the groin area, because of which the intestine descends from that rupture to one of the testicles;
and this rupture is either of the diaphragm, or of the distension of it, and these two manners come from many causes:
from percussion, or from jumping, or from shouting, or from lifting a heavy weight, and by similar things;
and the signs when it is from the distension of the diaphragm, is that it happens little by little, over a long time, and does not come suddenly; and the abscesses are equal even towards the depth, because the diaphragm presses on the intestine.
And the sign is that when it is from the section of the diaphragm, it causes sudden pain at the beginning, and the abscesses appear differently, under the skin near, and this is because of the issue of the intestine and the body on the outside of the diaphragm.
And sometimes the intestines descend with the intestine, and are retained there, and cause the patient to suffer great pain, especially when it is pressed.
And in these iron treatments there is fear, wherefore it is necessary to avoid them.
And the manner of the work is that you instruct the patient to return the intestine with his hand inside into the wound, if he can return it there; then let it be supported on its neck between your hands, and raise the thighs;
then extend the scrotum above, and cut all the skin of the testicles lengthwise; then put inside the lips of the wound hooks according to what you need to open the wound, and let it be such that the egg can come out;
then flay the fascia which is under the skin of the testicles, until the white hard fascia is uncovered on all sides;
then put your index finger into that which surrounds the testicle, into that which is between the white fascia which is under the skin of the egg, and between the second fascia, and separate that which is behind the egg, and between the second fascia;
and then move with your right hand inside the scrotum, and extend the white fascia upwards with your left hand, and lift the egg with all the fascia towards the groin; and instruct the assistant to extend the egg upwards, and untie that which is behind the ligature;
and search with your fingers if there is any part of the intestine enveloped in the hard white fascia, and if you find anything, then put it back into the abdomen below;
then take a needle with a thick thread made of ten threads, and put it into the back part of the fascia, which is behind the skin of the scrotum; after the waist, then cut the ends of the threads which appear, until there are four threads; then assemble them one over the other in the manner of a cross, and tie the fascia, of which we have spoken which is under the skin of the scrotum, with a strong ligature in two parts; then wrap the ends of the threads, and tie them firmly in two parts, so that none of the vessels which nourish them can enter in, that no abscess may form there; and place the ligature again according to the first ligature along two fingers of it, and after these two ligatures leave of the fascia which is under the skin of the scrotum the breadth of a finger; and afterwards all the rest according to the roundness that the testicle has;
then cut in the part which is under the skin of the scrotum, until the blood flows, and the bowel, as we have said before;
then apply wool moistened in oil, and put it in the wound, and apply the ligature that we have mentioned. And sometimes the white fascia that we have mentioned is cauterized, after the incision, for fear of bleeding. For this happens many times, and leave the ligature until it falls off by itself;
and if it is slow to fall off, let it be sprinkled with warm water, and apply what we have said, until it falls off;
then treat the wound with another treatment, until it is perfectly healed.
of fleshy hernia
In this branch I never saw anyone who dared to perform the treatment with iron.
And the ancients said that it is done like the branch that is next to the vein, in such a way that you tie the vessels, after cutting above or slightly below;
then cut in half, and treat the abscess with those who operate, until the vessels bleed;
and treat it as we have said, until it is healed.
Sometimes a rupture occurs in the angles, as we have said, and the place opens;
and none of the intestines descend to the testicles, and if any descend, it is little, and returns every hour;
and yet if it remains too long at this point, the wound or sheath grows, until the intestine descends;
and this happens by the extension of the sheath which is at the angles, as we have said, for it is extended, then the place is softened and swollen and opens;
and the cure is by cautery, as we have said before;
and sometimes it is cured by iron in this manner: and that is that the patient lies often on his back between your hands, then cut the swollen place of the rupture widely according to the quantity of three fingers;
and then extract the sheath which is under the skin that follows it, then take the root and put it on the apparent place of the sheath;
and press it to the depth of the belly, then sew the two apparent places of the sheath over the head of the root, and sew one and the other;
then pull out the head of the root, and do not cut the sheath nor stretch the egg nor anything else, as I have made known to you in the cure of the rupture of the intestines; then cure it by the cure of wounds.
then cure it by the cure of wounds. And when you cut the threads, cleanse and treat the wound until it is healed.
The sheath is constricted, and there is no appearance of rupture, and the cautery is gentler in this place, and closer to salvation.
of the softening of the skin of the testicles
Many times the skin of the testicles is softened in some men, because the flesh within is softened, and it is ugly to see;
and it is necessary, when one wishes to cure it, that one makes the patient lie on his back, and cuts the softened skin from the natural skin;
then bring the two edges together with a suture, and if you wish, first sew the excess of the softened skin with three or four sutures firmly;
then cut between the sutures, and cure it like other wounds, until it is healed, and the thread comes out.
Of the castration
Know that castration is forbidden in our law, and therefore I would prefer not to speak of it in this book;
and it is only necessary for two reasons:
one is that the surgeon knows how to respond when asked, and knows the treatment;
and the other, because we often need to castrate some animals to help us, such as goats and sheep and cats and other animals.
I say then that castration is done in two ways: either by pulling, or by cutting.
In that which we do by pulling, we make the animal sit in warm water, until the testicles are softened and hanging; then take them in your hand, until they are retracted and you no longer feel them.
Of castration by cutting: you must hold the animal, and press the skin of the testicles with your left hand, then tie the suspensory, and cut above each testicle in one cut, when you have properly skinned them;
and leave some bit of the tunica vaginalis and the thin membrane which is over the vessels;
and this method of castration is better than that which is done by pulling, because in pulling, by chance, something of the testicles remains, wherefore the animal desires lust;
then treat the wound until it is healed.
of the hermaphrodites
Hermaphroditism is according to two manners in men: one is that between the two testicles appears, as it were, the figure of the nature of a woman, where there is hair, and sometimes the urine flows there.
And the other manner is in women, and she has above the pubis as it were a penis and two testicles.
And the cure of the man and the woman is that you cut away all the added flesh, and treat them as other wounds;
in the second manner, of men from whom the urine leaks through the skin of the testicles, there is no cure.
Tenesmus is a growth on the genitals, so that it is very ugly to see; and some women have it as large as a hand, and this is the cure.
It is necessary that you hold the excess of the tenesmus in your hand or with tweezers, and cut it lightly;
and do not go too deep, lest bleeding occur, then cure it with another cure until it is healed;
and another growth that grows at the opening of the womb, and fills it, and sometimes bursts forth, and is like a cow's udder, and for this reason the ancients called it "cow disease". Then you must cut it, as we have said of the tenesmus, and cure it until it is healed.
Erratic is when the woman's nature is not complete, or the opening is small; and is natural by birth, or accidental by illness that has come upon it;
and is natural by birth, or accidental by illness that has come upon it; or it is by added flesh, or by a subtle or thick membrane, and is made deeply in the vulva, or on the sides, or below, or wherever it may be;
and prevents conception, and childbirth, and perhaps having menstruation;
and the knowledge of this is by the examination of the vagina.
If the stoppage is close at hand, I search with my fingers or a probe.
If it is of a thin membrane, and it is close to the labia, hurry, and break it thus:
place your two index fingers together, and the woman should be on her back, her legs spread;
then stretch the labia widely, until the thin membrane is broken, and the stoppage is opened;
then take wool, and moisten it in oil, and place it on the spot, and let the woman lie with a man each day, so that it cannot heal.
And if the membrane is hard and thick, then you must cut it with a spatula similar to a myrtle leaf.
If the stoppage is of fleshy origin, then lift it with a hook and cut it;
and have styptic medicines, such as acacia, dragon's blood, incense, together with egg white;
then apply a broad lead plate, so that the wound cannot heal;
and so it should be for a long time, and apply a tent of dry linen;
then it should be treated with other treatments until it is healed.
And when in the swelling comes new flesh, then it must be cut according to this manner, unless it is festering abscesses. For a festering abscess which is in the swelling, one should not touch with iron.
of the hemorrhoids Hemorrhoids are openings of veins from which blood usually flows, and when the hemorrhoids are old they become swollen;
and we have already spoken in the division of the similarities of these, and the signs, and I will say here those which receive cure.
I say that hemorrhoids and swelling, when they are deep in the swelling, and they do not appear to the touch, then the cure is not by iron.
Those which are at the opening of the swelling, which one can feel, are those which one can cure.
It is necessary then that you place the woman in a cold house, then stretch the swelling with tongs, and cut it at its roots, then sprinkle on medicines that restrain blood, such as acacia and dragon's blood and incense, and similar things;
then place her feet against the wall for an hour, then place her in cold water;
and if a flow of blood comes, then make her sit in a decoction of sumac and pomegranate bark and oak galls and similar things, and then take barley flour, and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster on her back.
And if it stops, that is good. If not, apply cupping glasses to the back and breasts without cutting;
then take wool, and moisten it in plantain juice or agrimony juice with old wine, and apply it to the area.
And when the abscess subsides, treat the area with ointment until it is healed;
and that which is called "albathir" is red, and is similar to a rough head, so it must be cut as I have said of the thelul; and then treat it until it is healed.
Many kinds of abscesses occur in the mare, such as cancer and stony abscess and herpes and esthiomenes and fistulas and hemorrhoids and hot abscess, and many other diseases that I have mentioned in the division.
It is necessary then that I discuss in this treatise the hot abscess which occurs in the mare, which is not one of the abscesses that collect pus;
And if you wish to know the work of iron, see if the abscess is sharp at the beginning of its appearance, and full of heat and fever, and if it becomes red if you can see it. Then do not hasten to pierce it, but let it mature until the pain is lessened;
and then make the patient sit on a seat, and have two small seats where he leans, and rests on his back and brings his feet together at the lower part of the leg;
and let his thighs be spread, and place his arms under his knees, and bind them well with a good bandage;
then suck him towards the right side, and administer the instrument with which one opens the mouth of the abscess, of which the form follows here;
and it is necessary that when you see this instrument administered, that you first insert a probe to know the depth of the abscess, so that what enters of the instrument does not go deeper than it should, and that it does not injure the patient; and if the instrument is larger, it is necessary to cover the depth of the abscess with cloths, so that the instrument does not harm it;
and it is necessary that he place the cone of the instrument on top, and that he hold the instrument.
And when the abscess opens, and one feels it with a soft hand, then it is necessary to cut it at the head, with a spatula;
and when the boil is emptied, it is necessary that you place in the wound tents soaked in rose oil, or in dry verdigris oil;
and place the tent deep into the abscess, and place on the outside of the abscess and on the wound clean wool soaked in water in which mallows have been cooked;
then cure it after two days with an ointment suitable for this, until it is healed;
and sometimes one cleans the abscess and the wound with an enema of water and honey, and then with water in which lily roots and birthwort have been cooked; then return to the ointment.
And if the wound is hidden in the abscess, then you must avoid cauterization with iron, but treat it as we have said in the division.
of childbirth It is first necessary for the midwife to know the form of natural childbirth, and the signs are when you see the woman pressing downwards, and desiring to breathe the air:
then the child hastens to come out; then know that this childbirth is according to the natural form, and the exit is head first, and the afterbirth with it;
and when you see these signs, it is necessary to gently press her belly, so that the child comes out quickly;
for when it descends head first, the afterbirth comes out with it, and the womb is cleansed of its superfluities by good cleansing;
and that which comes otherwise does not come naturally.
For sometimes it comes feet first, and the body or head and hands come out first, or it comes on its belly, or sideways, and is perhaps twisted around its neck, and in other bad ways;
so it is necessary for the midwife that she be wise and subtle in these things, and beware of error and deceit, and I will show you all the ways how one should help her.
If the child comes head first by natural issue, and the woman gives birth with difficulty, and her strength is weak, then make her sit on a saddle, or have the women hold her;
and raise her with oil of fenugreek which has been cooked, and then the midwife puts between her fingers the little spatula of which this is the form: and she splits the secundine, and cuts with her nail until the moisture that is inside runs out;
and she takes the woman's belly until the child descends, and if it does not descend, then it is necessary to give the woman a clyster of fenugreek mucilage with oil of sesame;
then make her sneeze and cough with sneezing powder, and hold her mouth and nose for an hour: then the child will come out immediately.
And if the two hands come out, then you must gently put them back little by little; and if they cannot go in, then put the woman on a seat, and raise her feet; then lower the seat to the ground, and hold the woman so that she does not fall when it is lowered;
and if the hands cannot enter, and the child dies, then cut the hands with the knife that is mentioned above, and extract the child, and reposition it equally.
of the delivery of the child on its feet When the child comes on its feet, then it is necessary to push it upwards; and then turn it little by little, until it is even;
then take one of the feet and extend it little by little.
When it comes down to the thighs, then instruct to grasp it, and make it sneeze with a decoction; if it jumps further, if God wills.
And if it does not go further as we have said, then turn it little by little, until it is according to the natural form. For then it will come out easily.
And if it does not come out as we have said, then take mallow mucilage, and linseed oil, and melted gum, and grind everything in a mortar; and apply this ointment to the woman's genitals and outside, then have her sit in warm water up to the ribs;
and when she is softened below, make her a pessary of myrrh, and insert it below, and leave it for an hour; then have her sit on a seat, then have her sneeze and hold her mouth and nose, and gently press her belly, for the child will come out immediately.
of the child's exit onto her knees When the child comes in this way, let the midwife put her hands in little by little; then let her be supported by her neck, and her feet hanging down, and let her lie on a bed; and fold her hands little by little, and then take her hands on her belly, and remove the pillows from under her, until she is positioned downwards; and if the child does not come out, take its feet and move them strongly, then move its belly upwards, then put your hands in; and draw the child out little by little; and instruct the woman to strain until the child comes out.
of the delivery of the child which comes from the womb, one hand at a time. It is necessary to devise a way to bring back the hand: if one cannot bring it back, then make the woman stand and walk;
if she cannot walk, then make her lie on the bed, and spread her legs widely;
then administer the mucilage that I have described;
and if she does not give birth, then make her sit on a seat, then study how to bring back the hand; and draw out the child according to its natural position, and make her sneeze, and instruct her to strain until the child comes out.
of the child's exit over its neck, and its hands spread out, and its face turned towards its mother's back it is necessary that the midwife hold its hand, then turn it little by little, and draw it gently;
and when it is even, then apply to the part a poultice of mallow and oil, as we have said, then instruct her to move little by little;
and when you have done this, then make her sit on a seat, and instruct her to strain; and make her sneeze. in this same manner for the afterbirth
in this same manner for the afterbirth When it comes out in this manner with the afterbirth, cut the afterbirth with your nail until the moisture is emptied;
and if the child hangs by its face and neck, cut it from the buttocks so that it is not retained and the child dies;
then put the child inside, until you have placed it as it should be, and instruct the woman to hold herself sometimes:
Of the birth of twins Know that twins are often born, and sometimes three or four are born; and that is not a strange thing, and it happens little. Three are a strange thing, and they do not live, except a few;
Three are a strange thing, and they do not live, except a few; I know that, if they are multiplied, and are separated by the membrane which divides them, which is attached to the navel;
and sometimes they come out as naturally as a single one, as we have said.
And if they come out badly, treat them as we have said, and let the hand be skillful, and do quickly and lightly what it does; and do as is most conducive to salvation. of several children
Sometimes they are formed in the womb, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, or more, up to fifteen, and they are all formed in the shape of a child by the measurement of the wise and glorious, and the healer must know all this, for by chance similar things happen; then he should act accordingly.
of the dead child
When you treat a woman with a dead child in her womb, as I have said in the division, and it does not come out, and you are constrained to use your hands; then you must know if the woman is of sound constitution, and has no accident or fear of death;
then the woman should be placed on her back, with her head inclined downward, and her legs raised;
and the attendant should hold her in two places, or she should be tied to the bed so that she is not pulled during the descent of the child;
then rub the mouth of the womb with moist oils with a mucilage of mallow and fenugreek and linseed, then let the person assisting oil their hands with these oils and mucilages;
then insert them into the womb gently, then find a suitable place to insert the ointments, and take care that the child is positioned to descend head first;
then insert the ointments into its eyes or its neck or its mouth or its palate or under the chin or in the clavicle or near the ribs, and if the descent is feet first, insert them into the heel and the middle ribs;
and it is necessary that he hold the ointment with his right hand, and place the curvature between the fingers of his left hand, and gently insert it with his whole hand, and insert the ointment into any of these places that we have mentioned, until it reaches the empty space;
then insert another ointment, or a third if you need it, so that the extractions are equal;
and then spread it evenly by moving from one side to the other, to allow pus to escape, and let the ointments be toothed to hold the pus, as is the form here:
And if some remains, let him lubricate some of his fingers with oil, and insert them into that part, and draw out the other part;
and if any remains, place this ointment on a higher place, and do this until it all comes out.
And if one hand comes before the other, and he cannot bring it back because of the tightness, you must wrap it in a cloth until it is all out; then cut it at the joint of the sole or at the heel, and thus you must do in the other hand, and in the two feet.
And if the child's head is large and it is narrow at the exit, or it has a sharp, collected head, you must insert the spatumile espinous between your fingers, and split the head and draw out the water; or you round it with the instrument that is called "almidach," the shape of which is shown with the instruments in the chapter which follows this one;
and do the same if the child has a naturally large head;
and then pull out the bones with tongs, and if the head jumps out and is drawn out by the forceps, let it be split, until the moisture that is in the worst place comes out;
and if it cannot come out, cut it into pieces as best you can;
and if it is swollen in the belly or under the ribs, then you must pierce it until the moisture runs out.
And if the child is on its feet, the extraction is easy, and the straightening at the mouth of the womb is easy.
And if it is narrow in the belly or chest, then you must extract it with a cloth wrapped around your hand; and cut the belly or chest until the moisture that is there runs out;
and if the other limbs are removed, and the head remains, then the midwife puts her hand deep into the womb, and pulls it out to the mouth of the womb; then puts in a hook or two, and pulls it forcefully out;
and if the mouth of the womb is constricted by a hot abscess that has formed there, then you should not work there, but should apply moist and oily substances; and apply plasters, and sit in softening and moistening water.
And if the child is on its side, and you can reposition it evenly, then administer what we have said for a living child;
and if one does not have the power [to do so], then pull it out forcefully in pieces, and leave nothing of the afterbirth.
And when you have done this, then administer what we have said for hot abscesses that occur in the womb;
and if a flow of blood occurs, let it be placed in astringent water, and administer other treatments.
And I saw a woman in whose womb a child had died, then another was conceived upon that one, and the other died. After a long time, an abscess came to her in the groin, and it swelled until it opened, and began to greatly fester.
I was called to treat it, and I thought about it for a long time, and could not heal the wound.
I applied a plaster of strong attraction, and a bone came out, and after some days another. I wondered greatly, because the belly has no bones.
So I thought that it was the bones of a dead child.
I searched the wound, and drew out more bones, until the woman was in better condition; and the woman lived a long time thus, and a little pus always issued from the place;
and I have included this chapter only because, when the master finds a strange thing, he should know how to help.
After this comes the form of the pressor, with which one uses the books;
and with two turnings at the two heads of the two ligaments. However, the horns should be more subtle than the restrictor, and should be made of ebony or boxwood;
and the mouth of the wood should be one finger wide, and the edge of the horns one finger, and one and a half palms long; and between the two ligaments should be two additions of this same wood, which should be fastened in one and the other, half a palm long or a little more;
and these two additions are inserted into the mouth of the trepan to open when one turns the two horns.
Another form, similar in appearance but more subtle and lighter, should be made of ebony or boxwood, similar to tongs; and have at the two ends two additions, as you see, one palm long, and two fingers wide;
and when you want to open the trepan with the whole instrument, have the woman sit on a bed, her feet hanging down and her legs open, then put the two additions fitted together into the trepan, and hold the head of the instrument underneath between her thighs; then work your hand with the whole instrument, as you did with the tongs equally, according to the amount you want to open the mouth of the trepan, until the opening makes what it wants.
These instruments are all surpassed, and their forms are multiplied; and when the surgeon has prepared them, the work is so much faster, and higher for men because of their quantity.
Do not despise the instrument that you have not prepared, for their necessity is not excusable.
When the afterbirth is retained in childbirth, you must instruct the patient to hold her breath, then make her sneeze with a potion, and press your hands to her mouth and nose; and if it comes out because of this, it is good.
If not, take a pot, and make a hole in the lid, and put in herbs that can open the mouth of the womb, such as calamint, rue, anise, chamomile, cassia lignea, and centaury; all these herbs, or some of them, should be boiled in the pot in water over the fire;
then put a tube in the hole of the pot, and the other end into the mouth of the womb, and hold it until the vapors enter the womb;
then make her sneeze, as we have said. If the afterbirth comes out quickly.
And if it remains after this treatment, and does not come out, instruct the midwife to moisten her left hand in sesame oil or in mallow poultice, and then put it into the birth canal, and search for the afterbirth; and when she has found it, let her take it and gently pull it straight out, so that the womb does not fall out during extraction;
but she should move it gently to the right and to the left, and then pull; then it will come and be extracted.
And if the mouth of the womb is too narrow, we have mentioned the treatment of sneezing, and of herbal fumigation;
and if it does not come out from all that we have said, be careful not to be hasty in pulling;
but it is necessary that what is at the mouth of the womb, you tie it to the thigh of the woman, then you apply a clyster of tetrafarmacon ointment; then it will rot and soften, and come out.
However, when it rots, a bad odor comes to the stomach and head, and harms the patient. Then suitable fumigations are necessary for this:
Some of the ancients have tested fumigation of cress and dried figs.
The form of the instrument with which one fumigates the woman for the retention of the flowers and the afterbirth is this:
And it is of glass, similar to a funnel, and one puts the narrow end inside the woman, and the wide end over the fire;
and let the fumigation be on the coals, and burn it until it is consumed, and begin again with another.
Many children are born who do not have the fundament pierced, but have it stopped up by a thin membrane: therefore it is necessary for the midwife that she pierce that membrane with her finger, and not pierce it with a sharp instrument, and she should guard against injuring it that she does not touch it;
then put on wool moistened in wine and oil, then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if you doubt that it will close up again, put a lead cannula in the opening, and leave it there for several days, and it should be removed when the child wants to go to the toilet.
And sometimes this obstruction comes from a sudden wound or abscess; then it is necessary to cut that obstruction: then it should be treated, as we have said of the lead cannula.
Fistulas which come from below the fundament are swellings and thickenings which come near the fundament externally, or in the space between the two parts; there is one fistula or several;
and when that swelling is old, it works, and sometimes white or subtle pus flows out, and sometimes these fistulas are perforated;
and are known by the fact that there comes out with the excretion or flatulence when the patient excretes, and sometimes a worm jumps out.
And there are fistulas which pierce as far as the bladder, and as far as the middle of the penis; and reach as far as the joint of the thigh, and as far as the buttock.
And thus one recognizes the fistula perforating the rectum, and not perforating: and that is that you put your index finger in the rectum, and put a thin needle of bronze or iron into the fistula when there is no tortuosity.
And if there is tortuosity, then put a thin lead tent or a horsehair there, until you feel the tent or the hair on your finger;
and if you do not feel it, and neither excretion nor flatulence nor worm comes from the opening, as we have said: know that it does not perforate; then hasten to cure it.
And when the fistula penetrates to the bladder or to the urinary duct, urine escapes from it, and it cannot be healed by medicines.
If it is pierced as far as the hip joint, the tent is brought to the place; if there is no tortuosity and the origin of the pain is around, it is that there is always a boil, and no medicine or sudden ointment helps;
and in these penetrating fistulas there is no cure except labor, and the vanity of foolish doctors who meddle with them.
In that which is not penetrating and is not old, there is hope of healing by iron, as I have experienced, and it is that the patient lies on his back between your hands;
and raise his legs up to his thighs, and have his thighs bent towards his belly; then insert a tent of bronze, or of lead if there is tortuosity, until you know where the tent reaches.
If the patient feels it around the fundament, then you must put your index finger there, if you then feel that the tent has pierced it;
and it is discovered where you feel between your finger the pus or the flesh, then know that it is penetrating; then do not work on it if it cannot be healed.
It is said however that one can heal some, but this happens rarely;
and the help that is done, is that one heats the subtle cautery according to the width of the fistula, as it is said before; and puts it very hot into the fistula, until it reaches near the bottom; and do this two or three times, until you know that the rotten flesh is burned, which is similar to a bird's feather;
and then treat it with tents moistened in butter, until that rotten flesh comes out, then treat it with an ointment that generates flesh and heals.
If it is thus healed, it is good.
If this, it cannot be healed otherwise;
and if the tent enters, and does not pierce down to the finger which is in the bottom, and there is between your finger and the tent a thick covering of flesh or of membrane, and you see the fistula at that which follows the covering of the heart; then cut from the beginning of the fistula, and push the tent forward constantly, and then cauterize afterwards, until it reaches the end of the tent; and the tent will be delivered, and will fall;
then cleanse those rotten flesh which resemble a bird's feather, and let nothing remain.
And if the blood overcomes you, and flows between you and the work, then cauterize it with fire or with a sharp medicine.
For fire cautery combines two good things: that is to say, the burning of these added fleshes, and the staunching of blood and the drying of the moisture;
then treat it with tents moistened in butter or in crushed herbs, until the place casts off pus, and the burned flesh separates in the pus;
then treat the wound with ointments that soften hard flesh, and these are dry medicines.
For when it is restored, it is healed and does not return.
And if a fistula reaches to the bottom of the fundament, and is distant from the body, put your finger into the fundament and search there.
If you feel the tent, and between two is the membrane or the fascia or flesh, where it is about to pierce, then there is no other way of confidence and hope, through the use of one of the three methods:
either you cauterize it as we have said, or you cut it to the bottom, or if you can, put tents there and treat it as before;
and do not go too deep, lest you cut the structure that holds the fundament, and the excrement comes out involuntarily; then treat it, as we have said;
then treat it, as we have said; perhaps it will be healed, or you remove that covering and clean it after it is cut away from the fundament, either with a tent or with another pointed instrument; then cleanse that rotten flesh which is in the wound, as much as you can; then strive to restore the wound, and to keep the fistula in the part outside the fundament:
then strive to restore the wound, and to keep the fistula in the part outside the fundament: this will be easier for the patient.
And sometimes fistulas are like this: and it is when you place the tent in the fistula, and it is beside the fundament near the skin above, then take a tent pierced at the end according to this form: And put one twisted thread in two, and put the tent with the thread into the fistula until it reaches the end.
If it is penetrating into the margin of the fundament inside, then pull the thread from that hole, so that you put your finger into the fundament;
and pull the end of the thread, and bring the two ends together, and pull one against the other, and leave it one or two days;
and restrain it sometimes, until the thread cuts the flesh that is between the two, and they separate;
then treat the wound until it is healed and sound.
If the fistula does not pierce, make it pierce in every way that you can, if it is not too deep. For it is not necessary to cut too deeply for the laceration, and then treat it, as we have said, until it is healed.
The shape of the pointed spatula with which one cuts the fistula is very sharp on one side and cutting; and on the other side not, so that one does not cut what one should not cut, as you see here:
Hemorrhoids are according to two manners: or they are inside the rectum, like grains of resin, and there are small and large ones, and they constantly bleed, and there is one or more, and they are outside the rectum and at the end of the rectum;
but those which are outside have little moisture, and constantly a little citrine water or a little blood, and have the color of the body;
and the cure of those who have them inside the rectum, is that you instruct the patient to strain to go to the privy, until the rectum protrudes, and the threads appear; then hasten, and grasp it with tongs, or hold it with your fingernail, then cut it at its roots;
and if the hooks cannot hold them because of their moisture, then take them with a rag, or with cotton, or a piece of chamois leather; and pull them out with your fingers, then cut them, and sprinkle on some hot powders which are in place of a cautery; or you cauterize them as is said in the chapter on cautery, then treat them with other treatments until they are healed;
and if the matter cannot come out, then clysterize the patient with a biting and harsh clyster to wash what is in the fundament, so that it may come out clearly; when the patient is seized, and if the threads are strong from the fundament, then the cure is easy;
when the patient is seized, and if the threads are strong from the fundament, then the cure is easy; and it is that you take them with your fingernail or with pincers, and cut them, then treat them as we have said, until they are healed, and that he fears the incision with iron. Then you must administer the suture in this manner:
Then you must administer the suture in this manner: take a twisted thread, and put it in a needle, and then pull the thread above and make the needle pierce on the other side, and turn the two ends of the thread under the needle, and let it be wide;
and pull the thread tightly, then knot the thread, and pull out the needle, and do so for all the others, and leave one to run off the excess blood;
then put on the wound a cloth moistened in rose oil or cerate, and put it on the wound, and tell the patient to rest;
and then leave it until they fall off, and when they have fallen off, treat them with ointment and other treatment, until they are healed.
of the drying of the wound or bottom Many times there is drying of the bowels in the intestine, and by constriction of nature, and when the illness is old and medicine does not help. Then you must scrape with the point of a spatula or your fingernail the top layer of skin, which will prevent it from becoming moist; then treat it until it is healed as it should be;
and if it cannot heal, then begin scraping again more forcefully than before, until it is very healthy, and is scraped; then treat it until it is healed.
of the trembling Formication is a slight tingling sensation around the body, and goes very deep;
and sometimes it finds the cold, and one feels it as if dead from trembling, and it comes throughout the body, and more in the hands than elsewhere.
And the cure is that you take a quill from a goose feather, or a strong vulture feather, and place that quill on the trembling, until the circle encompasses the trembling all around; then turn your hand with the quill until you cut all around the trembling, and put it deep, and pluck the trembling from its roots.
And if you wish, do this with a quill of bronze or iron according to this form, and let it be subtle below and wider above: not pierced, to hold easily to the finger, and easily press.
And if you wish, cauterize the trembling, as it is before in the chapter on cautery.
Sometimes a clyster is made of silver or of pewter, or of molten or hammered bronze;
and sometimes these instruments are made small and large, according to those to whom they are administered. Those then which are administered in the treatment of children and who are weak and painful, are small.
Those then which are administered in the treatment of children and who are weak and painful, are small. The form of the clyster, small and large, is wider above, where the belly is bound according to this manner:
and there is an opening where the belly is bound, as you see, and the end is pierced inside;
and has on one side two holes, and on the other one;
and let the belly where one puts the medicines be of an animal bladder or of parchment, and let it be pierced all around with small holes, and let there be one finger's breadth between each hole, then put into these holes a strong thread of raw thread twisted in X or around, and gather the belly like a goat's bladder; and when the medicine is inside, tie it to the instrument in front with a strong thread, then clysterize;
and this is the form of the circle:
And let the medicine be neither too hot nor too cold, and anoint the head of the clyster with oil or egg white, or something similar, then insert it gently; then the attendant squeezes it with both hands together, until it is all empty, then withdraw the clyster, and let the patient raise his legs to the wall, and if the medicine wants to come out, hold it as long as you can; and if he sleeps a whole night, it is a greater help.
And if you clysterize him for a disease of looseness of the bowels, and the medicine hastens to come out, repeat it until he is healed.
And if the hemorrhoids are in the fundament, or an abscess, let the clyster be as fine as for a child;
and this is the form of the fine clyster on which the leather is stretched:
We have already spoken in the division of the treatment of wounds;
now we will tell you the cures by hand and by medicine, according to the completion.
I say that wounds are diverse according to how they are made, and according to the places where the wounds are made, and of what they are made.
The things by which wounds are made are by the throwing of a stone, and the cut of a sword and of a knife, or of a lance or of a stick or of an arrow, or of similar things;
or that are made according to the places of the body, such as a wound that falls on the neck, or on the head, or the foot, or the belly, or the liver, and similar members;
and I will tell you the cure of each wound, and will begin with the simple wounds of the head, for the remembrance will come in its chapter.
I say that when a simple wound comes to the head, and the bone is not broken, then take care if it is from the throwing of a stone or similar things, and the skin is nevertheless broken and the wound is large, and you fear the rising of a hot abscess: then make it bleed immediately from the cephalic vein, especially if little blood comes from the wound, and let the bleeding be on the opposite side from the injured part;
and let the patient avoid fullness of wine and heavy foods.
And if he does not want to bleed, let his food be lessened, and let him not drink wine, nor eat meat;
and put on the wound, if hot abscesses come there, cotton moistened in rose oil only, or in styptic wine;
and if there is no hot abscess, put on the wound, if it is fresh with all its blood, and it is not exposed to the air, a powder, which I will describe shortly afterwards;
and if the burning has exposed it, put on some ointments, until it is healed.
And if the wound is large, such as from a sword cut and similar, and the lips cannot be brought together by tents, bring them together by suture, as I will say in the case of wounds of the belly, of the suture.
If the wound is laid open to the bone, and hangs, and holds only by a little, cut it; then treat the wound with medicine, and restore hard flesh in place of skin, and instruct the patient to eat strong foods, such as bread and cooked wheat, also poultry, and similar things.
And if you find putrefaction in the skin, and it does not reach the bone, cut away all the putrid matter and throw it away, then treat it;
and if there is an artery or vein in the wound from which blood flows, and it cannot be stopped by medicine, seek the artery, and if you find it loose, tie it with a thread; and if that does not help, cauterize it.
And if these wounds are small and simple, the cure is easy: and it is that you put in this powder which heals before the flesh has moved.
And the manner of the powder is: take incense, one part; dragon's blood, two parts; quicklime, three parts, and powder it finely, and apply it to the wound, and bind it tightly, until it heals well and joins with all its blood;
and then bind it well, and leave it untied, if it does not swell; for one does not remove the medicine until it is healed.
And sometimes this is done with lime alone, when one does not have incense or dragon's blood, but provided that the burning does not change the wound.
And if the burning has changed the wound, one should act likewise;  one does not put this powder on it;
but one applies some digestive ointments, or poultices of barley flour made with water and honey, until it throws off pus; then cure it with other treatments until it is healed.
And if a bone fracture occurs with the wound, and it is small, extract it with fine forceps;
and I will tell you later about head fractures.
of the wound of the neck
If a wound occurs in the neck and it is simple, there is no difference between it and one in the head, but if the neck nerve or artery is severed.
If it is the nerve, there is no other remedy than to leave the wound alone, and not apply anything constricting, for it harms the nerves and causes them to retract; and do not apply anything cold to the wound, for the substance of the nerves is cold, and their continuation is with the brain, which is the highest member;
but let the medicine be lukewarm, such as warm washings in sweet water, and mixed with rose oil, and cooked herbs also washed in sweet water, and other minerals in this manner, and moist ointments.
And if the wound is large, sew it and bind it with bandages, then treat it until it is healed.
And if the wounds are deep and are swollen and full of pus, pierce it in the lowest place;
and if the artery is cut, and a flow of blood comes from it, tie it off, and bind it, and cauterize it if necessary;
and if the spine of the throat is cut, or the heart, and the conduit is guarded, through which the flesh goes, sew the heart to the throat's cartilage, and do not touch the throat but replace it according to its natural form; and then bind it properly, and leave it for some days, then treat it with drying ointments until it is healed;
and if the wound has made an impression on the bone, search it; and if there are pieces of bone, draw them out entirely if you can, and those that you cannot get, leave until the wound festers, and the opening is cleaned and aligned;
and if the wound is fresh, sprinkle on the powder that I have mentioned. And if there is bone in the wound and there is a fistula, treat it as I have said in its chapter.
If it is a blow from a lance or a knife, and the wound is deep, observe if the wound emits air when the patient breathes: know then that the wound is mortal;
and if it is not deep, and it is fresh with all its blood, do not apply powder at the first hour, nor bind it up, lest the blood be impeded from flowing, and return to the heart, and kill the patient; but apply an attractive ointment, and bind it twice a day;
and if you have no ointment, put old cotton in the wound to soak up the moisture, and make the patient sleep on the wound for three days, or four, or more; thus there will be no spasm, nor evil tremor of the heart, nor constrictions of the breath; and when you see the good dispositions, then know that the wound is healed. Treat it then with tents and other treatments, until it is healed;
and if it cannot heal, and festers, always know that there is a fistula;
then treat it as one should. And if the wound is from a sword or knife incision, and it is simple, on the breast or back, treat it as one would treat the one in front; if it is large, by suture;
and if it is small, with powder, and if it has reached the bone, and has cut pieces, search the wound, and pull out the splinters if they are detached; and if they are not detached, let the wound fester, this will ease the extraction;
and for other wounds on other limbs, the judgment is as we have said.
of the rupture of the belly
The ruptures of the belly are large and medium and small;
from the large wound sometimes the intestines, or the nerves of the intestines, protrude, therefore their reintroduction;
and the suture is more difficult, and sometimes the small wound is worse than the large one, because the intestines are more difficult to put back in, unless one puts them back in immediately;
because the intestines swell as soon as they feel the cold, they are more difficult to replace, and therefore the medium-sized wound is better, because one more easily returns the intestine to its place than the others.
And know that the rupture of the belly is according to four manners:
the two common sutures occur in the suture of the belly, and the suture of other wounds of the body and two other proper sutures are common to other wounds;
and yet they are more proper with the suture of the belly, and I will say each one and explain.
I say that when the wound is small, and something of the intestine comes out, and it is difficult to put it back, this is by one of the two manners: either because of the smallness of the wound, as we have said, or because the intestine is swollen from the cold.
And when it is cold, warm it in this manner: wet a sponge or soft cloth in lukewarm water only, or you cook in water squinant and cyprus and spikenard, and irrigate the intestine until the swelling is removed;
and sometimes astringent wine does this, and is better than water alone for reducing swelling.
And when you see the swelling depart, then moisten the intestine with water in which althea and mallows have been cooked, for by this the entrance is easily opened a little;
and if it cannot enter, then open the wound a little with the instrument with which one cuts hemorrhoids;
and the first treatment is better than cutting, that no one should cut without great necessity;
and these are the instruments for splitting it:
cut inwards in the curve and not outwards, and see here the form: And when the wound is enlarged, and the intestines protrude, put them back according to their natural form in their proper place, if you are able, for this is better.
When the wound is large, and it is in the lower part of the belly, you must make the patient lie on his back, and put his legs higher than his head; and if it is in the lower part of the belly, put the head and chest higher than the lower parts, and also if the rupture of the belly is in one of the two parts, put your attention to that the injured part be higher than the other;
and thus you must administer what I say in large and medium wounds.
In small wounds, put what is prepared, then have in your hands a pitiful minister who holds the entire rupture in his hand, and bring the edges together;
and this is the common manner of sutures, and it is that you take one needle or more, according to the quantity of the width of the wound, then leave from the head of the wound one finger's width of space, and there stick a needle where there is a good strong thread; and pierce the two edges of the skin with the two edges of the siphac, which is beneath the skin within, until you make it pierce from that part, and bring together the two edges of the siphac, the four together;
then twist a double thread around the needle from two sides, then bring together the two edges of the wound evenly, and then leave one finger's width of space, and there stick another needle;
then tie the thread as you did the first needle, and do not cease doing this according to what you need of needles, until the whole wound is constricted;
and let the needles be medium-sized, between fine and thick, for fine needles cut all the flesh, and the too thick ones cannot enter well: therefore it is necessary that they be medium-sized;
and it is not necessary to push the needles too far outside the flesh and skin, lest they cut and open the wound before the healing;
and then cut off the ends of the needles, that they may not injure the patient in his sleep, and put tents or small cloths at the ends of the needles to hold them, and leave them until the wound is healed;
and this method of sewing with needles is more suitable for small wounds, for one or two needles suffice.
The second suture is common, and is that you bring together the two edges of the skin and the two edges of the flesh together with a needle on which there is a strong medium thread;
and when you have pierced these four edges together, then return the needle to the part where you began, in the manner in which one sews cloths;
and place between each stitch the thickness of a little finger;
This suture is used by men, and I sewed a wound that a man had in his belly, which was wounded by a knife, and the wound was more than a palm wide, and the intestines protruded well two palms wide, and the wound was in the middle of the belly.
I returned the intestine after it had been twenty-four hours out, and the wound was healed up to fifteen days, and I cared for it, and it was healed.
And the physicians had judged that he would die, and this was a miracle;
and I did not treat it with ointment, because I was in a place where none could be found, nor any medicines; and I put clean cotton on the wound twice a day, and washed it with honey water until it was healed.
Now I will tell you the two proper methods of stitching:
take the needle, and put it from the outer part to the inner;
when it has pierced straight through the heart, leave the head of the siphac or the thread where you have put the needle, and make it pierce from the other side from the inner part to the outer;
and the meaning of this stitch is that you sew as the furriers sew furs, and that you leave the thread on one side once, and take it up on the other, until the stitching is completely done.
The second method of stitching, which Galen properly described, is as some do, who join the two parts together naturally, and apply one end of the thread to the other end, in this manner:
insert a needle in the head of the muscle nearby, and make it pierce only that place, and leave the two ends of the thread; then turn the needle, and make it pierce from the outer part to the inner part, with the two ends of the thread;
then make it pierce one and the other from the outer part to the inner part, in two other places of the muscle that are on the other side;
and this is the best method of stitching and the most common.
Galen says this, and some testify to it, that one should sew the belly with two needles, where there is thread in each;
and one should insert one needle from one side, and the other from the other, in the manner of those who sew straps;
and know that when the rupture is in the middle of the belly, the stitching is more difficult than in other places of the belly.
The judgment of the wound is such as the judgment of other wounds:
and it is that when you find the wound fresh with all its blood, before the fire has changed it, then replace the intestine, and sew it;
then put on the flesh-healing powder, and if the fire has changed it, then put on any ointment that is present, until the wound heals; and the threads are sewn, and the surfaces and the muscles are joined; then treat the wound like the others, until it is healed;
and if you do not have medicines, then put on, as soon as it begins to produce pus, old cotton, and change it twice a day until it is healed.
For you do not need any other medicine in many instances when the wounds are simple;
and if you fear that the wound may affect the principal members, then you must moisten light wool in oil of moderate warmth, or in rose oil, and place it around the armpits, and under the armpits;
and if he feels pain or corruption in the bowels, and this often happens, then administer enemas of warm red wine, especially if the corruption reaches the intestine;
and pierce it inside, and know that when it is the large intestine, it is easier to heal than the small.
The intestine which is called "jejunum" cannot heal when it is injured, and this is because of the abundance of veins that are there, and because of the subtlety of the whole body, and the proximity of its nature to the nerves.
And if the viscera protrudes from the wound, replace it back as with the intestine, while it is fresh;
and if it is old and has become wormy or black, then you must bind the area that is black, so that a flow of blood does not come there, for there are veins and arteries;
then cut that which is between the ligature, and hang the two ends from the part below the wound to the outside to ease extraction when the viscera falls, and the wound swells.
Of the rupture of the bowel
When the intestine is broken, and the wound is small, it can be restored in some men, because I saw that a man was wounded in the belly by a lance;
and the wound was on the right of the stomach, and was suppurated and became fistulous, and the excrement and the flatulence issued from it;
I applied treatment according to my ability, and did not cease to refine [my treatment] until he was healed, and the place was closed.
And when I saw it closed, I feared that the patient had harm in his belly; and there was no harm there, but he remained in better condition, eating and drinking;
and some practitioners said that when there is a small wound in the intestine, it should be bound in this manner: take small splints with large heads, then bring together the edges of the wound, and when the splint has opened the mouth, place it on the two lips, so that it pulls its mouth together;
and then cut off its head, and this holds so that it cannot loosen, then place another splint afterwards in the same manner as before, until the wound is completely encompassed; and sew the wound.
These ends are cauterized in the intestine, and no harm comes to the patient, and one can tie the intestine with a fine thread that is cut from the intestine of a beast, in this manner:
take the end of this intestinal thread that is very lean, and then tie to the end of this thread a fine twisted linen thread, then put the thread into the needle, and sew the intestine, and return it into the rupture;
and this method of sewing splints is not false except according to the way of trust and hope;
and if the wound is large and wide, especially when it is in one of the thin intestines, there is no device or wisdom, except subtlety.
of a fistula wherever it may be Know that every wound or abscess, when it ages, is universally called a "fistula," and especially when it is haired and produces pus.
And a fistula, in truth, is a hard and white knotted swelling, where one feels no pain, and is as hairy as a bird's feather;
and sometimes it exudes clear pus, and sometimes thick; sometimes little, and sometimes much;
and I have spoken of it in the division of wounds, that every wound which is not healed, and there is no flesh, this is only because of one of the nine causes: that is to say, by the smallness of the blood or body; or because of its bad quality; or because there is hard flesh within, and on the lips, which does not allow flesh to grow; or there is too much swelling; or the place is rotten, and the matter is of bad quality; or the medicine is not good in the treatment; or because the corruption is a kind of pestilence; or because of the property in the region, digestion is slow, and healing is slow, and it swells by nature; or there are veins or bones there;
and I have already shown all these causes, and the signs, and the cures of medicines in the division.
Now it is necessary that I make you know the cure of a fistula which is made by the work of hands.
Know that a fistula occurs in all the members of the body; for there are fistulas that come to the large veins, and to the arteries, and to the nerves, or to the syfac, or to the intestine, or to the bladder, or to some of the ribs, or to the spine of the back, or to any joint of the hands or feet; and so there is one that comes to the property of the principal member, and to similar places.
And all the fistulas that are of this manner are of difficult healing, and there is nothing but labor, and ignorance;
and if there is any fistula that does not reach the place that I have said, and you have confidence in the cure, and you want to know it, then take a tent of bronze or iron, if the fistula is straight, then seek it;
and if the fistula is crooked, then search it with a thin tent of lead, for lead bends easily around the tortuosity;
and if the fistula has many openings and you cannot search it well with tents, then clysterize it through one of the openings, for the moisture runs from one opening to another, and cleanses it;
then search it wisely to your ability, that you may know if there is bone or nerve, and it is deep, and ask the patient well about the pain that he feels at the pressure of your hand, and the place where he feels it;
and when you truly know the place where it is, and if it is far from a joint, or nerve, or artery or vein, or in any of the places that I have told you, then cut it according to what I have told you, and remove from there the filth and the corrupt flesh that are within;
and then cure it until it is healed, and if the fistula is very deep in a straight place, then it is necessary that you cut deeply, as much as you can, then put in moist tents in medicated water, and push them to the head of the fistula, until the medicine corrodes the superfluity that has remained at the bottom;
and then apply ointments that engender healthy flesh, until it is healed;
and if it is not healed by this, then cauterize it as we have said, and if the bone is corrupted by the fistula, then cut it.
If a vein or nerve does not bother you in the principal members, as we have said;
and if the bone is uncovered, and there is corruption and blackness, then clean it until all the corruption is removed, then cure it with things that engender flesh until it is healed;
and if it is not healed, and returns as before, know that you have not gone to the bottom:
then uncover and search until you are at the bottom, and remove all the corruption, then restore the place;
and if it is thus healed, it is well. If not, know that the corruption is too deep, that you cannot reach it; then there is no other remedy than to leave it to nature;
and if there is a small corrupted bone, and you can pull it out with tongs, then extract it with a suitable instrument for this, and if there are many bones, then extract them all, and leave none behind;
and if the moisture hinders you, and there is no risk or fear, then cut both moisture and flesh, and free the bones.
And if you cannot remove them at once, apply something to the wound that encourages putrefaction, and wait until the area is rotten around the bones, and then the bones will come out more easily;
and if it is a large bone, such as from the leg or thigh, only remove the corruption until all the blackness is gone, then close the wound;
and if a large part of it is corrupted, and it reaches the marrow of the bone; then it must be scraped and cut all the way to the corruption, and then treat it until it is healed;
and I will tell you of a fistula that happened to a man in his leg, so that you may take it as an example and help in your work.
He was a young man of about thirty years, who had pain in his leg from a cause that came from within the body, so that the matter came to the leg, and it was swollen with a large abscess, and there was no external cause to open it;
but the physicians, through their folly, worked on it so much that the abscess opened, and much matter flowed out, and it became a fistula, and many holes appeared which all discharged pus and moisture from the body;
and many physicians treated it for about two years, and there was no wise man in the art of surgery, until I was called there, and I saw his leg and the medicines with which he was treated, and what ran through the holes in great quantity; and the young man's flesh became red, and had a yellowish color.
I inserted a tent into one of these holes, and then I searched all the holes, and found that one led to another from all parts of the leg.
I hastened then, and cut into one of the holes until I uncovered a part of the bone, and found it corrupt and pierced, and the corruption went down to the bone inside;
I removed what appeared to me of the corrupt bone, and thought that there was no other corruption, except that which I removed;
and I began to treat the wound with boiling medicines for a long time, and it could not heal;
and then I began again, and uncovered the bone as before, and found the corruption continuous in the bone, and I probed it, and then removed it, and I strove to heal the place; but I could not, until I cut around a handbreadth of the bone, and removed it completely with its marrow, then I treated it with medicines; and it was healed and mended quickly, and it was not necessary to begin the work again except for the weakness of the patient, who could not endure, and for the fear of death that I had for him. For because of the evacuation he bled often, but he was healed completely, and in place of the bone grew hard flesh, and it was of good condition and had no impediment or ill effect whatsoever, neither in walking nor in coming.
And if the bone is broken in any part of the body, then it must be treated in this manner: take a linen cloth, and bind it to the end of the bone which is visible, and instruct someone to pull it upwards; and place another linen cloth, thicker than the first cloth, and bind it over the flesh which is above the bone, and extend the head, so that you pull the corrupted flesh downwards, and uncover the flesh over the place where you wish to treat, so that the treatment does not injure the flesh;
and place a cautery iron or a hot iron under the bone to cut away the corrupted flesh;
and it is necessary to treat as much as one can see and feel the corruption, and to treat again another time.
And if the bone is corrupted, and is not visible, and the corruption is in the middle or in one part, then uncover all the flesh;
then place a cautery iron underneath, and then treat from one part to the other the corruption, and let the treatment be a little longer than the corruption, as we have said;
and if the corruption is in the joint, then cut the corrupted joint, and treat the bone where it is held on the other side;
and if the corruption is in the continuation of the two joints, there is no other remedy than to cut;
and if the corruption is in the wrist of the hand, or in the ankle of the foot, that is a very serious matter, but nevertheless you must examine that corrosion, how it appears to you; and cleanse it in every way that you can, but so that the vein or the nerve do not hinder you;
and know that the incisors and saws for cutting these bones are many, according to the position of the bones and their appearance, and their thickness and thinness, and their size and smallness, and their hardness; and therefore it is necessary to prepare for each kind of work its instrument;
and know that the work will show you the instrument you will need, according to the knowledge of this art, and the testimony of the kinds of diseases; so consider the instrument you need according to what is necessary.
The heads fester either from an internal cause, or from an external cause;
and when you have treated that corrosion with the cure of medicines, and they do not help, then it is necessary to cut off that member up to the place where the corrosion comes, so that the patient escapes death by this, or the greater harm, from the lack of the member;
and the sign is that the member becomes black, so that it seems to be burned by fire, and festers after the blackness, then that corrosion goes from member to member, and takes over the whole body;
then hasten to cut, and if it is from the sting of some venomous beasts, such as a sea scorpion and viper and the like, if the corrosion is at the tip of the finger, cut it off, and do not give it space to come down to the hand.
And if it comes down to the hand, cut it at the joint, so that the corrosion does not reach the arm;
and if it comes to the arm, cut it at the elbow;
and if it passes the elbow, it is death, and no remedies are of use except the quantity of its virtue;
and do the same when the corrosion comes to the foot: if it comes to the first joint, cut it after the other joint;
and if it comes to the foot, cut off the whole foot; and if it ascends in the leg, cut at the knee joint;
and if it comes above the knee, there is no other remedy than to leave the patient to die;
and the manner of cutting or sawing the limb is that you tie it above and below, and one attendant stretches one of the ties downward, and another attendant stretches the other tie upward, and you sever the flesh which is between the two ties to a width of one span, until the bone is uncovered;
then cut or saw it, and place on each side a linen cloth, so that the saw does not touch the healthy area, and another lesion and abscess are caused to the patient.
And if profuse bleeding occurs when you operate, cauterize the area quickly, or apply some styptic powders;
then return to your treatment until it is complete, then bind the injured limb with a suitable bandage, and treat it until it is healed;
and I will tell you that it happened to a man in his foot:
a blackness befell him which resembled a burn from fire, and this corrosion first appeared in his toe, until it affected the whole foot;
and when the man saw the corrosion, he hastened to cut off his foot, and was healed;
and a long time afterward the corrosion returned to a finger of his hand, and he came to me, and I applied repellant things after the cleansing of the body, and the corrosion could not cease;
and he wanted me to cut off his hand, and I did not want to, for I had hope of repelling the matter; and I also feared that if I cut off his hand, that he would die, because the man's strength was weak;
and he despaired completely, and returned to his land, and hastened to cut off his hand, and was healed;
and I have recounted this only so that one may do likewise, if one has need.
Sometimes an abscess comes in fleshy tissue, and remains so long that it forms a large collection of pus; and then it breaks and bursts, and the pus spurts out, and the place remains empty, like a vessel; and the skin which is above is as thin as a fine cloth, and does not extend to the bone, nor to the nerve, and such an illness is called "sain," and is not called "fistula";
but if it is so deep that it reaches the bone, it is called "fistula";
and the skin is such that you cut that skin all around, and especially when it is thin, like a cloth; and it does not heal because of its corruption.
And if you are confident that the skin will heal, and the corruption is not deep, and the skin is thick with flesh, treat it with a clyster thus:
see if the abscess is large, and the pus that comes from it has a foul odor, then clysterize it with Egyptian medicine which is made thus: take vinegar, and oil, and litharge, equally, and put to cook in a vessel over the fire, until the medicine is red, and becomes as thick as honey;
and then take of this according to your need, and put it in water and honey, and clysterize the abscess, and widen the opening; and leave the medicine in for two hours, then remove it by squeezing;
do this many times, until the abscess is cleansed, and the pus is removed;
and sometimes it is clysterized with lye, when this medicine is not present, and it is that you take ashes of vine wood, and pour water over them, then filter it, and clysterize with it, until you know that the abscess is well cleansed;
and if the patient cannot tolerate it, neither the Egyptian medicine nor the lye, then clysterize him with water and honey in which there is a little powdered litharge; or you may clysterize with honey and mulled wine, for honey has the property of cleansing and washing, and wine helps to dry the wound;
and when you have done this, and you are confident that the abscess is well cleansed, then clysterize it with that which causes flesh to grow in it, and it is that you take diafinitive plaster, and make it with rose oil and wine;
or you may clysterize it with some medicines and ointments, of which I have spoken of the properties in the treatise on ointments;
and if the opening of the abscess is small, and the nozzle of the clyster cannot enter, then widen it a little with an iron instrument, and insert a tent of Egyptian ointment, or basilicon ointment, until it is widened;
and if the wound is too wide, then sew it and leave only a place where the clyster can enter, and if the opening that discharges pus is above, then cut it at the lowest point that there is.
and if you cannot cut the abscess below as you wish, then prepare it in such a way that the pus flows to the lowest point that there is, for when the pus is deep, it does not allow flesh to grow there and if you cannot cut the abscess below as you wish, then prepare it in this manner: that the pus runs easily downwards, and leave nothing of the pus;
that the pus runs easily downwards, and leave nothing of the pus; and take consolidating medicines to put on the wound, and extend it over a linen cloth that covers the whole wound; then cut forcefully towards the opening of the wound a little wider than before, then spread soft ointment on another cloth according to the size of the opening, and put it over the opening of the wound to ease the pus, and do not remove the large cloth outside except after many days once;
and the one that is over the opening of the wound, remove often to remove the pus, and know what flows from the pus, if it is venom or little or much, or digested, or undigested;
and take heed if the patient feels pain or not, and if there is an abscess or not, and when your medicine has been spread in such a manner and you see the nature that leaps up from the opening of the wound, then know that the wound will heal, and health approaches;
and then unbind it in the morning, or on the third day, and when you unbind the wound, change to another cloth, and renew the ointment.
And if subtle venom flows after a long time, do not despair of healing, for healing approaches.
For there are men whose flesh is slow to grow in their wounds, and others who do the opposite;
and if undigested pus flows from the wound after many days, know that the wound will not heal;
and if the wound is slow to heal, and is neglected, add drying medicines moist in substance and dry in virtue, such as diaphinite ointment, for it contains a large part of vitriol, and this is the last medicine;
Take diaphinite ointment, and it is made with rose oil, and rose water, equal in quantity;
then mix it and use it;
and this same is better cooked thickened, when diaphinite ointment is not present, or you take myrrh and aloes and incense, and grind it, and powder it over the honey while it is on the fire;
and then glue a cloth to it, and spread it over the wound, and sometimes one administers aristolochia longa, and roots of the lily of the valley, which is like bean flour and centaury; and use it of simples or of compounds: grind them, and make a powder, and put it on the honey that I have mentioned, and use it;
and if the cure is prolonged, and is not cured by this cure, then know that the corruption is deep, and makes an impression on the bone, or on the hard parts, or on the ligaments; then cure it as a fistula, as we have said before.
A whitlow is an abscess that arises under the nail of the little finger of the hand, or of the foot, or perhaps arises in other fingers;
and when it is neglected, and one does not take care of it, then there comes a hot abscess, and it runs and spreads until it reaches the root of the nail, and perhaps it will destroy the whole of it;
and the corrosion reaches the bone, until there is foul-smelling pain, and the end of the finger is swollen, and the color is livid.
When you treat it as we have said in the section, and the treatment does not help, then you must cut away with an iron all the excess that remains of the nail, then cauterize the wound afterwards. Cauterization is a great help if the bone is healthy, and the nail is healthy;
and if the nail presses on the flesh, and begins to prick and wound it, then you must place a thin object under the nail where it pricks the flesh, and lift it up, and cut that flesh subtly and lightly, and apply to the remaining flesh burning and corrosive medicines to remove it all; then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
And if the corruption is in the bone, cut it and draw it out, for as long as the corrupted bone remains, it cannot heal;
and if you see the finger corrupting, cut it at the joint as stated before, then treat it until it is healed;
and if it is wounded and swollen, and it causes great pain, then you must heal it first;
then cut the nail of the whitlow acutely by cutting across from above, and take care that the cut does not reach the flesh beneath the nail, for the patient would feel too much pain;
and if it happens, apply something that soothes.
The extra fingers that grow on the hands of some men by chance are all fleshy, and sometimes there are bones in them, and sometimes a nail, and some of them grow at the root of the joint, or their origin is in some of our fingers.
That which grows on any part of the finger does not move, and that which grows at the joint of the finger, sometimes moves;
the treatment of that which is fleshy is light, in this manner: cut it at its root with a wide spatula.
That which grows at the root of the joint is difficult to cure: then refrain from cutting.
In that which grows on the finger at the last joint, it is necessary that you first cut the flesh around to the bone, then cut the bone with a saw suitable for this, then cure it until it is healed.
The joining together that occurs between fingers comes from birth, or from the closing of a wound, or from a burn, or from similar things.
It is necessary that you cut that joining, so that the fingers return to their natural forms; then place between them tents or cloths moistened in rose oil, so that they do not join; or you place between them thin pieces of lead, until the place is healed, as it should be.
If a joining occurs to any of the fingers with the palm, cut that joining as necessary.
Varicose veins are large, swollen veins full of melancholic superfluities, which appear in many parts of the body;
and it happens more in the legs of those who walk and work and carry burdens, than in others.
Therefore, you must sometimes administer a purging of bile, and then bleed from the basilica vein.
The cure with iron is according to two methods: one is that they are cut, and the black blood is drawn out; and the other method is that you open the vein, and draw it all out.
The incision is according to this method: first bathe the leg in very hot water, until the thick blood is thinned, then bind the patient's leg from above the thigh down to the part below the knee;
then cut the vein in one place, or in two or in three, with a wide cut, then raise and draw out the black blood with your hand, from one end to the other, until as much blood comes out as the patient's strength can endure;
and then bind it, and instruct him to abstain from foods that produce black bile;
and repeat the evacuation and bleeding when the veins are full, and it harms the patient.
The raising of him is according to this manner: raise the leg of the patient, if there is much hair, then put it in the bath, and pour warm water over the leg until it becomes red, and the veins swell;
and if you do not have a bath, then heat it by the fire, and then cut towards the vein lengthwise to the head of the knee, or in the part below at the ankle;
then open the skin with an oncin, and scrape the vein on each side, until it appears when one feels it;
and it is seen red and black, and when it enters the skin it seems like a white cord;
then put the instrument underneath, until it is raised from the skin, and then lightly pull it with the oncin, then cut it in another place above three fingers;
then scrape the skin over the vein until it appears, then lift it with the instrument, as you have done, and pull it with another oncin, as you did first;
then cut another incision, or several if you need them, then lift it, and cut it at the toe, then pull and lift it to the second incision;
then pull it from incision to incision, until it is all out, then cut it;
and if you cannot pull and lift it, then put a needle with a strong double thread in it, and tie it and pull it, and put an instrument underneath, and turn your hand from one side to the other, until it comes out; and take care that it does not break, for if it breaks, then one cannot pull or lift it, and it causes harm to the patient;
and when you have pulled it all out, then put on the wound wool moistened with wine and rose oil; and treat it until it is healed.
And if the bowel is constricted and twisted and wrapped together, and it is not straight, as we have said, then you must cut it forcefully, but not cut it completely; and pull it out as we have said before.
The shape of the iron with which one cuts the bowel is curved, and does not cut sharply, so that it does not cut the vein;
and is of a large curve, for if it were thin, it would cut the vein, but it should be thick as we have said, and here is the shape:
This vein is located in the legs, in hot places where no herbs or trees grow, and in dry earth;
and perhaps it arises elsewhere than in the legs, and this happens from the corruption that comes from under the skin, just as serpents and worms arise within the body, nestled between skin and flesh.
And if the sign of the beginning of this vein is that a very large inflammation comes in the leg, then the place changes, and the vein begins to come forth, like the root of a plant.
When the head appears, you must wrap around it a piece of lead of one and a half to two ounces, and tie it, and leave the lead hanging from the leg, and every time that a point comes out, wrap it around the lead, and tie it;
and if it is too long, cut off a part, and wrap the remainder, and do not cut it at its root, until it is completely emerged; for if you cut it, it returns into the flesh, and causes an abscess and corruption in the place, and a serious illness;
because of which it is necessary that it be treated little by little to the end, and that nothing remains in the body;
and sometimes this vein, when it is treated, is five palms long, or ten, and a man once came to me, from whom it emerged ten palms long, and when you cut it, put a probe into the hole, and pierce it to the bottom, so that everything comes out;
and let the matter that is inside be emptied, and administer to the place medicines that prevent corruption for some days, then cure it like abscesses.
And sometimes this vein has many roots, and especially when it appears in the joint of the foot, or in the foot, and there are many holes, and from which roots sprout;
cure it then as we have said before.
of the worms which are born between skin and flesh This illness is called in our land "ox disease," because it often happens to oxen, and it is a small worm which is born between skin and flesh, and goes throughout the body rising and falling, and one feels it well in going from limb to limb, until it breaks the skin where it goes, and jumps out;
and is engendered by the corruption of certain humors, just as worms and serpents and lumbrci and ascarides come in the belly;
and one doubts its malice, for when it goes through the body, and it rises to the head, and it comes to the eye, by chance it enters, and destroys the eye; and this happens many times.
When you see it to cure and draw it out, then one can only pull it out when it moves:
then it is necessary that you bind the place above and below with a strong ligature very tightly, then cut above and pull it out, and if the worm is deep in the flesh, and you do not find it, then cauterize it with fire, until it dies;
and the greatest harm that it does is that it runs to the eye, as we have said;
and if you see it coming to the head near the eye, then pull down the eyebrow strongly from below, then cut above, and pull it out;
and it is necessary to treat the patient with bodily cleansing using purgative medicines for the bad, corrupt humors, and to abstain from foods causing putrefaction.
Of the pain that comes from flatulence This illness is called "vakirir" in our land, and it is a pain that comes in some limbs, and then moves from limb to limb;
and I saw what I tell you. I was called to a sick woman, and she uncovered her arm, and I saw a small swelling in the vein of the arm;
and a little afterwards, I saw it climb like a worm to the shoulder, faster than anything, like quicksilver when it runs from one place to another;
the pain departed from that place, and settled in the shoulder, and then a little afterwards ran through the whole body, until it came to the other arm;
then she told me that it constantly turned around her body, as I saw it.
I greatly wondered how it moved thus from limb to limb, for I had never seen this illness in this manner. However, I had seen many who had felt pain move from one place to another, but I had not seen it as I saw it in the woman;
and I thought that it was because the woman had a dry body, and the veins uncovered, and therefore that constrained wind appeared;
and it does not appear for the same reason in those who are plump, and who have moist bodies and full veins.
And when you wish to cure this illness, and the patient feels this pain, if it appears as we have said, then bind it above and below quickly, and then cut it until that constrained wind escapes from the place; and cauterize the place;
and if you do not see it with your eyes, then cure it with that which expels winds, such as foul-smelling pills, and pills of serapinum, and similar others.
Arrows are diverse, according to their appearances and according to the places of the body where they lodge.
The diversity of them is that there are some which have large points, and small ones, and barbed ones, and smooth ones; and some which have two angles, and some which have tongues, and some which are broken;
and that which lodges in a limb lodges in two ways: or in a principal member, such as the brain, heart, liver, lung, kidneys, intestines, bladder, and similar members. When it then lodges in any of these members, and the signs of death, which I will tell you about below, appear: then you must avoid extracting this arrow, for death follows in many ways; and when these bad signs do not appear, and the arrow is not very deep, then I draw it, and treat the wound.
And the signs of the brain when the arrow falls there and pierces the bone, and the dura mater which is above the brain is pierced, are when there is scotoma and throbbing and dizziness and redness in the eyes, and inflammation and redness of the tongue, and spasms and confusion of understanding, and vomiting of bile; and perhaps blood flows from the nostrils, or from the ears; and perhaps he loses speech and voice; and there comes from the wound a white moisture resembling pus, and also something like shredded flesh comes out;
and if these signs appear, abstain from treatment, and remove the arrow if it is not inside.
The signs of an arrow in the heart are that it is near the left breast, and it feels as if it were stuck in something hard, not empty; and perhaps the arrow moves like pus, and dark blood flows, and there is coldness and cold sweat, and syncope: know then without doubt that death approaches.
And the sign that the lung is injured is that frothy blood spurts from the wound, and the throat swells, and the patient changes color, and sighs deeply and seeks cool air.
And if the arrow strikes the covering of the breast, it is near the small ribs; and he breathes heavily and feels great pain and sighs; and all the members of the shoulders move.
And if the arrow strikes the stomach, perhaps something undigested from the flesh spurts from the wound.
And if the arrow strikes the belly, and some dung spurts out through the ruptured intestine, there is no hope of cure, nor of extracting the arrow.
And if the arrow strikes the bladder, and urine spurts out and flows, and the patient feels severe pain: know that the wound is mortal.
The other members, such as the face and neck and throat and shoulder and arm and spine of the back and ribcage and thigh and legs, and similar members, are safe according to various dispositions. When the arrow is in the nerve or artery, and it is not venomous, as I will tell you happened to me, so that you may do likewise.
It happened to a man that an arrow struck him in the tear duct at the root of the nose: I probed it, and pulled it out from the other side under the fat of the ear, and he was healed without harm.
And I pulled out from a boy an arrow that struck him in the eye fat under the eyelid, and the arrow was embedded, and I could barely reach but the point towards the shaft, and the arrow was as large as a Turkish bow, with a light iron head without barbs;
the boy was healed, and no ill effects came to him.
And I pulled an arrow from the throat of a Christian, and the arrow was an Arabian one with barbs:
I cut the barbs, and worked carefully until I pulled it out, and the Christian was healed.
And I pulled an arrow from a man, which had fallen into his belly, and I thought that he would die;
and after he had passed thirty days, his condition did not change; I cut the arrow, and I grasped it, and pulled it forcefully, and there was no bad accident.
And I saw a man from whom an arrow fell into his back, and the wound was closed over;
and the arrow remained inside him, and he did not change his natural disposition, nor did he find harm in any of his natural functions.
And I saw another man, into whose face an arrow fell, and the wound was closed; and it remained so without suffering great pain;
and many other similar cases.
And I extracted an arrow from a man of the king's princes, which had fallen into his nose, and was slightly leaning towards the right side; and the arrow was completely embedded.
I was called to treat it after it had fallen three days. I found the wound very narrow.
I searched it with a very fine probe, and did not feel it; and he felt a prick and pain beneath his right ear.
I thought that it was from the point of the arrow. I applied to the place an attractif and digestive plaster, so that the place would not swell; and the place of the arrow appeared to me.
and the place of the arrow appeared to me. I put the plaster there many days, and the wound healed again, and the patient remained thus a long time, until he felt the arrow one day inside his nose;
and he told me so. I put a sharp corrosive medicine on the wound for many days, until it was open, and I probed it, and felt the head of the arrow which was sticking in the place;
then I added to the opening of the wound with that sharp medicine, until the head of the arrow appeared visibly to me;
and the time passed well for about four months, and then I widened the wound so that I put in the forceps, and moved it on one side and the other, and it could not come out;
then I did not cease to refine and devise methods of instruments, until I took it one day with well-made forceps, according to what its form will be at the end of this chapter, until I pulled it out, and cleaned the wound.
And the physicians judge that the cartilage of the nose cannot be restored: I restored it then, and the wound was healed, and the patient was completely cured.
Now I have told you the quality of the extraction of certain arrows, so that you apply your care to that which I do not say, for the book cannot contain everything;
but the wise master considers even a small thing, and from what is present and lacking, finds new work, and new instruments, for dealing with the strange things that happen in this art.
I say that arrows do not come out of the limbs where they are stuck except according to two manners: either through the place where they entered, or through another part;
and that which leaps out through the place where it entered, that is an arrow entering fleshy places, and sometimes leaping out immediately.
And if it does not leap out immediately, then leave it until the flesh is rotten around it, and the exit is eased;
and also if it is stuck in the bone, and it cannot come out, then leave it thus for some days, and move it each day;
and then it will leap out, and if it does not leap out, then pierce around it with a thin drill, until the place around it is widened, and then pull it out.
And if the arrow is lodged in the body so that one cannot see it, then search for it with a tent. and if you feel it, then pull it out with a suitable instrument;
and if you cannot, because of the narrowness of the wound, and the depth of the arrow, and there is no bone, nerve, or vein, then enlarge the wound;
and pull out the arrow if you can, and if the arrow has barbs by which it holds, then remove the flesh that is pierced on both sides as much as you can, and then break or bend the barbs of the arrow, until you can pull it out;
and be careful that you do not break the arrow, for you would draw it out more painfully.
And if you cannot [do it] at once, leave it until the surrounding flesh is rotten, then pull it out, for the extraction will be easier. And if the flow of blood hinders you, then use what we have said about treatment in its chapter;
and beware of cutting the nerve and the vein, and devise how you can pull out the arrow without danger, whether quickly or slowly, or firmly or gently;
and place the patient according to the position he was in when the arrow entered him, for that is the greatest help there is, and if you cannot, then place him according to what the signs show you.
The arrow which comes from another part, where something of it appears, or the skin is swollen where it is visibly or palpably seen:
then cut above, until the forceps can grip it, and then pull it out: if it jumps out immediately.
And if it is lodged in the bone, rotate your hand around until it enters the bone, and widen the bone, then pull it out.
And if it cannot come out, leave it for now, and then resume the extraction until it comes out;
and if the shaft of the arrow is there, remove it with the whole shaft;
and if the shaft breaks, and you wish to administer extraction, use a channeled instrument, so that the point of the arrow enters the channel of the instrument;
and then pull it out, and if the arrow is broken, use an instrument with a point that goes in, to ease the extraction.
And if the arrow is poisoned, you must cut away all the flesh around where the poison is, if you can, then treat the wound as is necessary.
And if the arrow breaks in the foot or in the belly or in the bladder or in the side, and it is close to the surface, and you can cut to it, then cut.
and be careful not to cut the vein or the nerve, and then extract it, and then sew the wound, if necessary; and treat it until it is healed.
The shape of the forceps with which one extracts arrows is similar to a bird's beak, and here is the shape:
And there are many kinds: large, medium, and small, according to the size of the arrow.
The shape of the pushing head is like the feather of a bird, to push at the point of the arrow, as the shape is here:
There are thirty-one veins from which one bleeds, of which there are sixteen in the head, namely: Two temples which are behind the ears, which are called the two "herbech"; and the two arteries which are in the two apparent temples; and two veins that are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes, which are called "aspires"; and the vein that is in the middle of the forehead; and the vein that is at the top of the nose; and the two jugular veins that are in the neck; and the two veins that are in the upper lips of the mouth, and these are the veins that are called "augeherich"; and two veins that are under the tongue.
The veins from which one commonly bleeds are five in each arm:
one is the cephalic, and is on the left side, and the common people call it "the vein of the head"; and the middle one is called "fast," and is composed of the cephalic and the basilic, and the common people call it "the vein of the heart"; and the basilic is on the right side, and the common people call it "the vein of the belly," and it is above the fossa, and it is that from which one bleeds, which appears manifestly on the wrist.
And the salvatella is the vein which is between the little finger and the ring finger, and it has two branches;
and in the leg and in the foot there are three veins: one is below the bend of the wrist on the left side, and the second saphenous which is at the ankle on the right side; and the vein which is called "nessa," which is in the ankle of the other side;
and in the other leg are three veins below those.
Bleeding from the veins that are behind the ears helps with chronic catarrh and migraine;
and the quality of the bleeding, as I tell you, is that you raise the head of the patient, and rub the place where the veins are with a rough cloth; then the patient constricts his neck with a bandage, until the two veins appear behind the ears in two places hanging from the head: then press them with your finger, and where you feel the pulse under your finger, bleed from there;
then take the lancet, and put it under the vein down to the bone, then raise your hand with the vein upwards, and cut both the skin and the vein well two fingers breadth across, and let blood flow out as much as you wish;
then bind and tie it, until it is healed;
and I have already spoken of incision and cautery in the first book.
Bleeding from the two arteries that are in the two temples is good for chronic migraine, and hardened, and habitual ophthalmia, and for a running of watery tears from the eyes;
and the qualities of the bloodletting are as I said: and it is that the patient should strain his neck, until the two veins appear clearly; and feels the pulse under your finger, and then bleed from above;
then raise the skin above the vein up to your index finger, and place the lancet below, and raise the vein upwards, and cut it, as you have done in the two other veins, and let the blood flow according to your needs;
then unbind the patient, and place your finger on the vein for an hour, then apply cotton; and then bind it firmly, and leave it until it is healed;
and we have already spoken of their cutting and their extraction, at the beginning of the book.
Bleeding from the vein of the forehead is as valuable as bleeding from the cephalic vein for old facial diseases, and for migraine, and for redness;
and the method is that the patient twists his neck, until the vein appears; then take the instrument which is called a "fossor", of which here is the form:
And place the point on the vein, and press down with your hand, or with something else, and let the blood flow out according to the quantity that you wish; then untie the patient's neck, and tie the vein until it is healed, and sometimes one operates with a wide blade.
However, it is not necessary that the blade be too sharp; and cut across, for the bone is near, and perhaps the blade will break when it is thin.
Bleeding from the two veins that are in the two temples helps the eyes, and ringworm, and redness, and the stye in the eye, and diseases of the face;
and the quality of their bleeding is such that the patient strains his neck by twisting with some sort of ligature, as before;
then bleed, and let the bleeding be across, a little long with the blade a little wide, for there is no flesh there. And if the blade is thin, perhaps it will break;
then let blood flow, as much as you need, and then bind on cotton, and bind it well.
Bleeding from the vein of the nose is good for dropsy, and for raging fever, and for facial diseases, such as migraine and redness that comes on the face, especially when it is chronic;
and the quality of the bleeding is that the patient constricts his neck, then holds his nose with his left hand, and takes a long, thin blade, and inserts it between the lips in the space between the two nostrils, because the vein is not easily visible there, and the blood will immediately begin to flow;
and do not go too deep, and let blood flow according to your need, then bind it for a night, for it is very quickly restored;
Bleeding from the two thumbs helps in the constriction of the windpipe, and in the beginning of leprosy, and in many diseases, and in impetigo, and in toothache, and in herpes, and in fistulas;
and the quality of the bleeding is that the patient constricts his neck from below on both sides, as we have said;
and let the master stand over the patient's head, and let the patient sit on a seat, then open the vein lengthwise a little widely, then draw blood moderately, or as much as is necessary;
then do likewise in the other vein, then loosen the bandage, and bind both veins moderately, so that the patient does not choke; and leave it until morning, that the wound may be healed.
Of bleeding the lips Bleeding the veins of the upper lips helps with bile in the mouth, and corruption of the gums, and fissures of the lips, and of the nose and around.
And the manner of bleeding is to make the patient sit before you, and hold his neck as I have said; then turn the lip, and look at the two veins, of which one is at the right lip and the other at the left, and one knows them by this that they are black, and by this that around them are small black veins:
cut then one and the other, and if you do not know them, and you are in doubt, then cut the largest on each side, and do the same with the two veins that are above and below, for it is the same manner.
Of bleeding under the tongue Bleeding from the veins that are under the tongue helps after bleeding from the cephalic vein, and it is for the constriction of the throat, and for diseases of the uvula, and for diseases of the mouth;
and the quality of the bleeding is that the patient sits between your hands before the sun, and lifts the tongue, and looks on each side for a black vein:
bleed then one and the other, and do not go too deep, for underneath are the arteries.
The veins of the throat which are commonly bled are bled according to two methods:
either by piercing with a flat, myrtle-leaf-shaped blade, or with a slender, olive-shaped one like cutting knives, and it is called "anesil"; and they are wide and slender according to the width and narrowness of the veins. The shape of the myrtle-leaf blade is very renowned, and it is wide as you see:
And it is needed to open hairy veins full of thick, apparent blood, and which contain thick and cloudy blood; and this is the shape of the olive-shaped blade:
and it is more slender and pointed, and is for bleeding the slender veins, where there is thin, citrine blood.
Bleeding of the basilica vein, which is one of these veins, helps with illnesses that are below the throat, and in the neck, and in the chest, and in the belly;
and it is necessary for the bleeder that he bleeds wisely, and that he guards against the artery which is underneath. And if he cuts the artery, and a flow of blood results, then he must staunch it, as I have said; and the blade should not be pointed, but cutting like a knife.
And if the basilica vein does not appear clearly, then you must squeeze it, and choose another; or you seek a branch of it, or you bleed in its place the vein in the middle of the arm: it appears clearly; and cut it with a knife-blade, as we have said.
And if you wish to know the place of the bleeding, then it is necessary that you first squeeze the arm, that you touch the place until you feel the pulse; then mark the place with ink, and then tie the arm, and cut the vein with a sharp knife; and be careful not to injure the artery when you see the place swollen, for that is the artery: wipe it then.
And if you see it spurt upwards like the urine of a child, and the blood is red and thin, know that it is blood from the artery: hurry then, and put your finger on it for a long time, then remove your finger if the blood stops, which often happens; if not, tie up the arm, and leave it like that, and the patient should not move it;
and let it be protected, and do not move it until it is healed.
And if the blood is not stopped, and it overcomes you, and medicine is not at hand, then cut the artery if it is visible, because the ends retract; and stop the blood.
And take a piece of bark from a fig tree, and split it, and take one of the halves and bind it on well until the next day;
If the blood stops, it is good; if not, then treat it, as we have said, with powders that stop blood;
and the stopping of blood is not difficult in many cases because of the small size of the wound, and the strength of the ligament of the arm.
The bloodletting of the vein in the middle helps because it draws blood from the head above and from the body below, because it is composed of the basilic and cephalic veins, as we have said;
and it is necessary for the bleeder to beware of the nerve that is below, and if he goes too deep, and he finds the nerve, and it swells and the bleeding is difficult, and perhaps it cannot heal;
and this nerve appears many times, and if it does not appear in some men because of its subtlety, then you must bleed it with the lancet; and avoid the nerve to your ability.
And if there is a vein between the two nerves, then cut it lengthwise.
Bleeding from the cephalic vein helps, as it draws blood from the head, and helps the eyes;
and it is necessary to bleed by puncturing the olivary vein or the myrtle vein, for it is the safest of all the veins, for it has neither nerve nor artery beneath it. However, one must seek the easiest place, and it matters not if one fails the first time, and one begins again; and perhaps the place swells in some men, when one fails the first time, but it matters not.
The quality of the bleeding is according to your judgment.
The first thing you should know about bloodletting is that bloodletting is administered only to preserve health, and to avoid future illnesses;
and let the bloodletting be done in one of the three veins that are in the arm: that is to say, cephalic, median, and basilic; and one should bleed in the beginning of spring fasting, and in autumn and winter after eating, when the signs of repletion appear;
and one should bleed on the first day or the third, after two or three hours of the day.
The bloodletting which is administered for illnesses has no determined hour, but when need is, by day or by night, at all hours and at all times;
and one should not bleed children until fourteen years, nor a woman carrying a child except from the fourth month until the seventh. Nor should the elderly who have passed sixty years be bled.
And when someone wants to be bled, in whatever manner it may be, it is necessary that he cleanse the intestines with a light clyster, if he has much retained feces, so that the veins do not draw from the intestines the putrid superfluities harmful to the principal members;
nor should one bleed him who is too full of food, nor who is drunk, until he is sober, nor those with dropsy;
and one should be wary of bleeding after colic, vomiting, diarrhea, and frequent intercourse with a woman, and of labor, of wakefulness and fasting, and all that weakens, whether by something of the mind or of the body;
then refine the humors, if the blood is thick, by foods and by drinks and by medicines, if you have the power to do so;
then enter the bath, if nothing prevents it, to refine the blood, and bleed from the vein of the arm around the third hour, as we have said;
and guard yourself that day from work, and from pain, and from lust, and from similar things;
and be calm and joyful, and let the bleeder be higher than the one who is bled, and let him rub the arm two or three times, then tighten the ligature moderately, for when it is too tight or too loose, the blood cannot flow;
and then rub the place with the hands, until the veins swell, and one feels them;
then the bleeder moistens the lancet with a little old oil, then places the finger of his left hand on that vein below the place a little where he wants to bleed, so that the vein does not slip and fail when pricked.
For there are veins that flee like strings when bled, and there are some that are full of wind, so that when one puts the lancet to them, the vein withdraws from the lancet, and one cannot open the vein, and so it is with those; and if he opens the vein, the wound is too narrow, therefore the bleeder must be careful in these things.
And if the vein opens the first time, it is good; if not, then begin again a little below that place or above hastily, if the place is not swollen.
And if the place is swollen, and the patient is frightened, leave it a day or two, and do not bind the arm: perhaps an abscess will form there;
nor enter the bath, then begin the bleeding again if it pleases him;
and if the opening is small, or the blood flows subtly and you fear that not enough blood will come out as you wish, then pierce in that same opening with the entire blade straight;
and work a little hastily, before the place is swollen; for this happens many times, when the wound is small.
If you see the place swollen, do not begin the bleeding again, and put on a little oil of lye, for it lightens the body of the blood, and lye is milder in this place than oil;
and thus administer the oil of lye in each bleeding that you bleed the veins, to stanch the flow of blood;
and the same does theriac and ox-gall, when one puts it on the place; it thins the blood and disperses it when it is too thick.
And if a large abscess forms there, which happens many times, especially when it is not bled except at that time when the opening of the vein is small, hasten, and apply to the place a sponge soaked in water and a little hot salt, and press it for an hour;
and you must do this after the bleeding from the vein, and if some blackness or greenness remains at the place after some days, it does not harm; and if you wish, put on something of aloes or myrrh mixed in juice of calamint, mint, or similar.
And many times an abscess and swelling appear at the bleeding of the basilica:
then put your hand on it, and if you find the place soft to the compression of the hand, then that swelling is bad. Avoid then that you put on anything of what we have said, for by chance it might cut off the artery;
but make a dry plaster to harden the place, then treat it with another treatment, until it is healed.
And draw blood from each one according to the quantity of his strength, and the color of the blood.
For if the blood is black, let it flow until it is red; and if you see it thick, let it flow until it is thinned; and if it is too hot, let it cool.
And it is necessary for one who is full-bodied and strong, and needs bloodletting, that a wider wound be made for him, and that the lancet be wide;
and for one who is weak, do the opposite, and he should be bled little and often, and one should bleed him by cutting across, not by pricking;
and this manner of bleeding is safer from the flowing of blood and the cutting of nerves, and is better than bleeding lengthwise or widely.
And to one whose body fails during bleeding, one should give bread soaked in pomegranate juice; if he is feverish, draw blood three or four times. And if he is of cold complexion, let him eat before bleeding bread soaked in medicated syrup, or in aromatic honey syrup with spices, such as pepper, cinnamon, ginger, and chickpeas, and a well-scented syrup.
And if he faints during bleeding, after the escape of much blood, then he should drink broth of meat, and subtle aromatic syrup, and use the other things that we have said in the section or chapter on syncope, for the evacuation of a vein.
And if he wishes to bleed his arm again, and bleed another time, then it is necessary, when he is weakened by great bleeding, that he bleed little by little, according to the quantity of his strength continuously.
And whoever wishes to bleed his arm after the first bleeding, and he has a strong body, let him bleed seven hours after the first bleeding, or after the ninth hour.
And whoever wishes to be bled from another part, should be bled on the second or third day.
For there is much blood inside the body which is already heated, and causes fever; therefore it is necessary to draw a great quantity, and widen the opening until it bleeds profusely; then, when you consider all the conditions of bleeding, and place your hand on his pulse while he bleeds, that death may not come in place of profuse bleeding, and this happens many times, when the bleeder is negligent;
and it is not necessary, when you wish to untie the arm, and cause blood to flow a second time, and the opening is closed, that you press strongly upon it; nor, if it is crooked, that he extend the arm hastily, for that would be bad;
but leave it until it bleeds a second time; or you prick it with the point of the lancet, until the blood which is congealed at the opening of the vein flows freely, and place on it a little salt dissolved in water, and press lightly upon it.
And if the vein is swollen, leave it and do not bind it, until the abscess is reduced.
And if there is need to draw blood a second time, bleed him in the same place, or in another vein, or in the other arm.
The vein in the arm is bled in place of the vein in the head because it is better composed.
And the manner of bleeding is that the patient puts his hand in warm water until the vein is red;
then it should be bound moderately, so that the vein appears well, then bleed it immediately across, not across the width or length;
and let the opening be wide, and bleed very near the joint of the hand, and if no blood can come out, put the hand back in warm water, and let the blood run into the water until you have enough;
and if it is summer, do not put the hand back in warm water, for it is put in more in winter than in summer;
and bleeding from this vein is safer than all other veins, because there is neither artery nor nerve there.
Bleeding from the salvatory vein of the right hand is good for all liver diseases, and this is the manner:
constrict the hand, and put it in warm water until the vein is swollen, so that one can see it; and if it bleeds across, and if you cut it completely through, it does no harm;
and do not go too deep, for the nerves are underneath, quite bare of flesh, and then put the hand back in warm water, if the blood is congealed in the wound, and cannot come out.
And when you have drawn as much blood as is necessary, put oil and wax on the vein to seal it quickly, and thus do with each vein.
Bleeding from the left hand is good for the disease of the spleen, and do just as I have told you for the right.
Bleeding from the saphena vein is good for all the diseases that are below the body, such as diseases of the womb, and retention of menses, and disease of the kidneys, and of the old thighs and legs, and similar diseases.
And the quality of this bleeding is that the patient puts his foot in warm water, and rubs the vein until it swells, and binds above the joint of the foot; and the vein is at the ankle, and above the foot many branches go;
bleed then in the largest branch, or at the ankle, which is more valuable.
And if you bleed it above the foot, beware of the nerves that are below, and bleed it across as if cutting;
and let the lancet be sharp.
And if the blood cannot flow out, put the foot in water, and let the vein empty well.
And if the bleeding fails the first time, begin again the second time a little higher up, for the place is salty;
do not fear the nerve, as we have said, and do the same for the saphenous vein of the other foot equally.
The location of the sciatic vein is at the outer ankle, and bleeding it benefits the hip pain, when it is due to hot blood.
And the quality of its bleeding is that the patient enters the bath, and presses above the ankle with four fingers twisting, for otherwise the vein does not appear;
and if it appears, bleed it in all the ways that you can, and across; and it is better that you cut it, because the place is safe, and it is very abundant in many men.
and it is better that you cut it, because the place is safe, and it is very abundant in many men. And if you do not find it, bleed any vein that appears on the back of the foot, and towards the little toe, and beware of the nerves;
and make as much blood flow as you wish, and then untie the ligature, and apply cotton and bind it; it is now healed.
Cups are made of horn, or of brass, or of glass;
and cupping is done in two ways: either by cutting and drawing blood, or without cutting.
And this cupping which is without cutting is done in two ways: either it is with fire, or without fire;
and cupping which is done by cutting and by extraction of blood is done in fourteen places of the body, of which one is at the very top of the head; and another is in the middle of the neck; and two others on the two sides of the neck; and the cupping below the chin; and the cupping of the two shoulders; and the cupping above the buttocks; and the cuppings between the two arms; and the cuppings of the two legs; and the cuppings of the two ankles;
and cupping does not draw blood except from the small veins that are scattered in the flesh, and therefore it does not weaken one, as bleeding from a vein does; and it is not necessary that it be administered, either with fire or without fire, in any illness that comes from repletion, until the whole body is emptied.
And if by necessity of illness it is necessary to cup, or by custom, then we administer it every hour at the beginning of the month, or at the end, and in the middle and at every time;
for there are some who, when they need cupping, have a heavy head;
and there are some who find repletion and redness in their face, and in their head, and in the neck, and darkness in their eyes;
and some who find a drop of blood in their mouth, and have a swollen tongue, and spit blood; and there are some who dream, and see at night blood and wounds and dead people and similar things.
And when we see these signs, and especially when it is mid-month, we order them to be cupped after three hours of the day.
The bloodletting of the temple helps the headache… that comes to the eyes, and it is not necessary that this be after the evacuation of the whole body;
and this cupping is in place of bloodletting from the cephalic vein, and it is not necessary that one who is of cold complexion use it, or who has a catarrh, for it does them much harm;
and therefore it is not necessary that the elderly use it, nor those who have cold illnesses in the head.
And he who is often bled, becomes forgetful, and therefore it is necessary to place the cupping a little lower because of the fear of forgetfulness.
Cupping in the neck is in place of bloodletting from the head and the basilic vein, and therefore it is good for tightness of the chest, and for a fissure in the bronchial tube, and for cough, and for repletion;
and it should be applied lightly, for if it holds too firmly, it causes forgetfulness or stomach and heart problems.
Cupping at the second rib of the neck is good for headaches, and ophthalmia and migraine, and for strangulation, and for pain at the roots of the teeth, and is in place of bloodletting from the basilic vein;
and you must instruct the phlebotomist to extend the patient's arm when making the incision, so that he does not cut the artery, and a sudden flow of blood does not occur.
Cupping under the chin is good for mouth disease, and for corruption of the gums, and similar diseases that are in the mouth; and is in place of bloodletting from the two lips.
Cupping of the shoulders is good for illness that comes from heat and fullness.
Cupping of the elbows is as good as the three veins of the arm, for it draws blood from those large veins;
and instruct the phlebotomist not to go too deep, for the place is bare of flesh, and there are nerves and arteries underneath.
The cupping glass that is on the rump is good for hemorrhoids of the fundament, and for diseases below, and it is necessary that the cupping glass be large, and of bronze, that it may draw well; and perchance, if it were thin, it would break; and it makes large wounds.
The cupping glasses of the legs are openly healing, for they draw blood from the whole body, and are good for old pains of the loins, and of the marrow, and of the bladder, and resolve inflammations;
and are placed on the two shins, and the two ankles, and yet they weaken the body after long use, and cause fainting in many instances.
The manner of applying the cupping glass is that you first place it empty, and suck moderately, and apply it quickly, and move it evenly, and do not cease doing this, until you see the place red and swollen, and the redness of the blood appears;
then heat, and reapply the cupping glasses, and take care in the disposition of bodies, for there are some who have tender flesh, and clear pores: then it is necessary to strike only once, and it is necessary to make wide wounds, and somewhat deep; and suck lightly.
And if the blood is thick, then it is necessary to strike twice: the first time to refine the path of the thick blood.
And if the blood is very thick, then it is necessary to strike a third time;
and when we wish to draw blood little by little, then one time is sufficient for us. And if we want a lot of blood, then we begin again often;
and if the blood is thick, strike deeply, and the limit is that the heart be pierced suddenly, and it is necessary for those who have thick and hard skin, and who have narrow pores, that you anoint the places of the cupping glasses with aperitif and dissolving oil: if it is in summer, with violet oil, or sweet almond oil, or pumpkin seed oil;
and if it is in winter, with cress oil, or lily oil, or chamomile oil, or something similar.
And if the excess is thick and cold, take marjoram oil, or balsamite oil, or dill oil, and the like.
And if the one whom you treat has tender flesh and wide pores, it is not necessary to put any oil there, but it should be washed after cupping with rose water, or cold water, or mulberry water, or pumpkin water, or porcelain water, or something similar.
And he who has much moisture, let him rise with vinegar, or myrtle water, and sumac, and similar things.
And those who have thick excesses rise with old wine, or beet juice, or a decoction of dill or chamomile, or other similar things;
and one should not bleed with cupping before the bath or in the bath, but after the bath one or two hours;
and do not sleep after cupping, and it is necessary that he be wary, when he is to be cupped and when he is cupped.
And beware if the one who is bled is choleric, and if the blood is too sharp and inflamed; then he should take cold things, such as pomegranates and endives and lettuces with vinegar, and similar things; and eat chickens, and capon meat, and moist meats.
and eat chickens, and capon meat, and moist meats. And he who has a cold complexion, should take honey syrup, and moderately fragrant wine, which is between old and new, and eat little, and eat chickens and small birds and pigeons;
and the day that he is cupped, he should drink more than eat;
and it is necessary to give some men sometimes theriac or nutmeg before or after cupping, to strengthen the principal members; and let the blood be thinned, but it is not necessary that those who are hot drink it.
The cupping glasses that are applied without incision are those that are applied to the liver, and to the spleen, and gout, and to the belly and the bladder and the kidneys and the hip, for these members do not tolerate being incised, and it is done only to draw blood from member to member, as we apply them to the breasts when the milk flows;
to remove the viscosity that is in the member, as we apply cupping glasses to the belly and to the bladder to reduce the member;
and removes the pain, when there is obstruction or stone, it removes by its attractive virtue perhaps the obstruction, or dislodges the stone from its place;
and so it does when it is applied to the liver and to the spleen when there is retained flatulence, and these cupping glasses are applied empty to suck only; and sometimes they are applied with fire, and sometimes full of warm water, as in diseases of the pleurisy, and in such a way that one fills the cupping glass with hot water alone, or with water in which suitable herbs have been boiled.
The form of the cupping glass applied with fire is this:
And let it be two fingers wide and half a palm deep, and let it have on the side around the middle a small hole, as if to insert a needle, and let it be of bronze, smooth in front so that it does not injure the patient when placed on the limb;
and let it have in the middle a crossbar of bronze or iron, to place a burning candle, and let there be large and small ones according to the diseases and the age of those who use them;
for the cupping glasses of children are different from those of the old, and of the thin from the fat.
And one must thus place this cupping glass on the limb:
take the candle of wax or a liniment, and place it in the cupping glass across the bar that is in the cupping glass, so that the light is at the bottom of the cupping glass so that it does not burn the patient;
and then place it on the limb, and your fingers should be on the hole that we have mentioned, so that when one wishes, the vapor escapes, and one removes the cupping glass;
and one takes the liniment as before, and repeats it often, if you need to.
In the cupping glass then, which is administered in the illness of pleurisy, with completely hot water, there is no bar or hole, and it is administered only when it is full of water, and is placed on the limb only;
and this is the method:
Leech applications are administered only to limbs where cupping glasses cannot be applied because of their small size, such as lips and gums, and similar places; and in places devoid of flesh, such as fingers or nose, and others similar;
and the quality of the leeches is that when you find leeches that are in clear fresh water without putrefaction, you take them;
and put them for a night in fresh water, until they are hungry, and have nothing in their bellies; and then let blood be drawn with a vein incision and cupping, then rub the limb until it is red, and apply the leeches;
and when they are full and fall off, if it is a place where one can apply a cupping glass, apply it, for this is very beneficial afterwards.
If not, raise the area with vinegar, and then with water, very well, and then dry it;
and if the place bleeds too much after the leeches fall off, soak a linen cloth in cold water, and apply it until the bleeding stops;
and if the bleeding is profuse, apply crushed vitriol, or galls, and similar things, until it stops;
or you may put on the area halves of peeled beans, and leave them until they dry on the area; this will stop the bleeding immediately;
and if you need more, apply more leeches.
And if the leeches will not attach, rub the area with fresh blood, or prick it with a needle until blood flows, and then apply them; as soon as they sense the blood, they will attach;
and when you see that they are falling off, sprinkle a little aloes and salt, or ashes,  they will fall off immediately.
Here begins the book of fractures. This chapter is often necessary in the art of medicine, and concerns the restoration of fractures and dislocations.
Know, dear son, that foolish men throw themselves out of this chapter, because they never saw any of the ancient books, nor read any letters in them;
and for this reason the science is strange in our land, for I never found any good ones;
and I know nothing, except through the science of the ancient books, in which I have studied so much that I have drawn the science from them, and by experiment, and by the habit of my life;
and I have described to you in this chapter what is contained, and have abridged it at the end, and have clearly shown the forms of the instruments that are administered, as I have done in the two chapters preceding this.
It is necessary, then, that we say in the prologue of this book the sums of the speech and the chapters where the wise man puts his understanding, and dwells on the truth, so that those who are experienced may know and learn this noble art, and teach it to others.
I say that when a fracture or dislocation or torsion or contusion comes to anyone, it is necessary that you hasten to bleed the patient on one side and the other, if nothing prevents you, such as weakness of the body, or infants, or the elderly; or if the weather is not very hot, or too cold;
and eat cold things, that is to say cold pottage, and the flesh of birds and of kid, and let him not drink wine, nor eat any fatty meats, and let him not fill himself too much with foods that fill the veins with blood, until you have no fear of a hot abscess, or of the spread of matter to the limb;
then let the patient return to his former regimen that he had used.
And when the broken bone begins to heal, it is necessary that one nourish the patient with foods that provide great nourishment, or that have viscosity, such as wheat cooked in water, and rice, and heads, and feet, and tripe of cow, and eggs, and fresh fish, and strong wine, and similar things. For with such nourishment, the flesh grows again and the fracture heals more quickly.
And know that the broken bones of old and decrepit people cannot heal well nor knit according to their nature because of the dryness of their limbs, nor those that are too tender, such as the bones of little children;
but there is a remedy, reset the broken bone with thick bandages that support and join the limb together, until it strengthens as it was before; and do not cease from this work, and for this reason it is necessary to nourish him with strong foods, as we have said.
And know that fractures are diverse in many ways.
For a fracture of the head is different from a fracture of the breast, or of the leg, and I will tell you in this chapter all kinds of fractures. For there is a fracture that goes across, and another lengthwise, like the cutting of a quill for writing.
For there is a fracture that goes across, and another lengthwise, like the cutting of a quill for writing. And there is a fracture with a wound, and a fracture with only a small crack.
And each kind has its own device and proper instrument in its restoration, according to how the remembrance comes into its place;
and a fracture of the bone is known because the place is twisted, and it appears clearly by swelling, and sounds when pressed by the hand;
and when there is no twisting or sound on touching, and the patient does not feel great pain, there is no fracture;
but there may well be a twisting, or crack, or small fracture. Then you must not move it by hand, but apply the medicines that follow, and then restrain it subtly.
And know that for a fracture that goes spirally, and the two parts are disjointed, they must immediately be set equally, before abscesses form there;
and if hot abscesses form, leave it for a few days, until the abscesses are calmed;
then set it evenly so that you can gently and wisely move it, and know that the restoration of this is easier than the restoration of one where there are pieces;
then restrain it, as is necessary later.
And if the bone is broken into pieces, extend it from two sides, if it is a hand or foot, or with your hand if it is a small limb, or with two cords, or with one cord and your hand;
and place the limb according to its natural form, so that when the broken parts of the limb are separated, bring back by all means the additions to their places as much as you can, and ensure that your work does not cause injury or pain to the patient;
and carefully join the two ends of the bones according to the best forms.
And feel it well with your hand if it seems to you that it is not well:
then straighten it nicely, and do not bind it too tightly, nor press it as those do who cause by their work a hot abscess and contraction in the limb, as we have seen many times.
And when the limb is set, strongly instruct the patient not to move it, neither awake nor asleep, nor turning, nor in any other way; and ensure that the limb is so secure that it feels no pain. For when it feels any pain, it is not set properly, and it must be put in such a position that it feels no pain;
and ensure that the limb is so secure that it feels no pain. For when it feels any pain, it is not set properly, and it must be put in such a position that it feels no pain; and take care that it is set straight, so that no crookedness comes when it is restored;
and the quality of the broken limb is according to what I tell you.
Know that broken limbs are diverse in smallness and in largeness and in form.
For there are small limbs, such as arms and fingers and similar: then it is necessary to wrap with soft and fine linen cloths; and those that are large, such as thigh and leg:
then it is necessary to wrap with a wide and firm linen, for the wide linen embraces the whole large limb, and constricts it equally on all sides, so that there is no slack;
then tie around light tow, three or four turns depending on the limb, and tighten your hand a little on the whole linen, then go above the fracture and tighten less, so that the fracture then moves the fracture slightly;
and soften the linen little by little, until you grasp a large part of the healthy area, then take another linen, and turn it around again over the broken area;
then return to the part below the fracture, and tighten moderately, neither too strongly nor too weakly, as we have said in the first chapter above;
then place between the linen bandages tow or cloths, until it is all even, then bind all over with a bandage, and then apply your well-made splints, if there is no abscess or swelling.
And if there is swelling or an abscess, then apply something that soothes a hot abscess, and which reduces the swelling, and leave it like that for a few days;
then tighten your splints, and let them be half of a wisely sawn wide cane, or of wood from which staves are made, or of palm branches, and let them be according to this figure:
but it is necessary that the splint that one places on the fracture be a little thicker and wider than the others;
and let it also be as long as is necessary for the limb, small or large; then tighten the splints as you did in the first binding, then tie over it a suitable thread, as in the first binding over the fracture; tighter above, always less;
and the threads should be medium, neither too thick nor too thin, and should be of soft linen;
for if the threads are thick, as I have seen in the works of fools who make their bandages of twisted linen cords, and this is a great error, because the bandage cannot be even if it is too thin, and it is not necessary that there be less than a finger's breadth of space between each splint.
And if the patient is injured by the ends of the splints after tightening in healthy places, then place under them linen lint, or carded wool, so that he is not injured.
When the wound is with a fracture, and the bone is broken, I will describe the treatment afterwards.
And know that it is not necessary to bind all broken limbs with splints on the first day. For when the limb is large, it is not necessary to apply splints forcefully before five days or seven, or more, depending on your certainty of a hot abscess arising;
And here is the manner of ancient plasters for restoring fracture, dislocation, and torsion:
and it is that you take flour that adheres to the walls of the mill, and cook it with abundant egg, and apply this confection, neither too thin nor too thick, and use it; and this is the common method of the plaster restoring the fracture in many situations, and especially for women and small children, for it is neither too hot nor too cold.
Another method of plaster restoring fracture and dislocation and torsion: Take 3 ounces of labdanum and enula and asafoetida and gum arabic and myrrh, of each 10 ounces; myrrh and aloes, of each 5 ounces; comfrey 9 ounces; and make them into a powder, and mix them with egg white; If the man's complexion is hot, use this plaster, for it is of good composition, and quickly restores broken bones, and is beneficial to many men.
Another kind of plaster that is good for sprains: take comfrey and mallow, each 10 ounces; myrrh and aloes, each 9 ounces; gum arabic 6 ounces; Armenian bole 10 ounces, and grind well, and mix with water or egg white, and apply.
Another type of plaster for joints and bones dislocated from their places, and soothes the resulting pain, and heals the damage to the bone, and the fracture: Take new wool, and moisten it in vinegar and cooked oil, and apply to the place.
This plaster does not restore, but it is good for soothing a hot abscess, and properly removes the pains.
Another type of plaster which restores broken bones: Take dried fig leaves and leaves of henbane, and grind them together, and make a plaster.
Another type of plaster for the restoration of a bone fracture and for reducing the remainder of an abscess. Take mallow root, chamomile, violet flowers, and vetch flour, one part of each;
and grind, and mix with wine, and if the limb is inflamed, mix it with moist coriander water, or with water, and apply it.
Another type of plaster stronger than the first, when a hard abscess occurs in the restoration of the limb. Take mallow roots, and linseed, alkanet, melilot, and comfrey, and violet and chamomile flowers, of all these one part each; and grind, and mix with salt water, or fresh water, or with wine, according to the heat of the limb, and its condition.
Hippocrates says in his book that one should not put on a broken limb for restoration anything except a cerate made of wax and oil, and nothing else, and says that it should be neither too soft nor too hard.
And it seems to Galen that one should put on the broken limb, for restoration, slightly warm dry things, such as myrrh and aloes and incense and similar things, as we have said.
Another kind of plaster that is good for injury and pain: Take mugwort and chopped human hair, or bird feathers, and mallow, and salt equally, and grind them, and make a plaster and bind it on.
And then unbind it a little afterwards, and take care if the patient feels no pain, or if the bone has not moved from its place; if not, unbind it in a few days. And if pain or itching comes to the place, without rest or swelling, hasten, and unbind it, and remove the plaster immediately;
and take a light cloth, and a moist sea sponge, and dip it in water, and lift the place, until the itching ceases, and the pain is calmed; then let the limb rest for an hour, then put on dry wool, moistened in water or rose oil, and bind on a nut, until you are sure of a hot abscess;
and the inflammation of the limb will subside, and the pain will be removed, then recommence the subtle binding, and a little plaster, and do not bind it as tightly as before; and continue until it is healed.
And if you see that the hot abscess and redness and pain and swelling are completely gone, and you need a plaster and a bandage, then start again, as you did at first equally.
And if nothing comes of what we have said to the limb, then do not unbind it before three or four or five or seven days; and sometimes leave it twenty days, depending on what one sees, until the fracture mends, and the joining of the flesh approaches;
then restrain it more than before, and it thickens its flesh, as I have said before;
and if you see the place drying out more than is necessary, know that nourishment cannot come there; then moisten it with lukewarm water, every time that you unbind it, and let that be every third day, and loosen the bandage a little;
by this work then nourishment comes quickly to the limb, and it quickly amends what the foolish healers do, who bind the limb too tightly:
that is bad, and it is a dangerous practice, and I see nothing else but to leave it and to work correctly.
There are many kinds of fractures, and diverse forms, and the causes are different;
for there are fractures that are made by the percussion of a sword, and the neck breaks the whole bone down to the fascia which is under the bone, just as a hatchet or club does; and for this reason this kind of fracture is called "hatchet-fracture".
Or the sword cuts the bone from above without piercing, and this kind of fracture is called "absolute";
and the wound of these two fractures is large or small.
And if there is a blow with a blunt object, or a fissure from a stone, or from falling on a stone, or from similar things.
And if there is a penetrating fracture, which reaches down to the membrane which is under the bone, or it is on the bone, and this wound is either large or small.
And if there is a wound which is spread in the bone as finely as a hair, and the fissure is small, and for that reason this fracture is called "capillary";
and if the wound which is made either by striking with a stone, or by falling, or by a similar thing, and drives a piece of the bone inwards, and the place is swollen as caulkers do when they strike cauldrons; if the stone enters inside.
And this happens more to those who have soft bones in the head, like a child's head;
and it happens in all these kinds of fractures that small pieces are separated like stars; and I will speak in its place.
And we recognize all kinds of fractures by the pulling on them, and the probing with probes, and by the corrupted flesh that is on top.
Hair-like resemblance is known by this: when the bone is uncovered, and one rubs against it, the black fracture appears.
In the treatment of the fracture, pay attention to the patient's symptoms, and if you see any bad symptoms, such as vomiting of bile, and loss of consciousness, and stretching, and fainting, and acute fever, and the eyes becoming watery and red, and other similar symptoms in various ways, then it cannot heal without doubt.
And if you see no frightening symptoms, and you hope for healing, then begin the treatment.
And when the wounded man first comes to you, and it is in winter, it is necessary to remove the bone before the fourteenth day, if you can.
And if it is in summer, then hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, before the flesh under the bone is corrupted, and the symptoms that we have mentioned appear.
And if the fracture of the bone reaches the membrane covering the brain, then it is necessary that you split the split part thus:
and it is that you take the head of the wounded patient, and uncover the bone in every way that you can, and the surface of the wound as gently as you can, and if bleeding occurs upon uncovering the bone, or a hot abscess, help him with what is necessary, and it is that you fill the place with cloths moistened in rose oil; and let the wound rest until the hot abscess is calmed, and you are assured of the cessation of bleeding; then begin around the bone to remove it, and this is done according to two methods of work:
one method is that you cut with a narrow incision in front, and this is the form:
And then make another incision larger than the first.
And the second method is that you have a number of different incisions, some narrow and others wide, and they are pointed, and are of Indian iron;
and work lightly, that you do not injure the head.
And if the bone is strong and hard, then you must pierce it around, before you make incisions with chisels, not so deeply that it pierces through the skull bone, and it should have above the point a margin or a circle, so that the point does not pass beyond the bone;
and you must have several, so that each comes in its place on the thickness of the bone, so that you have chisels for the whole head;
and this is the form of the three kinds of chisels:
The quality for piercing around the broken bone is that you place a chisel on the bone, and turn it with your fingers until you know that the bone is pierced;
then put the chisel elsewhere a little afterwards, and thus do all around, then cut with the incisors the thickness of the bone which is between the holes, and do this as subtly as you can, and lightly, as we have said, until you draw out the bone with your hand, or with some of the instruments that you have, such as forceps, pincers;
and be careful not to touch the brain or the dura mater.
And when you have pierced and extracted the bone, it is necessary that you remove the remaining bone fragments with another instrument similar to an incisor, but it must be thinner and more subtle than the other incisor;
and if there remain any small bones or scales, remove them lightly with one of the instruments; then treat the wound with tents and ointments as we have said.
And the other method of operation is that which Galen described, which is safer; and he praised it greatly, and that is his word. First, you must uncover a part of the bone where the broken part shows, so that when you have uncovered that part, you will place under the head of this lenticular incisor, of which this is the form:
And it does not cut on one side, and the part is sharp on two sides, so that the cutting edge is towards the bone;
then strike with a small mallet above, so that you cut the bone lightly all around, and take good care of the membrane that is underneath;
if it is adhered to the bone, remove it lightly, for one removes it well without harm, and without fear.
And if the fracture of the bone does not reach the membrane, and the bone is only cut from above, and there are small pieces, then it is necessary to remove that roughness, and remove the splinters with a fine rasp of which you should have various sizes, to apply in each place the most suitable, according to the work and the shape of the fracture.
So begin with large rasps, and then with finer ones, and do not cease doing this until it is well.
In each of the other hairline fractures and subtle fractures, you must apply a remedy according to its condition;
and this is something that is not unknown to one who has applied their study to this art.
And if the fascia is exposed, then you must take a linen cloth, according to the size of the wound, and moisten it in rose oil, and place it on the wound; then take another cloth doubled in two or three, and moisten it in wine and rose oil, and place it over the first cloth; and do this as gently as you can, so that you do not injure the fascia, then apply another bandage over it, and do not bind it tightly except so much as to hold the wound only;
and leave it thus one or two days, until the swelling of the abscess is subsided, then unbind it, and apply medicines such as lily roots, and bean flour, and incense powder, and birthwort, and similar things;
and of these things make a powder, and put it on the wound, and constantly apply cleansing medicines without biting.
and ensure that the wound is always clean, that you do not leave ointment there, nor allow pus to collect, for when pus collects on the membrane of the brain, it will fester and rot, and great harm will come to the patient;
for when one puts something biting on the fascia, it becomes necrotic on top. Therefore take care, if any bad accident comes to the patient, as we have said, it is undoubtedly doubtful.
And if blackness comes there only because of the medicine that has been put on, which has such a property, then you must take one part honey, and three parts rose oil, and glue one cloth, and put it on the fascia; then treat it with the appropriate methods of treatment, until it is healed.
Know that sometimes the two parts of the nose are broken above, or one alone, for they are two bones;
and that below is cartilaginous, and does not break, unless it is bent or twisted, and then heals.
And if one of the two parts is broken, then you must put your little finger in the hole of the nose, and set the fracture even with your index finger, and with the thumb from outside, until the nose returns to its natural shape; and do this gently, and ensure that the patient feels no pain from your work.
And if the fracture is in the upper part of the nose, and the finger cannot reach the place, then you must set it even with the head of a slightly thick rod.
And if the fracture is in two parts, do likewise, and hasten to restore it the first day, if you can;
if not, after the seventh or tenth day, when the swelling of the abscess has subsided, then put into the head of the nose tents of linen cloths, if the fracture is in one part.
Or you put one on the other side, if the fracture is there; and let the tents be so large that they fill the openings of the nose.
And some restorers say that one should moisten the tents in butter, and change them each day. It does not seem to me that this is good, but they must be moistened in a preparation of egg white and mill dust; then leave the tent until the bone is strong, and the cartilage hardened.
And sometimes one puts goose feathers in the nose instead of tents, and a soft cloth is wrapped around it, and the fracture is held, and the patient blows through it; or do what you wish.
And if hot abscesses come to the nose while you are working there, put cerate or cotton moistened in rose oil, or a little diachylon there.
And if hot abscesses do not come there, put a plaster on top, of chickpea flour and incense powder, mixed with egg white, then put light lint on top, and do not bind the nose;
and if the fracture of the nose is small, and it is broken into small pieces, extract it with instruments suitable for this, then sew the fissure, and treat it with things that generate flesh and heal, such as plasters and ointments suitable for this;
and if there is no wound inside the nose, treat it with tents, and put lead weights there, until it is healed.
When the jawbone is broken underneath, and there is no wound on top, and the fracture is only on top, and it is not broken in two, except perhaps splintered inside, one recognizes it easily.
It is necessary, if the fracture is on the right side, that you put your index finger in the patient's mouth; and if the fracture is in the left jawbone, put your index finger of the right hand, and gently put the fracture back in place, and set it with the other hand from the outside, and make it even.
And if the fracture of the jawbone is separated in two, it is necessary that you apply traction from two sides, until it is even.
And if movement of the teeth occurs, or breakage, then bind them with a thread of gold or silver or silk, then put cerate on the broken jawbone, and put on a double cloth; and put on the cloth a well-made large star, or a piece of even leather, long and wide according to the jawbone, and bind it on as tightly as you can, and instruct the patient to rest, and eat light foods.
And if you see that the alignment changes, unbind it on the third day, and then reset what has changed; and put a plaster on, of powdered millstone with egg white or barley flour, after you have removed the cerate;
and put light wool on the plaster, and if the plaster dries, and the patient's condition does not change, leave it until it is healed; often it is healed in three weeks.
And if hot abscesses appear, administer what we have often said.
And if there is a fracture and wound together, observe if any piece of bone has come out; then carefully remove it with the appropriate instruments.
And if the wound is narrow, widen it with a blade according to your need.
And when you have removed all these pieces, and none remain, sew the wound if it is large, and apply suitable plasters to it, to generate flesh, until it is healed.
A fracture breaks in several ways in front, towards the shoulder, and the break is of three kinds:
or it is broken and separated in two, and there are pieces, and it is the easiest to restore;
or there is a fracture with a wound.
And the procedure is, when the fracture is without a wound, that you have two assistants, so that one holds the shoulder where the broken fracture is felt; and the other extends the neck towards the part;
then set the fracture with your fingers, so that the shape is as it should be, and there is neither appearance nor shortness.
And if you need to extend more, then place under the patient's shoulder a round bolster of cloth or wool, and let it be thick according to your need; and extend and lift the clavicle, and pull the bolster with your hand, so that you set the fracture as it should be.
And if you cannot pull the head of the clavicle outwards, because it is deeply impacted, then the patient must lie often on his back, and place a medium-sized pillow under the shoulder, and the attendant pushes the shoulder downwards, until the bone of the clavicle is raised.
And then set the fracture with your fingers, and if you find it broken, then you must make an incision.
and draw the pieces out gently, and if the bone cannot join because of some impediment, then cut it with one of the scalpels that you have; but that you place this instrument under the clavicle, to protect the viscera:
and it resembles a spoon, and is not pointed, and should be as wide as is necessary, according to the size of the bone and the demands of the operation;
and it has two ends, as you see, and one is wide, and the other narrow, as is the opening of the wound that you have made when you drew out the bones;
and when you are certain of a hot abscess, then sew the wound, and if the opening is small, or you suspect a hot abscess, then fill the wound with pledgets and tents, according to its size.
And if hot abscesses appear, soak a pledget in rose oil and vinegar and wine, and apply it.
The binding of the bone, when it is without wounds and without cuts, is that you apply to the bone a plaster of powdered millstone and egg white, and place light tampons on top, and place a splint under the armpit, if you need it; then take a very wide bandage, a palm wide, then place a double layer of cloth over the tampons and the plaster; then take a thin strip three fingers wide and long, and wrap it around that bandage, so that the end of the bandage is hanging; and place the strip on the fracture, and turn the bandage over the neck, and under the healthy armpit, and under the affected armpit; and tighten it from each side, and when you see that the bandage holds the fracture properly, and you clearly see that the strip does not move over the broken bone, then check it every day, and when the bandage loosens, tighten it;
and make the patient lie on his back, and place a small pillow under the armpit while he sleeps, to raise the shoulder; this will relieve the fracture of the clavicle by the elevation of the shoulder, or you bind his arm to his neck, and do not unbind it unless a bad accident occurs, up to twenty days;
then renew the plaster, if you see that it is necessary, and tighten it and leave it so, until it is healed;
and it is healed at most in twenty-eight days, and in less time in some men.
Of the fracture of the shoulder
It rarely happens that the shoulder breaks at the wide part or in the middle, and one does not know it except by touch;
then set it according to the nature of the fracture, and reset it according to its natural form, in all the ways that you can;
then put on the place mill-powder with plenty of egg white, and light linen bandages, and put on a double cloth; then put on a wide and thin splint, a little wider than the shoulder, and if there is hair under the splint in any place of the shoulder, fill that hair with linen bandages, so that the splint sits evenly;
and then bind it all with a strong bandage firmly, so that the splint does not move from its place, and examine the bandage each day;
and every time that it loosens, then bind it, and set the splint even if it is out of place, and let the patient lie on his side;
and the shoulder is restored in twenty days or in twenty-five.
And when this number is complete, then unbind it, and be sure, for it is not a bone that easily dislocates.
And if a piece of the bone protrudes forward, and points below the heart, then cut it, and remove it, and do what we have said in the fracture of the clavicle to soothe a hot abscess.
of the fracture of the breast
The breast is sometimes broken in the middle, but this happens rarely; but it often breaks on the outside.
And when it is broken in the middle, it declines downwards, and the patient feels great pain, and shortness of breath, and immediately, and perhaps vomits blood, and the hair appears in the broken bone, and one feels it well.
And the restoration is that the patient lies often on his back, and one puts a cushion between his shoulders, then presses the shoulders, and brings together the ribs of the two ribs with your hands, and subtly put it equally in all the ways that you can, until the shape of the bone is as it should be;
then put on plasters and lint over the subtle star of salt, or of other light wood, and wrap it in a cloth, and tie it over the broken bone, so that it does not move; and turn the bandage roundly to the back, and tighten it properly, and check every hour the bandage, and if it loosens, then tighten it;
and if it is necessary to untie it, because of corrosion or itching that comes to the place, or pain or abscess, then hurry, and untie it, and remove the plaster, and address that which has come there with methods of treatment;
then replace the plaster, and tighten it until it is healed.
Of the fracture of the ribs
Know that the fracture of the ribs only happens in the large spaces behind the back, and in the front towards the head, and they only break because they are slippery; and one feels it well on examination with the fingers.
And the restoration is that you set the fracture even, as is necessary. And then apply the plaster, and bind it with a bandage, if you need to.
And if the rib fracture is slanted inwards, the patient feels very great pain, and a stabbing pain, like pleurisy, because the bone pricks the lung; and breathes with difficulty, and often vomits a great quantity of blood, and this is a serious condition, and the ancients have applied great skill to it.
And there are some who say that it is necessary to administer foods that inflate the belly, to push the fracture outwards.
We do not do this, so that hot abscesses do not form, if they have not already formed. And if they have formed, then treat them.
And some of them say that one applies cupping glasses to the area, to strongly suck, and this seems reasonable; however, there is doubt that the cupping glass might attract superfluities to the area due to the weakness of its constitution.
And some say that one should cover the area with wool soaked in hot oil, and place tents between the ribs to equally distribute the pressure around, then it should be treated with the treatment for pleurisy, with meat and medicine.
And if the patient feels such great pain that he cannot bear it, because of the bone which pierces the flesh, and the patient is in doubt, then it is necessary to cut open above the area of the broken rib, and it is necessary to place an instrument underneath to protect the viscera;
and then one must cut the bone, and pull gently, and then sew the two lips of the wound, if it is large, and treat it with plasters, until it is healed.
And if hot abscesses come, then apply cloths soaked in rose oil to the area;
and treat the area in the meantime as is necessary for an abscess, and let him lie often on the side where he should, until it is healed.
and also to the spine of the back.
And when this happens to someone, and you want to know if he will be healed or not, then take heed if you see his hands softened and swollen and dead, and he cannot move or extend them, and when you prick them with a needle, he does not feel it.
Know that he is mortally wounded in many ways, and if he moves them and feels well when they are pulled and pricked, know that the joint of the bone is safe, and that the patient will be cured, if care is taken.
And if a similar thing happens to the spine of the back, and you want to know if he will be healed or not, then take heed if the feet are softened, and if the accidents are there which are in the hands, and on the back there is flatulence and involuntary bowel movements;
and when he is turned on his stomach, there is involuntary bowel movement. And when he is turned on his back and wants to sit up, he cannot. Know that he is mortally wounded: so do not labor in his cure.
And if these symptoms do not occur, the condition is less serious.
And the cure is that you observe if there is a hot abscess, then apply rose oil or egg yolk oil to it until it is calmed;
then apply one of the comforting and drying plasters, and bind it with a bandage, and instruct the patient to rest; and do not sleep on that part where he feels the pain, until he is healed.
And if any bone is separated, it is necessary to cut above the heart; and remove the bone, then bring together the two edges of the wound, if it is large, with a suture, then treat it with flesh-generating ointment until it is healed;
and if the head of the bone is broken, which is called the "head of the cow", if you put your little finger of your left hand there, and set it even with the other side to your ability, then apply the plaster and the bandage on top, if you need it;
then bind it, and if there is a separated bone, cut above it, and remove it, and treat the wound until it is healed.
Of the fracture of the hip bone
It rarely happens that the hip bone is broken, and if it happens, it is only a slight reduction at the head; and it splits lengthwise, and slopes inwards, and the patient feels pain at the site, and pricking, and swelling where it is broken.
And the restoration is that you extend your hand above, until you are above the fracture; and know what is the fracture and its shape;
and if the fracture is only at the head, then set the fracture evenly, until it is of natural shape.
And if the fracture is lengthwise, or it slopes inwards, then make the patient lie on his stomach, until the resetting of that fracture is prepared for you. And when you have set it evenly, then apply the plaster, then put on a splint of wood or horn, and restrain the fracture so that it does not move;
and fill the space under the ribs, until the sides are even. And instruct the patient to sleep on his healthy side, or on his back.
And if hot abscesses develop there, do not touch them until the hot abscesses are subsided, and apply what we have said before; and then return to the restoration, and restrain it as necessary, if there is no bad accident;
Of the fracture of the shoulder
The shoulder joint is that which is between the elbow and the head of the shoulder, and if it is broken, then one must restore it according to one of two methods:
one of which is that you take a straight piece of wood of moderate thickness, according to this form:
And tie two cords to the two ends, and hang them up high, and let the patient sit on a seat;
then throw his broken arm onto the wood, until it reaches the armpit, and have a curve of wood in the middle, then hang some heavy thing or let the assistant stretch it down;
then let the physician set the fracture even with his hands together, until the fracture returns as it should.
And the other method is that one suspends the patient on his mattress, and ties his hand to his neck, then instructs two assistants that one holds what is above the fracture with his hands, and the other holds below with a cord, and each stretches to his part.
And if you want the traction to be stronger, then pull a cord below the fracture, and above the fracture, and let each of the assistants stretch to his part.
And if the fracture is close to the head of the shoulder, then you must place one cord in the middle under the armpit, and another towards the elbow, below the fracture;
and also if the fracture is towards the elbow, then you must place a cord lightly, without effort, until the fracture is even above the place, and above the elbow;
then set the fracture evenly, as is necessary, and pull it, if hot abscesses do not appear there.
And if hot abscesses appear there, then do not pull it until seven days, and apply wool soaked in vinegar and rose oil, until the hot abscesses are calmed;
then pull it, and the manner of pulling is that you place the plaster on the fracture, then assemble the arm to the shoulder, and place your hand on the shoulder or on the breast;
and place the cloth, and pull on the shoulder and on the arm, so that the arm is in its proper place, if nothing prevents it, or if the bone is not moved.
And if you doubt that the bone may move, then use splints, and place on the fracture one splint larger and stronger than the others, and let there be one finger's breadth of space between each splint, and let each splint be so large that it surpasses the fracture by three fingers' breadth on each side;
then pull on the splints, as I said at the beginning of the chapter on the fracture, more strongly and less as you move away.
And if you see the placement of the splints, and the binding, as we have said, at the time that you restore the broken limb, and you fear a hot abscess, then leave it to mature until the seventh day, as we have said;
then examine every three days the bandage, that itching or swelling does not come there, or that nourishment cannot reach the limb because it is too tight. If so, redress it, as we have said.
And if no such accidents occur, then do not unbind it except after three days or more, and let the patient sleep on his back, and have his hands on his stomach;
and place under the shoulder a cushion full of wool evenly, and check every hour of the day or night, that the shape of the broken limb does not move, or that the bandages are not loosened;
then redress it by the power of medicine, and give him the food that we have mentioned before, in such a way that the food is at first finely ground; and when he begins to recover, let it be coarse.
And it is customary that the shoulder and the leg should be healed in forty days altogether; and then one should unbind it and administer baths and ointments to heal the place.
And if the constriction is severe and swollen, it should remain unbound for fifty days or two months.
Of the fracture of the arm
The arm is composed of two bones, which are called the two "fossile", of which one is small, and it is the one that follows the little finger;
and the other is large, and it is the one that is below, towards the little finger;
by chance the large fossile alone is broken, or the small one, and by chance both together.
When the small fossile is broken, the restoration is easy, and the healing;
and when the large one is broken, the healing is difficult, and more serious than when both are broken together.
If it is the small fossile that is broken alone, then it should be slightly extended a little, and set even.
And if it is the large fossile, then it should be pulled more strongly;
and extend it on a cushion, and hold the little finger of the hand higher than the others, and the little toe lower than the other toes, and let the patient be crossed over himself, and a cushion in front of him higher, so that the patient suffers no pain;
then let the attendant extend his arm to the lower part of his hand, or to a linen, and another attendant to the other above.
And then let the physician set it even, according to its best form.
And if in the fracture there are pieces, then put each one in its place, and if there is any separated that touches the heart, and you cannot restore it to its place, then cut it and remove it, as we have said before.
And if with the fracture there is a wound, I have spoken of it in a separate chapter; then take care of it.
And if at the beginning of the resetting, hot abscesses arise, then glue a cloth of cerate made of rose oil and white wax, that it be neither too hard nor too soft; and bind the cloth on subtly, until the hot abscesses are calmed.
And then remove the cerate, and apply a plaster of the mill's powder with abundant egg, then apply the splints, and let the splint of the fracture always be stronger, and a little wider than the others;
and know that there should be six splints on the arm in several positions: whether the fracture is in one of the bones, or in two;
and bind more tightly above the fracture than elsewhere, and always less as it moves away, as I said at the beginning of the chapter; and let the cloths that are on the fracture be soft and moist, and not hard or rough;
and let the cloths that are on the fracture be soft and moist, and not hard or rough; and let the thread, with which it is bound, be of linen, neither too thick nor too thin, as we have said.
And examine the limb and the binding after a few days. And if any bad accident happens to the limb, such as itching that comes to the limb, then you must irrigate the limb with warm water, until that itching is calmed;
and let the limb rest without being bound tightly.
And then resume the binding, and if the binding is loosened and the bones separated, and similar things, then redress it.
And take care that nourishment can reach the limb, for if it is too tight, then you must loosen it a little, and leave it thus for a few days, until nourishment flows to it, and then bind it tightly.
And if none of these things that we have said happens to the patient, then do not unbind it until twenty days.
or around, then hang his hands around his neck, and let his neck be straight, and beware of movement and fidgeting, and sleep on his back;
and know that this fracture is healed in thirty or thirty-five days, and perhaps in twenty days, according to the compositions and complexions of the humors.
Of the fracture of the hand
Know that on the back of the hand and at the knuckles of the fingers, few fractures occur, and only sprains happen many times.
And when the palm of the hand is fractured or sprained, it is necessary that the patient sit cross-legged, and sit straight in front of him evenly;
then he places his hand on a flat surface, and the attendant extends the broken bones, and aligns them, until they are well joined;
and applies the plaster and lint, if no abscesses form, then he applies a splint according to the size of the area; and it should be wrapped in a linen cloth.
And if the fracture is on the inside around the palm of the hand, make a sling of cloths, and instruct the patient to hold it to his broken palm; and then bind it with a long cloth, and let the splint be of soft leather as large as the palm of the hand, and bind it as necessary.
And if the fracture is on the outside, you must place one splint above, and another below on the palm, so that the hand is open and straight, then bind it all around the hand, and tighten the binding between the fingers.
And if the fracture occurs in any of the knuckles of the fingers, if it is the thumb, set it straight as necessary; and bind it with the palm, and if you wish, place a small straight splint to raise the fracture, so that it does not move;
and if the fracture is in the other fingers, such as in the index finger or one of the others, set it straight, and bind it with the healthy finger that is next to it; or you bind them all together, holding them still, or you place a splint on top, as with the thumb;
and take care in the restoration and arrangement of a hot abscess, and treat what comes from it, as I have said.
The bone of the thigh is often broken, and one sees it well when it turns forward and backward;
and the restoration is that one binds one bandage above the break, and another below. And the patient lies on his face, then each attendant extends his bandage to his part equally;
and this is when the break is in the middle of the bone.
And if the break is close to the root of the thigh, let one of the bandages be towards the groin, and the other bandage below the break.
And similarly if it is close to the knee, then let the bandage be near the knee, and let the extension be below;
then let the surgeon set the bone evenly with his two hands, until it is according to its natural shape, and then apply the plaster, and bind it, if no abscesses form.
And if there is a hot abscess, let it subside, then return to your work and your treatment; The ligature is made in this manner.
You must wrap around the fracture a hard bandage doubled two or three times, and let the excess remain, then turn the leg until the heel comes to the root of the thigh, and place a long thread between the thigh and leg, near the knee below, and bring the ends of the thread above;
then turn the bandage over the leg and over the thigh, then place splints on the fracture, and place a splint on the bone of the leg;
then fill the empty space between the leg and thigh with soft cloths to ensure even tightening, then begin to tie firmly three or four turns above the fracture; and the further you go above the fracture, the less you tighten it;
then take the two ends of the thread that you placed between the leg and thigh, and tie the three splints that are above, then return below to the ends of the thread, until you come near the foot;
and tighten it so that it does not move from its place, then leave it thus, until neither abscess nor swelling nor anything similar appears. And if it occurs, then untie it, and treat what appears, as we have said many times;
and if there are pieces of bone that protrude, then it is necessary to remove them, if one can; and if one cannot, then it is necessary to cut open the place, and pull out the splinter; and treat it as we have said, until it is healed.
And sometimes the thigh is broken so that splints are applied, as in the shoulder and arm;
nevertheless, in the restoration thus made the patient does not limp.
And know that the thigh is restored in fifty days, or a little less or a little more, according to the diversities of complexions.
Know that in the kneecap there is seldom a fracture, but it bends many times.
And if it breaks, it is only a crack, or a hole, and it happens with or without a wound, and this one feels well.
And the restoration is that one puts what is round back to its place with the fingers, as much as one can;
then apply the plaster, and put a round splint on it, if you need it, and bind it as necessary, then observe all the conditions that we have mentioned in other fractures, such as hot abscess and other similar things; apply to each accident what is necessary, until it is healed.
Of the fracture of the leg
Know that in the leg there are two bones, of which one is rightly called "mustelz", and the other is called "foscile";
and the fracture happens just as it does in the arm, and therefore the restoration is the same as that of the arm, and the procedure is exactly the same. And if the two bones are broken together, then the leg turns in all directions.
And if the thin bone is broken, it turns forward.
And if the large bone is broken, one feels great pain, and one sees it well; and it turns downwards.
Then administer extension, and set it even, and bind the splints evenly;
but however, if the fracture is bad, and there are several pieces, the extension must be less and lighter; and lighten it according to your ability.
And when you have completed your work, take two wooden splints that encompass the leg on one side and the other, and are the length of the leg from the knee down;
then wrap in two places one bandage above and below, and bind it in the middle also, and with this binding the leg cannot bend to the right or left, and thus it is well;
and some administer a splint the length of the leg, and it is of wood, and in it one places the leg to prevent movement, and this is properly done in a fracture where there is a wound;
and move the leg each day, to see if there is a hot abscess or other complication; then cure it until it is healed.
of the fracture of the bones of the foot
At the ankle there is no fracture, but at the bones of the foot there is sometimes fracture and in the toes also, and there is nothing but a crack in many instances.
And if there is a fracture in the bones of the foot, and you see these bones overriding one another, then have the patient put his foot on the ground, as if he wanted to walk, and then immediately put your foot on his, there where the bones are raised, then press it until they return to their place;
then apply the plaster and lint, and place under the sole of the foot a small board with two full edges, then bind it to the foot properly, after you have wrapped cloths around it, and other things that you need.
And when three or four days have passed, untie the bandage, for you will find the bones even, whether broken or dislocated.
And if any of the toes are broken, reset them, as we have said for the fingers of the hand; then place on the broken toe a splint along the length of the toe, and let it be a little wider, then place under the foot that board that I have mentioned, and bind it properly;
and if there are two or three, or more, broken, then put on each toe a splint according to its size, wrapped in a linen cloth, and bind the board under the foot; and let it rest on the top of the board over the instep, so that it holds it well.
And you must not forget the other things that I have said about other fractures, as we have said; and treat each accident as is necessary.
of the fracture of the bone of the wrist
When the bone of a woman's nature is broken, make her sit upright, then incline her towards her back, and let her be held from behind;
then fill the patient's vagina with cotton, and put in as much as will fit;
then stand the woman up, and lift her back little by little, and then the cotton will jump out, until it comes to the entrance of the vagina, and the bone returns with the cotton;
and when she wants to urinate, remove the cotton, and when she has urinated, replace it, and do this for seven days or so: the fracture will be restored, and if you wish, take a sheep's bladder, and tie a string to the opening, and put the whole bladder into the vagina; then blow forcefully into the string until the bladder is inflated inside; in this way the fracture will be returned to its place;
then it should be filled with cotton, and leave it like that for some days, until it is healed.
And when the bone of the man's or woman's wrist is broken, restore it in the same way as we have described for the hip bone;
and these fractures are not hidden from the one who applies himself and practices, and understands my book.
For the fracture signifies in many ways the right way of restoration: understand it then.
In the penis, when it is broken, take a goose's neck and put the penis in it; then wrap cloths around it, and leave it for three days or however long, and it will be healed quickly.
of fracture with wound
It is necessary for one who has a fracture with a wound, especially if it is large, such as the bone of the thigh or shoulder or similar, that he be healed immediately, so that the healings that we have mentioned testify to it.
And if the wound heals, then staunch it with vitriol, if you have nothing else, then begin again to restore the fracture in that same hour, or that day, if hot abscesses do not appear.
And if hot abscesses appear, then leave the restoration until the ninth day, until the abscesses are calmed, and do not touch it on the third or fourth day, for you would cause bad accidents.
And if the broken bone is apparent on the uncovered flesh, it is necessary that you put it in place gently with your hands, with slight extension.
And if extension is not sufficient to set it in place with your hands, then reset it with this iron instrument, which is seven or eight fingers long, and its width is according to the size of the wound; and for this it is necessary for the surgeon to have three or four, according to what he needs for each treatment of a fracture;
and let it be round and somewhat thick, so that it does not bend under compression on the limb during your work, and let it be sharp in front, and thick from the middle forward, thus:
And it is called a "palainche," wherefore it is necessary that the curved head be placed on the head of the apparent bone; and push it at once, until it returns, and is even on both sides. And if the fracture is subtle, and the instrument cannot well grasp the bone, then it is necessary that you cut the head of the bone, until the instrument has power over it.
And if you cannot reset the bone, as we have said, then cut it with an instrument suitable for this, either an incisor or a saw, as you see fit;
then clean what remains of the bone of roughness and small splinters.
And when the bone is reset, and the patient feels great pain afterwards, know that it is not in its natural place.
So work until it is in its place, then moisten a cloth in black styptic wine, and properly if it is in summer; and do not put on the wound cerate or anything else containing oil, lest it cause putrefaction and corruption;
then administer lint when you have reset the bone, and leave the wound uncovered, and cut the covering all around, according to the size of the wound, and take great care that the wound is not constricted by the fracture;
and many times foolish surgeons have done this, and have caused the patient either death or sometimes corrosion; and let the bandages be softer and gentler than for other fractures.
And if the wound is bad or large, and you fear that bad complications may arise, as we have said, and you find pain in the area, then you should not put lint on it; but wrap around it, instead of lint, hard cloths, and bind them.
And when you see after one or two days pus forming at the wound, remove what you have put on with wine, and apply a wound-healing ointment, such as tetrapharmacon ointment and similar.
And you must unbind the limb twice a day, morning and evening, until it is healed and sound.
And it is necessary that the limb be positioned in such a way that the pus flows down easily.
And if many days pass, and it cannot heal but continues to produce pus, know that there are small pieces of bone, wherefore it is necessary that you cleanse the wound with a tent, and remove all those separated pieces which cause that pain.
And if a fistula forms at the site, or another kind of corruption, then you must treat it, according to what is said in the preceding chapter.
And when the bone is broken, and protrudes from the limb, such as the bone of the thigh or the shoulder, and other similar large bones, do not pull it out, for many times death results, but leave it until it festers;
perhaps it will fall out by itself after twenty or thirty days, then treat the wound, if you can;
and if you cannot, then leave it.
Many times after the healing of the fracture, especially when it is near the joint, and it is an ugly thing to see the shape of the limb; and perhaps the limb cannot perform its natural functions.
Take heed then if the bone is fresh: if you administer styptic medicines, such as aloes, incense, and myrrh, and sarcocol, acacia, and similar others, so that you take some of these things, or all together, and mix them with styptic wine or with egg white or with vinegar; and put them on the wound in linen cloths, and bind it well, and do not unbind it for several days;
and put them on the wound in linen cloths, and bind it well, and do not unbind it for several days; and then unbind it, and start again with another, until the swelling is removed;
or you bind on a well-made piece of lead; for the property of lead is that it removes all swellings from the limbs;
and if the swelling is already converted into hardness like stone, and it is necessary to remove it, then cut it away, and remove the apparent excess; or you scrape it with a razor, until it is removed, and treat it until it is healed.
of the limb which is weak after healing
When the fracture of the bone is healed, and the limb remains weak and thin afterwards, this happens for many reasons: one of which is because it was bound too tightly, and was not bound as it should have been; or because there were too many bandages, and nourishment could not reach the limb; or because of excessive washing; or because of too much movement, not at the proper time; or because he has little blood in his body, and is weak.
And the cure is that you make the patient eat, and make the body soft, until the blood is multiplied in him; and administer a bath, and give him joy and happiness;
then put pitch on the limb, so that the pitch draws great nourishment to it, and often water it with warm water, until nourishment flows to the limb; and returns to its natural form.
of the limb twisted after the healing When the limb is twisted after the restoration, and the broken bones are apparent, and the shape of the limb is ugly, yet it does not lose its natural function:
do not believe the fools who say that one should break the limb anew, and many foolish physicians have done this in our land;
and this practice is blamed, and great harm comes from it, and perhaps death;
however, if the knots and the twisting are fresh, then they must be bathed with warm water, or softening herbs are cooked, such as mallow leaves, and roots, and melilot, and similar things;
and make a softening plaster, such as well-made diachylon, and you take the mucilage of mallow, and mix it with hen grease or sesame oil, and make a plaster on top;
or you take fat figs, and crush them with flaxseed, and similar medicines that reduce swelling.
And sometimes the knot is removed by continuously and long rubbing with moist hands. And let movement be given to the limb every hour.
And if the tortuosity is old and hardened, like stone, and it needs to be removed with iron, then it must be cut to the bone, with a light, fine incisor; and put care and diligence into the treatment.
Dislocation is the departure of a joint from its place, wherefore it cannot move, and the limb is misshapen, and the patient feels great pain and great injury.
When a dislocation occurs in someone, it must be immediately reset without delay.
For if one delays, the place swells, and perhaps one resets it with difficulty;
therefore one must not move it at the time that it is swollen: many times it causes spasms and other pains;
however, when this happens, bleed the patient, then leave him until the abscesses are calmed;
then bathe the limb with warm water and oil, then gently reset it, and treat each limb as its treatment will bring it into its place.
And I have ordered the chapters on dislocations from the head to the feet.
It happens that the jaws are dislocated on both sides, and the dislocation of both is according to two manners: or they are a little removed from their places, and softened a little; or they are completely dislocated, and hang towards the breast, and the saliva runs from the mouth so that he cannot hold it, nor can he close his mouth, and his tongue is entangled with speech.
When the dislocation is small, it returns by itself in several positions.
And if it is complete and accomplished, then you must reset it quickly, and not delay;
and in such a way that the assistant holds the head of the patient, and puts the middle finger of one of his hands into the root of the dislocation of the mandible inside the mouth, if the dislocation is on two sides; and the other two fingers of the hands should be outside, to make it even;
and instruct the patient to soften his jaws, and move them in all directions. And the middle finger puts it even, until it returns to its place.
And if bringing it back is difficult, especially if it is the two jaws together, then bathe them with warm water and oil, until they are softened slightly;
and do not delay in bringing it back, as we have said.
And when they are brought back evenly, and the patient's mouth closes well without softening, then apply cloths moistened in cerate made of rose oil and wax, then bind it lightly with soft bandages;
and let the patient sleep on his back, and his head should be supported between two cushions, so that he does not move it to the right or to the left, nor does he strain to chew, but let him eat light food, until the pains are gone, and the jaws are healed;
and then let him eat what he wants lightly, and let him not strain to open his mouth when eating and drinking, until the jaw is well healed and sound.
And if the two jaws cannot be put right at once, and are not returned to their place, then fevers and accustomed swelling result, and perhaps looseness of the bowels, and perhaps vomiting of pure bile.
And when you see this, then know that it is perdition; and many times he who it happens to dies within nine days.
The collarbone cannot be dislocated inwards towards the ribcage and breast, and it is sometimes dislocated outwards, and this is easily felt.
And the restoration is such that the patient lies often on his back, and extends his arms; and then press the place firmly with your palm, and it will return;
then apply the plaster and bandage it well, and bind it tightly;
and the shoulder which is towards the ribs cannot be dislocated; unless perhaps a little, and if it dislocates sometimes, then reset it in its place, as we have said;
then apply the plaster and bandage it well, and bind it tightly, and instruct the patient to rest until he is healed;
and in the same way is the head of the shoulder reset, when it is separated from its place.
Of the dislocation of the shoulder
Know that the shoulder is dislocated only in three ways:
one is that it dislocates towards the armpit below; and the second is towards the breast; and by chance it dislocates to the upper part, and this happens rarely;
and it does not dislocate behind the shoulder, nor inwards towards the nerves;
and it often dislocates downwards towards the armpit, especially in those who have little flesh, for in these it jumps out readily;
in those who have enough flesh, it jumps out with difficulty, and returns with difficulty.
And by chance it happens to some men that there is a percussion or fracture, and the shoulder swells with a hot abscess, and they think that it is dislocated because of this.
It is necessary then that you examine it, until you are certain; and then begin the treatment.
And the dislocation is known when it is lower towards the armpit, and it shows a difference between the diseased shoulder and the healthy one, and you will find a clear difference between them; and you will find at the head of the shoulder a hollow, and under the armpit, on touching the head of the shoulder, as if it were an egg; and the patient cannot bring his hand to his nose, nor move it in any way;
and also, if it is dislocated upwards, it is not hidden, for you find it clearly on touching;
and this type of dislocation is not difficult to reset, when it is recent, or if the child is ill.
And the method is that the attendant raises the patient's hand upwards, then places his thumbs under the armpit, and forcefully raises the joint upwards into place; and the attendant raises the hand and extends it upwards, then puts it downwards; it will come quickly.
And if it does not come as we have said within a few days, then it is necessary that the patient be bathed in warm water; and the attendant applies a softening and soothing poultice, such as a decoction of mallow, fenugreek, and melilot in water, and it should be administered;
then the patient should be placed on his back, and a pad of wool of equal thickness, neither too soft nor too hard, should be placed under the armpit, then the physician places his heel on the pad, and raises the head of the shoulder skillfully, and pulls the patient's hand;
and another attendant holds the patient's head so that it does not move downwards; that shoulder returns immediately, and if you wish, reset it in this manner:
and that you have present a man who is larger than the patient; and he should be positioned towards the side, and place his shoulder under the patient's armpit, and raise the armpit upwards, so that the patient hangs in the air; and another attendant pulls the patient's hand downwards towards the belly. And if the patient is too light, let him hang with something heavy attached, and the dislocation will return immediately.
And it is reset also in another manner:
and that is, one sticks a long poker in the ground, whose head should be as round as a pestle, and should be neither too thick nor too thin; then it is placed under the patient, but let there be soft cloths on top, and the patient should be lying along the length of the stick;
then let his hand be pulled down forcefully on the other side, and the joint will return to its place quickly;
and if it does not want to return for all these things that we have said, then do this treatment: take a poker two arms long and four fingers wide, which has a round head to enter easily deep under the armpit, according to this form:
then tie soft cloths on the head of the stick, so that the stick does not injure the patient, then place it under the patient's armpit;
and extend his arm along the length of the stick, and tie the shoulder to the stick, and the arm at the head of the hand, then place the arm on a rung of a wide ladder, and let the hands be extended downwards, and let the body hang on the other side: the joint will return immediately.
And when it is in, in whatever way it may be, you must place a smooth wool pad under the armpit, then apply the prepared plaster of mill dust, with incense and egg white, over and around the whole shoulder, then bind it firmly under the armpit, and turn the bandage over the plaster, and embrace the hand to his neck, and let the hands remain thus.
And he must eat little, until the limb is strengthened, for it will heal faster;
and then eat more after five or seven days, and move it; and if it is firm and not softened, it is healed.
And if the joint is out of place because of moisture that has come there, or for another reason, you must administer cautery to three points, as it is described in the chapter on cautery.
And if you do all this, and it loosens after seven days, and the joint does not hold, and he cannot raise his arm upwards, then know that the nerves at the head of the shoulder are severed or stretched or softened; and know that the joint will never be fixed in its place.
The dislocation which is towards the breast and nipples, or behind, is caused by a blow and stretching of the hands, and another treatment is administered there;
and treat until it is healed.
And if after healing stiffness comes to the limb, and slowness in movement, then let the patient use baths many times, until that stiffness is relieved, and returns to its former nature.
of the dislocation of the rib
Know that the joint of the rib is dislocated with difficulty, and returns with difficulty;
and if it is dislocated on all sides, and especially in front and behind, and the dislocation is not hidden, for one sees it well and feels it well; and dislocated according to each form. And when you join the diseased rib with the healthy one, you can see it clearly. For the joint is broken, and he cannot bend his arm, nor touch his shoulder at all.
And it is necessary that you reset it before hot abscesses come there, for if hot abscesses came there, it would be difficult to reset it;
and perhaps it cannot be reset at all, especially when it is in the back; it is worse than other dislocations, and is more painful, and perhaps death results.
And the restoration is, when it is such that one can reset it, that you extend his hand with your two hands; and his arms should be spread out, and the hands of the physician around the elbow, above and below, and put the joint to its places together, or to the root of his palm, until it returns to its place.
And if the dislocation is in front, it returns when he doubles his hand to his hand, and pushes from the root of the palm towards the elbow which is dislocated.
And if it will not return to its place, administer strong extension;
and it is that two assistants extend the arm, and two assistants hold it, so that it does not move during the extension;
then turn the arm on each side, after you have wrapped a long and wide double cloth;
and when the physician joins the joint with his hand, let him anoint it with some oil to soften the joint, then push the joint strongly, until it returns;
and when it is in place, apply a dry plaster with egg white, and bind it tightly, and hang the arm around the patient's neck, and leave it for some days, then unbind it.
And if the joint is firm in its place, unbind the binding, and leave it;
and if you see that the joint does not hold well, redo the plaster and the binding, and leave it thus for some days, until it is firmly set; then unbind it.
And if he feels pain after the resetting of the joint, and it moves, bathe and rub it gently, and press until it is relieved; or you put on the joint a poultice of fat mutton, then leave it one day and one night, then remove it, and have him enter the bath; and when he sweats, rub the joint moderately, then put the poultice back on, and then enter the bath; and thus do it two or three times, until he is healed;
and if you wish, put on warm, moist cow dung with butter, and bind it on;
then it will return to its proper place.
the dislocation of the hand
The joint of the hand dislocates, and its reduction is easier than other joints. However, it must be reduced quickly, at the very moment it is dislocated, before the place swells, or a hot abscess forms there.
And the reduction is that you place the affected hand on a table, and the assistant extends the hand, and places it evenly, so that he places his palm on the appearance of the joint, and pushes until it returns.
However, you must check if it is well in place; then the patient places the back of his hand on a table for extension and reduction. And if the dislocation is on the back of the hand, the patient places the back of his hand on the table, and the assistant places his hand on that appearance of the joint.
If it returns immediately, it is well. If not, restrain it with soothing plasters applied warm, and leave it so without restarting.
And if he cannot endure it, and you cannot put it in place after a few days, the joint remains crooked;
and it harms the patient nothing except that the hand is weakened, and cannot grasp anything at all: then know that the nerves are severed, or the arteries;
then there is no other remedy except to restrain it with a cautery near the case, and perhaps nothing else is of use.
And when the hand is in place, apply the plaster that we have mentioned, then bind it and leave it for five days, then unbind it and leave it so.
And if he cannot move it well, and there is some stiffness, moisten it with warm water, and rub it until it is healed.
of the dislocation of the fingers of the hand
Sometimes the fingers of the hand are dislocated on either side, sometimes on the back of the palm or on the belly;
then extend the finger, and push the dislocation with your thumbs until it returns, then support the head of the finger, and bend it towards the part where it is disjointed;
and leave it for two days, and then put it even on that day;
and at night bind it, as we have said, and unbind it by day, and make it move, and bind it at night;
and do this often, until it is tight, and do the same, if it is dislocated on the belly of the hand, and do as you have done before, until it is healed;
and do the same, when it is dislocated elsewhere.
of the dislocation of the spine of the back
When the spine of the back or of the neck is dislocated, or there are several dislocations, there is no cure, for death quickly takes the patient.
And the sign is that the excretions leap forth without will, nor can he hold them, and many times some limbs are softened, or the two thighs or the two arms or one.
And many times the spine moves in four directions;
that which moves to the rear is called "gibbosity":
The cure is that you observe if the gibbosity came from infancy: if there is no cure or healing at all.
And that which comes from a fall or from blows or similar things, the ancients described methods of cures with great words, where there is not in all great profit;
but I have shortened it according to my intention, and have formed instruments in diverse ways.
I say that in the gibbosity that comes to the breast in front, there is no remedy nor health;
and also that which comes straight on two sides, and one cannot cure except that which properly comes to the back, as I say;
and it is that the patient be stretched on his face in one even place, and have a support beneath him, that he not injure himself;
then stick one brand in the earth firmly, and another at the feet, and tie one rope across the armpits of the patient, and another at the hips, and at the knees, and at the ankles;
and two assistants hold the ropes, one at the head and the other at the feet, between the two brands;
and let them be well secured, the brands as we have said, and the physician put his palms on the spine firmly, until it returns.
And if it does not return by this treatment, then take a board three braccia long, and place it under the wall, and let the patient be on his side, and place the head of the board under the wall, then place the middle of the board on the spine; and let the physician place his feet on the other end of the board, and press well, until it returns to its place;
and if you wish, do it with a lathe that turns by hand. And it is that you place two brands at the head of the patient a cubit apart, and towards the feet two others, and there should be between each brand, above and below, a palm's breadth of space in length;
and let there be in each brand a hole where the lathe runs, and let the brands be firmly in the ground so that they do not move;
and between each two brands let there be a turning brand, on which the ropes turn, and let there be on the two turning brands two small brands a palm's length long, to turn the lathe;
and then tie the rope that is through the armpits to the lathe towards the head, and the other rope towards the feet to the other lathe, and each of the assistants turns his lathe with all the rope, and the master places the spine evenly as we have said.
And when it is even, then apply a drying plaster with egg white, and then the lint, and then the splint of a tablet three fingers long, which covers the area of the gibbosity and the part of the healthy spine, then bind it with a rope, as we have said, and let the patient use light nourishment, until he is healed;
and if anything comes at the end of the healing, then it is necessary to administer softening and soothing medicines, with the splint that we have mentioned above; and sometimes one administers a piece of lead, and sometimes the appearance comes in the last vertebra of the back, and one thinks that it is a dislocation; and it is the bone that appears, which is why one should not be presumptuous: by chance it would bring death.
Know that at the hip joints and at the shoulder joints only dislocations occur, not as in other joints;
and the hip joint is dislocated according to four parts: inward and outward, and forward and backward;
and more inward than elsewhere, and little dislocated forward and backward.
And the recognition of its inward dislocation is that when one joins the affected leg with the healthy one, it is longer, and the affected knee appears more than the healthy one, and the patient cannot bend his knee to the fire; and the place which is nearby is swollen with a hot abscess, because the head of the thigh comes there.
And the sign of the one to whom it happens outwardly, is that these accidents are contrary to the preceding ones.
And the signs of the one to whom it happens in front, are that he extends his leg well according to its length; nevertheless, he does not bend his knee without pain, and if one wants to make him walk, he cannot go forward, and he retains his urine, and the groin swells, and when he walks, he steps on his heel.
And the signs of the one to whom it happens behind, are that he cannot extend his knee, nor bend it, and that leg is more twisted than the other, and the groin is softened, and the head of the thigh is in the place under the ribs.
The treatment of this kind of dislocation is that you observe if the dislocation is old, and if it remains according to its disposition, then there is no cure; and it is not necessary that there be presumption.
And in the one whose dislocation is fresh, and this is of the four kinds of dislocation, hasten that you turn the joint, and stretch it inwards and outwards, and move it to the right and left; by chance it will return, and needs no other cure.
And if it does not return in this manner, then you must prepare a strong assistant, and strongly stretch the leg with two hands, or with a linen cloth tied above the knee; and another assistant extends his hand above in such a way that he puts his hands under his armpits, then binds him with a soft linen cloth above the thigh; and another holds the head of the linen;
and they extend up and down all at once, until the patient is lifted from the ground at once, and remains hanging.
This method of extension is common to the four similar cases, and if the dislocation has returned, as we have said, it is well.
If not, then one must apply a remedy similar to it.
When the dislocation is inward, you must place the patient on his healthy side, then place the linen on the root of the thigh, and the place which is below the groin, then extend the linen upward toward the groin, and toward the hip joint;
then let another assistant take his arms, and embrace the thick part of the affected thigh, and extend it strongly outward; then it will return to its place immediately;
and this type of dislocation is easier than the others.
And if you cannot reduce it in this way that we have said, then you must bind the patient's two feet together with a strong, soft linen over the two heels and over the two knees, and let the affected leg be extended two fingers more than the other;
then let it be hung from the end of a beam, and let it be two arms-lengths above the ground;
then instruct an assistant to embrace the head of the thigh, and let another assistant hang with the patient, who firmly embraces the thigh, for the joint returns immediately quickly.
And when the dislocation is in the front, let the patient lie down, as we have said in the case of someone with gibbosity, and tie a linen bandage firmly over the affected leg and also over the foot;
then place two firebrands, one at the head and another at the feet, then insert a firebrand between the patient's thighs in the middle of the groin; and have moistened cloths placed around, so that it does not burn the patient, then let each assistant extend towards him, and let the surgeon place the dislocation evenly with his hand.
If it returns, it is good.
If not, place it on a table, and press it as we have said in the case of gibbosity, and let the patient lie on the healthy side.
And when the dislocation is in front, it is necessary to extend the affected leg quickly, and according to what I have said; and let the surgeon put his effort on the affected angle, then press with the other hand, and extend it downwards towards the knee.
And if the dislocation is behind, it is not necessary to extend the affected limb downwards, or to lift it from the ground, but it should be as if the hip were dislocated behind, as we have said about lying on the two hips; and let him be on his face, and the limb extended as we have said before, and one must press on the joint at the table; and it will be right when the patient extends his legs, and they are equal; then bring the thighs together, and apply the plaster, and bind it with a bandage, so that the hip does not move; and let him rest for three or four days, then unbind it, and apply the plaster again;
and if you see that they are equal, then bind it, as before, and leave it for three days;
then unbind it, and have him walk gently, until the limb is strengthened.
Of the dislocation of the knee
The knee is dislocated in three ways: that is to say, inwards and outwards, and backwards;
and it does not dislocate forwards.
And the sign is that you instruct the patient to bend his leg to his thigh, and if it does not bend to his thigh, know that it is dislocated;
and the restoration of all is that you make the patient sit upright, and extend his leg if he can, and place your back against his face, and put his foot on your feet;
then take his knee in your palms, and pull it between your fingers, then bend the two sides of the knee strongly; and another assistant extends his foot, until the knee returns to its place, and the sign is that he bends his leg easily to his thigh;
and apply the plaster, and bind the leg to the thigh, and bind them tightly together for three or four days, then unbind it;
and the patient should not exert himself to walk, until the limb is strengthened.
And if the limb is not straight, administer strong extension, as we have said in the treatment of the hip, until it is healed.
of the dislocation of the heel
The heel is sometimes sprained, and sometimes completely dislocated, both inwards and outwards.
And the sign is that the ankle is swollen, and more so on the side where it is dislocated:
The reduction is easy, and one should gently extend it with one's hands when it is only sprained.
And when it is completely dislocated, you must make the patient sit upright, and hold him firmly by the leg, above the ankle;
then pull the foot towards you with your right hand, and then with your left hand twice, then extend it upwards, and gently place the foot upwards;
and do this twice, as we have said, by pushing and pulling the foot;
If it returns, it is well;
If not, then begin the process again, for it returns;
and if it cannot return thus, then have the patient lie on his back on the ground, and firmly stick a stake in the ground between his thighs, and tie cloths around it, so that it does not injure the patient;
then let the assistant hold the thigh, and another assistant extend the foot with his hands or with a rope, which he ties above the ankle; then let each assistant extend equally, and the stake should always be between the patient's thighs to restrain the patient when he is extended;
then let the physician gently reset the dislocation with his hands, and another assistant hold the healthy leg underneath, and the dislocation will return quickly.
And when it is in place, then apply the plaster and lint, and bind it firmly, and tie the foot to the leg, and guard the nerves which are on the ankle behind, that the binding is not too tight;
then leave it for two or three days, and if the binding loosens, then tighten it;
then unbind it on the third or fourth day, and forbid the patient from walking for four days; and if he walks before that time, it is not certain that it will not dislocate again.
And if hot abscesses occur, then you must soothe them, as we have said elsewhere, until they are healed.
of the fingers When the fingers are dislocated, they must be gently extended without force, and it is an easy thing.
And if the dislocation is in any knot of the back of the foot, then you must have the patient sit on a level place or on a table perfectly straight, and place your foot on what is visible of those joints, then press firmly with your foot until it returns;
and when it is even, and nothing appears there, then place under the sole of the foot a board with two supports, then bind it firmly, and leave it for three days, then unbind it; and make him rest until he is healed.
of wound and dislocation together
When a wound occurs with the dislocation, and one wants to restore it, many times it happens that the patient dies:
so do not be presumptuous in the treatment, if you are not wise in the art and have not practiced it for a long time, and if you are not compassionate and merciful and slow, not rash;
and use at the beginning soothing things for a hot abscess, and leave the patient in God's hands, if you see no hope of healing; and when you see hope, then immediately reset the limb in place, before the hot abscesses come there;
and when the limb is in place, administer things soothing to a hot abscess, and treat the wound, as is necessary, with drying ointments;
and if with the dislocation there is a fracture, and small bones separated, then remove them, and do what we have said in simple diseases;
and beware of entering the path of fear, according to what I have said, for it is worth more to you according to your Creator, and for the salvation of your soul and your body.
