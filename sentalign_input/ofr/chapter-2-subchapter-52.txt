when the intestine protrudes outside
If the appearance of the intestine comes from a cauterized wound or a ruptured syfac (intestinal abscess/fistula), and it is on the abdomen and some of the intestines protrude, as it happens in other ruptures, or from blood flowing from veins or arteries depending on what is in front, or from flatulence; 
and if it is through the rupture of the syfac and through the exit of the intestine, then the color of the abscess is similar to the color of the body, and it is a light thing without pain, and it appears with various openings.
And if it is due to the protrusion of the intestine, then it is more varied, and when one presses it with their fingers, it withdraws, and then returns, and perhaps it is constricted, and greatly enlarges upon entering the bath and from strong exertion.
And if it is due to moisture, it is a light thing, and it is readily apparent when you press it with your hand, and it is not constricted;
and if it is due to blood, the abscess appears by these signs: large and hard, and fixed in a certain area;
and if it is due to flatulence, it is soft to the touch, and the task is to see if the appearance is due to blood from an artery, or a vein, or flatulence.
Then you must abandon the treatment.
For there is doubt and fear, as I told you in the chapter on abscesses, concerning the artery and the vein.
And if the appearance is due to the intestine or the bowel, then you must instruct the patient to hold their breath, and lie stretched out straight, then mark with ink all around the swelling;
then have them lie face down between your hands, then go around the area you marked with the spatula, then spread half of the abscess above with the large hook;
then tie it around with a strong thread, or a cord of strong silk firmly, and let the knot of the tie be loose;
then open the half of the abscess spread over the tie, and put your index finger in it, and search for the intestine;
if you find it caught in the tie, untie it, and push the intestine back inside the belly;
and if you find the swelling, take it with the hook, and cut off the excess;
and if the artery or vein gives you trouble, go around it carefully, then return to your work and take two needles, and thread two strong threads through them, and place the two needles around what you have done in a cross so that you make them pierce [the tissue];
then tighten the abscess in four places over the needles, and if you wish, remove the needles, and leave the area until it rots, and the dead flesh falls off by itself;
or you cut it when it is thinned and rotted, then treat it as appropriate, and shave the abscess as we have said;
and remove the blood or moisture that you find, then treat the area appropriately, and suture the area.
