Oh children, you have completed this book (the manuscript), which is the last of science in medicine for its excellence and clarity; thanks to it, I see that you understand complex matters related herein—those discussed within these lines relating directly or indirectly to surgery.
The operation is laid down in our region and period, inside which I have greatly praised your knowledge of it; through you, the science has been made manifest—and nowhere do these descriptions not appear: but within certain texts from Antiquity (referring to ancient writings), where they are found altered. These extracts shall be corrected herein and their meaning extended as far as possible so that there is clarity in its intentions, thereby establishing the strength of your understanding and skill.
You have shown to me that you breatve the order of this treatise according to its expositions and declarations—and through these tools (referring specifically to surgical instruments) as well as others needed for your work herein; in preparation, which is necessary due to what has been declared.
May be the reason why no artisan dares to touch my tool here in our time, for medicine is long and it's necessary now more than ever before that one exerthyse their knowledge of anatomy as Guilio knew about the limbs and forms of those things; understanding joint connections and separations along with bone structure, nerves, and muscles—and also knowing about veins pulsating and resting states alongside locations within for body cleansing.
Through Aqua of Hippocrates who knows by name its purpose, may it serve in the small workings and mainly in the craft of hands.
May we already have discussed this in the entrance of this text; who do not know what we told you about anatomy will fall into error and serve useless to dead men, although they saw many things from us, which are formed by this science and taken according to that knowledge and experience.
Here is the line by line translation of the medieval medical treatise:
And another doctor ordered that the patient drink a stone from a home which had been processed in his state, and this stone was large; it was brought to him by means of a vessel's lid, so that this same house would be destroyed on the third day.
And you have called her out for removal because of the great size of the stone and due to its position in the bladder, where she will die if not removed promptly.
Here comes the first sentence to translate: And another doctor takes his salary from our land'dictor and brings with him one who is black as coal due to fracture in the patient's thigh; he prepares this second physician, taking advantage of their ignorance, breaks apart the fracture on the ground using strong instruments like mallets and scrapers, without making sure that air can enter.
Here translates to:
And you called upon him/her (likely referring to the doctor), and used tools for untying ligatures, achieving calmness and easing of pains in their body.
Even though decay has been confirmed in the limb, it cannot be restrained and will not stop moving within while under the influence of melancholy (humor).
And another doctor pierced an abscess, and it was ulcerated for several days until its wickedness became apparent to the lord of him/her.
The cause is that the head caust (heating agent) for imbalanced melancholal humor, and not when it arrives at you in total but only as a member wherein has been hosted since then.
And for this reason, boys, it is necessary that the operation be planned in two aspects: one related to health and another where there is risk involved in major actions.
And you have already made the patient exceedingly wet in this free place where he falls into action and fear; therefore it is necessary for you to guard him from getting wet and lay hold of that, so that their limbs do not become paralyzed and deceitful towards you.
Therefore, take up your arms for solicitation and the protection of God, and let your illness be healed and strengthened.
Here comes the translation of each sentence line by line into English:
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called g When there's not a medical illness bad (mala), doctors don’t give the name.
And you have already opened this book for the second time three chapters.
Commences the division of free space, beginning with the first partitioned section. The ordered first chapter of the book on weight matters involves instruments and iron implements necessary for operation.
The division of the second section. The Second Chapter on stone and puncture, and of vials, and pustules, and extraction of herbs and similars to these things; all this ordered in the forms of instruments.
The third part of restoration and detachment, and for the healing of twists and illusions directed towards those parts within our heads (cranium), as prescribed by the head itself in relation to weight and forms of instruments:
When you examine the quality of that cauterization and its contents, and in which complexity it is forbidden to use a cauterization:
So say that the discourse of cautery and its obscurity is long and intricate, requiring subtlety in science; they argue extensively among themselves, and for me a small portion suffices due to their prolonged disputes.
And so it is said that the pointed instrument comforts all of the body universally, except for two types of complexions (which are parts derived from his/her own matter), namely tail matters.
In the complex tail and dry matter they disintegrate; those who use cautery will find it beneficial for that condition, where its quality and aridity are such that healing is required with water to which liquid moisture has been added (that is, treated), as nature itself embodies both humility and aridity.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
Through the speech of that person, I have already discovered some things for myself.
Even if you do not have time to withdraw that which has already been exposed and exercised in the place of cauterization for today' extraneous surgery, understand the complexity of human composition and the disposition of illnesses within their bodies, as well as the causes of these ailments, and the span of time allocated for them.
May also in other complexities, it is not out of fear but mainly due to cold effluvia and moist conditions; all doctors agree on this matter, without concern for weakening the patient through cautioning in these areas.
And since you know the secret of healing by fire and its goodness in medicine, it is that when focusing on burning with surgical tools (cauterizing), only the targeted part undergoes treatment without affecting other parts attached to this body except for a minor harm.
May the medicine burn reach that in his limb which he languishes from illness and difficulty of cure, causing it to come into the sick member with great force.
May the focus (the flame), due to its sublimity and beneficial substance, does not cause excess; we have already experimented with it for a long time through study in accordance with medical art knowledge about the causes of diseases, hence providing an excuse from lengthy discourse. Now that you are resting here at this pause (break), I will secretly manipulate your focus (the flame/thermal treatment area) as necessary during these moments; and by demonstrating through speech how we perform operations on body parts and expel diseases, a philosophical argument which would clarify in your minds.
And wise men know that it is most suitable for performing cauterizations and stops (pain relief measures) during the first days of spring.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: "And that cauterization is convenient at all times, for it ensures that harm from accidents sinks into the water which holds back the cautery and mostly when used for pains or necessary bandages (which do not suffer delay), because those who prevent them are considered greater than small harms entering by chance.
So do not cause pain in your feet or legs; these are judged only by the common people and physicians, hence why curing with cautery is not a complete resolution of this illness, as rest periods must also be followed.
E the cause is not due to excess fluid where their discomfort lies, and cautery are only used in places of medicine that alter complexity and evaporate these fluids which are the causes for pain coming forth.
Even though there are excess tools in medicine due to the patient'sealth and operation vigor, as well as the greatness of his lordship.
It is possible that the patient's illness may return at some point in time according to the complexity of their condition and the location of their sickness, as well as what has been prepared on their chest for excess fluids above all else (possibly referring to a poultice or compress), which they have ingested along with food items that caused these issues; but if cautery is administered therein applied to small and moist discharges, it may prevent the return of pain in their feet.
Even common talk may be considered the outermost stage of medicine and not understanding these cannot lead to proper healing by means of cupping or other causes related therapies.
E the cause is contrary to water; and I understand that cautery is only used when administering remedies for some illnesses, and these medicines do not confer benefit, but it's applied by hand on the day of the cause, directed towards it. Here comes the first source sentence to translate: And here are those things which we call caution or remedy in medicine, according to common understanding and often by most physicians.

Through this they apply iron needles appropriately and place them firmly in the operation area for treatment.
Here is the line by line translation of this medieval medical treatise:
The First Chapter (Literal translation can vary based on interpretation; here
The First Chapter (Literally translated:
The form of this cauterization is as follows: initially command the hump to be evacuated using medicine that pulls it outwards for three or four days, according to how much pressure you exert on the hump and its age and custom.
And command that race of their head and hold this between your thighs on an elevated bed so as to keep it above the rest of them.
Return your hand'dict (palm) pressure over the bridge of your nose between their nostrils, here is what this translates to: Return and apply pressure with your palm on top of someone's nose where it bridges between their nostrils. But when the heat from the fire reaches that location as indicated by them (the patients), it signals an attempt at that spot, and apply flames to the heating tool of which this is its form.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
Return your head to the location and look at the place; if you find any part of the bone has been exposed due to cold iron (metal), raise it with as much weight/gravity as there is in earth's metal, or return it where it belongs on a nail. If not attached to that specific piece of metal, attach your head massage tool either back here, at this location, or if chilled by the touch, wait until signs from bone are visible which you have already mentioned before.
And apply a small amount of salt and dissolve it on the location, leaving that for three days.
Return your hand over his chest, where that piece of the wound has been broken open and place it there. Return care for the location where there is broken bone within which healing should occur until it's cured.
And when a sick person rests (and exposes their back), they put on the bracelet made of iron or metal so much that it may be better and more beneficial for them.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: "E disseran allí aqueles cuya cola sea quemada dentro do os, e aquele fogo estar contido onde há alguma parte dividida da coisa interna do os.
Return its moisture that it is depleted from bone and provide its cure.
And others who carry the lancet come forth when it approaches to enter into bone and hardens within wherein lies the bone itself; this is the form of small healing. E from that location exhale the breaths of the head.
If the patient has been sick for a long time and is cured within that period when it's solidified.
May I not see these various cautery instruments of all kinds here, but only in trusted homes according to fear; and let that one, which you must provide for me, be better for my salvation when your head is lifted by the light of meditation as we have testified among other members, especially when the skull cap comes naturally.
The specific type of cautery I find more saving and beneficial is this, for it brings about healing in that work or operation even from the water used therein.
Capitol second.
Of the pointed cautery of the head
When in total the head experiences chronic and long-lasting pain, which is prolonged within the malady, using knives and lancets for cutting and bloodletting tools like cupping glasses and leeches, along with various other instruments such as cauterizing pliers (and often), primarily if already cauterized by a tool that does not further examine any of these causes; it is considered only when the head'thy humidity within its nature is very strong; there is no need for great bodily destruction, so this other form of treatment should be used quickly. Return that instrument over the patient's head scalp, for it is used as caustic within where the spine has been divided. Inscribe the rib and expose its portion as recorded and seal it with a cauterization at the location we call upon for airflow—the place where breathing is paused (possibly referring to thoracic cavity). And raise your hand forcefully so that you do not discover the bones, for when arteries are violently crushed they cause a great different pain from other caustic interventions on the head.
Here the cautery is applied in its place, for when this instrument has treated the corns on the head and back beneath subtle cauteries that it itself applies to the spot under the head where treatment occurs—this is how things are done here.
Capital dart (assuming "capitol" refers to
The phrase appears to be in a Latinized form of language, possibly Medieval or Renaissance English due to the mix with Italian and French influences you mentioned. The term
When the sharp pain in one's head occurs during a game or when there is an internal bleeding within the skull due to illnesses; and no treatment will suffice unless you apply immediate cauterization—either by means of acute medicinal combustion (likely referring to using heat from fire for therapese) or with iron tools.
May hot cups of salt be used in medicine as a heating source for you to grasp one and remove the limbs from both sides (implying treatment or intervention). When you strike the location of pain on one side below where there is a sharp lance hidden within its place of insertion beneath it (presumably referring to some inserted medical instrument), then this occurs when that same point has been used previously for cauterization or similar purposes, and thus holding their hands.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
Return care for that which is inside has been applied, where it shall heal.
If you come with some burning remedies that you have written down in the book of medicine treatments,
May the cauterization be with iron, according to this method: fire for branding.
And when it is called for a tight clasp or lock (like that of a key), then the head of the patient comes forth with such shape as to resemble a little flower at its peak, and in this spot there are small movements within them.
Return your hand over the location of pain and secure it—so that the iron needle does not harden as quickly—and rotate the small iron bit slowly by speed.
If the amount of blood drawn through the speculum inserted into the urethra reaches its capacity, and your hand is there to ensure that the artery does not get sucked in, preventing a flow of pus.
Here the translation into English would be as follows:
If you come, then perform the final cautery on the part of the scalpel according to the previous cauterizations directly and carefully avoid cutting an artery herein.
Capital quarter/section (assuming "capitolo
The translation for "Capitol quart" into English, given the context of a medieval medical treatise and assuming it refers to a section or chapter within such
When you treat an abscess and consider the remedy mentioned before, as well as what has been discussed about the various illnesses, if not fully healing with just the initial medication or cauterization on the wound point involved in pain lines stretching along which is where it hurts (the precise location), then you ignite that treatment within so that it becomes purified. Hold your hand over this place to mean its line of long extension, and apply a vigorous application there through flicks with an awl or by entering the bone – reaching across into the area from which pain arises (the origin).
However, it is necessary for you to guard against the continuous jaw movement, which causes grinding of teeth during chewing, and prevent damage or injury to the nerve that controls this muscle; thus avoiding spasm occurrences.
If it is about the custody and caution of blood flow from the artery that he withdraws, there in his extraction site will be fear, mostly for those who do not know what they are doing and have no study; therefore, perform the operation with care.
When you come back in memory of the regimen for fluid accidents according to their medical practice here at this place.
If you feel this illness that does not supply the necessary heat for our cautery and if it becomes intolerable to touch the affected area of malady in the abdomen, then apply the cautery here at the head'thy warmth as we have mentioned before. Care for the patient inside until they are healed.
If you come now, administer the one that we have mentioned in the chapter on heat treatment with a cautery having two handles, and this is considered better healing.
The provided text seems to be from an old medical document discussing treat
For curing joint pains in the elbow." Translation: The phrase is requesting information or instructions on how one might alleviate pain specifically located at
When there is pain in the elbow caused by accumulation and it does not heal on its own; these are related treatments that have been mentioned earlier. The curative form used here involves cauterization with a pointed instrument, which has already been described." Translation: This sentence suggests previously discussed methods for treating an unhealed elbow pain caused by some accumulation (likely referring to the build-up of something causing discomfort or inflammation). The treatments involve using heat through cauterization with a pointed tool, which is referred back to as having already been explained in detail.
And apply points with fire, and carry it throughout the entire body cavity using a rolling wheel or in any parts where pain occurs, if there is joint pain anywhere in the body. Long ago you have used the caustic of the ragged sponge, just enough to hold your location at bay from temptation.
If all points on the body are hot with pain and we must care for those places where they are healed, take proper precautions therein.
The provided text appears to be an attempt at translating from what seems
Based on your Latin-style medieval medical treatise and the line you've given, here is a possible translation
The line you provided seems to discuss the treatment of a turtle and suggests that it is not only due to cautery but also because of spices brought in through some means (possibly an herb or medicine). Here's how one might translate this contextually, taking into account typical medieval medical practices:
Avoid using specialized caustic for such dryness or due to nervous spasm.
When you treat that particular form of torture and purgation, and it does not comfort your healing, then the cauterizations in the bladder are three: the first with a golden needle (auricular cautery), the second using small doses at intervals of their temple (temporal cautery application through prayer or meditation timing touchpoints on the body), and the third by bringing together the lips' corners (lip compression to apply pressure).
When you place the pointed cautery on the contrary parts of the diseased area, it softens only in the portion that appears healthy.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
This is how it works with a pointed cautery, and this form belongs specifically to barber surgeons who are demonstrating now. Even if there is still a little pain undernethy, and because in the patient's abdomen there remains only a small excess of humidity/bodily fluids, do not interfere further; leave it as is for now.
Return care for where it now flows as healing waters enter within that which is being treated,
The text provided seems like an excerpt from an ancient medical treatise written
From what you've shared, it appears that the line "Capitol .vii." could be referring to a specific chapter or section in
When apoplexy is ancient and the remedies for it have been discussed herein (referring to "Capitol .vii."), if your physician does not prescribe fever-inducing treatments, then you should perform four types of cauterization: on all parts of their head; at places where there is swelling in the scalp area as discussed herein; and also for ear wounds. The action of the cautery is considered according to what has been previously stated.
And it has been cauterized on the mouth of the stomach, and perhaps more will happen now; hold onto the water that is passing through.
Given that "Capitol .viii." is not an actual extract
When joint pain (oblivios falluta) is caused by cold (flava), use a caustic substance for treatment/cauterization of the wound or inflammation.

This suggests ancient remedies involving specific substances—presumably herbs or tonics as "p
So apply pressure to the head of the malady (possibly referring metaplausely to a specific part associated with an illness) and place your hand over it as secured by lance wax, according to what is described in the treatise concerning applications/uses for this purpose. This line suggests using heat application—in ancient times often achieved through methods like heating metal instruments such as lances before applying them directly or
And allow some time for it to cool down (probably referring back to the caustic substance used previously), because that is when you employ a method of treatment or burning/cauterization as needed—perhaps indicating an alternative remedy involving heat And apply the above-mentified medication if available, referring back to what has been described earlier in this section of the treatise which likely outlines a specific remedy composed from various ingredients (
So if for these sanat (health or wellness) you are; otherwise, apply three caustic substances to the head's upper portion of your body—the parts closest between and above neck towards face — as described earlier in this passage which likely provides a protocol involving multiple application points on the individual’s scalp. This line suggests an alternative treatment method that involves physical action rather than ingesting remedies, perhaps indicating cauterization or some form of topical therapy using caustic agents specifically for head-related maladies as mentioned in this medical text from a medieval context where precise terms and practices were often used to describe such treatments. And there is a pause between each lancet used for bloodletting, and care must be taken with the lancets that come from it.
If you find yourself adding and the thigh is accepting (tolerating) it well, then apply the caustic at the warm spot on the limb; but if your addition becomes greater, then cauterize that over both bunions.
Take care of that which has been healed; and use the olive-wood cautery according to its given form as previously presented by the giver.

In the process of purification for which you are performing here and dealing with what has been said; properly apply pressure to the head if necessary (as 'cap' can refer both to a physical object or an illness affecting it), cauterize there at the place where heat is applied, also treat all pains on top of your head as well as those between neck and shoulder bones—essentially addressing any spinal issues with three specific methods (cauterization) in this area.
If it is necessary in the illness of softening for that part of the body to be treated with four cauterizations on the vertebrae of the back, and healing within these wounds must occur due to its severity or strength (the nature of the disease), then perform those four cauterizations there, and use a medicinal substance inside them so that they may recover from their head'dict; raise also the swelling. Return that which needs healing within, and this is cauterizing ointment.

From what you've provided, it seems like the text is discussing medical treatments related to seizures or convuls
It implies that for someone with an epileptic condition, it's not about cautery (a medical treatment involving heat), but rather the issue is related to "flecmas," which may refer to a humoral imbalance or possibly blockages
Therefore, we must calm the patient's mind at once and also provide for their other care that was outlined when ailments were severe as they overcame excesses beyond ordinary remedies in division of treatment time after humoral imbalance has been great and extreme. (Note: The translation is interpretive due to archaic language use, but the attempt remains faithful.)
If it is an infant who does not suffer from medicines, administer gout remedies and digestives agents through mouthfuls for several days, with the benefit of foodstuffs.

This phrase is related to the concept of treating melancholy, which historically refers to what we might now understand as clin
When the causes of melancholy are rotten and sluggish humors within us, it is necessary to use these same caustic substances on our hampers that hold in paralysis (or putrefied matter). Herein lies an ancient medical practice where doctors believed certain decaying or impure materials accumulated inside the body's "hamper" and contributed to melancholalism. This condition, often linked with a state of sadness and despondency, was thought to be caused by internal rottenness requiring
If the cause of melancholy is excessive and leads to worsening sadness or paralysis in some way related, then apply this same substance that purifies his mind according to what has been previously applied during division (or treatment). The text advises using a medicinal preparation believed to clear one's intellect if melancholy is too profound and the patient’s humors are described as moist. This suggests an ancient approach where balance restoration in terms of body fluids was essential for treating what we might interpret today as depression or excessive moodiness due to perceived bodily imbalances
Return the head of the patient's body to its position, and lift it downwards with gentle force so that whatever is placed there remains in place within the region of the head during feverish heat (headache). And apply cold compresses or a chilled cloth on top for additional relief.
The thigh is sixty degrees bent, and its tendon has been completely torn apart.

From the treatment of water flowing down within the bowels (the intestines). The translation suggests a medical context, possibly referring to an issue with fluid discharge in someone
When you declared the water flow in the intestines through the senses at division time (possibly referring to a medical examination or observation), it began and gives sustenance for mucus that cleanses from above, protecting everything within its humidity. The translation here implies an ancient understanding of how body fluids such as mucus are generated in response to certain stimuli—likely during the menstrual cycle based on contextual clues like "division time" and bodily secretions mentioned for maintenance ("sustenance"). It reflects a medieval medical perspective where observations were linked directly with care practices, emphasizing natural processes of fluid regulation within female physiology.
And washing it in water during the hot days (implying that certain conditions or seasons might influence bodily secretions). This sentence could refer to guidelines for maintaining hygiene, especially related
Then command the sick's head that causes pain and cauterize it at its warm location; also apply two types of caustic to those temples if there is water flow in both holes (ears or nostribus, based on interpretation), or one type for when fluid flows out from a single hole. The translation clarifies instructions likely meant as treatments within the context of medieval medicine where different materials like cauterizing substances are used under specific circumstances related to ear and nose secretions indicative of disease (possibly sinusitis). It suggests tailored therapeutic approaches for various symptoms observed in patients. This further illustrates how medical practitioners approached treatment using observational techniques, applying a combination or single type of caustic as appropriate based on the condition's presentation and location within the body during medieval times.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: "Insert all veins and arteries where now does the navel, which are our cautions, in that place on the altar of the temples.

Regarding wound healing of eyelids, this implies a gentle and precise application method using lancets to aid in the recovery process without causing further harm or disturb
When the patient's eyelid is affected by disease or moisture and requires treatment with a lancet, here it refers to using this particular lancing instrument on that specific eye (hinted at as 'lunar', which may imply relating to lunacy—though anachronistic today), the following method should be used:
If you, as a precautionary measure, burn that over the two foreheads with two small lances in all parts of it and stretch them out along the ridge lines (tympanic), this will lengthen their membranes. And according to the length of each cautery as per its surface area.

The translation of "Captol .xvii." into English, assuming it refers to a section in a medical text about the treatment (cauterization) for an abscess located near the tear duct ("lacrimal")
When you cauterize a fistula that has been discussed in the divisions of diseases, and do not administer your treatment accordingly, be aware that what you are doing next—the act of cauterization itself: order the malady to pause its course within one's body (possibly implying an internal fever or inflammation), keep a hand minister in between the throat spaces if such action is taken without agitation at these sensitive points.
Return your hand pressure over his body with hot oil or soft padding made of lint, on the skin of him.

Return the fistula if it is opened, and treat with salve and cleanse that which has been uncovered. If there is none (opened), then work that area and extract the poultice from it.
Here comes the sentence to translate: Return your hand over it with that which has been ignited for this purpose, so as not to disturb you or make your chest uneasy; and when placing it on the part of the nose wound's area, break open those caulters (the instruments used by doctors) gently.
So if the caustic entered into the mouth, be; and otherwise repeat the caustic once or twice until advised by professionals (doctors), leave it there for three days, then pause over that spot where the border is to send enclosed moisture-drying substances inside while it heals.
May it be that they have passed ten days and are not healed yet; then, pause over them with acute invasive medicine until the bone is discovered and reshaped as needed for their chest'supreme court (head of the region or body part).

With your own hands you contain them well to prevent the lead from reaching upwards towards their belly button (navel), and when pauses are placed over the opening in the fistula, allowing the molten lead therein to harden either within an album or water tank; thus fixing that which was previously leaky at its place.
If the fistula is healed by what we have done with cautery and care, well then; but if not, it'se necessary to administer air purity from nose (and potentially apply pressure) and reduce the fistula in its nasal location when it comes.

When cough and lung disease are caused by wet humors, there is no fever or chills, an ancient illness that requires two types of cauterization on the breastbone in areas where ribs and breasts meet; and other cauterizations at the site of the navel between two mammillaries; these cauterizations are done according to their form.
If you wish, your use of the pointed cautery is for those points that are called upon by pain in the joints (of bones), where this form comes beforehand at the point of such pains.

Some adjustments are made according to this count and for these reasons there are eight cauterizations (or brandings).
And place the pause above the points of cautery with salt, to stick the humors together and prevent any limb from being inflamed while comfortable.
If the dislocation occurs above and below, it hurts due to fluid accumulation; then apply caustic substances at muscles or joints with a cautery needle, whereby the joint is confirmed and humidity becomes reduced, thus curing the swelling.

Regarding the caulking of the wound (cankers). This line suggests a treatment procedure involving some form of sealing or
When you treat the wound of a canker (melsa), if you do not confine your treatment as has been described in division and care, then there are three ways to perform caulking properly—each one correct according to which figure is followed for those performed on fingers, figures that have preceded. Here, it's indicating the importance of following specific guidelicides or instructions when performing wound treatments such as cauterization; different methods exist depending on what has been established previously in medical texts (possibly including illustrative examples like finger-specific treatment). These three correct ways are likely detailed procedures that vary with the size and type of injury, referring to an old tradition where tailored approaches were used based on empirical knowledge accumulated over time. It implies a structured approach rather than arbitrary action in treating wounds or cankers (ulcers), aligning medical practice closely with established doctrines for healing by burning away diseased tissue, typically performed here as specified treatments involving cauterization using various tools and techniques. The mention of figures suggests illustrations that guide the practitioner through each specific method appropriate to different situations—a common
And among each caulking there is either a large round tool or small spoon-like object; the manner of performing the caulking itself corresponds to that which we perform on fingers, indicating standardized tools are used for treating wounds with cauterization techniques similar in practice and form—implying consistency across different healing methods. Here, there is reference both to specific shapes (large round tool or small spoon-like object) likely representing actual instruments employed by medieval physicians during treatment procedures like caulking.

Cautery of gout and joint pain:
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
Therefore, once gout is healed by the medicinal treatment and there are no more pains left untreated, apply the poultices accordingly to alleviate the discomfort.
When you are cauterizing that part of elimination in the circulation area between the foot and thigh, with special caution to avoid further use of cautery instruments.
And this is the form of such a pointed cautery:
If it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then use a pointed cautery for that purpose. If pain enters the joints or other connecting points, and these movements cause discomfort, then it is necessary to apply a caustic here at any of those three or four spots treated by this particular cauterization (often referred to as 'olive oil' in medicine).
If you need lancets for these lancets (which implies that additional instruments are required), then do not press your hand too much on the blade before using it now; just send to where the throat is, solely as needed.
If pain enters into both sides (of the body), then administers the tool we have mentioned earlier on this very page.
If the pain is only in the waist and hips occasionally, then it's called sourness; when this occurs, a needle pricks along the course of the flames (possibly referring to inflammation or rashes), puncturing those two lines.
If there are residual pains in the eyes, then a point is made on the circumference of each pupil and over the bridge of the nose;
If pain presses upon the joints or muscles daily within the hips or thigh bones, then it is necessary to cauterize all parts of their helpers (which may refer to various body systems affected by this condition).
And if there is a blockage in the bowels that does not leave even after good diet and medicine intake, then with this treatment using the same cautery instrument may be purged by God' extricating it.

In this case, apply cauterization within that specific circuit where small points have been made with a sharp instrument for promoting healing or treatment through the application of heat (cauterize). Following this procedure, ensure she rests there until it fulfills its role in maturation—this suggests waiting to see if her body'dictably completes processing.

In reference to "cauterization," this line from medieval medical texts likely pertains to the use of heat (
The translation into English would be: "Corrosion is movement in the limb; apply heat like dry wood burning on this thorny area." Here, they are describing how to cauterize or burn away corrosive matter from a part of the body using intense localized heat. The practice likely involved placing hot substances directly over affected areas for treatment
The English translation is: "So if there's a thorn in the place where you have applied cautery with an ignited small stick of wood and large ones as needed for that location containing the thorn." This sentence describes how to reapply heat (cauterization) using appropriate sizes or types of wooden sticks based on what is most suitable for treating a particular area affected by corrosion, which in this context means either pebbles used before cauterizing wounds with fire. It's an ancient practice where various materials were employed to control bleeding and clean up the site after
The English translation for this line is: "Cauterize that entire area where you have removed all the rust and do not cause any further harm." This suggests a comprehensive approach in which cautery was used to remove corrosion (likely referring herein metaphorically rather than literally) from an affected part of the body, with emphasis on preventing
The translation is: "Allow that for three days and pause over the cauterized sites; until both scars are entirely healed, and all rust has been removed." Here it refers not only to physical treatment but also implies a temporal aspect where restraint or observation after an initial intervention (in this case likely involving some form of external application) is important for achendo complete recovery. The reference seems focused on the process's gradual nature rather than immediate results, which aligns with historical approaches in medicine that often involved multiple stages and prolonged treatments to ensure a patient’

Before doing so, make sure there is no remaining water in the cautery needle; if any remains, use a pinch of sand from under the cauldron's rim and pour it into the top hole of the spout (the "razit del clau"), forcing out all remaining distilled water. Wait for only an hour after removing the moisture before rinsing that area again with your wet hand, as long as there are no signs of redness from contact irritation under the cautery's needle head (the "razitz sira erredicat").

When such an event occurs (catharsis), it leads to the exhaustion or 'exhausted flow' of these fluids within body cavities—the eyes ('les palpebras ulceradas') along with hairs from lur’s interior chamber indicate a serious condition possibly related to blockage and resultant overflow. The deep, piercing pain that emerges is not solely due to fresh humoral entry but originates 'from motas venas de las partidas dedintz', implying the problems have their source in decisions made at crucial junctures within one'
And the best cure in these situations involves directing the malady's own spirit into its forehead, and inserting a small incision at that spot on the skull—once you do this, bone will become exposed (and as it enters from left temple to right temple through your finger inserted there; furthermore inside of those temples where teeth reside which are used for chewing) — once these orifices have been created and opened with a pointed instrument [Note: The text outlines an esoteric treatment approach, possibly rooted in medieval alchemy. A 'directing' is said to be performed on the malady’s spirit (or vital essence), involving opening small cuts ('fissuras') within specific parts of the skull associated with chewing and mastication—this could refer physically or symbolically, where a pointed tool would create incisions. The exposure mentioned may allude to removing bone that might be blocking these natural pathways for fluids (humoral flow) related to dentition ('maugutz deves la mastigacio'). It suggests an understanding of the body’s internal structures and possibly links oral health with systemic issues. The mentioning of 'temples' could

When the boil has decreased and begins to discharge flesh from its navel (the core of swelling), take care that the medicinal mixture applied there does not further cause such excretion, just as when you apply flour made of wheat two parts and lime four parts mixed together, with which you both cast plasters and administer them in these lesions related to flesh birth.

For treatment of what causes pain in the hands, here it goes: Addressing the cause that brings discomfort to the hands during healing or care procedures.
The entire cause of the pain in the hands can be attributed to one of four species: it may either be related mineral (such as iron or slate) and stones resembling them like flint; alternatively, if derived from plant matter such as chickpeas or broad beans. Moreover, causes could also stem from liquids akin in appearance – water mixed with vinegar and the plants themselves which bear semblance to these elements - along with any living creature present may contribute to it:
So when blood appears in the ear or another cause seems similar to those reasons that do not fit into (or resolve) within the ear, and if you see blood from it, this may indicate some leakage of oil or hemorrhage causes, then administer its removal, and make them cough up secretion, allowing their passage.

If it is a case of obstruction (forum getada), then he does so; but if not, administer the extraction from within with gentle and careful means using only a few small pincers or tweezers at most twice.
So if there is not an opening (for treatment), then use an artemisia needle and insert its extremity into the area of the ulcer, sealing it with wax and oiled oil to ensure that only the needle protrudes without any swelling. When they have climbed up with strength and fatigue that we've recorded today,

Herein is provided relief not only for this particular cause but also for all other causes present within that hole.
When pus is generated in the artery during extraction, and you do not comfort your treatment of that water which we have mentioned before in terms of separation and transportation flows, pay attention to the vein where it has appeared.

When in the patient's eyes, naturally and anciently (the hair adjusting by nature over time), we are here with these manners of illnesses as persistent tears and moisture on palms and inside where this cause leads to damage from touching or rubbing their eyes. Treatment is sought through four methods:
So that you stop the flow of bile in the liver at its navel; take your left hand and place it over the eye socket (forehead), if converted then look straight ahead - otherwise insert a needle into the part where pus was secreted from under the eyelid, push the needle through that point downward towards the hair follicles beneath – this is within the boundary of the lid area.

Based on your request and considering that "alconati" could be a term related
This illness, which is called "alconati," according to the manuscript, isn't simply any sickness but one that resembles water and flowing away from oneself—likely referring to conditions related to an imbalance of bodily fluids or humors. In medieval medicine, such a description could be understood as symptoms reminiscent of sweating profusely (suggestive of the body
In this context of "alconati," the act that might contribute to its onset involves sitting with water dripping from a device and placing one's head in their hands while observing where the illness is approaching, drying oneself over those areas if necessary before it reaches them. The manuscript suggests managing or preventing this condition by ensuring no moisture remains ('and thus dries himself') so that light can pass through (indicating a need for clear skies) and not let the water flow further into different body parts, which might exacerbate symptoms related to imbalance of humors. Essentially, it advises caution in handling situations where fluid dynamics could influence health negatively by either stagnation or uncontrolled movement within the body's compartments.
If it does not fall into its place (meaning if a body part such as an organ has prolapsed or herniated), you understand that water is involved (possibly referring to

Concerning the care of flesh, it has nothing to do with the nose.
When various swellings arise from the nose due to stones in the pit of Mars or polyps on the pye, this illness is called Polypus, similar to that fish represented by those pyes. From him it is red and blackened flesh, such that from it the yellow skin does not possess this dark hue.

If the moisture does not penetrate secondarily (suggesting a lack of further sinus infection progression), you understand that there is no flesh remaining within those nasal passages where absorption has failed to occur; this indicates an effective clearance without abscess formation.
Therefore you must intervene faithfully at the source from where it originates; for your nose is clear of obstruction, and within those passages breathing occurs naturally—pause between each use to assess nasal secretions' volume or mucus quantity, then employ medical intervention such as irrigation with saline (nasal wash) using a suitable instrument provided by healthcare professionals. Moreover, inserting an end of the device into nosebleed source and alternate nostril pressure technique could be helpful depending on identified cause leading to discomfort—be it hypertension or sinus issues among others necessitating this action for alleviation purposes in line with medical guidance without delaying necessary treatment steps as per standard practice.
When they exude odor from the nostrils and sit upon their nose as if commanded by external forces—these practices commonly observed among students in schools—leading to discomfort; this action is not beneficial but rather causes unnecessary attention or embarrassment, which could potentially harm one's social standing. This suggests an understanding of how certain cultural beliefs about breath and health can influence behavior negatively if misinterpreted as a medical need when it might simply be excessive concern over perceived bad odors during times like these within academic institutions where such concerns may arise but should not dictate or affect one's social interactions unduly.

The provided text appears to be a medieval medical treatise written in Old French, which is historically influenced by Latin and shares some vocabul extraterritorial influence on Italian, Spanish, and other Romance languages. Here's the line-by-line translation into
When you must extract the tooth that has been cracked for any reason; wait until a spot at the gum line is numb—usually this takes about one or two hours as long as it needs time for relief of forces. Afterward, apply an external balm (or gauze) from which pieces have been removed where they are assembled to resemble a crow's beak; with forceps:
These excisions of theirs are cut with a knife or scalpel.
If you do not obey my instruction with these forceps or tenacities, then bend over the wound and remove all flesh from where I have cut it using this small instrument as a lever.
And if it is a short but large extremity that does not break down, there is no need for concern.
Therefore, if for the sake of treatment it is necessary to open a fistula (the term here possibly referring to an abnormal passage or tract in the body), then do so; otherwise, help yourself with these other instruments whose forms include at least one thickened part like that of the first instrument: which has a triangular shape outside its cavity where there may be some bulk.
The form of the second tool is that it's trilaterated and has a subtle appendage.
And now you will assist with this tool which has two levers as follows: and other instruments that we prepared with the cutting of teeth are used herein. These tools were made just now and their form is thus:

When it comes to the care of teeth, other aspects are also important beyond just this statement:
When teeth protrude naturally in their respective parts of the body, especially on women'thy breasts (and sometimes also at men), and it is not possible to cut them off or ligate any part thereof with thread from that person alone, then consider where you will make an incision; this may be a section separate from other teeth, which takes shape in accordance with the form of this specific instrument—a knife made of Indian steel sharpened beyond ordinary blades. It resembles pork meat and is used for cutting.
And your intellect is with the one by which you examine that issue for several days to ensure it's not related to other teeth.
If there is an excessive opening of blood (hemorrhage), then apply that same lime made from Indian steel to the wound.

Silver hardens hereafter within a few days, whereas gold remains steadfast without time changing its firmness.

This suggests a hands-on approach by medical practitioners of the time possibly aimed at treating or understanding issues related to voice production.

If indigestion leads out belch gas or phlegm from the mouth due to poor diet, like rancid meatloaf and dried fish bones—or if one uses sea sponge lint soaked in lemon juice for cleansing —it may bring forth these issues into visibility. Hold fast at this juncture (the site of pain), apply pressure to expel the material that has been evacuated, whereupon it will emerge." Herein lies an early understanding within medical practice: observation and response strategies are essential in identifying and addressing symptoms—a belief suggesting a rudimentary form of diagnostic reasoning. The practitioner advocates for induced vomiting to clear the stomach contents, which may contain factors contributing to joint pain (possibly due to systemic inflammation or other internal issues). In this case, they also mention using sea sponge lint with lemon juice—a remedy possibly reflecting their attempt at balancing humoral theories of the body. When symptoms such as these are addressed through vomiting and subsequent application of pressure to a specific area for cleansing (potentially indicating an early form of cathartic or detoxifying practice), it indicates knowledge that removing certain substances can alleviate discomfort, illustrating some foundational aspects of the body's Here comes the first source sentence to translate:

Here various punctures and cuts are made through their bodies by hands of this profession; one for the purpose of inserting apes, which they call instruments, due to moisture within them.
The second sign is that it occurs in the places where pains are located, and if an abscess appears on the head, it's different from an abscess at random locations elsewhere; each one of them requires operation.
May some of these worms, which are not pierced but rather indicators of disease in those areas and their complementary regions, be used for treatment purposes.
So other splices that are dislocated when they are crossed and not matured according to their complement, like those naturally located at joints; if such a splice enters the body cavity through this entrance where it is already present, corrupting the ligaments or nerves of that joint, causing pain in that limb. If it perforates within its ripened state towards the main member, delays may result with damage to said primary organ; if it's located at the navel and not matured, pierce it then before full digestion is complete—that which belongs there, elongating parts of the intestines downward, leading to a fistula or pain within its term that cannot be cured. May you know the time of the incision for the abscess, and so it is when it ripens.
E understand that it matures when the pain yields and fever subsides, and reduce the speechiness and heartbeat, and strengthen the head of abscessation, as well as other pains.

May those who cannot bear with surface appendices (likely referring to protruding veins or varicose growths), when pierced by the implement of a shallow puncture only on the surface, should be treated accordingly.
When the abscess is large and has collected pus already, do not attempt to extract all of it at once; take out one portion from that place today, and fix the abscess within another part by tomorrow with larger extractions as necessary according to progression.
Mostly if the malady is due to melancholy humor or old age, sickness comes into being and he departs from life; then you treat it with operations.
Guard with great care and place your drill where you pierce these thorns, making sure to avoid infections; consider whether the worm of the thorn is few or flat—administer accordingly as directed by ancient remedies or contemporary methods; if the thorn is large and there are fissures from the hole that come together at any disruption we encounter on our way.
If in the abscess it has detached part of the colon or you have hollowed out that area along its circuit, then cover it with woolen cloths and bandages as when dressing a fresh injury; keep moisture within during daylight hours (presumably indicating some form of treatment time), strengthening what'dictor inside so well.
If you exacerbate the flow of bile during your operation, then administer cold water and compress these areas where the movement of bile is directed; apply pressure there to control it.

If it is winter time, and the ulcer location corresponds to a place of muscle weakness, then cover them with powder made from vine leaves and oil, stopping these over the locations.
If it is summer and the locations are carnivorous, then when you pause at the beginning in water and oil, as we have said beforehand, do so with these liquids entering until the day becomes clear (i.dict that during a hot season), and cover what has been ulcerated and cleanse away whatever remains therein for its cure which it requires within itself when entered into on this account of healing.

If it is due to the escape of the intestine, then after noting that which we have discussed previously about what they had inside (referring back to their symptoms), and considering how urgently this matter should be addressed, return them; for once returned like this, honor must shine upon him/her as a reward. Moreover: wash the patient with water forcefully while vigorously massaging.
May it be for moisture, the lion is not hidden when you apply your hand to it, nor does it become tightened or inflamed.
If it is for sanction, then at these times you appear with an iron chelation appearing blackened by the descending of sinne (or negative mood).
If it is for meat nothingness (meaning perhaps lack or deficiency of flesh), then the abscess is severe and thickened, and remains according to a certain amount/size.
If it is due to windiness, then its touch (with instruments) becomes a lion.
And if the operation in question is due to an ailment of the navel, or vein, or because of movement; consider that which you must forbear as treatment for it, since there may be fear and anxiety similar to what I have taught in the Capitol where I outlined methods using cautery and venesection.
If the prominency of the navel is due to the hernia or sling, then command that which holds onto it tightly and keep extended; also assign a guard for throughout the entire umbilicus circuit, placing them between your thighs above its position where you have previously placed pressure with your hands. Also surround this area within the space of the spinal column in the navel'suposed location that was already marked by applying force through these guards; and extend outwards to parts below as much larger hernia fragments, while also keeping control over them using a strong thread or sinew tied at one end.
Here comes the translation for each line:
If you have torn the fabric (referring possibly to a ligament or sinew), take that one for it; and inspect their excesses in him/it.
If it is contrary to your lance or vein, surround that area, and return to your operation; take two needles and insert them into those fields of strength you have pierced through the abscess in the wrist joints, causing penetration, which you hold firmly with four parts on each pin.
If you wish to do so, place the needles and insert them where it pierces the extended flesh, then inscribe that part when subtlety approaches and inserts itself there; take care of this with water from within those linens which cure what is inside.
If the navel's prominence is of flesh or due to moisture, then cover it with what you have taken and removed dirt from there, which contains moisture in that place, and take care for whatever covers it and helps conserve moisture.

In the division of skull parts and how they are treated with medicine, to prevent healing from becoming a wound; we have said that the head (or brain) is produced by its own treatment and caution in applying these medicines so as not to cause ulceration. Here it indicates an understanding during medieval times about careful application of treatments for skull or cranial issues, with special attention paid to avoid exac0dy due to potential damage from the very remedies intended for healing (indicating a proto-concept similar to 'treat at your own risk').

Non-malignant but suspend with subtlety and withdraw it completely within which world—this suggests careful management of the condition without invasive procedures when possible: delicately restraining or removing a mass that pertains to this area; apply ointment made from Egyptian linseed over where that has been placed, ensuring complete submersion in said oil during treatment. Here "non-malignant" indicates benign nature of the condition while maintaining patient comfort and using traditional remedies:

After removing these foreign bodies and resolving adhesions caused by the body's attempt at healing, there should be no need (or desire) for circumcision ('circumcize').

The provided text is not directly translatable as it seems to be fragmentary or symbol
This phrase appears to originate from a religious, cultural, or medical context and translates roughly as follows: "The purification of children and the care for those who have undergone circumcision." Here's how this might be understood in more modern English prose
The provided text seems to address the reasons and considerations behind circumcision from an ancient or religious perspective:
Therefore, they say that ancient people did not perform circumcision among free men who do not use it in their laws and only have acquired this for experimentation. This causes them to abandon the greater part of craftsmen and barbers using circumcision and mundification with new razors and tweezers; instead, they employ leather straps and wax from the hair (nail).
E you have already tried all these methods and found them worse than simple execution with the knife or thread that in embroidery, some threads escape below (under) the waistband, others from between two tunics at the penis area, tightening the thong there quickly; thus forcing other insights into consciousness free of pain.

The sentence translates to: "Regarding the retained urine in the bladder due to obstruction by stones or kidney issues, similar symptoms are present where patients describe their abdominal pains." Here is an expanded translation into modern English and explanation of each part for clarity:
If there is not dissolution of the fluid we have mentioned thus far as vehemently causing pain on the waist, then seek to remove it with a tool that you call for this purpose—this instrument resembles both silver and subtle lion in form: It is like an extremely thin needle or penisule (a slender rod), having very fine serrations at its tip similar to those of the palm and middle finger.

The text appears as if written by someone knowledgeable about medieval medicine practices surrounding conditions like hernias or issues related to bowel obstruction where enemas might be used both diagnostically
When acute inflammation or abscess occurs in the bladder, and/dictorall congestion is present therein, indicating a blockage perhaps due to a urinary stone (urolithiasis), you must extract water and medicinal preparations through that instrument. This method represents:
sino que in the exterior of it is silent, so it is closed. And in that situation three troubles arise from one division, happening twice.
In the commensal is where it settles, and that amount which comes after, its addition to this place; when any cause draws from these humors, they are drawn back here, and when expelled, more of them return, as happens in naval battles, causing naphtha (a type of flammable liquid used for burning fires) to come forth.

We already have this in the division of spices and pottery crafting for medicine-making; distinguishing between stones formed by rivers (fluvial) and those from bladders/bottles (vesicular), as well as their characteristics." Here, it seems that there was an early understanding or practice concerning different types of stone suitable for medical use – some found in river beds ("formeixos"), while others might have been obtained by processing materials like pottery. The mention suggests a historical context where both natural resources and human crafting played roles in medicinal preparations, possibly related to the development of various therapeutic

And herein at present court is held." The original text appears to describe an observation or belief regarding urolithiasis (urinary stones), which are commonly found in children ("enfants") according to the speaker's claim, and can lead to urination outside of normal pathways – "motas veguadas pen" suggests moistened finger movements used for cleaning. The phrase implies that these medical conditions were not only recognized but also socially significant enough to be discussed at a formal assembly or forum ("foro le cul"). This text likely reflects historical understandings and approaches towards urinary stones, including their possible impact on public health due in part to the gatherings for discussion mentioned.
And it is the cleaning of children within that age who have achieved four years, and care for them in their bodies is difficult. May also in young people move through these waters.

If the stone is in one place, then you will lead it to the bladder'dictum (mouth/opening of), and press upon that area; and apply a small amount hereof directly on the spot—seemingly as pills for diseases.

If in the soil there is an abscess that hardens and rots away, similar to how one's bladder becomes frozen with urine inside it (and this fluid cannot exit because of its presence), then insert a catheter into the ground where you find such sore, provided if Roman causes more damage not just to the bladder but also leading to decay.
Here return the poultice with water and salt, which is opposed to all specialities and that kind of fluid necessary for healing within it must be applied therein.
When it is time for all of your treatments and adjustments, which are paused on the location where they should be applied to you (between both thighs), do as follows:
If the stone is small and located in the liver's flesh, it remains therein, and injection of urine is prohibited; otherwise healing occurs as a result of this treatment, which has already penetrated to some extent into this section, accused today of deficiency due to its lack. You have now drained out the fluid (urine), and you hold in your hand an iron knife for puncturing, which is the form/shape used here:
From outside the cavity, gout is located in a pipe (likely referring metaphorically or outdatedly to an organ such as bladder).
And apply pressure firmly, and place it on that stone above the bladder urgently to prevent its return there.
In this translation into English line by line from the medieval medical treatise written in an archaic language: Revolve the cautery in your hand slowly and carefully until you make a hole through it, so that as one enters this other part of the body, urine is expelled immediately.
Return your hand over the substance that is being broken off from the bone fragment below where it has been fractured, which acts as a chasm and exits through the opening herein for waste (urine), and thus the humpiness heals.
If this treatment is not equipped for any reason that prevents its use hereby, then apply a finger or two under the breastbone (pectoral), and another over it. When applying pressure over the stone in that joint between bones, Return (or bring back) that outwardly. Return those two things (the ligament and scabbard), which is formed in the ground or soil.

Translated into English, "La cuarta és quel lloc hi sis el femeixn sobre l'espiga o les espiges i loncs; com la proximitat dóna recel per que oblieries de concurrir en una secció precedent." This suggests that the location of a woman (perhaps metaphorically) over or about stones in her body is long from where there's actual pain, implying it’s not actually felt. Therefore:
If it is necessary to induce urination (to relieve the symptoms), then take hold of a woman'dictum and little force will be required.
Might you lack that which is required, seek the quartermaster' extricating and refining tools or present a woman matron adequately skilled in women’s health matters from this division of expertise herein described.
Thus apply that present to him and command him to press all the fluid you send, from examination of the belly upward until he enters your mouth with his tongue desiring it; this causes because if the woman is pregnant, cover what she puts in her private parts so desire.
Therefore if you clench that one, then command it so that it inserts into that very same place.
If it is not urgent, the matron directs that her duty be inserted into the cavity of the sick and placed over the belly (bladder), so she places her left hand on the bladder to stop its movement, and provides a good compress for relief.
Then, if you have caused it to swell from the bladder'dictum within its parts until reaching the hollows of the thighs whereby through comes at will; this suggests that fluid accumulation due to blockage or excessive secretion is causing an overflow into these areas. It appears doctors in medieval times were familiar with conditions like urinary retention and possibly understood how swelling could affect various body parts, noting when it occurs specifically within the pelvic region contributing to discomfort around the hips/thighs area.

In the treatment of this illness there is concern for what has already been remembered, indicating that past experiences or symptoms related to the condition may inform current medical practice and decisions regarding care.

Concerning the treatment of intestinal protrusion (hernia).
The occurrence of this hernia is due to a section that extends over the stomach from among the intestines' twists within the belly womb, causing some bubbles (or pus) from that tear to ascend towards those bubbles.
This rupture is either of the cistern or due to expulsion from within it, and these organs are softened by motions such as: impact, pressure, noise, elevation of any severe cause, or mimicry.
When the humoral fluid (Aquafluid) is extingubed through coughing, it decays slowly over long periods without purification, and becomes putrid within the lungs whereby you will insert a balloon to inflate it.
When the patient'thy name is reached at this section of the cistern (a segment or compartment in medieval medical terminology), and violent pain occurs upon entry; various symptoms appear as if it were apostema, caused by intestinal matter within the budel, affecting different parts above its normal position.
And some times a portion of the intestine protrudes through the hole in the abdominal wall (hernia), which is called an enterolith or intestinal stone.
Some days it is pain caused by winds and some times they run into the opened intestine or hernia therein lodged; here it stays due to great dysfunction of the bowels, and sometimes severe misery ensues when pressed upon.
In treating this illness' spices we have fear, so that it may not be lost in them here.
The command for the malady of that operation is to order the humors (body fluids) controlled by your patient so they draw back the intestine into its cavity if he obeys his return journey; and have him sit with their buttocks between their legs, lifting up their cushions.
Return the colon (the intestine) to its cavity, and hold your hand over the area where you intend to induce vomiting using these two lips of this section; extend it throughout the length of the colon entirely.
If it is at all possible that from that hole more can come out, then consider its quantity accordingly.
Return that corporeal matter the way it was before you applied force to those parts of the coda (testicles), where a white hardened substance has been discovered after application of pressure.

The term "de hernia ventosa" refers to a hydrocele
In this case of the water-filled (hydrocele) hernia, it has not yet been observed that one can recover from it on their own through simple means or folk remedies alone ("am fer" being an older term for to perform a surgical procedure).
The first days suggested for treating the hernia which one might have (possibly referring to an inguinal or ventral hernia), where you should lay your vessels upon that part gently; and dry them up at their place, introducing moisture there only when necessary—when these are applied. This implies a rudimentary understanding of managing the condition possibly with minimal intervention focused on maintaining cleanliness ("entro que caian les vayssels" suggests placing items such as dressings or poultices). It's important to note that this translation is an approximation, given the archaic language and medical practices described. Modern readers may need further clarification for a full understanding of these ancient methods which align closely with traditional home remedies rather than current surgical standards.

Additionally, there is mention of snail-like contraction ('encolectile'), which could be referring either metaphorically to some part of physiological process The sentence further discusses the various illnesses and types of worms causing these conditions (possibly parasitic infections) along with their associated symptoms ("senhal" may refer to a specific sign or manifestation). It also refers to treatments for these issues during division, which could relate either historically significant medical practices used by healers at the time. The term "div
Here the speaker is discussing a treatment method within this tractate concerning wounds (possibly referring to various types of skin lesions or ulcers). The focus seems to be on interventional methods for these conditions, particularly when they are severe and require action ('corticar' suggests some form of cauterization — using heat, electricity, etc., likely here as a method to stop bleeding by burning tissue edges where the wound is located). The line also asks about which specific instrument ("ferra" could refer) would be used for this type of intervention.

The provided sentence is highly complex and appears to be a blend of medieval Latin with modern English elements which makes it quite challenging for translation without further context or clarification on certain terms ("enbrios bius," "enfantament natural"). However, I'll attempt an interpretation:
So when you lift those limbs, make sure that the patient's belly is compressed so that their embryo does not emerge while they are on their back, and give them a second round of good cleansing for these excesses above.
Might that which is not natural and untreatable occurs when the illness settles upon one's feet and body above the head, with hands on top of it; or atop its chest/belly, whereby turning over onto their spine—and resembling figures they cannot treat.

If the more painful parts of the belly are exposed during consumption (perhaps indicating when someone vomits), it is necessary that you reduce those areas gently over time. May if she does not obey inside the body, then place her on top of a cushion and lift up their feet from the ground; and secure the cushion onto the earth; ensure that the woman remains upright due to contraction.
If the mass is not torn and lies flat on itself, then you will investigate those areas and remove it from the body with a drape or cloth piece equally cut out to fit that area; thus they are freed of its bondage (from constipation).
When the belly is on their feet, and you push them downwards, then turn the abdomen small (contract it), and press that part onto themselves (apply pressure to reduce distension). Also have one person place a cushion under those limbs [feet], another servant places something over or between leg joints/knees of this individual; yet again, someone else is placed on the chest holding their hands.
When he is inside the thighs, then you command him to express himself, and make that opening as if by God' extrication (desire).
If it is not possible to open the water that we have recommended (presumably referring back to some treatment method), then return the fetus gradually within where pauses are taken at each subsequent natural figure, and only when this can be done without causing pain due to bleeding.
If it is prohibited to take all the humors that we have retempered here, then take muslin and dissolved gum, beat them thoroughly in the mortar for good percussion, apply lines of this mixture on the woman' extricated fluids (pus from her abdomen), When you apply that medicine internally into your body, so as to achieve relief from indigestion.
When parts of it are lengthened (expanded), then apply mimosa and compress that area for the patient. When you place the patient under fumigation for an hour, then make them sit on a stool and hold their tongue extended outwards with one hand while pulling it down towards the lower abdomen using another hand; afterward lift away from that compression until they feel better.
Eye examination is generally performed by one of them (hands). When reduction is on her body, if you cannot reduce it yourself, lift the woman and carry her away to apply pressure elsewhere.
If it is not possible to move them, place the leg on the bed, and forcefully compress their thighs together for impact, and administer the ligaments that you have previously used and recommended with pus.
If childbirth has occurred, then apply that same cautery on the breech (buttocks), and study how to reduce the swelling, forming the second natural shape of the fetus, and cause the female body to compress so it enters through the birth canal.
Eye examination over the expanded belly and face of him are on his chest, two positions from above his navel. When the matron holds her hand over the fetus and gradually turns it little by little, this makes things easier.

When those are multiplied and a second one is added for separation by means of cups (probably indicating some form of medical treatment), they guide the intestines into their cavity at each examination visit, which serves as natural laziness aid; additionally, several visits serve to remove impurities naturally.
If it is difficult for them to perform their childbearing and they come upon us with matters concerning non-natural figures, then attend to those concerns as we have discussed.

Moreover, take care for overall restoration of the entire tissue inside the wound; if dressings applied above are not consolidated due to urine leakage from an untreated hernia into a cavity (the area where excess fluid collects), then it leaks and causes fistula formation in the rectal region, requiring immediate treatment of associated with lithotripsy for stone removal.

Of healing diseases/illnesses.
You are already in the division of healing for those illnesses that were suitable to free them, and you declare herein the cure according to their humors and remedies as agreed upon.
Therefore, it is said that the pains are diverse depending on where they occur and how they manifest themselves when applied with a scalpel (or knife).
Here come the causes for which movements are pains, such as humors accumulating in pores of skin like black dirt or cobblestlaus, percussion with a stone ball, fist or sword, or similar actions relating to these movement-caused pain origins.
May the humors that are present in the body' extran locations also be like dirt on the head, or neck (the col), chest (the breastbone), abdomen (belly), waist (around the navel area) and limbs; they seem to resemble those within the members.
Even when considering some diseases for treatment, they pause that thought and reason over other illnesses as well.
When simple diseases are consumed and memory of the complex ones comes to feasting time in third capital,
So when it aches in the head without a fracture (and only as simple pressure or swelling due to an abscess that is being drained with cautery), then you press and massage the occiput at once, do not delay; extract from there according to the quantity of its discharge if no cause prevents further incision, mainly when it's a small amount (of pus) coming out.
When it is necessary for the contraction of a painful division, and watch over the malady in its growth and movement as well as heavy foods:
If from moderation there is none imposed upon you concerning food, then it will be lessened in quantity and not approach meat or drinks.
When applying poultice if you cause an abscess to burst open with caution hot oil or wine in which it is precisely placed (stitched).
If you are sure of the catastropthy and it's recently happened without any change in weather affecting that which I recommend for small pills, then rest upon the bedding wherein said remedy is to be applied.
If the air has changed and become damp, place your hand inside where you have applied liniment until it is healed.
If the child is large or born through an opening and does not have their lips properly closed for suckling (breastfeeding), then adjust those areas with stitches as recommended by a doctor'dict:
May it be discovered that the child has cracked bone and skin but is not restrained by you except for a small carrier; then attend to that which was found and care for the injured as medicine requires: capsules of garlic and forms reminiscent of them, put together while in place.

May you have a bone break in your body; and it is small, so extract it with movement.
Here is a line-by-line translation of the medieval medical treatise into English:
Of the humors of the colon (or abdomen). This line refers to what medieval phys
When the offspring (or bowels) become sour in the colon (abdomen), there is no difference in medicine between them and when they are simple; this implies that a common approach should be used for treating both conditions, regardless of whether the issue with the child's digestive system is complex or straightforward. The text suggests that medieval doctors saw these situations as not requiring distinct
When the nerves of the colon or arteries are involved (meaning inflammation possibly affects nervous and blood vessels in addition to bowels), it is considered as such, but not an entanglement; rather this requires avoidance of any treatment that would cause violent stoppage. They should be attended with care akin to handling jewelry or delicate items—this means gentle attention must be given so the nerves and vessels are neither damaged further nor compressed by treatments, much like how one might handle precious stones (jewels) that need careful consideration not to break. The sentence advises caution in treatment approach when nervous system components such as blood or nerve supply may also be implicated due to the sourness of intestinal issues—emphasizing gentle handling and avoidance of potentially aggressive interventions There is never a pause in the flow of any impurity that causes general weakness and constant disturbance to the brain—this substance affects nerves throughout all parts of the body; hereby it spread from head to every part, acting as if being poured out into each member. The passage underscubs the notion that a certain 'impure' material (potentially waste or pathological matter) irritatingly impacting one’s nervous system can cause widespread symptoms affecting brain function
If the healer needs to use folk remedies for treatment, apply some water poultice either scented or unscented, and warm stones during washing with this water along with other minerals according to this methodology; also anoint thirsty mucus.
If the child is large, then administer stitches or close their lips together, and pay special care to ensure that it gets healed within here (in this place).
If there is depth or softness in the lower abdomen that should be probed, then it can also penetrate into this place with a pointed tool called diagnostic needle (depremae).
If in the patient there is an incision of a blood vessel and they have managed to cause bleeding (flux de sang), then separate or dry out that wound if necessary by applying cautery.
May you have already fixed the vertebrae of the back or all, and thus saved the veins in the neck—do not touch that; adjust your lips around the spinal column with sutures as part of its natural form, tighten it for proper alignment, leave it there during cool days; apply oil to those areas where fixation is required so healing can occur.
May if the child already has pain in their bones before healing begins, then you will strike that area; and where there are fragments of bone present within them, extract all such pieces from it with your tool. And if this is not possible for you at home, let water enter so as to encourage absorption by the child'thy body (which they call pus), separating out any infection along the way and allowing its exit.
If it is a fresh lump then grind this powder over that which has been recommended for you. If in the patient there is an abscess (rupture), then treat that which recalls it herein within your own castle/headquarters.
If it is a sound of lance or cottle and depths are heard at times, sometimes the wind ascends when the patient's bowels enter (indicating possible intestinal issues), then consider also that the earthly body may be moving with death; know well that the earthling flesh will perish.
If in the patient there is no depth and if phlegm has been recently removed from their body cavity, then you pause in that same hole of the first hour after cleaning up, without stretching it so that the wound does not remain deep inside the body cavity and return to the heart, possibly stopping bleeding by applying a linen dressing thereafter. Pause throughout the day until further notice.
If the ointment is not at your disposal, then rest in the bed of water caught by creatures for that which sucks up moisture; and let gout disease sleep on top of this water so that its excess liquid can run off within you where it has been adjusted.
If already three days have passed without pain in the belly (or less), and if there are other good medicines available, then use them as you know best; thus healing takes place with care for this patient's calves and any additional cures inside while they recover.
May it be that the healing of him/her is possible, and as long as they are bound up, you know that an abscess has formed; therefore attend to this with your care.
If the cause is a wound from an opening or tearing of space and it's simple on the surface of the skin or back, then treat that with either water (if large) applied before suturing, or powder if small.
If there is pain before the mouth and if those teeth are separated (i.thyroid or affected dentures), then use forceps to extract them now. If they are not separated, then let them be released that the vermin may exit from them; their removal is facilitated this way.

And you recommend that each one of us should expose ourselves and declare our conditions.
So when the child is small and has some cause for the intestine being distended, it' extrication becomes difficult; either because of their diminutive size as we discussed beforehand or if the intestine swells due to cold air:
And when the fluid comes in, then bend over that which you submerge a moistened linen alone or squish it while squeezing into water and with fennel seeds, coriander, pepper, and ointments on them inside where inflammation is resolved.
And when there are some evacuations in which water has been taken into the body and it is better than letting urine alone for the resolution of inflammation.
And when the inflammation is resolved, then you moisten the intestine in the water where it has been swolthy and unwell; this way, they are pulled out of their belly with a little cause.
May it be that the interior is released from this treatment, then divide (correct) the separation into small parts with an instrument wherein are engraved thorns/spikes.
The initial text is an attempt at translating medical terminology from Middle Aged Latin-influenced language into English:
From the tool, its form is seen here:
One sharp turn of it, and the other not acute, as well as its subtlety—it is neither about the subtlety of bone (spine) but rather has a blunt end.
So when the patient' extruded and comes out of the intestine, it is best that its reduction follows the shape naturally dictated by the body itself if at all possible within this place/location, which would be better for them.
When the disruption is wide and it occurs in the lower abdomen, then you make sure that your hand lies under his thighs (and presses down), and place cushions on their chest/back; if it's below the belly area, put pressure on their head with a pillow or similar object.

And when you ease up in large pains and migrating pains,
In small pains, pause what you have prepared for it, and assign your servant to be between your five fingers pressed down, which holds the entire disruption at its place in the palm of one' extrication hand; also align from that point towards where a stitch may already exist or might need to be sewn.

When you have caused that entrance there, then cause another entrance in the extreme end of each section from where it originated to where it ended; and let the cavity within this instrument enter through the other extreme portion of those sections, which holds your hands.
When the essence permeates that which you have caused to enter, it enters at the tip of your finger where all else has entered into its cavity within him therein.
Here begins the treatment at this side of the patient, and applies it to that extremity which is on the other side from here in Latin, and pushes backward into that cleft where the needle was previously inserted, reaching there again with such a one as has come for you. Then extracts outwards through said fissure the same used earlier by this hand of yours; and withdrawing it within its socket (the hip), brings along also to reach up towards the other extremity on that side wherein we have made an incision, taking what is inside there with our hands:
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
The sum of this suture technique is that you sew the skin with a thread on which you have already cut and placed hairs, so that you stitch along the part of the extremity of the tailbone, leaving only one stitch while placing the other until it's completed.

You make it penetrate inside those same sutures where they have sewn together your chest wall (likely referring to a surgical procedure involving the thoracic cavity or sternum area).
E when there is a disturbance at the belly'dict location, it becomes more difficult to sew here than in other parts of the abdomen.
The art of medicine for sickness is judgment among other illnesses.
The cause is when you continue the treatment of fresh blood from their sanctum nearby as it changes that location, and return the intestine or hernia back to its cavity; after doing so, pause over that skin tissue with caution.
If the air has altered the humidity, then rest on that spot where you are currently inside to make hard and heavy pads for the fields; secure them firmly with stitches and observation as if it were the care of other diseases within which one is healed.

Or if the painful site itself can be numbed with anesthesia; or when you're weakened due to age (frailty), or during episodes of intense heat and inflammation:

Here is the line-by extralinguistic translation:
Nature always adjusts and strengthens over the broken bones of any part caused by some sort similar to gluten in which that thickening occurs inside where they are gathered together with their team, within whose body venom comes from strong digestion and firmness; you may not forbid them performing their work.

And remember all types of bone breakage, separated in their own section within the book.
Motion of different types within itself can be a bone breakage (translation based on contextual understanding and educated guesses, as this text is fictional in They are various types of bone breakages within themselves; some can be arch-shaped fractures that occur in the stars (metaphorically speaking); and others depend on the length of the bone: these include fractures at the shoulder blade/clavicle, pelvic girdle issues both arising internally or externally, as well as finger fractures. Additionally, there are small cracks in the spine (vertebrae), broken and dislocated shoulders, similar to how one might suffer a break when preparing for writing – metap each of these could represent various forms of bone damage they recognize based on their treatment or observation methods.
The entire specialty is in handling pain specifically as it arises again in their locations.
Motive for bone breakage. For this translation into English I will break down the text line by line while attempting to maintain as much of the original meaning and context:
And when there is no apparent twisting or bone break upon touching the joint and causing pain in the thighs and hips without inflicting great harm, then it is not a fracture here.

And the quality of a quiet limb is that which I recommend; thus, you understand how bodies are diverse in size and shape among those things.
Here come the ones who are small like arms and face to them, then cover that they enclose with a delicate cloth wrap.

Return the splinter to its upper position in the broken area and apply tight pressure with your hand so that it does not protrude further from where you have lanced the breakage. Here the patient is wrapped in an outer covering of the location where the break occurred, and gradually softens the tightness, until taking away most of it from that place with hands' pressure.

However, if the splint placed on that fracture is thick and a small one has been applied to the other splints as well, then its length according to where it rests upon the body's extremities - both height and size; and strong support should be provided over these splints following your first bandage type related to strictness; this must correspond with the location of the fracture itself. And as we extend from the point of the fracture, so too will our tension increase on that same tightening (of the wound).
When the threads are thick and thin as they should be (referring to sperm), if the threads are large, it is seen when coarse fibers of them pop out during arousal; this great error occurs at equality.
And when delicate threads are not conveniently sufficient for the ones you wish to tie, do not bind them with those waters which flow between stone and stone; where there is a day' extricable period has elapsed.

This is how healing was performed by the physicians for which there are breaks and displacements with twisting.

When it is necessary to adjust in the tightness you may have even at your first stricture entirely, and insert into the belly' extrusion of humoral excess according as memory occurs for him.
May if you open the fracture site and dry out or exhaust it so much that there is no sign of healing left; know that food should be prohibited to aid in this situation—and drink water every day for three days, alleviate the swelling with a small pill, through which nourishment will enter into the affected limb, resulting in recovery.
May those who perform the restoration of another'se bone fracture when not yet healed during meals be mistaken according to their method, and if correctly done by means of its curvature, great fear arises; but if they are rightly treated with hot water applied directly as needed (perhaps diluted), it will expand the Ancients in free states without resistance.
Even if they have not seen it from afar before now, so that it is reasonable for them not to do.
Capital Second: When a bone is broken in the head.
The spices of breaks are motes (irritants or causes), and their forms vary, with distinct origins: for any break caused by a percussion through space, it enters the cranium where it is felt as heat internally; if the crack extends into part of the bone, you inspect its depth within that portion. Here, this kind of fracture type is called "absolute displacement.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
This break or intruder that has already entered the periosteum (the layer surrounding the bone), it is either in the face of the bone itself, and here lies its dirt from these broken bones.

When the nose is broken and cracks, it refers to a medical situation where there has been an injury resulting in fracture
Be that as it may, the explanation is this: when your nose isn't actually broken (it has not fractured), but rather divided into pieces due to an incident or misuse somewhere along time ago; and since then there are two bones involved with a cartilaginous nature in their connection. This division doesn'thy result from the break itself, nor does it cause illness directly within you (it is not diseased internally), but rather malformation of shape – crooked form or twisting alignment - as well as deviation and displacement that may lead to complications requiring medical attention for proper assessment and possible intervention.
If one of the two bones has indeed suffered a break within your nose (the small part you've inserted), then this is where intervention by yourself should cease – do not continue to manipulate it inside, as that could further aggravate and potentially displace or damage what remains. The course of action dictated here involves returning the nasal structure back towards its natural form once again after such an injury has occurred; thus implying some sort of healing process or restoration technique might be advised by medical professionals to ensure proper recovery, assuming that no further intervention is necessary beyond this point. It's clear from these translated lines and interpretations that even in the absence of a fracture (broken bone), there remains concern over structural misalignment or displacement within And should you wish to ease your situation (in this context likely referring back to the nose injury or misalignment), be mindful that such actions on yourself could have consequences – especially if it involves procedures related to a hernia, as previously mentioned in line four of our translation. This warning suggests caution and perhaps consultation with medical experts before proceeding
If the fracture is in the upper chest portion of the ribcage and does not move towards it, then cover it with a piece from where the large bone fragment is located at the site of injury.

If you do not sew in the apesterum quickly, then hasten to fill that wound with wheat flour and pommelet powder from baked almonds; place your hand over it on its backstop (the area where the tailbone ends), making sure no nasal air enters.
If bones of the nose are broken or compressed, be careful not to cut over those areas with tools meant for them; and fix that fracture using fluid appropriate for it (like blood), which carries life force, applying pressure where necessary until healing occurs: then apply bandages suitable for treatment.
If you break a child'se nose, then take care of that with some warm clay and insert tubes of lead inside so as to heal the whole body.

During jaw joint fracture restoration, often referred to as the treatment for a broken jawbone (mandible), several steps and consider
When the jawbone has become dislocated and not merely cracked or broken into two pieces with bending at different parts (indicating an improperly healed fracture), take note that this often indicates a more severe injury requiring careful attention rather than mere observation alone. Such cases usually necessitate specialized treatment due to the complexity of jaw joint injuries which may involve displacement and misalignment issues beyond simple breaks or cracks.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
If the jawbone is broken into pieces, then cover it with extension of bone segments inside so that healing (recovery) can occur.
If you have caused convulsion of the teeth leading to disruption (likely referring to broken or misaligned teeth), then apply pressure on those parts which you hope will stop bleeding from the root of gold/silver or copper deposits, and place your hand above the fractured jawbone. Also put a single finger along the length of the fractured jaw; press it with what is provided for its application (likely referring to dental instruments), ensthy not destroying them in doing so.
When commanding the humors that are out of balance (the malady), ensure rest and calmness for him/her, pause his food consumption with their sips taken by birds.
If your figure is distorted in any manner, then you should bend and unlace that part on the third day; rectify what has already been altered from it by applying powders made of lead or egg white/albumen (egg whites), sprinkling them over the cast lint cloth.
And when that bandage is applied and placed over it, without altering the position of the bone, so long as this injury remains in three consecutive days, then healing occurs naturally for a healthy and strong fracture; these movements are repeated continuously during those three days.
If another purulent wound occurs, apply what we have mentioned for other pains within the body cavity until it heals and resolve that abscess.
If the fracture is from bone separation or displacement, consider whether it's of the os (bone), then remove those fragments that are necessary for returning them to where they belong in the body during their recovery period.
If the poultice of the patient is squeezed out, then increase it as much as your need requires at the site of application.

When the wing (furcula) is broken due to excessive movement of its associated muscles, this fracture can occur in one of three ways: it could be a simple break where only bone breaks apart; an avulsion injury which means bits of bone are torn away by strong pulling or shearing forces from the attached tendons and ligaments as if they've been stripped off (as muscles might during vigorous fla
When the wing is broken (fractured), it can be separated into two pieces that do not align properly – this complicates its healing and repair, making restoration challenging or even impossible in some cases; alternatively, if a cast must be applied to maintain proper alignment for bone regeneration, precise casting becomes difficult. Additionally, when the fracture is open (compound), where broken fragments pierce through skin creating an opening – healing here requires medical intervention at hospital settings due to risk of infection and complexity; or if there's nerve damage along with the breakage making not only restoration but also daily function a significant difficulty, these conditions necessitate professional veterinary care.

Consider if the nourishment is prohibited for preventing excess in the member due to tightness; provided that you can slightly ease it and continue doing so each day until reaching the required nourishment again.
If in the abdomen you do not heal any of these causes that have been mentioned, then it will take up to twenty days or more than those already given for recovery.

Extend the minister' extruded bones and have them worked by this doctor at their good joining points.
And when you have applied plaster and bandage without causing an ulcer (apostema), then adjust the size of the dressing according to the amount needed for that area, and already covered it with a linen wrap.
May it be that the joint pain is in the parts divided by your hand bones, and appears as if sinews of cloth, and commands the malady to tighten that part with your clenched hand; make such a tightening long on the fabric (of skin/sinew).
Wherever there is cloth (or drape) on which the body rests, making sure that the body lies against it and strengthening that part secondarily:
May it be if the fracture is in parts outside (the limb), then cover below the stone and another of that part with your hand so that the middle becomes protected, and hold back any swelling; similarly when you have revolved your hands to between the fingers as a lever.
If you break the bones of your fingers or toes, and if it is their finger or toe that gets injured, then apply pressure on them with your palm as much as possible until a small splint made of astel (a type of wood) for four days so that the fracture heals properly without becoming swolthy.
May it be that the fracture is in those places as well (the knee, wrist, ear, or ankle), just like where this one is now (in the elbow joint), then hold your hand on what you touch; if they continue to shift around and move about without restraints, take a pause over that small stone we have here, as when holding hands in our feet.

In the context of treating a hernia, which is not actually related to bone healing but rather soft tissue or possibly intra-abdominal organs
The pelvic bone, which has been displaced and is now considered to have become separated or detached from its normal position around the navel (belly button), as stated hereafter referring it with terms like "displaced" and "separated." It suggests a medical condition that may involve hernia where organs are protruding through an abnormal opening, potentially affecting the integrity of pelvic bones. In modern English
In the restoration process, a strong suture is placed directly over the break in the bone, along with another bandage or support material right next to it; simultaneously, the abdomen and chest are compressed by weight or pressure applied above them as part of securing the repair site. This indicates an attempt at manual reduction for a hernia where external forces may be used in conjunction with sutures (stitches) directly on top of bone fractures, although this is not typical modern medical practice and reflects historical or alternative approaches to what appears here
The minister (or physician) extends the suture along its entirety as per where it intersects or joins with bone fragments when they are in place within the marrow cavity of the affected area—indicating a meticulous attention to detail required for proper immobilization and support during healing. This reinforces that careful handling is given
And if it is permitted to perform an incision of the groin (where hernias commonly occur), then one must place suture material over its intersection with bone fragments within that area—this ensures extension and support where needed, along with additional bandaging or stitching directly atop fracture sites. This underscs a technique used to stabilize both the soft tissue incision site in preparation for possible hernia repair (likely involving mesh) as well as address bone fragments within that surgical field—emphasizing an integrated approach between managing potential complications such as enteroceles and fractures.

If bone is broken in two parts, then the cushion becomes all portions of it.
If the bone is cracking under pressure, then the cushion becomes parts of its divisions down there (i.dict).
If your bone is cracked or broken (trintat), then immobilize it right away (atrobas dejoz), and these are causes beyond your control (no sunt tuitades).
And administer stretching and exergy (energy) as directed by that methodology for the joints, tendons, and ligaments according to their position/alignment.
May God be with you, if the crack in the cushion causes displacement and pain increases when pressed, then ease it by your will.
When there is any cause for operation on the arm, and when you gouge with awls and perform the entirety of the surgery, then take wooden pincers that are paused in advance over the causes which have been stopped by stones, used as needles made from palm leaves; apply these to those items where there is a small growth, not using fingers or long bones according to their length, and insert them quickly into the abscess.

When a bone is broken in children (infants), the treatment for a fracture typically involves:
It is convenient for the one to whom you have applied fracture reduction, and primarily if your shoulder or adjutant'dict (helper) bone size matches that of their own shoulder or helper, then tend to yourself by reducing and possibly performing an incision on them immediately if conditions allow as stated in previous testimonies.
If the child falls sick and vomits blood (sickle), then you must hold them close to prevent further regurgitation of what has already come up, unless another cause is at play.
When he begins to repair the fracture on that day, do not extend it further unless you are dealing with suppuration (infection).
If you cauterize the ulcer, then heal it within one day, provided that the ulcer recedes by tomorrow and over the next three days in total; otherwise, you will cause bad complications to him.
If the bone is broken and protrudes above the neck (the most prominent part of the sternum), then it should be reduced there by you, making that movement with your hands to make things easier for yourself and take only a little stretching out.
May it not be due to overextension and the position of your patient, then reduce that which is in those areas; this will heal by iron as its length ranges from seven digits or eight (fingers), and according to the size required for treatment based on the amount indicated hereinforth within fracture care.
And provide relief and ensure that there is not much discomfort for the patient during the operation time on them.

Therefore you must grasp the limbs of the fracture and if that part is delicate, do not use such a good instrument for repair; rather, insert what tool they have into this bone which has been broken so it can function properly again.
May you not be able to reduce the bones of all that we have recommended, then proceed by cutting away whatever fluid has come from those intestines which we've mentioned; or use one of your saws for this task in any way it may possibly fit into your hands.

Based on my understanding of Latin-influenced languages like Italian
When you care for the joint that has been injured at any location where a fracture occurs, this is what can be interpreted and translated: "Capitol .xx." - It appears as though there may have been an abbreviation or symbol
When you care for this joint continuously in the healing area of a fracture, mostly at connections and primarily due to pressure on its limb part by body figure - it strictly forbids any spontaneous action or movement from that limb as if putting restraints upon natural operation. This suggests an approach where after injury (fracture), especially near joint points subjected to stress during healing, one must avoid unnecessary movements of the affected area and let nature take its course in mending bones – essentially allowing for a period of immobilization or limited movement as recommended by medical professionals who would understand these complex instructions.
Therefore consider if the joint is recent and administer in that medicine which has specified dietary remedies for it; such as aloe vera (aloen), grapes, mint leaves (enses), comfrey roots or stalks (sercacollo) and burdock root juice (accrassia). Apply these either to some of the patient's limbs in total amounts that are strictly prescribed by health professionals. Do this with their skin tight, applied directly as specified on a piece of gauze or bandage stretched across them over the joint for effective constriction and support during treatment – implying an approach where dietary supplementation is combined with topical application to aid in healing and providing comfort around recently injured areas. This text suggests using specific herbal remedies applied directly on skin-tight dressings, potentially as part of the therapethy regimen for joint injuries or related conditions according to historical medical practices informed by a combination of dietary interventions with practical home care measures involving direct application and bandaging.

When you have healed the member' extraneous twisting and elevation of bone fracture, and it is determined by form that there are deficiencies in this limb; yet, its participation in natural operation is not prohibited at all for whatsoever reason. However, do not receive into your hands the word of such a person whose existence within said member has been newly established through fracture or twisting.
May also stand as the work of doctors and innkeepers who have caused us pain here, and this operation is lost forever due to great fear for what it represents (i.dicta).

Therefore when you bend down to adjust a dislocation, forcefully straighten it back into place immediately; if delayed, the joint is displaced and making matters worse becomes difficult for water (humors) to reduce the dislocation.
And so that there is not too much moisture or tightness during the period of application, frequent movements bring about cramps and pains.
When you apply cold water on the affected area, and then compress it to restrain prolapse (returning of an internal organ), place your body part in immersion with both leg bathed under hot spring waters or oil baths for easement.

You understand that the elbow joint is displaced and returning it back there are difficulties; for when dislocated at all points especially between which part lies behind another, or by touching as per any figure wherein said limb may be dislocate (and upon adjustment of such a misaligned elbow you will plainly see the manifestation), then this joint is concave and cannot bend your arm nor engage with that specific muscle.

This line indicates that dislocation can occur where different parts of our skeleton meet (in Latin "ma"), which usually involves the arm(s) connecting to the body ("braz"). The process of reducing, meaning repositioning the joint back into its original place, is notably challenging and time-sensitive. If treatment isn'thy quick or if there has been an apoplectic (seizure/stroke like symptoms), this could result in additional complications ("apostemat" refers to a condition where tendons are immobile due to adhesions, often following surgery). Here I have translated the complex
The reduction of a dislocation is such that you stop the joint's misalignment above and on top of an inanimate surface (like a table) while extending from there onto it; this method involves having either your hand or palm placed overcoming impending displacement, then pushes back into its proper position. Here I have translated another line where specific actions are described for the treatment process during dislocation reduction: The procedure entails stopping and potentially adjusting a misaligned joint above an inanimate reference point such as on top of furniture or similar object that can bear weight; this is done by extending part(s) from said surface, with hands (or palms), directed over where the displacement could happen next. These tools—extensions like tables and hand positions are used to maneuver joint back into its original alignment once dislocated ("reduce"). This
Indeed when it is considered that the palm rests on the abdomen of her/him, then let hernia press down from their two sides onto a table for extension and reduction; if displacement precedes them, they must position themselves in such a way that their own midsection sits upon this inherent risk over the table.
So if it returns soon, good things will come to be; but if not, that painful spot may harden and become inflexible until the appointed day arrives when action can no longer prevent suffering or treatment.
May the joint according to its twisted nature; and not in vain does it affect, but rather is softened without cause—understand that the nerves are sprained or stretched out herein, and you will see they tighten up specifically for cauterization at this location with strong water infusion which provides a reason.
So when they return reclined with the one we have recommended for them to be compressed and bound tightly, their limb should rest on it for days; furthermore, cut off its length (presumably referring back to a treatment like bandaging or constriction) while also exergying/exercising that part of the body.
If the patient' extraneous movements cease and they experience some pain in their lower or upper parts, apply water poultice herein and warm fomentations accordingly; let them be treated until cured.

The phrase "curacio di dislocazione dei vertebre del dorso" translates to English as "treatment for the dislocation of thoracic
The translation of your phrase in English would be: "When any of the thoracic or cervical vertebrae are fully dislocated and loose spondylotic fragments occur, it is not treated; instead, death occurs due to strangulation." This sentence reflects a medieval medical understanding where full dislocation leading to potentially fatal consequences was beyond their curative capacity. It emphasizes the severity of such injuries during that era before modern surgical interventency became available or understood in spinal trauma management.
This complex sentence in English would translate to: "If the dislocation of the uterus occurs involuntarily and cannot be held back; moreover, lubrication is applied gently to his or her limbs or body surface, two cushions on their legs are used, or one among those three methods (lubricant application for limbs/body surfaces with leg-padding, using additional padding); in these cases where a spondylolysis fragment occurs from its own location—further lubrication is applied and the treatment of that piece will be conducted through four steps." Here we see an intricate medieval medical approach which involves specific methods for treating dislocation involving soft tissues. The use of padding or additional cushions indicates a primitive form of traction, while mentioning 'lubricants' suggests early attempts at reducing friction and movement to facilitate healing—an understanding that would have been rudimentary compared with modern orthopedic practices but shows the beginning stages where various methods were explored for treatment.

If you wish to turn the position in which it has revolved (presumably referring to a patient's body or condition), stay on your back with your head of the malady at the end of two sticks; these rods are each as long as one arm, and keep your head there at the end of another pair of sticks placed vertically undernethy limbs. There is also space between every stick—a palm-length apart—and it has already become in any such spaces where you turn (presumably adjusting or moving a part of the body). And each one rests firmly on the ground so that nothing untoward happens with them, particularly gout.
And in one of these he receives a staff upon which it turns and is twisted between the two sticks of them.
In the limb there is a distortion wherein it forms wood-like length of which equals to a hand'dictated by its rotation, and in both other sticks they resemble that one.

Of hock joint dislocation care. (This translates to a medical context concerning the treatment of a hip
Realize that the hock joint and muscle connection are not inherently weakened but have become dislocated only once, without causing harm to other smaller body connections of curvature or recession which you might otherwise injure by excessive force elsewhere. (This translation interprets a medieval medical perspective on treating a hip dislocation with caution towards preserving the integrity of adjacent structures and not exac0ding potential damage.)
The hock joint is dislocated according to four ways: it can be dislocated at the divisions of bones, or below them (perhaps referring to lower leg structures), ahead of them ('anteriorly'), behind them ('posteriorly'), or beneath them ('subtendently'). This line provides a description based on medieval medical knowledge regarding possible locations for hock joint dislocation.
Mostly it is dislocated at joints (or parts), and rarely in front or behind the joints (parts).
When the dislocation of your limb occurs at its joints and you adjust the sling for hinges on health is long enough to stretch it out until no longer ill, then hook up thin rope whereof has been untwined so that nothing will come off from which was once whole; here comes the first source sentence translated into English:
When the name of that person who has been displaced is mentioned, it means that their accidents are contrary to this one (the current condition or injury).
Even the one from whom dislocation occurs down there as you expand on their heel cushion secondly complementarily, may not necessarily double that pain which is already present in the joint; if further displacement happens and cannot be managed at these parts below now, urine retention within it becomes (happening) and its bandage gets punctured/pierced hereby, you must walk on their heel.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
May reduction of these spices for this dislocation is what you consider, and if the dislocation is old and ancient, it has already been reduced by whatever treatment you have administered so far; therefore, there's no need to perform further intervention here in that cure. And thus not even a prognostication can be made at this point of care.
In the one where dislocation is recent and among the four species of dislocation, then turn the joint you have turned back to its place on both sides (the limbs), first right side and then left, until it returns firmly without need for other treatments.
Mayhaps, if it does not return in this treatment, then the servant who prepares must act strongly and extend the cushion under them from where they were placed just now; or their hands as well (or stretch a ligature above that), another servant extends the bandage of such down there so fast; hold tightly with one whose task is to keep pressure on, while carefully placing taut strings at extremities.
When there is extension from the head down towards the joint of the neck or between the shoulder blade and the thoracic vertebrae, it means that:
And if their extension of all these is within the period that the swelling rises up to its body part on earth, then let it rise accordingly with the patient'supart from where they stand (their position).
This specific exercise is special for all four of them (or in this context likely referring to patients or individuals).
And if the displacement returns with water that we have spoken of, then be still; but if not, it is necessary throughout all special waters for which treatment has been described in our care.
In their own reduction, when dislocated and displaced to the joints, so that the malady is returned onto its chest; and pause the ligaments at the location of the hollow between the waist of the thigh where it meets with the spot where the leg bends while lying down. And extend the ligament in their part belonging to the shoulder blade towards the topmost portion of the breastbone, which belongs to the joint's uppermost section.

When properly reduced, when it dislocates from the forearm part, where the hump of the ilium presses on its own joint according to what we have recommended in our chest gelatin; and his ligaments are placed directly over the affected hip and chest.
Here are the translations line by line:
Each minister extends over its respective area, and the doctor holds their hand for reduction according to art.
When dislocation occurs in the parts ahead of time, then it is necessary to stretch out that change (dislocation), and as this medical case describes; the doctor places his palm on the leg area below the hips, stretgyly expands there with one hand while compressing another part above hip level.
If the dislocation is at the joints behind, it will not be that their humors have spread to the areas of nowhere and are elevated above ground; having points where they cause pain as if there were two anchors downstairs (meaning a low position), according to what we've said about this patient below, even when his/her belly has been dislocated from these joints further back, it will not show any weakness.
When compression is applied using a table over the location where the joint joins.
So when the reduction is completed as I have covered — and "the reduction of you" does not mean that it concerns your body, meaning instead: extend cushions from underneath them; once again these are adjusted (and tightened), expanding their respective spaces after extracting those parts outwards with forceps, ensuring the wider bandage is securely wrapped and held in place for three to four days.
Return the ligament and bandaging, and compare one cushion with another.
And if you see those ill-fitting in your room, know that the dislocation is already fixed, and thus let the humors flow out of it.
If you see any cause of softening, return and bandage that part according to your first touch, and stretch it out for three days.
Return that part of it and let them walk slowly on what remains for as many days until they are comfortable.
