 CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX.
On the cauterization of fistulae in the anal and peri-anal regions.
 When the patient will not submit to the cutting operation we have described in its own place, and is afraid of it, he may perhaps be cured with the cautery.
So when somebody gets a fistula, and pus and foul humidities have for a long while been running from it, you must first explore it with a fine probe and judge of its depth by the probe.
Then heat a spike-shaped cautery and introduce it, hot, into the fistula, in the direction of the bottom of the fistula and to the depth to which the probe entered.
And repeat the cauterization till all those corrupt bodies are burnt away; once or twice or three times over, as you have need.
But beware of burning a nerve should one be there, or a big blood-vessel.
If the fistula penetrates to the urinary bladder or the intestine, beware of all these parts.
Do this only when the fistula is in a fleshy part and you judge that it does not open into any other part.
Afterwards dress the place till healed.
If the place cicatrizes and the flux of humours ceases and it remains so for a long while, you may know that it is perfectly healed.
But if the flux of humours from it is not stopped, understand that it has perforated or that at the bottom there is a piece of diseased bone or the like; which will be mentioned in its proper place.
