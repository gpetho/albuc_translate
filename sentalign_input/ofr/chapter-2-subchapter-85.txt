of the rupture of the belly/abdomen
The rupture of the belly/abdomen is large, medium, and small; from the large wound sometimes the intestine, or the sinews of the intestines, protrude, which makes their insertion difficult; and the stitching is more difficult, and sometimes the small wound is worse than the large one, because it is harder to put the intestines back in, if they are not put back in immediately; because the intestines swell as soon as they feel the cold, so they are harder to put back in, and therefore the medium wound is better, because the intestine is more easily returned to its place than in the other two. And know that the rupture of the belly/abdomen is of four kinds: the two common stitches occur in the stitching of the belly/abdomen, and the stitching of the other wounds of the body and two other specific stitches are common to other wounds; and yet they are more specific to the stitching of the belly/abdomen, and I will describe each one and explain.
I say that when the wound is small, and some part of the intestine comes out, and it is difficult to put it back, this is for one of two reasons: either because of the smallness of the wound, as we have said, or because the intestine is swollen from the cold.
And when it is cold, warm it in this way: wet a sponge or a soft cloth in lukewarm water only, or in which you have cooked squinanth, cypress, and spikenard, and sprinkle the intestine until the swelling is gone; and sometimes this makes the veins contract, and is better than plain water for reducing swelling.
And when you see the swelling subside, moisten the intestine with water in which marshmallow and mallow have been cooked, for this makes the entry easier by a little; and if it cannot enter, then cut the wound a little with the instrument with which hemorrhoids are cut; and the first treatment is better than cutting, which one should not do unless there is great necessity; and this is the instrument for cutting it: it cuts inside the curve and not outside, and here is its form:
And when the wound is enlarged, and the intestine protrudes, put it back in its natural form in its proper place, if you can, for this is better.
When the wound is large, and it is in the lower part of the belly, you must make the patient lie on his back, and put his legs higher than his head; and if it is in the part below the belly, then put the head and chest higher than the lower parts, and also if the rupture of the belly is in one of the two parts put your attention to this so that the injured part is higher than the other; and thus it is necessary to manage what I say in large and medium wounds.
In small wounds, put what is prepared for you, then have between your hands a skillful assistant who holds the whole rupture in his hand, and brings the edges together; and this is the common way of stitching, and it is that you take one needle or more, according to the size of the width of the wound, then leave from the top of the wound a finger's width of space, and insert a needle there with a good strong thread; and pierce both edges of the skin with both edges of the siphac, which is under the skin inside, until you make it pierce on that side, and bring the two edges of the siphac all four together; then tighten it with a double thread around the needle on both sides, then bring the two edges of the wound together evenly, and then leave a finger's width of space, and insert another needle there; then tie it with thread as you did the first needle, and do not stop doing this according to how many needles you need, until the whole wound is closed; and the needles should be medium-sized, between fine and thick, because fine needles cut all the flesh, and those that are too thick cannot enter well: therefore they must be medium; and do not put the needles too far outside the flesh and skin, lest they cut and open the wound before it is stitched; and then cut the heads of the needles, so that they do not hurt the patient while sleeping, and put tents or cloths at the heads of the needles to hold them better, and leave them until the wound is healed; and this way of stitching with needles is more suitable for small wounds, for one or two needles suffice. The second stitching is common, and it is that you bring the two edges of the skin and the two edges of the syfac together with a needle with a strong medium thread; and when you have pierced these edges all four together, bring the needle back to the part where you began, in the manner in which one sews cloth; and put a space between each stitch the width of a little finger; men know this stitching, and I stitched a wound that a man had in his belly, who was wounded with a knife, and the wound was more than a palm long, and the intestines protruded a good two palms, and the wound was in the middle of the belly. 
I put his intestines back after they had been out for twenty-four hours, and the wound was stitched up to fifteen days, and I treated him, and he was healed.
And the physicians had judged that he would die, and it was a miracle; and I did not treat him with ointment, for I was in a place where none was found, nor any medicines; and I simply put old cotton on the wound twice a day, and washed it with honey water until he was healed.
Now I will tell you the two proper ways of stitching: take the needle, and push it from the outside to the inside; when it has pierced the flesh straight through, then leave the edge of the siphac or skin where you pushed the needle, and make it pierce on the other side from the inside to the outside; and the meaning of this stitching is that you sew as the leather-workers do skins, and that you leave the syfac once on one side, and take it again on the other, until the stitching is completely finished.
The second way of stitching, which Galen specifically describes, is as some do, who bring the two parts together naturally, and join one end of the siphac to the other end, in this way: insert a needle at the edge of the wound nearby, and make it pierce only that place, and leave the two edges of the siphac; then turn the needle, and make it pierce from the outside to the inside, at the two edges of the siphac; then make it pierce both from the outside to the inside, in two other edges of the wound that are on the other side; and this is the better way of stitching and the most common.
Galen said these words, and some testify to it, that one should sew the belly with two needles, with thread in each; and one should push one needle from one side, and the other from the other, in the manner of those who sew straps; and know that when the rupture is in the middle of the belly, the stitching is more difficult than in other places of the belly.
The treatment of the wound is like the treatment of other wounds: and it is that when you find the wound fresh with all its blood, before the burn has changed it, then put the intestine back, and sew it; then put on the flesh-generating powder, and if the burn has changed it, then put on some ointment that is available, until the wound festers; and let the threads fall out, and let the siphac and the wound be healed; then treat the wound like the others, until it is healed; and if you have no medicines, then put on, as soon as it begins to fester, old cotton, and change it twice a day until it is healed.
For you do not need other medicine in many cases when the wounds are simple; and if you suspect that the wound may affect the principal members, then you should moisten light wool in oil of moderate heat, or in rose oil, and put it around the groin, and under the armpits; and if he feels pain or pus in the bowels, and it often happens, then give him enemas of lukewarm dark wine, and especially if the pus reaches the intestine; and pierce it inside, and know that when it is the large intestine, it is easier to heal than the small one.
The intestine which is called "jejunum" cannot heal when it is wounded, and this is because of the layout of the veins that are there, and because of the thinness of the whole body, and the proximity of its nature to the nerves.
And if the omentum protrudes from the wound, put it back in just like the intestine, while it is fresh; and if it is old and has become green or black, then you must tie off the place that is black, so that a flow of blood does not come there, because there are veins and arteries; then cut what is between the ties, and let the two ends hang from the part below the wound until later to ease the extraction when the omentum falls off, and the wound festers.
of the rupture of the bowel
When the intestine is round, and the wound is small, it can be restored in some men, because I saw that a man was wounded in the belly by a lance; and the wound was to the right of the stomach, and it swelled and became a fistula, and the excrement and gases came out of it; I treated it as best I could, and I did not cease to refine the treatment until he was healed, and the place was closed. 
And when I saw it closed, I feared that the patient would have pain in his belly; and he had no pain there, but remained in better condition, eating and drinking; and some experimenters said that when there is a small wound in the intestine, it should be tied in this manner: take ants with large heads, then bring together the edges of the wound, and when the ant has opened its mouth, put it on the two edges, so that it clamps its mouth on them; and then cut off its head, and this holds it so that it cannot come undone, then put another ant after it in the same way as before, until the wound is completely enclosed; and sew the wound.
These heads thus burn the intestine, and no harm comes to the patient, and one can also tie the intestine with a fine thread which is cut from the intestine of an animal, in this way: take the end of this intestinal thread that is very lean, and then tie to the end of this thread a fine twisted linen thread, then put the thread in the needle, and sew the intestine with it, and put it back into the rupture; and this manner of stitching with ants is only by way of trust and hope; and if the wound is large and wide, especially when it is in one of the small intestines, there is no remedy nor health, except subtlety.
