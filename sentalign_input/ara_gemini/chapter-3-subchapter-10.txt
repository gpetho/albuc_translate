The tenth chapter on the reduction of hip fracture.
Rarely do the hip bones break.
If they do break, the break is such that they shatter at their ends, split lengthwise, and tilt inward.
The patient experiences pain in the area, a prickling sensation, and numbness in the leg on the side of the fracture.
Its treatment is to run your hand over it until you determine the shape of the fracture.
If the break is only at the ends, then adjust the fracture according to what you can achieve in setting it until its shape resembles its natural shape.
If the break is lengthwise, or if it has tilted inward, then lay the patient on his stomach so that you can set the fracture.
Once you have set it, apply a bandage, then place a splint made of wood or leather on it, and tighten it firmly, without fear of the fracture shifting or the splint slipping.
And level the hollow of the flanks with whatever fills it so that the tightening takes hold evenly.
And instruct the patient to sleep on his back or on his healthy side.
If a hot swelling appears, stop extending and setting it until the hot swelling subsides, and apply what soothes it, as described previously, then return to setting it and tightening it as appropriate.
If fragments appear in the bone, or if anything shatters from its ends, it should not be removed or touched, but rather leveled from the outside, as we have said, and left untightened until it heals.
