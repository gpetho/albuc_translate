On the treatment of an imperforate anus.
Chapter 79.
Many children are born with their anuses not perforated, which a delicate membrane has obstructed.
Therefore, the midwife should perforate that membrane with her finger; if not, she should perforate it with a sharp Spatumili and be careful not to touch the muscle.
Then place wool soaked in wine and oil over it.
Then treat it with ointments until it heals.
If you fear it may become obstructed, place a lead tube in the opening for many days, and remove it when the child wants to evacuate.
Sometimes obstruction of the anus also occurs due to wound healing or an abscess.
Therefore, that hardened area should be cut, then treated as we described, with healing and lead.
