The author of this book said: When I had completed for you, my son, this book, which is the theoretical part of medicine in its entirety, and reached the limit in its clarity and explanation, I decided to complete it for you with this treatise, which is the practical part, done by hand.	AFTER finishing for you, my sons, this book which is the part of knowledge dealing with medicine in its entirety; and having made it as clear and explicit as possible, I thought it well to complete it for you by adding this treatise which concerns surgical operating.	0.7458074
Because surgery in our country and in our time is totally nonexistent, so that its science has almost been forgotten and its trace obliterated. There remain of it only insignificant traces in the books of the ancients, which have been corrupted by copyists and marred by errors and confusion, so that its meanings have become obscure and its benefit remote.	For the skilled practitioner of operative surgery is totally lacking in our land and time; so that the knowledge of it is on the point of being blotted out and its remains lost; and there is nothing left of it except a few traces in the books of the Ancients; where, however, it has been so corrupted by the hands of scribes, and subjected to error and confusion, that its meaning has become obscured and its value diminished.	0.8706851
So I decided to revive it and compose this treatise by way of explanation, clarification, and conciseness, and to include illustrations of cauteries and other surgical instruments, as this adds to the clarity and covers what is needed.	Therefore I decided to revive this art by expounding, elucidating, and epitomizing it in this treatise; and to present the forms of the cauterizing irons and other operative instruments, since this is an adjunct to explanation and a vital necessity.	0.8733798
The reason why there is no skilled surgeon in our time is because the study of medicine is long, and its practitioner should first train in the science of anatomy which Galen described. Until he understands the functions of the organs, their structures, temperaments, connections, and separations, and the knowledge of bones, nerves, and muscles, their number and origins, and the pulsating and non-pulsating veins, and the locations of their origins.	Now this is the reason why there is no skilful operator in our day: the art of medicine is long and it is necessary for its exponent, before he exercises it, to be trained in anatomy as Galen has described it, so that he may be fully acquainted with the uses, forms, and temperament of the limbs; also how they are jointed, and how they may be separated; that he should understand fully also the bones, tendons, and muscles, their numbers and their attachments; and also the bloodvessels, both arteries and veins, with their relations.	0.8745372
Therefore Hippocrates said that physicians are many in name but few in deed, especially in the practice of surgery.  We have mentioned some of this in the introduction of this book.	And so Hippocrates said: 'Though many are doctors in name, few are in reality, particularly on the surgical side.' We have already spoken of this in the introduction to this book.	0.89531356
Because whoever is not knowledgeable in what we have mentioned regarding anatomy will inevitably fall into an error that kills people, as I have witnessed many who dabbled in this science and claimed it without knowledge or understanding.	For he who is not skilled in as much anatomy as we have mentioned is bound to fall into error that is destructive of life. Thus I have seen many laying claim to this knowledge and boasting of it, but having neither knowledge nor experience.	0.7747323
For I saw an ignorant physician incise a scrofulous tumor on the neck of a woman, and he severed some of the arteries of the neck, so the woman bled until she fell dead in his hands.	I saw an ignorant doctor incise a scrofulous tumour in a woman's neck; and he cut certain arteries in the neck so that the woman bled until she fell dead before him.	0.9267082
And I saw another physician proceed to extract a bladder stone from an old man; the stone was large, and he acted rashly and extracted it with a piece of the bladder wall. So the man died after about three days. I had been summoned to extract it, but I saw from the size of the stone and the condition of the patient what I had estimated about it.	And I saw another doctor presume to take out a stone from a man of advanced age. The stone was large; he rushed blindly at the task and extracted the stone and with it a piece of the bladder itself; and the man was dead in about three days. I had myself been previously called in to extract the stone but from what I saw of the size of it and the condition of the patient I judged that the outcome would be so.	0.9586131
I saw another physician who was earning a living from some of the police chiefs of our city by practicing medicine.	I saw another doctor who had a regular salary from one of the high officers of our country for medical treatment.	0.7807306
A black boy who was with him experienced a fracture in his leg near the heel, along with a wound. The physician, in his ignorance, quickly bandaged the fracture over the wound with compresses and splints, binding it tightly and leaving no ventilation for the wound.	There had occurred to a negro boy of his a fracture of the leg near the heel, together with a wound; the doctor rushed in, in his ignorance, and bound up the fracture, over the wound, very tightly, with pads and splints, not allowing the wound to breathe.	0.91402596
Then he indulged his desires, then left him for several days and instructed him not to loosen the bandage.  Thus, his leg and foot swelled, and he was near death.	He then let him go as he wished and then dismissed him for some days bidding him not to loose the bandage. Eventually his leg and foot swelled and he was close to death.	0.9212842
So I was called to him, and I quickly loosened the bandage. He found relief and his pains lessened, except that the corruption had taken hold in the limb, and I could not turn it back.	I was called in and made haste to loose the bandage, upon which some ease and reduction of the pain followed. Nevertheless, gangrene had already taken hold on the limb and I could not hinder its progress; it.	0.7952872
And the corruption continued to spread in the limb until he perished.	continued to extend in the limb until he perished.	0.63251054
And I saw another physician treat a hard, cancerous tumor.  It ulcerated after a few days until the affliction of its owner worsened. This is because, if the cancer is purely from black bile humor, it should not be touched with iron at all.	And I saw another doctor incise a malignant tumour; after some days the place broke out in open ulceration, thereby adding to the misery of the patient.	0.6737898
Unless it is in a limb that can be entirely amputated.	For a cancer that arises from a melancholic humour should never be touched by the knife unless it should happen to be in a part of the body which may be removed thoroughly and in its entirety.	0.47593004
Therefore, my son, you should know that manual work is divided into two parts: work accompanied by safety and work accompanied by damage in most cases.	Wherefore you must know, my sons, that operative surgery is divided into two parts, namely, where operation is associated with the health of the patient, and, on the other hand, where it is for the most part fraught with danger.	0.68462884
And I have pointed out, in every place where it occurs in this book, any procedure that involves risk and danger, so you should beware of it and reject it.	Throughout the following book I point out wherever I have described an operation that is accompanied by fear and danger. It behoves you to be wary and to shun such, lest the ignorant have an opportunity to reproach and slander you.	0.7420577
Lest the ignorant find a way to criticize and attack, adopt resolution and precaution for yourselves, and gentleness and deliberation for your patients.	Show, then, caution and care for yourselves and gentleness and perseverance for your patients.	0.6072364
And employ the best path leading to safety and a praiseworthy outcome, and avoid dangerous diseases that are difficult to treat.	Take the best road that leads to health and a happy outcome. Illnesses that are very threatening or difficult to cure, leave alone.	0.7003637
And keep yourselves from anything you fear might bring suspicion upon your religion and your worldly life, for it is more preserving of your honor and more elevating of your status in this world and the next.	Purify yourselves of anything which you fear may cause doubt as to your religious life and your secular life; for this will perpetuate your good name and will elevate your fortunes in this world and the next.	0.8942083
Galen said in some of his advice, "Do not treat a bad disease, lest you be called bad physicians.	For Galen once said in certain of his admonitions: 'Do not treat mischievous maladies lest you get the name of mischievous doctors.'	0.87389934
I have divided this treatise into three chapters.	I have divided this treatise into three books:	0.9002188
The First Chapter.	BOOK ONE.	0.58544993
On cauterization with fire and cauterization with caustic medication, organized and arranged from the head to the foot, and illustrations of the instruments and cauterizing irons, and everything needed for the manual operation.	Concerning the actual cautery; and cauterization by caustics. It is divided into chapters set in order from the head to the feet. The shapes of the instruments are shown and the iron cauteries and all things necessary for operating.	0.7324478
The Second Chapter.	BOOK TWO.	0.6852584
On incision, and scarification, and phlebotomy, and cupping, and wounds, and the extraction of arrows, and all similar things, organized and arranged, and illustrations of the instruments.	Concerning incision and perforation; blood-letting and cupping; wounds and the extraction of arrows and the like. The whole is divided into chapters in order; and illustrations of instruments are given.	0.74409884
The Third Chapter.	BOOK THREE.	0.69392395
On bone-setting, and dislocations, and the treatment of sprains, and similar things, organized and arranged from the head to the foot, and illustrations of the instruments.

This is similarly divided into chapters set in order from head to feet, with illustrations of instruments.	0.8122723

chapter-1.txt
The First Chapter.	BOOK ONE	0.4183396
On cauterization.	ON CAUTERIZATION	0.68948394
And before we mention the operation of it, it is necessary that we mention the manner of its benefits and its harms, and in what temperament it is used.	Before we expatiate on the actual operation of cautery it is necessary to mention its advantages and disadvantages and the temperament upon which it is to be used.	0.8342829
And I say that the discussion on the manner of the benefit of cauterization and its harms is a long discussion and a precise science and a hidden secret, and a group of the wise have spoken on it.	I say that a discourse on the advantage and disadvantage of cautery is a long one, a subtle learning, a hidden secret. A great number of wise men have spoken on the subject with differing opinions.	0.7885152
And they differed on it, and I have summarized from their words the little, fearing lengthiness.	Lest I should be over long I have reduced their opinions to a summary.	0.44861728
And I say that cauterization is beneficial, in general, for every bad temperament that is with matter and without matter, except for two temperaments, and they are the hot temperament without matter and the dry temperament without matter.	Now I say that the cautery has universal application for every ill constitution, whether organic or functional, with the exception of two: the functional hot temperament and the functional dry temperament.	0.7041869
As for the dry temperament with matter, they differed regarding it, so some of them said that cauterization is beneficial for it, and others said the opposite of that, that cauterization is not suitable for a disease that is from heat and dryness, because the nature of fire is heat and dryness.	About the organic dry temperament the Ancients differed, some saying that cautery helps in a constitution of this kind, while others said the opposite: that cautery is of no use in a disease caused by heat or dryness; for fire is naturally hot and dry and it is obviously absurd to treat a hot dry sickness with a hot dry remedy.	0.8160566
And it is impossible for someone to be cured of a hot, dry disease with a hot, dry remedy, and the one who says the opposite of that said that cauterization with fire could benefit from a hot, dry disease that occurs in the bodies of people. Because when you add the human body and its moisture to the temperament of fire, you make the human body cold.	But he who holds the opposite view says that actual cautery may help in the case of such hot dry illnesses as arise in the human body; for when you compare the human body, humid as it is, with the nature of fire you find the human body cold.	0.7434931
And I say what he said, because experience has revealed that to me many times, except that no one should imagine that matter except one who has been trained and practiced in the field of cauterization extensively. And has become familiar with the different temperaments of people and the states of diseases in themselves, their causes, their symptoms, and the duration of their time.	I myself from much experience agree with this last opinion. However, no one should attempt this operation unless he has had long training and practice in the use of the cautery, and is fully acquainted with the various human temperaments, and the character of the complaints in themselves; their causes, symptoms, and duration.	0.7237995
As for the other temperaments, there is no fear for you from them, especially cold, wet diseases, for all the physicians have agreed upon them and have not differed regarding the benefit of cauterization in them.	Concerning the rest of the temperaments there is no reason for fear, particularly the cold and humid distempers; all medical men are agreed and none differs concerning the utility of the cautery in such cases.	0.80275494
And know, my sons, that among the secrets of treatment is cauterization by fire, and its advantage over cauterization by caustic medication is because fire is a simple substance whose action does not go beyond the cauterized organ, nor does it harm another connected organ except slightly.	Now you should know, my sons, that the actual cautery and its superiority over cauterization with chemical caustics is one of the secrets of medicine. For fire is a simple substance having no action except upon the actual part cauterized; nor does it do more than slightly harm any adjacent part.	0.87326884
And cauterization with caustic medication, its action may extend to further organs, and perhaps it causes in the organ a disease whose treatment is difficult, and perhaps it kills. Fire, due to its nobility and the excellence of its essence, does not do that unless it is excessive.	But the effect of cauterization with caustic may spread to parts at a distance from that burnt; and also in the part cauterized it may give rise to a disease difficult to cure or even fatal. Whereas fire, on the other hand, on account of the nobility of its nature and its superiority has no such effect unless it is overdone.	0.7627299
And this has become clear to us through experience due to long service and care in the craft and observation of the realities of the matter.	That has become clear to us by experience through length of service, devotion to the art, and acquaintance with the facts of the matter.	0.80063426
For this reason, I have dispensed with lengthy discourse, and were it not unbefitting of this book of mine, I would have presented to you regarding fire a hidden secret and the manner of its action on bodies and its expulsion of diseases, with philosophical, demonstrative words too subtle for your understanding.	So I need not prolong this discourse. Were it not inappropriate to this my book I should relate to you a deep secret concerning fire, the manner of its action on bodies and its expulsion of diseases; with a reasoned philosophical discourse too subtle for your understanding.	0.8827194
And know, my sons, that they have differed on the time suitable for cauterization, and they considered the best time to be springtime.	Know also, my sons, that the Ancients disagreed also as to the fit time for cautery, affirming that spring was the best.	0.78882974
And I say that cauterization may be suitable at all times, because the harm occurring due to the time is absorbed in the benefit that is brought about by cauterization. Especially if the cauterization is for necessary, strong, urgent pains that cannot bear delay, for what is feared from them is that they will be followed by an affliction greater than the slight harm occurring due to the time.	Myself, I say that the cautery is suitable at all times; for whatever harm may arise from the season of the operation is utterly outdone by the benefit deriving from the cauterization itself; especially if the cautery is applied to pains that are severe, grievous, and swift, brooking no delay, because of the fear that the consequences may be more grave than the slight harm from the season.	0.8867298
And do not let enter your minds, my sons, what the common people and ignorant physicians imagine, that the cauterization which heals from a certain illness will not have a recurrence ever, and you consider it blameworthy.	Nor let enter your minds, my sons, the groundless notion of the laity and of ignorant doctors, that the complaint cured by the cautery never comes back later; do not cleave to this opinion.	0.83539724
And the matter is not as you imagined, because cauterization is just like a medicine that changes the temperament and dries the humors which are the cause of the occurrence of pains.	The fact is not as they think; for the cautery is homologous to the drug which alters the constitution and dries up the humidities that give rise to disorders.	0.76824933
Except that cauterization is superior to medicine due to the speed of its success, the strength of its effect, and the intensity of its power.	But the cautery excels the drug by the rapidity of its success, the strength of its action, and the potency of its powers.	0.79607487
And the illness may possibly return sometime, depending on the patient's temperament, the rootedness of his illness and its strength, and what is prepared in his body from the accumulation of excess humors within it and his negligence of himself in acquiring them from foods and other similar causes.	It may be that the disease will return at some time according to the temperament of the patient, and the persistence and virulence of the disease; and from the formation of a mass of superfluities in the body; from his neglect of himself in acquiring them from food; and from causes of a similar nature.	0.8727244
However, unless the illness for which cauterization is used is a mild illness and in an organ with little excess humors and moisture. Such as cauterizing a tooth for pain and the like, it is possible that the pain will not return in it, and that happens in the minority of cases.	Of course, if the disease to which the cautery is applied be a slight one, and in a part only slightly liable to superfluities and humidities, as, for example, the cauterization of a molar tooth for toothache, and the like, then it may happen that the pain does not return; but that happens rarely.	0.8397516
As for the common people's saying that cauterization is the last resort of medicine, it is a correct statement, but not in the way they mean, because they believe that no treatment is useful, neither with medicine nor with anything else, after cauterization has been performed, but the matter is otherwise.	Another common saying is that the cautery is the final remedy; which is true, but not in the way which they mean. For they believe that after cauterization no treatment, either with or without medicine, will help.	0.8430417
The meaning of cauterization being the last resort of medicine is that when we use various types of treatment for a disease, and those medications do not work, then we lastly use cauterization and it is effective, thus from this it has come about that cauterization is the last resort of medicine. Not in the sense that the common people and many ignorant physicians mean.	It means something precisely the opposite: after various treatments have been applied to a certain disorder without success, then last of all we apply cauterization and this proves effective; whence comes about the saying that the cautery is the final remedy—not in that sense in which it is popularly held by the laity and by many ignorant medical men.	0.7988965
The ancients have mentioned that cauterization with gold is better than cauterization with iron, and they said that because of the moderateness of gold and the nobility of its substance, and they said that the site of cauterization does not suppurate, but this is not absolute.	The Ancients have stated that cauterization by gold is more effective than by iron. Now they said that on account of the temperateness of gold and its noble character. They also stated that the site of cauterization does not become purulent, but that is not absolutely so; for I myself have experience of that and have found that it happens in some cases and not in other cases.	0.8273443
Because I have tested that and found it to do so only in some bodies and not others, and cauterization with it is better and finer than with iron, as they said, except that if you heat the cautery iron of gold in the fire, it will not be clear to you when it is heated to the degree that you want because of the redness of the gold.	Cauterization by gold is indeed better and more successful than with iron, as they have stated; except that when you are heating the gold cautery in the fire you are uncertain, by reason of the redness of the gold, when it reaches the desired temperature.	0.7571831
And because it cools quickly, and if you increase the heat, it melts in the fire and flows, so the craftsman finds himself busy with that, therefore cauterization with iron is faster for us and closer to correctness for the procedure, God willing.	In addition to this it cools very quickly; and if you overheat it it melts in the fire, melts and runs, and the practitioner finds himself in difficulties. Therefore in our own opinion cauterization is swifter and more successful with iron.	0.7664876
I have arranged this chapter on cauterization in sections that I have organized from head to foot to facilitate for the student what he wants from it, God willing.	Now I have arranged this book on cauterization by chapters, set in order from the head to the foot, to make it easy for the seeker to find what he wants.	0.7401047

The First Chapter.	CHAPTER ONE.	0.7567476
On cauterizing the head with one cauterization.	On the single cauterization of the head.	0.8243818
This cauterization is useful for an excess of moisture and coldness in the brain, which are the cause of headaches and an abundance of discharges from the head toward the eyes and ears, excessive sleep, toothache, and throat aches. And in general, for every illness that arises from coldness, such as paralysis, epilepsy, muteness, and similar ailments.	This cauterization helps against excessive humidity and coldness on the brain, which cause headache, abundance of defluxions from the head to the regions of the eyes and ears, excess of sleep, toothache, sore throat, and in general any sort of disorder arising from frigidity, such as palsy, fits, apoplexy, and diseases similar to these.	0.9135257
The method of this cauterization is that you first order the ill person to vomit with a laxative medication that cleanses the head for three or four nights according to what the strength of the sick person, their age, and their constitution requires.	The manner of performing this operation is first to bid the patient open the bowels with an evacuant which will also clear his head, for three or four nights, according to the strength, age, and habits of the patient.	0.8748075
Then you order them to shave their head with a razor, then you have them sit cross-legged in front of you, having placed their hands on their chest.	Then tell him to have his head shaved; then seat him cross-legged before you, with his hands on his breast.	0.7978257
Then you place the base of your palm on the bridge of their nose, between their eyes, and where your middle finger ends, mark that place with ink.	Then place the lower part of your palm upon the root of his nose between his eyes; and where your middle finger reaches mark that place with ink.	0.89242244
Then heat the olive-shaped cautery iron, which is pictured here.	Then heat an olivary cautery.	0.5295774
Expose [an area] of the bone the size of a probe head or a cherry pit; then lift your hand. Otherwise, reapply your hand with the same iron or another if it has cooled down.	If you see that some bone is exposed, the size of the head of a skewer or a grain of vetch, then take your hand away; otherwise repeat with the same iron, or, if that has got cold, with another, till the amount of bone I have mentioned is exposed.	0.78446096
Until you see of the bone what I have described to you; then take some salt and dissolve it in water, soak cotton in it, and place it on the area and leave it for three days.	Then take a little salt dissolved in water; soak some cotton in it, apply to the place and leave for three days.	0.7407192
Then apply cotton soaked in ghee and leave it on until the eschar from the cautery falls off. Then treat it with the quadruple ointment until it heals, God willing.	Then apply some cotton soaked in butter and leave it on till the eschar falls off; then dress with Tetrapharmacum ointment till healed.	0.7199961
They have said that as long as a wound remains open and suppurates, it is better and more beneficial.	The Ancients said that the more a wound is kept open, discharging pus, the better and more efficacious.	0.77736807
Some have mentioned cauterizing the skin down to the bone and holding the cautery until part of the thickness of the bone is burned, then scraping away the burnt bone and then treating it.	Some said the skin was to be cauterized through to the bone and the cautery held until some of the thickness of the bone was burnt. Then the burnt bone was to be scraped out, then dressed.	0.8763692
Others have said that one should cauterize extensively until it has a strong effect on the bone so that a piece like a carat or a small coin falls off the bone. They claimed that this ventilates the vapors of the head from that place and they leave the wound open for a long time.	Others said that the cautery should be carried through to burn a deep impression in the bone so that there should come out of the bone a piece shaped like a grain of a carob tree or a small spindle-whorl; they asserted that the vapours of the head would be exhaled through this place. The wound should be kept open a long while, then dressed until healed.	0.8544058
Then it is treated until it heals. I do not recommend these two types of cautery at all, except in some people and in a risky way, and leaving it alone is better in my opinion and safer if it can be done.  For the head is weakened when its natural connection is broken, as we have seen in other limbs.	But these two methods of cauterization I do not consider right except on certain men; and I regard them as risky. In my opinion, to let the patient alone is preferable and safer, if it is to be. For the head is weakened when its natural continuity is broken, as we see in other parts, and particularly when the patient's head is weak by nature.	0.7972255
Especially when the patient's head is naturally weak. The first type of cautery is safer and better in my opinion, and I use it, so use it and you will be safe, God willing.	In my opinion the first type of cauterization is safer and better; therefore use that and be safe.	0.6379757

The cautery used to cauterize the temples and the back of the head should be gentler than the cautery used to cauterize the middle of the head, and this is its picture.	I shall describe this cauterization in its own place. The cautery for the frontal prominences and occiput must be more slender than that for the middle part.	0.60375595

On cauterizing non-chronic migraines.	On the cauterization of non-chronic migraine.	0.9768453
If pain occurs in a fissure in the head with a headache, and the pain extends to the eye, then have the patient vomit with medicines that purify the head, and use all other treatments that I mentioned in the sections on diseases. If that does not work, then cauterization is done in two ways.	When there occurs pain with headache in one side of the head and the pain extends to the eye; and the patient has cleared his head with purging drugs and there has been applied the other treatment that I have mentioned in the sections on diseases, but to no avail; in this disorder cauterization is of two sorts, either with caustic or with the actual cautery.	0.832965
Cauterization with a burning medication is as follows: take one clove of garlic, peel it, and cut off its ends on both sides. Then incise the location of the pain in the temple with a wide scalpel until there is a space under the skin that can accommodate the clove.	This is the manner of cauterization with caustic: take one clove of garlic; peel it and cut both ends off; then cut open the site of the pain in the temple with a broad scalpel till there is room to contain the clove under the skin; then introduce it under the skin till it lies completely hidden.	0.8702631
Insert it under the skin until it disappears, then tighten a bandage over it tightly, and leave it for about fifteen hours. Then loosen it and remove the garlic, and leave the wound for two or three days, then apply a dressing.	Then bind up the wound tightly over it with pads and leave for fifteen hours; then unbind it, remove the garlic, and leave the wound open for two or three days; then apply cotton wool soaked in butter till it suppurates.	0.85962975
Apply cotton dipped in fat to it until the area suppurates, then treat it with ointment until it heals, God willing.  And if you wish, you can do this with some of the burning medications that I presented in the eighteenth chapter on burning medications.	Then dress with ointment till it heals. If you would rather, you may carry it out with one of the caustic drugs that I have included in the eighteenth treatise, on caustics.	0.74030995
As for cauterizing it with iron, it is done in this way: Heat the cautery iron, which is pictured here:.	The actual cauterization with iron should be done in this way: heat a cautery of this shape.	0.7216011
It is called the nail-shaped cautery because its head is like the shape of a nail, somewhat domed and with a small protuberance in its center.	It is called the claviform; the head is nailshaped in that there is a slight curvature with a small protuberance in the middle.	0.7833595
Then you place it on the painful area and hold your hand while turning the iron little by little, and the amount you burn of the skin's thickness should be about half. And lift your hand so as not to burn the artery that is underneath, causing bleeding. Then soak cotton in salt water and place it on the area and leave it for three days. Then saturate the cotton with fat, then treat it with the ointment until it heals, God willing.	Apply it then to the site of the pain, hold your hand steady and revolve it little by little. Let the thickness of skin burnt be about half; then remove your hand so as not to burn a subjacent artery, for thus a haemorrhage arises. Then soak some cotton wool in saline, apply to the place, and leave three days; then apply cotton wool with butter; then treat with ointment till it heals.	0.89676577
And if you wish, cauterize this migraine with the knife-like tip of the cautery, taking care not to sever the artery in this migraine, especially if it is not chronic.	Or if you prefer you can cauterize this migraine with the knife-edge that juts out from the cautery; but be careful not to cut an artery, specially in this kind of migraine that is non-chronic.	0.8632907

Cauterization of Chronic Migraine.	On the cauterization of chronic migraine.	0.85843426
If you treat the migraine with the aforementioned treatments mentioned in the sections on diseases and the treatment is not successful, and you see from the illness that it is not sufficiently treated by the aforementioned first cauterization with medication or cauterization by fire. Then you should heat the knife-like cautery until it becomes white-hot after you have marked the painful area with a line half a finger long or thereabouts, and you should draw your hand across it once, pulling it tightly until you sever the artery and reach the bone.	When you have treated a migraine in the way we have described and with what we have mentioned in the sections on diseases, and the treatment is ineffective, and you perceive that the malady is such that the cauterization we have mentioned before does not suffice for it, either with caustic or with the actual cautery, you should heat an edged cautery to white heat after you have marked the place with a line half a finger's breadth long or thereabouts; and impress your hand once and maintain the pressure till you cut down upon the artery and reach the bone.	0.9127877
However, you must be careful to avoid touching the jaw, which moves during chewing, lest you burn the muscle or the nerve that moves it, which would cause convulsions.	You must be careful of the mandibular joint which moves in chewing, that you do not cut the muscle or tendon that moves it, causing spasm.	0.80244195
And be cautious and attentive regarding the bleeding from the artery that you cut, for there is danger in severing it. Especially for someone who is ignorant of what to do and is not experienced and practiced, it is better to abandon the procedure.	Have the utmost care of haemorrhage from the artery you have cut, for the occurrence of that is dangerous, specially with one who does not know what to do, having no experience or practice; it is better to refrain from operating.	0.8479271
And the management of bleeding arising from the artery will be mentioned in its proper place in the book, God willing. If you see a condition that this cauterization does not address...	We shall later on mention a treatment for accidental haemorrhage of the artery, in due detail, in its proper place in this book.	0.5232959
And if you see that the patient's body can tolerate it, cauterize him in the middle of the head, as we have described, and treat the wound until it heals, God willing.	But if you see that this cautery is not enough for this disorder and you see that the patient is of bodily fitness for it, cauterize him in the middle of the head as we have described, and treat the wound till healed.	0.7339364
And if you wish, use the cautery that we mentioned in the chapter on arterial hemorrhage with the two-bladed cautery iron, for it is a better and more effective cautery than this.	If you prefer, employ that cauterization which we have described in the chapter on the extraction of an artery, with the cautery of two blades; for that is a cauterization better and more effective than this.	0.8409755

If an earache occurs due to cold and is treated with laxatives and all the other treatments that we mentioned in the Classification, and the pain does not go away, then heat the cautery iron called "the point," which is pictured here.	When the ear gets a pain from the cold and is treated with laxatives and other medicine as mentioned in its section and the pain nevertheless persists, heat the cautery termed 'punctate'.	0.8054596
Then, after heating it, cauterize with it around the entire ear, as you would circle it, or around both ears if the pain is in both. And keep the cautery a little away from the base of the ear after marking the spot with ink, and the cauterization should be about ten dots in each ear, or thereabouts.  Then treat the spots until they heal, God willing.	Then after it has been heated prick with it in a circle right round the ear, or around both if there is pain in both, after the place has been marked with ink; the cauterizations being a little away from the ear. Let the cauterization be of ten punctures or thereabouts round each. Then dress the places till healed.	0.9131267

On Cauterizing Lockjaw.	Cauterization of the twisted mouth.	0.4377733
Lockjaw that is treated with cautery is only of the type that arises from phlegm, as I mentioned in the classifications of diseases.	The twisting of the mouth which is curable with the cautery is of that nature which arises from phlegm, as we have already noticed in the sections on sicknesses.	0.6856512
Avoid cauterizing the type that occurs from dryness and spasm of the nerve.	But cauterization is to be carefully avoided in that type which is due to dryness or spasm of the tendon.	0.67836225
When you have treated this type of lockjaw with irrigations, errhines, and gargles, and your treatment has not been effective, it is appropriate to cauterize the patient with three cauterizations. One at the base of the ear, the second a little below his temple, and the third at the joining of the lips.	When this kind of deformity has been treated with electuaries, errhines, and gargles, and your treatment is ineffective, you should use three cauterizations: one at the root of the ear; the second a little below the temple; and the third at the junction of the lips.	0.8773452
And make your cauterization on the side opposite the diseased side, because the relaxation will occur on the side that appears healthy.	Let your cauterization be on the opposite side to the affected side, for the relaxation will arise in the side which seems normal.	0.8230538
The method of cauterization is that you cauterize with a cautery opposite the upper tip of the ear, a little below the horn of the head, and another on the temple, and its length should be the length of the thumb.	The form taken by the cauterization is that you burn him a little below the frontal prominence, on a level with the upper tip of the ear, and also on the temple the length of the thumb; carry the burning to a depth of about half the thickness of the skin.	0.76863253
Bring down your cautery until you burn about half the thickness of the skin, and this is the image of the cautery, and it is a type of scalpel, the image of which has been presented previously, except that it is a little finer, as you see. The scalpel should be slightly thicker, then treat the area as mentioned previously until it heals, God willing.	The shape of the cautery. It is a variety of the bladed cautery such as has already been described, but is rather more slender as you see. Its blade should have a certain thickness. Then dress the place with what we have mentioned till healed.	0.64146495

If the stroke becomes chronic and you have treated it with what we have mentioned and your treatment has not been successful and the patient does not have a fever, then cauterize him with four cauterizations. On each side of his head a cauterization, and a cauterization in the middle of the head as we have mentioned, and a cauterization at the back of the head as previously stated.	When an apoplexy has lasted a long while and has been treated by those methods we have given and your treatment has been ineffective but the patient has no fever, then burn him with four cauterizations: one on each frontal prominence; one in the middle of his head as we have described; and one at the back of the head as has been said.	0.8254736
The description of the cauteries is as above.  He may also be cauterized with a cautery on the mouth of the stomach, which would be more effective. Then treat as above.	The shape of the cauteries to be as before. He may also be given one burn over the cardia of the stomach; that will be more efficacious. Then treat as described.	0.8024582

Then his entire head is shaved, and a mustard plaster, written about in the chapter on plasters, is applied to his occiput several times. This is a type of cautery.	Then let his whole head be shaved and apply a mustard plaster to the hinder part as described in the treatise on plasters. That should be applied several times as it is a kind of cauterization; do it in the very way described there.	0.82203746
And do this in the exact order which I have mentioned there. If he is cured by this, then fine. Otherwise, cauterize him three times on the occiput, arranged in a row from the top of the head to the bottom of the neck.	If he is cured, well and good; but if not, burn him with three cauterizations on the back of the head, arranging them in a row downward from the upper part of the head to the base of the neck; and make an interval between each pair of one finger's breadth. Then treat as aforesaid.	0.7735405
Make the distance between each cauterization the width of a finger, then treat the cauterization as described previously.  If you want to increase it, and the patient can tolerate it, cauterize him in the middle cauterization.	Then treat as aforesaid. If you wish to add to these cauterizations and the patient be fit to bear it, give him a burn in the middle; and if still more, then burn him on the two frontal prominences.	0.6458477
If you want to increase it, cauterize him on the two horns. Then treat him until he recovers.  And the cautery iron should be olive-shaped, in the form which was described previously.	Then dress till healed. Let the cautery be an olivary as described before.	0.50303686

It is necessary to begin by purifying the head with irises and what we have mentioned, then shave the patient's head. Then cauterize him with a cauterization in the middle of the head, a cauterization on each "horn" of the head, and a cauterization on the back of the head.	Purgation of the head should come first, with electuaries and the other things we have mentioned. Then shave the patient's head; and then burn him with one cauterization in the middle of the head and one on either frontal prominence and one on the occiput, and three on the vertebrae of the neck.	0.7330594
And three on the vertebrae of the neck.  If you need, in the case of general bodily weakness, more than that, and the patient can tolerate it, and the illness is severe and persistent, cauterize him with four cauterizations on the vertebrae of his back. Cauterize deeply so that you burn most of the skin, then lift your hand. Treat him according to what was mentioned previously until he recovers, God willing.  And the cautery iron should be olive-shaped.	And if the malady of flaccidity of the body require still more and the patient be fit to bear it, and his disease be severe and have a strong hold on him, burn him with four more cauterizations on his dorsal vertebrae and carry the cautery to burn almost through the thickness of the skin; then remove your hand and treat him in the aforesaid manner till he is healed.

Only the epileptic whose epilepsy is caused by phlegm should be cauterized.  First, his brain should be cleansed with strong purgatives and all the other treatments that we mentioned in the appropriate section, if the patient is an adult and can tolerate taking the medications.	The epileptic who may be cauterized is he whose epilepsy arises from phlegm. When the patient is an adult and can stand taking the drugs, he should first purify his brain by great electuaries and the rest of the treatment mentioned in that section.	0.8550259
If, however, he is a child who cannot tolerate medications, he should use gargles and masticatories that cleanse the brain for many days beforehand, along with improving his diet.	But if it be a boy unable to tolerate the drugs he should employ gargles and medicaments to chew, to clear his brain, for several days beforehand, with an improvement in his diet.	0.87910736
Then his head is shaved, and then cauterize him with a single cautery in the middle of the head, as described previously in the instructions, and another cautery at the back of his head. And on each side of his head, a cauterization. If the patient is strong and can tolerate it, cauterize him with the cauterizations mentioned for the one who suffers from hemiplegia and looseness of the body on the vertebrae of the neck and vertebrae of the back.  The cautery should be olive-shaped, as previously described.	Then let his head be shaved and burn him with the single cauterization on the middle of the head in the manner described before, and with one cauterization on the occiput, and one on each frontal prominence; and, if the patient be fit and able to bear it, add those additional cauterizations on the cervical and dorsal vertebrae that we have already described for paralysis and for flaccidity. The cautery should be olivary, the shape before described.	0.89180565

When the cause of the melancholy be corrupt humours and a thick phlegm, burn him with those cauterizations mentioned in the case of the paralytic.	0.7907845
If the cause of melancholy is an excess inclining toward black bile, and the patient's body is moist, then make him drink what purifies his brain, as preceded in the classification.	If the cause of the melancholy be a redundance of humour turning to black bile, and the patient's body be humid, make him drink that which will purge his head as described in a previous section.	0.90987086
Then shave the patient's head, then make a well-fitted cake of linen, like a circle, then lower it to the middle of his head, with the patient sitting cross-legged, holding it from each side; then take one pound of old sheep tallow.	Then shave the patient's head and apply a compact ring-bandage of linen and put it round the middle of his head. Have him sit cross-legged, held firmly on all sides.	0.7906349
Then heat it over the fire with a moderate heat, as much as the finger can bear when inserted into it, then empty it onto the middle of his head, within the circle, and leave it until it cools.  Do this to the patient once every week, along with all of his other good regimens, until he recovers, God willing.	Then take a pound of stale sheep's butter and warm it on the fire to a moderate heat so that a finger put in can bear it; then pour it out on the middle of the head inside the circle of the bandage and leave it till it has cooled. Do this once a week with other efficacious treatment till he is cured.	0.82073796
And if you wish, cauterize him with many small, dotted burns without holding your hand on the cautery, rather, it should be a quick touch.  For this type of cautery moistens the brain moderately.	If you wish, burn him with multiple small puncture cauterizations; nor press long on the cautery but let this cauterization be only just punctured. For this kind of cauterization will moderately moisten the brain.	0.7418893

If you ascertain the beginning of watery eyes by the signs mentioned in the classification, then hasten to have the patient drink what cleanses his head and protects him from all moistures, and have him sweat in the bath while fasting for several days.	When by those signs I have mentioned in the relevant section there is brought to your notice the beginning of a cataract of the eye, start with draughts for the patient such as shall cleanse his head; and guard him from all humidities. Make him also sweat for some days, fasting, in the bath.	0.80097675
Then have him shave his head and cauterize it in the middle of the head, then cauterize him twice on the temples if the beginning of the watering is in both eyes, or on one side if it is in one eye.

On cauterizing the eyelid.	On cauterization of the eyelid when the eyelashes are turned inwards, irritating the eye.	0.52918255
If its lashes turn inward so that they prick the eye, then cauterization is of two types. Either cauterization by fire or cauterization by caustic medication. As for cauterizing with fire, you instruct the patient before that to leave his lashes, if he is one of those who plucks them, so that they grow long and even.	The cauterization is of two kinds, by fire and by caustic. Cauterization by fire will be thus: tell the patient previously, if he is one of those who pluck the lashes, to let them grow till they are long and straight; and if during growth they irritate him, bind the eyes with a fillet so as not to move till they have grown.	0.8498453
If they prick him as they grow, you bind his eyes with a bandage so that they do not move until they grow.  When they have grown and become even, place the patient’s head in your lap, then mark the eyelid with ink in the shape of an ace of spades.	When they have grown and are straight, put the patient's head in your lap and mark upon the eyelid with ink the shape of a myrtle leaf, beginning near the lashes.	0.65582633
The beginning of the mark should be close to the lashes.  Then place under the eyelid cotton soaked in egg white or in psyllium, then heat an iron cautery, the shape of which is this.	Then apply cotton wool soaked in egg-white or mucilage of psyllium seeds. Then heat a cautery of this form.	0.6568898
Then cauterize on the shape that you marked, little by little, in many passes, until the surface of the skin, which is in the shape of the ace of spades, is entirely burned, especially its surface. And the sign of your work being correct is that you see the eyelid has curled up and the hair has lifted away from the flesh of the eye.	Then burn over the shape marked out, slowly, with many small strokes, till the whole surface of the skin marked out to the shape of the myrtle leaf be cauterized, specially the outer part of it. It will show the correctness of your work if you see the eyelid contracted and the lashes risen away from the white of the eye.	0.84279084
Then lift your hand and leave it for three days. Then apply cotton with fat to it until the eschar comes off. Then treat it with the ointment until it heals, God willing. If any of the hair returns after a time and the eyelid relaxes,	Then remove your hand and let him be for three days. Then apply cotton wool soaked in butter till the scab falls off; then treat the place with ointment till healed.	0.8248671
repeat the cauterization on that place as you did the first time. If the hair is on the lower eyelid, cauterize it until it returns to its natural place and the hair does not prick the eye. As for cauterization with a caustic medication, you should instruct the patient to leave the lashes alone until they lengthen and become even.	But if after an interval there be a return of the same condition of the eyelash and of drooping of the eyelid, repeat the cauterization in the same place just as you did before. And if it be in the lower lid cauterize this also till it falls back to its normal position and the hairs do not irritate the eye. This is the method of burning with caustic: bid the patient let the lashes grow long and straight; then make the shape of a myrtle leaf out of paper.	0.79487735
Then make from paper the shape of the ace of spades. Then take some of the usual soap and some quicklime, a dirham's weight or so of each one, then grind them together thoroughly. Do this quickly, lest it dry. Then spread some of it on the paper that you made in the shape of the ace of spades and place it on the eyelid of one or both eyes. Place under the eye cotton soaked in egg white, with the patient's head in your lap.	Then take of common soap and of quicklime of each the weight of a drachm or thereabouts and beat them well together rapidly lest the mass get cold; then spread this on the paper shaped like a myrtle leaf and apply to the eyelid of one or both eyes; place also under the eye cotton wool soaked in egg-white; the patient's head being in your lap.	0.8757792
Place your index finger on top of the medication and press it slightly while moving it whenever the patient feels the stinging of the medication, because it will feel like a burning fire. As long as he feels the stinging, leave the medication on and move it with your finger. When the stinging stops, remove the medication and wash the eye with water.	Place your forefinger on the caustic and press it down a little and move it about according as the patient feels the bite of the caustic; for he will feel it sting like fire.	0.74089587
Look, and if you see that the eyelid has been lifted as it is lifted when cauterized with fire or cut, then [it is done]; otherwise, reapply the medication to the place where the medication did not take effect and did not turn black, until you have completed your work and the eye is lifted. Then place the cotton with the grease on it until the irritation from the burn subsides.	While the stinging lasts, let the caustic remain on and move it about with your finger; and when the stinging dies down take away the caustic and wash the eye with water; then look, and if you see the eyelid raised up as by a blepharoplasty, either by fire or by incision, good. If not, repeat the caustic application in the place that the drug has not affected and which has not gone black, until your operation is complete and the eyelid draws together.	0.77244717
Then treat it with the palm ointment or another until it heals.  And it is necessary for you, during the procedure, to be extremely careful that nothing of the medication falls into the eye. If the eyelid loosens after a few days, and we fear something of the hair in the eye...	If not, repeat the caustic application in the place that the drug has not affected and which has not gone black, until your operation is complete and the eyelid draws together. Then apply cotton wool with butter till the crust of the burn falls away; then treat with Palm ointment or the like till it be healed. But in your operative procedure take the utmost care lest the least bit of caustic get into the eye.	0.6724926
Then reapply the medication to that specific spot on the eyelid that has loosened, just as you did before, and then treat it until it heals. And this is the shape of the ace of spades.	And if, after some days, the eyelid be relaxed and some eyelash irritate the eye, then repeat the application, particularly in that part of the lid that has dropped, in the same manner as before; and treat till cured. This is the shape of the myrtle leaf.	0.663622
And know that people's eyes differ in size, small and large, so your cauterization should be according to that. And the correct method is not hidden from someone who has practice in this craft.	You should know that the human eye varies in size; so let your contracture be in proportion to this. The right procedure is well known to him who has experience in this art.	0.73686194

If you treat the fistula with what we mentioned in the sections on diseases and your treatment is not successful, then it should be cauterized in this manner.	When you have treated a fistula in those ways mentioned in the sections on diseases, without success, it should be cauterized after this manner.	0.8789748
You order the ill person to place his head in your lap, and an assistant holds his head in front of you, holding it so that he does not move or shake his head.	Bid the patient put his head in your lap; and let an assistant hold his head in front of you without moving or stirring.	0.888019
Then you place cotton moistened in egg white or in psyllium seed husks on his eyes, then you heat the cautery, which is pictured here.	Then place on his eyes cotton wool damped with egg-white or mucilage of psyllium seeds. Then heat a cautery shaped thus.	0.87779856
It is hollowed out like a tube of eagle feathers on one end, which is used for cauterizing, and if you wish, it can be open on the other end, and if you wish, it can be solid like a probe, except that this hollow one is better for your work, God willing.	It should be hollow and in shape like a fine tube, like an eagle's quill, at the one end that is used as a cautery. And if you wish it may be perforated to the other extremity; or it can be solid like a probe. But this hollow instrument will be better for your operation.	0.8164643
Then you squeeze the fistula if it is open and the pus comes out of it and you dry it, or if it is not open, you open it and extract its pus, then at that time you place the cautery on it, and it is very hot, and you hold it with your hand until it reaches the bone.	Then press on the fistula if it be open and get the matter out of it and wipe it away; or if it is not open, then open it. Then apply to it the cautery, which should be very hot, and press it in with your hand till it reaches the bone.	0.8732339
And move your hand slightly away from the eye towards the nose when cauterizing, so that your hand does not err or the patient becomes agitated, and the cautery falls on the corner of the eye and ruins it. If you reach the bone on the first cauterization, then stop, otherwise, repeat the cauterization a second time if you need to.	While you are burning keep the hand away from the eye slightly toward the nasal side, lest your hand slip or the patient draw away so that you put the cautery into the ball of the eye and destroy it. And if you reach the bone at the first cauterization, good; if not, repeat the cauterization if necessary.	0.909057
Leave it for three days, then apply cotton with oil to it, and treat it with the desiccating ointment until it heals. If forty days pass and it does not heal, then apply the sharp, corrosive medication to it until the bone is exposed and scrape it as will be mentioned in its chapter, God willing.	Leave it a few days, then put on cotton wool with butter and treat with hygroscopic ointment till it heals. And should forty days have passed and it does not heal, apply a sharp corrosive ointment so as to expose the bone, and strip it as will be explained in the appropriate chapter.	0.8392244
Another method for cauterizing fistulas mentioned by some of the predecessors is that you treat the site of the fistula by incising it, then you place a thin funnel into the incision itself. This is its image.	Another method of cauterizing a fistula is that which some of the Ancients mentioned: apply yourself to the site of the fistula and incise it; then insert into the incision a fine funnel, this being the figure of it, and pour into it a drachm of molten lead; and keep your hand on the funnel, holding it firm all the time, and do not let the patient move at all, lest the molten lead run into his eyes.	0.6529197
And you pour into it the equivalent of a dirham's weight of molten lead, and you hold the funnel firmly in your hand, tight and secure, and the patient must not move at all, lest the molten lead spill into his eye. And it is necessary to put cotton soaked in egg white or water over the patient's eye.	Then you should put cotton wool soaked in egg-white or water upon the patient's eye.	0.4633868
Indeed, the lead burns the site of the fistula and heals it wonderfully. If the fistula heals with the cauterization and treatment we mentioned, then fine. Otherwise, it is necessary to use perforation of the nose and redirect the fistula to the nasal passage, as will be discussed in its specific section.	For the lead cauterizes the site of the fistula and acts as a marvellous cure. If the fistula heals by the cauterization and medication we have described, well and good; otherwise perforation of the nose will undoubtedly have to be undertaken to lead the fistula into the meatus of the nose, by the technique that will come in its own place.	0.85998994

A fissure often occurs in the lip, called the harelip, especially in the lips of children, as it frequently happens. If you treat this fissure with what we mentioned in the section on incisions, and the treatment is not successful, then heat a small knife-shaped cautery iron in this manner.	There often occur fissures in the lip to which are given the name 'hairs'; they are particularly common in the lips of boys. When you have ineffectually treated these clefts with those things that we have mentioned in their section, then heat a small edged cautery of this shape.	0.80709636
Its concavity should be like the thinness of a knife. Then place it hot, quickly, into the fissure itself, until the cautery reaches the depth of the fissure. Then treat it with qayruti until it heals, God willing.	The hollow should be as sharp as a knife. Then quickly place it, hot, right on the fissure till the burning has reached the depth of the lip.

If a swelling appears at the base of the gums, or in the palate, or at the roots of the molars, then it suppurates and bursts, and the flow of pus becomes a fistula, then you treat it but the treatment does not succeed, then you should heat a cautery iron of a size that fits in the fistula.	When there comes a tumour in the base of the gums or in the palate or in the roots of the molar teeth, and it becomes purulent and breaks out and a fistula comes from the flow of pus, and you have treated this without effect, you should heat a cautery of a size to fit the fistula; then introduce it hot into the fistula opening; and continue the pressure with it hot until the iron, still hot, reaches the hollow and the extremity of it.	0.8384374

On Cauterizing Toothache.	On cauterization for toothache.	0.8523905
If the toothache is caused by cold, or if there are worms in it, and the treatment with medications is not effective, then cauterization is done in two ways: either cauterization with fat or cauterization with fire.	When the toothache arises on account of cold, or if there be a worm in the tooth, and medical treatment does not avail, then cauterization should be undertaken. There are two ways of doing this, one with butter, the other with the cautery.	0.82531047
Cauterization with fat is as follows: You take cow's fat and boil it in an iron ladle or in a shell. Then you take cotton and wrap it on the end of a probe, then dip it in the boiling fat and quickly place it on the aching tooth and hold it until it cools.	Cauterization with butter is done thus: take cows' butter and let it boil in an iron ladle or pan; then take cotton wool, wind it round the top of a probe, and dip it in the boiling butter and quickly apply it to the aching tooth and hold it there till cold.	0.887102
Then you repeat it several times until the strength of the fire reaches the root of the tooth. And if you wish, you can dip wool or cotton in cold fat and place it on the aching tooth, and place the heated iron on top of it until the fire reaches the bottom of the tooth.	Repeat this a number of times till the power of the fire reaches the root of the tooth. If you prefer, dip wool or cotton in cold butter and put it on the aching tooth, then on top of that apply the hot iron until the heat of the fire reaches the root of the tooth.	0.90105134
Cauterization with fire is as follows: You use a copper or iron tube, somewhat thick so that the heat of the fire does not reach the patient's mouth.  Then, heat the cautery iron which appears in the illustration and place it on the tooth itself, and hold your hand steady until the cautery iron cools. Do this several times.	The actual cautery is administered thus: take a tube of bronze or iron with some thickness in the body of it so that the intensity of the fire does not reach the patient's mouth. Then heat a cautery whose figure will be given shortly, and apply it to the tooth itself and hold your hand until the cautery gets cold.	0.87235993
The pain will go away either that same day or the next.  Following the cauterization, the patient should fill his mouth with good quality fat, hold it for an hour, and then spit it out.  This is an image of the cautery iron.	Do this several times over; the pain will certainly depart the same day or the next. After this cauterization the patient is to fill his mouth with good butter and keep it in for a while, then spit it out. This is the figure of the cautery.	0.79711735
Cauterize with whichever end you want and according to what is possible. This is a picture of the tube.	Cauterize with whichever end you prefer according to circumstances. This is the figure of the tube.	0.80586934

If the hemorrhoids are due to phlegm and cold humors, and they do not respond to ripening with medications, and you want rapid ripening, then heat the hollow cautery iron, which is depicted here, with both ends open.	When the tumours arise from phlegm and cold humidities and are not to be dispersed with medicines and you wish for a rapid dispersal, then heat the hollow cautery of which this is the figure. It is open at both ends to give exit for the fumes of burning from the other end.	0.7094592
So that the smoke may come out of the other end during cauterization, place it, heated, upon the swelling itself, once and a second time if needed, until you reach the depth of the swelling.  If the swelling is small, then make the cautery the size of the swelling.	It is open at both ends to give exit for the fumes of burning from the other end. Place it hot, right on the tumour, once, or twice if need be, till you reach the bottom of the tumour. If the tumour be small, suit the cautery to the size of the tumour.	0.7956252
Then leave it for three days and apply to it cotton dipped in fat until what was burned by the fire is gone, then treat it with ointment and bandages until it heals, God willing.

Take care that the cautery does not pierce through to the gullet, and burn no more than half of the thickness of the skin.

If the cough and disease of the lung are due to cold humors, and the patient does not have fever or phthisis, and the disease is chronic, then cauterize him with two cauteries above the clavicles in the soft, empty, depressed areas, and another cautery in the middle of the chest between the breasts.	When the cough and pulmonary disease arise from cold humidities and the patient suffers from no fever or wasting but the disease is chronic, sear him with two cauterizations over the two clavicles, in the soft depressions ; and with another cauterization in the mid-line of the chest between the breasts.	0.86525023
And the cautery should be nail-shaped in the form that was described previously. And if you wish, let your cauterization be by puncture with the cautery that is called the "puncturing cautery," whose form was previously presented in the puncturing for earache. And the punctures should be from thirty punctures to about that number.	And if you prefer, make punctate cauterizations with the cautery called 'punctate'; its shape has already been described under pricking for earache. The punctures should number upwards of thirty.	0.84852594
Then treat him with what was mentioned previously until he recovers.

Then treat as aforesaid until healed.

If the head of the humerus is dislocated due to slippery humors, or it does not stabilize when reduced from its dislocation, so that this becomes a habit for it - it is reduced and then dislocated at the slightest movement that occurs, as we have witnessed - then the jaw should first be reduced. Then the patient lies on his back or on the healthy side, then you lift the skin that is inside the armpit upwards with the fingers of your left hand if the joint is dislocated inwards.	When the head of the humerus is dislocated on account of the synovial fluid or when it does not remain in the correct position after the dislocation has been set, so that this becomes a regular occurrence—it is set and then dislocates with the least movement, as we have ourselves seen; you must first set the luxation, then make the patient lie down on his back or on his sound side; then with the fingers of the left hand lift up the skin of the axilla if the joint has dislocated downwards.	0.86907375
Then you heat the cautery with the two skewers, whose image is this.	Then heat a cautery provided with two spits in this manner.	0.69354427
Then you cauterize the skin with it until you penetrate it to the other side, and the shape of the cautery mark is four burns, and it may be cauterized with a cautery with three skewers, so the shape of the cautery mark will then be six burns, and the skewers are the thinness of the file.	Then with that burn through the fold of skin till you have perforated to the other side, getting four cauterizations. The cautery may be of three prongs and then the form of the cauterization will be six burns. The prongs should be of the fineness of a probe.	0.89036715

One cauterization below the xiphoid process the width of a finger with a nail-shaped cautery, and two cauterizations below, on the sides of the single cauterization, so that the shape of the cauterizations is like a triangle, and further apart so that they do not join when they suppurate, and the depth of the cautery should be two-thirds of the thickness of the skin, and the shape of the cauterizations should be...	When cold and many humidities get into the stomach, so that its constitution is disturbed and much fluxion has come to it, and a variety of treatment has been tried to no effect, the patient must be put on his back with legs and arms outstretched; then give him a threefold cauterization: one a finger's breadth below the hollow of the chest with the claviform cautery; and two below and to the sides of the first cauterization, so that it has a triangular appearance; but there should be some distance between each lest they run together when suppuration sets in.

If pain arises from the liver due to coldness and moisture or due to thick wind, so that it deviates excessively from its natural temperament, and the patient is treated with what we mentioned in the division, but it is not effective. The patient should lie on his back, and three cauterizations should be marked with ink in this shape and this exact size on the liver, below the cartilage where the human elbow ends.	When there is pain in the liver from cold and humidity or from thick vapour, so there is a severe disturbance of its natural constitution, and the patient has been treated as prescribed in the appropriate section but with no effect, the patient should lie back, and you should mark with ink the places of three cauterizations, in this form and exactly of this size below the costal cartilages, where the elbow reaches.	0.87095654
And there should be the thickness of a finger between each cautery mark, and the cautery should be lengthwise along the body, straight, and do not press your hand with the cautery iron.	Let there be a finger's breadth between each pair of cauterizations and let the burning be straight along the length of the body. Do not press the cautery hard with your hand.	0.8050477
And the amount you burn of the skin's thickness should be half of it, no more, and the patient should be standing on his feet; if he is not standing, then he should be lying down with his legs extended and his arms raised, and this is the image of the cautery iron.	Let the thickness of the skin you burn be half its thickness, not more; and let the patient be standing on his feet during the cauterization. Alternatively he may be recumbent with legs outstretched and arms raised. Figure of the cautery.	0.7991233
You can cauterize these marks with the scalpel cautery if you have gentleness and skill in the craft, and be careful not to go too deep in the cauterization, burning the entire skin and burning the abdomen and reaching the intestines, for the skin there is thin, so be aware of it.	You will also be able to do these cauterizations with the edged cautery when you have craft and facility in the art.

When there is an abscess in the liver and you are anxious to know if the tumour is in the body of the liver or in its capsule: if it is in the substance of the liver, the patient will be suffering from a feeling of heaviness and no very acute pain.	0.8248386
And if it is in the membrane of the liver, there will be severe sharpness with the pain. If you see that it has exhausted the physicians' treatment, then the patient should lie on his back, then mark the swollen area with ink.	But if it is in the capsule of the liver there will be the sharpest intensity of pain and you will see that it has baffled the doctors. Then the patient should lie back on his neck; then mark the place of the swelling with ink.	0.83773386
Then heat the cautery in the fire, which is the cautery that resembles an awl, and this is its image. And cauterize it with it one cauterization until you burn all the skin and reach the membrane with the cautery until all the pus comes out. Then treat it with the treatment of abscesses until it heals.	Then heat the cautery in the fire, this being the cautery resembling a probe, of this form, and with that make one cauterization till the whole thickness of the skin is burnt through, finishing up at the capsule so that all the purulent matter comes out. Then apply the treatment for wounds.	0.88995224
This type of cautery should not be used except by someone who has long been trained in the art of medicine, and has experienced these diseases repeatedly. Only then can he proceed with such a procedure. Leaving it [untreated] is, in my opinion, better.	This kind of cauterization should not be employed except by one who has a long experience of the medical art and who has frequent practice at dealing with this kind of disease.

On Cauterizing Warts.	On cauterization for pleurisy.	0.6840282
The ancients mentioned cauterizing cold warts with birthwort roots in this manner: Take one of the longest dry roots of long birthwort that you can find, about the thickness of a finger. Then dip it in oil and set it on fire. Then cauterize once between the connection of the clavicle and the neck, and twice lightly below the jugular veins, inclined towards the area below the chin, and twice deeply above the breasts between the third and fourth ribs.	The Ancients mentioned a cauterization for cold pleurisy by means of the roots of the long birthwort, in this fashion: you take the longest you can find of the roots of the long dry birthwort, and of the thickness of one finger; dip this in oil and light it at the fire; then burn the patient with one cauterization in the space between the junction of the neck with the clavicle; and two small cauterizations below the jugular veins, inclining slightly toward the region below the beard.	0.8606273
And also cauterize twice between the fifth and sixth ribs, inclined slightly towards the back, and once in the middle of the chest, and once above the stomach, and three times on the back: once between the shoulder blades and twice on the sides of the back below the cauterization that is between the shoulders.	And two big cauterizations above the nipples in the space between the third and fourth ribs; and two more between the fifth and sixth ribs, tending slightly toward the back; and another in the middle of the chest; and another above the stomach; and three more behind, namely, one between the scapulae and two on either side of the dorsal spine below the one between the scapulae.	0.8445054
And you should not deepen your hand with the cautery, but it should be on the surface of the skin, a superficial burn. Some of the ancients mentioned that some people used an iron cautery, similar to a probe, and they heated it and inserted it between the ribs until it reached the wart itself.	It is not necessary to cauterize deeply, but let it be a mere hint, in the outer skin. Now one of the Ancients mentioned that there were some people who used an iron cautery shaped like a probe, and introduced it red hot into the intercostal space until it reached the abscess itself and evacuated the pus, as we have mentioned under tumour of the liver.	0.7541939
And the pus comes out as we mentioned in the case of liver tumors. This reckless cauterization is very dangerous; either the patient dies immediately, or a fistula develops in the area that cannot be healed.	But in this perforation with the cautery there is a danger either that the patient may die on the spot or that an incurable fistula may arise at the place.	0.7062928

On Cauterizing the Spleen.	On cauterization of the spleen.	0.9008154
If you have treated a disease of the spleen with the treatments mentioned in the section on partitioning, and your treatment was not successful, cauterization is done in three ways, all of which are correct. One of them is to cauterize it three or four times in a row along the length of the spleen.	When you have treated disease of the spleen by the means that we have mentioned in the section and your treatment is ineffectual, there will be three ways of cauterization, each of which will be correct. One is to make three or four cauterizations in a row over the long axis of the spleen like the cauterization of the liver, a figure of which has been given above.	0.8882108
in the shape of the liver cauterizations, the form of which has been presented, with the space between each cauterization being the width of a finger or slightly more. The form of the cautery is the same as that mentioned for cauterizing the liver.  Do not insert your hand deeply with the cautery. The patient's position is lying on their back.	Let there be between each pair of burns a finger's breadth or a little more. Let the cautery be of the same shape as described above under cauterization of the liver. Do not put pressure on the cautery. Have the patient's body supine.	0.77593434
The other approach is at the elbow. You lift the skin opposite the spleen where the patient's left elbow ends. Your lifting of the skin should be across the width of the body so that the cauterizations fall along the length of the body.	The second method is to heat the cautery provided with two prongs, described in the chapter on dislocation of the shoulder. Lift up the skin over the spleen at the level of the patient's left elbow; and let the fold of skin lie across the patient's body so that the cauterizations will fall longitudinally.	0.7675449
Then you insert the two skewers, very hot, until they penetrate the skin on the other side. Then you remove the cautery, making four cauterizations. If you wish, you can cauterize with the other cautery, which has three skewers.	Then push in the two prongs, well heated, till you have pierced the skin from side to side. Then take out the cautery; and there are four cauterizations. Or if you prefer you can burn with the other cautery, of three prongs.	0.88111496
Then treat the cauterization site after you leave it to drain pus for many days, as this is more effective than all the preceding treatments.	Then dress the site of cauterization after you have allowed pus to run therefrom for many days. This is more effective than any of the preceding treatments.	0.9132521

On Cauterization for Ascites.	On the cauterization of dropsy.	0.65645087
Cauterization is only beneficial in the case of tympanitic ascites specifically. If you have treated the patient with ascites with the various treatments that we mentioned in the Classification, and your treatment has not been effective, then it is appropriate to cauterize him with four cauterizations around the navel and one cauterization on the stomach.	The cautery is particularly effective in ascites.	0.47407472
And another cauterization on the liver and a cauterization on the spleen and two cauterizations behind his back between the vertebrae, one opposite his chest and another opposite his stomach. The depth of the cauterization should be close to the thickness of the skin. Then you leave the cauterization open, draining pus for a long time.	When you have, without effect, treated a dropsical person with the various measures mentioned in the section on diseases, you should sear with four cauterizations around the umbilicus, and one over the stomach, another over the liver, and another over the spleen, and two behind his back between the vertebrae, one at the level of the breast and one at the level of the stomach; and let the burn be almost skin-deep. Then keep the burn open so that it suppurates for a long while.	0.7033702
And do not neglect the patient's treatment after cauterization with what is necessary so that it brings together the two meanings, and healing will quickly come to him.  The shape of the cautery iron with which the back is cauterized should be nail-shaped as its image preceded, and the one with which the stomach is cauterized should be olive-shaped.	Do not let the patient, after cauterization, be without the necessary treatment, so that you combine both methods for him, and a cure will speedily come to him. The cautery with which his belly is cauterized should be claviform like the figure previously given; while the one with which his back is cauterized should be olivary.	0.85990953

If they swell in dropsy and fill with yellow water, it is necessary to cauterize on the dorsum of the foot in the depression between the little toe and the ring finger.	When, in the sufferer from dropsy, these swell and become full of yellowish fluid, you should cauterize the upper surface of the feet in the depression between the little and fourth toes; hold your hand upright with the cautery; do not let it slant.	0.6773525
Keep your hand steady with the cautery iron and do not twist it. Then lift your hand and do not bring it back at all, for it will drain the yellow water. The cautery iron should be of this shape:	Then remove your hand and do no more cauterization whatever; for the yellowish fluid will exude.	0.6164691
Then cauterize the legs, two cauterizations on each leg. The cauterization should be done with the knife-edge of the cautery iron and should be along the length of the leg, one below the knee and another below it towards the middle of the leg. And on each thigh, two cauterizations.	The cautery should be of this type. Then sear the legs with two cauterizations on each leg; cauterize with the bladed end of the cautery, and let it be along the length of the leg: one under the knee, the other lower than that, about the middle of the leg; and two more cauterizations over each femur.	0.8989494
Leave the cauterization open without treatment for a long time so that the water drains from it, then treat it with all that we have mentioned.

If the diarrhea is from cold and humidities, so that it weakens the retentive and digestive powers in the stomach and intestines, and it has been treated with various treatments and has not healed, and you see that the patient can tolerate cauterization and is of sufficient strength, then cauterize his stomach with a large cauterization. As preceded in the cauterization of the stomach with the circular cautery iron, and four gentle cauterizations around the navel with the gentle nail-shaped cautery iron, and a large cauterization or two cauterizations on the coccyx.	When the diarrhoea is due to frigidity and humidities so that the capacity of the stomach and intestines to hold and to digest is impaired, and this has been treated by various methods and is not cured; if you see that the patient is able to endure the cautery and is of unimpaired strength, make a big cauterization on his stomach according to the preceding instructions for cauterization of the stomach with a circular cautery; and four narrow cauterizations round his navel with the thin claviform cautery; and one or two big cauterizations in the lumbar region over the coccyx.	0.9190569
If you see that the humidities are abundant and the patient can tolerate it, then cauterize him on the pubis and cauterize him on each flank, and perhaps add two small cauterizations on the stomach near the large one, for it is a successful treatment whose benefit will not fail, God willing.	And if you see that the humidities are superabundant, and the patient fit to tolerate it, then make one cauterization over the groin and one over the hypochondrium. You may also add two small ones over the stomach near the big one. This is an effective treatment that does not fail to help.	0.7952988

When there are one or more chronic haemorrhoids in the anus arising from thick and cold humours or corrupt humidities, and they have been treated by those measures mentioned in the section, without effect, then sear the patient with three cauterizations over the lowest dorsal vertebra a little below the flat part of the back, triangularly; and one about two fingers' breadth below the navel.	0.7842284
And cauterize below the navel at a distance of two fingers. And if you estimate that his stomach has become cold, and his food is not being digested, and you see that his face is swollen, then cauterize him on the stomach with a large cauterization, as has been described before, and cauterize his liver. And another on his spleen, with a nail-shaped cautery iron. And leave the cauterization open for a while. Then treat him until he recovers, God willing.	And if you consider that his stomach has become chilled and his food not being digested, and you see his face swollen, then do one big cauterization over the stomach as previously described; and one over his liver; and another over the spleen; with the claviform cautery.

Do this once or twice over.	0.7852176
If the warts are numerous, cauterize each one as we have described. Then, treat them with suitable ointments until they are healed.

On Cauterizing Fistulas that Occur in the Anus and its Surroundings.	On the cauterization of fistulae in the anal and peri-anal regions.	0.67578965
If the patient does not respond to the incision and procedure that we described in its place and is afraid of it, he may sometimes be healed by cauterization. So, if a fistula develops in someone, and pus and corrupt humors have been flowing from it for a long time, the first thing you should do is measure it with a thin probe.	When the patient will not submit to the cutting operation we have described in its own place, and is afraid of it, he may perhaps be cured with the cautery. So when somebody gets a fistula, and pus and foul humidities have for a long while been running from it, you must first explore it with a fine probe and judge of its depth by the probe.	0.8940248
Then know the extent of its depth with the probe. Then heat the cautery that resembles the probe. Then insert it hot into the fistula itself, following the direction and depth of the fistula reached by the probe. Repeat the cauterization until all those corrupt tissues are burned, once, twice, or three times, as needed.	Then heat a spike-shaped cautery and introduce it, hot, into the fistula, in the direction of the bottom of the fistula and to the depth to which the probe entered. And repeat the cauterization till all those corrupt bodies are burnt away; once or twice or three times over, as you have need.	0.87757313
And beware of burning a nerve if there is one there, or a large vein, or if the fistula leads to the body of the bladder or to the body of the intestine.	But beware of burning a nerve should one be there, or a big blood-vessel. If the fistula penetrates to the urinary bladder or the intestine, beware of all these parts.	0.81946063
So be cautious about all these places. You should only do this if the fistula is in a fleshy area and you judge that it is not deep. Then treat the area until it heals. If the area closes and the discharge stops and it remains so for a while, know that it has healed completely.	Do this only when the fistula is in a fleshy part and you judge that it does not open into any other part. Afterwards dress the place till healed. If the place cicatrizes and the flux of humours ceases and it remains so for a long while, you may know that it is perfectly healed.	0.8202306
But if the discharge does not stop, know that it is deep, or that there is corrupt bone at its bottom, or something similar, which will be mentioned in its place.	But if the flux of humours from it is not stopped, understand that it has perforated or that at the bottom there is a piece of diseased bone or the like; which will be mentioned in its proper place.	0.846098

If pain occurs in the kidneys due to cold or thick wind, and the patient's sexual intercourse diminishes because of that, then it is appropriate to cauterize on the loins, on the kidneys themselves, a cautery on each kidney with the nail-shaped cautery iron that was mentioned earlier.  We sometimes cauterize a third time on the abdomen itself, resulting in three cauteries lined up, which is more effective.	When pain strikes the kidneys from chill or heavy vapour, and the patient's sexual vigour is impaired thereby, you should burn him right over the kidneys, once on each kidney, with the claviform cautery mentioned before. I have often burnt him with a third cauterization on the flat of the back, making three cauterizations in a line, which is most effective.	0.8363556

When there occurs in the urinary bladder a weakness and relaxation due to chill and humidities, so that the patient cannot retain his water, sear him once below his navel, on the bladder, where the pubic hair begins; burn him once also on the right side and once on the left side of the navel; and let the distance of the burn from either side be the length of the joint of the thumb.	0.847876

Viscous humors may settle in the hip joint, causing it to be displaced. A sign of this is that one leg will be longer than the other when they are measured against each other, and you will find a gap at the site of the dislocation.  The patient should be cauterized right on the hip itself, with a semi-circular cautery.	Sometimes harmful humidities reach the hip joint and result in its coming out of its place. The symptom of this is that one leg is longer than the other when one is measured against the other; and a hollow is found there [i.e. at the hip].	0.7064671
After marking with ink around the joint as it rotates, so that the joint itself falls in the center of the circle. And the cautery iron should be the one whose form was presented in the cauterization of the stomach. If this cautery iron is not available, then cauterize with three burns using the large olive-shaped cautery iron.	Then you should cauterize the patient over the hip joint itself with a circular burn, after you have marked with ink a circle round the femoral joint, so that the joint falls in the middle of the circle. The cautery should be the one whose description has already been given in cauterization of the stomach. But if you have not this cautery by you, give him three cauterizations with the larger size olivary cautery.	0.78458506

On Cauterizing Sciatica.	On cauterization for sciatica.	0.80113554
If pain occurs in the hip joint, and its cause is cold and humidities, and you have treated the patient with what we mentioned in the division, and the treatment was not successful, and it became chronic, then it is necessary to purge the patient of thick humors with purging cassia or aloe vera pills, or similar.	When pain occurs in the hip joint and is due to cold and humidities, and the patient has been treated by those means mentioned in the section, and the treatment is ineffectual, and the pain becomes chronic, the patient should be purged of the heavy humours with foetid pills or pills of tamarind or the like; then cauterize him.	0.78060156
Then cauterize him. The method of cauterization is of two types: either cauterization with burning medications or cauterization with fire. Cauterization with fire is done in many ways. One of them is to cauterize directly on the hip itself, three triangular burns, like this image.	The means of cauterization in this case is twofold: either with caustic chemicals or with fire. The actual cautery will serve for several methods.	0.6818465
Make them a suitable depth, with a distance between each burn about the thickness of a finger, and the cautery should be olive-shaped.  And it may be cauterized with one burn in the middle at the top of the hip itself, making it four burns. If you wish, cauterize it with the circle which we mentioned previously in cauterizing dislocation of the hip, one burn.	One of them is to make three cauterizations over the femoral joint itself in a triangular manner ; and let them be of a fair depth; and the space between them a finger's breadth. The cautery should be an olivary one. Sometimes there will also be one cauterization in the middle over the actual head of the femur, making four cauterizations in all. The burning may be done with the circular cautery which has been mentioned under cauterization of a dislocated hip; a single cauterization so that the circle embrace the whole joint.	0.8096445
So that the circle surrounds the entire hip and burns the entire thickness of the skin. This is the description of cauterization for sciatica if the pain is confined to the hip itself and does not extend to the thigh and leg.	Burn through the whole thickness of the skin. This is the form of cauterization for sciatica when the pain is localized in the hip joint and does not extend to the femur and the leg.	0.8368552
If it extends to the thigh and leg, cauterize two burns on the thigh at the location where the patient indicates the pain, and one burn above the heel, four fingers up on the lateral side slightly, and the cautery should be knife-shaped, and the depth of the burn should be only the thickness of the skin.	But if it extends to the femur and the leg, cauterize him over the thigh with two burns at the place where the patient indicates the pain to be; and one burn four fingers above the great tendon of the heel, a little to the outer side. The cautery should be edged, and the depth of the burn only to the thickness of the skin.	0.8972665
If he indicates that the pain extends towards the toes, cauterize where he indicated, with the point cautery, three or four times, or more if needed. And if he indicates pain below the knee, towards the leg, cauterize there, one time, with a knife-shaped cautery.	But if the patient points out that the pain reaches to the toes, then cauterize where he has indicated to you, with a punctate cautery, three or four or more perforations if he needs it. If he indicates that the pain is under the knee towards the shank, give him one burn there with the edged cautery.	0.852317
And be careful in all your cauterizations not to burn so deeply as to burn a nerve or a large artery, thus causing the patient a serious injury or chronic illness.	Be careful in all your cauterizing not to carry the cautery so far as to burn a nerve or a large artery; for thence arises grave harm, or crippling, to the patient.	0.8535056
I have seen one and a second person who were cauterized above the heel, and the cauterization was excessive, so the leg became gangrenous until the gangrene reached the foot, and it became entirely perforated, and the entire leg was ruined, and then diarrhea and death occurred afterwards. If the pain is in both sides, cauterize them both in precisely this manner.	I myself have seen more than one person cauterizing over the tendon of Achilles, the cauterization being excessive, and the leg was affected with a defluxion of humours which eventually reached the foot and the whole was riddled; after that came diarrhoea, and, after that, death. If there is pain in two places, cauterize both in this way.	0.813475
Some learned physicians have mentioned, regarding cauterization of the hip, a cautery of this description: A cup-like instrument is made of iron, its diameter being half a span, and at its mouth, the thickness of a date pit or slightly less, and inside that cup, another cup, and a third cup.	Certain learned doctors have mentioned a cauterization applicable to the hip in this manner: make a bowl of iron with a diameter of half a span; the thickness of the edge of its mouth should be that of a date-stone or a little less. Another bowl is introduced into this, and a third into that; and there is a distance between the bowls of a thumb-joint.	0.8757926
And the distance between each two cups should be about the width of a thumb joint, and the cups should be open on both sides, and their height should be about one or two thumb joints, and an iron handle is made for them, firmly attached to the cups. And this is its image.	The bowls are open on both sides; and the depth of them should be a thumb-joint or two. Make an iron handle for them firmly fitted to the bowls. Here is the figure.	0.7899308
Then heat it in the fire until it glows red and throws off sparks, then place it directly on the hip while the patient is leaning on the healthy side, and cauterize him with three circular burns at once, then leave him for three days and dress him with fat, and leave the wound open for several days.	Then heat this cautery in the fire until it is hot and sends out sparks; and so let it be applied to the hip, the patient lying on his sound side; and thus three circular cauterizations will be produced at a time. Afterwards let it be for three days; then smear with butter and leave the wound open for a while; then treat with ointment till it heals.	0.8676183
Then treat him with the ointment until he recovers.  The author of this book says: This type of cautery we rarely use because of its ugliness and the dreadfulness of its appearance and because of the few we find who can tolerate it, except that it is good cauterization for those who can bear it and for whom its location is appropriate.	The author of this book says that we very rarely employ this method of cauterization on account of the ugliness and dread appearance of it, and because we find few patients who will endure it. Nevertheless, it is one of the best cauteries for him who can endure it and is correctly treated by it.	0.78432286
As for cauterization with caustic medications, it is that you make two cups, like the ring in which the door bolt goes down, of copper or of iron.	Cauterization with caustics is thus: make two bowls like the ring into which a door-hinge descends, either of bronze or iron.	0.81412005
Their rims should be about two knuckles high, or thereabouts, and the distance between them should be about the thickness of a finger, and they should be open at the bottom and open at the top, and they should be joined together in this way.	The height of their sides should be two thumb-joints or thereabouts, and they should be separated about a finger's breadth; they should be open above and below, and joined one to another thus.	0.9074777
Then place them directly on the hip while the patient is lying on his healthy side, and tighten your hand well, then pour between the two circles the strong water, slightly warmed by fire, and hold it for the duration of an hourglass, and the patient must endure its stinging and burning, for he will feel a stinging like fire.	Then place them over the capsule of the hip joint, the patient lying upon his sound side, and press down hard; then pour caustic fluid between the two rings—it should have been heated slightly—and keep it there for the space of one hour by the sand-clock. The patient must endure the sting and heat of it (for he will find it stings like fire) till the causticity diminishes.	0.8003171
Until the stinging subsides, then lift your hand with the instrument and wipe the strong water from the entire hip with fresh water, then leave it for three days and apply fat to it until the blackness of the burn disappears, and leave it for days while the pus drains from it, for it is more effective in benefit.	Then remove your hand with the instrument and wash away the caustic from the whole capsule with pure water. Let be for three days and apply butter to it till the eschar comes away; and let the pus flow from it for a few days, for that will be more conducive to healing.	0.8186986
Then treat it with ointments until it heals. If the pain extends to the thigh or leg, make a mold for it that holds water, just as you did for the hip, and this is the description of the strong water, and I have included it in the chapter on preparing medications.	Then treat with ointment till it heals. If the pain extends to the hip joint or the leg, make a form in some material that will hold the fluid for that, just as you did for the capsule of the femur.	0.8026376
Take one part alkali salt and one part unslaked lime, crush them and place them in a new pot which has a single small hole pierced in its bottom, the size of a probe, and place another glazed pot underneath the bottom of the pot.	Now this is the description of the caustic; I have already put it in my treatise on the improvement of drugs: take of the salt of potash and quicklime, equal parts, and beat them both up well and put them into a new earthen pot, in the bottom of which you have made a small hole of a size to take a probe. Place under that pot another one, glazed.	0.6279274
Pour fresh water over the alkali and lime, enough to cover them by a finger's breadth after you have pressed them down firmly with your hand, and leave the pot until the strong water descends into the bottom glazed pot, then collect all of that water, then pour it over another batch of fresh lime and alkali.	Pour enough water on the quicklime and potash to cover them to a finger's breadth after you have pressed them well together with your hand; and leave the pot until the caustic fluid has passed down into the bottom of the glazed pot. Then collect all that fluid and pour it upon a fresh lot of lime and potash.	0.86221266
For it will then be very strong and sharp, useful in many medical procedures and in cauterizing various organs, because it acts exactly like fire.  Among the medications which also cauterize the hip are thapsia, honey of spurge flax, and lime with soap, rubbed in.	Thus will the water be very caustic indeed. This is used for many medical procedures and for the cauterization of all members, as it has the very same action as fire itself. There are other drugs too with which the capsule of the femur is cauterized, such as Thapsia and Mel Anacardinum and inunction of lime with soap.	0.7835047
Galen recounted a story about one of the ancients who treated hip pain and sciatica and greatly praised this treatment, claiming that it needed no other therapy and that it healed in one application.	Galen, quoting one of the men of old, mentions a treatment for pain in the thigh and sciatica and he makes much of it, asserting that no other treatment was necessary, and that it would heal on one application, so much so that the patient would be carried into the bath and would go out completely cured.	0.87083876
Such that a person might even be carried into the bath and come out cured.  It is that green stinking hellebore be taken, but if green is not found then take the recently dried, and it is finely ground with a little fat and placed on the hip where the pain is, or on the leg, or on the thigh.	The method is as follows: take fresh green water-cress or new dry water-cress if fresh is not to be had; beat it up well with some fat and apply it to the hip where it hurts, or to the leg or thigh, and bind up.	0.5963917
And it is bandaged and left for about three hours, or as long as the patient feels the burning sensation subsiding, then he enters the bath. When his body is moist, he enters the basin, then the pain will go away and he will be healed, God willing. If he is not healed, repeat the poultice after ten days.	Then let be for three hours or until the patient feels a diminishing of the caustic; and then let him be taken to the bath. When his body is bedewed with sweat, get him into the pool; then the pain will vanish and he will be cured. If he is not cured repeat the plaster in ten days' time and then he will be healed.	0.9004414
For he will be healed, God willing. And know that no one should use cautery with these medications except after purging the body. Dioscorides mentioned that goat dung, if cauterized with it on the sciatic nerve, benefits it.	But you must know that no one should have cauterization with these drugs except after evacuation of the bowel. Dioscorides has said that cauterization with goats' dung is beneficial for sciatica.	0.7779747
The cauterization is done in this manner: wool is taken and soaked in old oil and placed on the deep spot that is between the thumb of the hand and the forearm, and it is closer to the forearm. Then take dry goat dung.	The cauterization is carried out in this manner: take wool soaked in old oil and put it into the cleft which is between the thumb and the forearm but nearer to the forearm. Then take the dried dung of a goat and expose it to fire until it glows like a coal.	0.88373905
And ignite it with fire until it becomes an ember, then place it on the wool and leave it until it is extinguished. Then take another, and continue to do so until the sensation reaches the middle of the upper arm to the hip, and the pain subsides, God willing. This type of cautery is called dung cautery.	Place it on the piece of wool, and leave till it cools, then replace it with another, and so on until the sensation has reached the hip joint by way of the forearm, and the pain stops.

On Cauterizing Back Pain.	On cauterization for pain in the back.	0.8411797
Pain may occur in the back from many causes, either from a fall, a blow, excessive vomiting, and the like. It results from an outpouring of a cold, moist substance, and cauterization is done only for this type.	Many different causes give pain in the back. Sometimes it happens from a fall or a blow, or from excessive evacuation or the like. It may also be due to an influx of humid matter. Cauterization is only to be employed in this last case, which arises from an influx of cold matter.	0.8480196
That which is from an outpouring of a cold substance, it is necessary, after emptying the patient with حبّ المنتن (habb al-muntin) and the like, to cauterize on their back where the pain is, three rows across the width of the area, after marking the place with ink. In each row, five cauterizations or more, according to what you see of the patient's tolerance and strength.	When the patient has been purged with foetid pills or the like, he should be cauterized in his back where the pain is, over the breadth of the flat of the back, after the place has been marked with ink, with three rows of cauterizations, five in each, or more, in proportion to what you see of the patient's endurance and strength.	0.76660705
And the cauterization should be with a point cautery, and if you wish, cauterize it three or four times with a medium nail-shaped cautery, in this manner.	Use the punctate cautery. If you like, you may give him three or four cauterizations with the middle-sized claviform cautery.	0.69001716

On Cauterizing the Beginning of a Hump.	On cauterization of early hunchback.	0.7442302
This ailment frequently occurs in young children, and the sign of its beginning in the child is that he experiences shortness of breath when standing and moving, and you will find at the last vertebra of his back a bead that has protruded, elevated above the other vertebrae.	This disease often occurs in small children. The sign of the beginning of the disease in a child is that he suffers shortness of breath when standing or moving, and you will find that at the end of his dorsal vertebrae there is one visibly projecting above the other vertebrae.	0.9089299
So if you see that, and you want to stop it, cauterize it with a circular cautery, in this manner. Let the cautery take every side of the vertebra equally, and if you wish, cauterize it around the vertebra with the point cautery, two or three rows, and let the points be close to one another. Then treat the area until it heals, in the manner that we have mentioned.	So when you see this and you wish to stop it, cauterize him with a cautery that should be circular so that the cauterization takes in equally all sides of the vertebra. If you wish, you can cauterize two or three lines around the vertebra with the punctate cautery; let the punctures be close to one another. Then dress the place with those remedies we have mentioned, till healed.	0.9228082
And be careful not to use cautery on a hump that comes from a spasm of the nerve.	But beware of using the cautery in the deformity arising from a nervous spasm.	0.77383417

On Cauterizing Gout and Pains of the Joints.	On cauterization of gout and pain in the joints.	0.89068234
If the pains of the joints are from cold humors that flow to any part of the body, and if the pains occur in the legs, then it is the physicians' custom to call that specifically gout.	When there are pains in the joints from cold humidities flowing into whatever part of the body it may be, and specially when there are pains in the feet, doctors are in the habit of calling that 'gout'.	0.86075705
If cold gout is treated with the types of treatment we mentioned in the division and the pains do not go away, then cautery will remove them, and that is that you cauterize after emptying around the joint of the legs with many cauterizations, and the cautery iron should be olive-shaped and medium-sized, in this manner.	When gout due to chill has been treated with the various treatments mentioned in its section, and the pains remain, the cautery will remove them. That is, you cauterize the patient with multiple burns around the joint of the foot, after he has been purged. The cautery should be a middle-sized olivary one, thus.	0.8084744
And if you need to cauterize the surface of the leg, do it with the point cautery. If the pains ascend to the knees or to the other joints, and this happens often, cauterize each knee three or four times on each side with this same olive-shaped cautery iron.	If you need to make punctate cauterizations round the front of the foot, use the punctate cautery; and if the pains go up to the knee or other joints, which often happens, burn each knee with three or four cauterizations on every side with the same olivary cautery.	0.8942734
If you need more than this cauterization, cauterize, but do not deepen your hand with the cautery, rather it should be about the thickness of the skin only. If the pains ascend to the hips or to the back, use what we mentioned about cautery in its chapter.	And if you require to cauterize him more than this, do it, but do not go deeply but only about the thickness of the skin. If the pains go up to the hip joints or the back, employ those cauterizations that we have mentioned in their own chapter.	0.858926
If the pains are only in the hands, cauterize around the two forearms as you rotate in two rows. If the pains remain in the fingers, cauterize them at each knuckle and on the back of the hand.  If the pains ascend after some days to the elbows or to the shoulders,	And if the pains are in the hands only, pierce a double line all around the wrists. If the pains remain in the fingers, pierce them once over each joint and once on the metacarpus. And if after some days the pains go up to the elbows or shoulders then cauterize both on each side.	0.88278264
cauterize them on each side. The patient should not neglect good regimen and taking medications, for if he improves his diet and expels the phlegm, he will recover with this cauterization, God willing.	And keep the patient to good habits and taking of medicine; for if his regimen be good and the phlegm got rid of, he will be cured with this cautery.	0.7412208

On Cauterizing Hernias.	On the cauterization of hernia.	0.79004574
If a hernia appears in the groin and some of the intestine and omentum descends into the testicle, and this is recent and of short duration, you should order the patient to abstain from food for the day and use laxatives to bring down the stool from his bowels.	When a rupture occurs in the groin, and part of the intestine and omentum comes down into the scrotum, being the onset of the disease, forbid the patient to take food for one day and have him use laxatives to empty the bowel.	0.7944155
Then he should lie down on his back in front of you and you tell him to hold his breath so that the omentum or intestine protrudes. Then you reduce it with your finger, and then mark with ink under the hernia on the pubic bone a mark resembling a half-circle, its ends towards the upper part of the body.	Then let him lie on his back in front of you and bid him hold his breath till the intestine or omentum comes out; then put it back with your finger. Then, below the hernia over the pubic bone, mark a semicircle whose extremities point upward.	0.90785897
Then you heat a cautery, this is its image.	Then heat a cautery of this type.	0.56635374
Until it becomes white and throws off sparks, then you reduce the intestine or omentum into his abdomen. Then an assistant places his hand on the area so that the intestine does not protrude, and you spread the patient's legs apart, placing a cushion under him, and another assistant ties his legs.	When it is white hot and emits sparks then return the intestine or omentum into his abdominal cavity, and have an assistant put his hand over the place to prevent the exit of the intestine. You should first have parted his legs and put a pillow under him; let another assistant sit on his legs and another on his chest, holding his hands.	0.8296194
And another (assistant) on his chest holding his hands.  Then you apply the cautery on the mark itself, your hand holding the cautery steady and upright, and you hold it until it reaches the bone, or you repeat it again if it didn't reach the bone the first time.	Then apply the cautery to the mark, keeping the cautery upright, and hold it till it reaches the bone; or apply the cautery again a second time if it does not reach the bone the first time.	0.74885046
And be very careful of the protrusion of the intestine while cauterizing, lest you burn it, thus causing the patient either death or a great affliction.  And know that if you do not reach the bone with the cautery, your work will not succeed. And it is necessary that the cautery for children be delicate according to their size and for adults according to their size.	You must take the greatest care that the intestine does not come out while you are cauterizing, lest you burn it and it result in death or grave injury to the patient. You must understand that if you do not bring the cauterization down to the bone your operation will not be successful. For boys the cautery should be slender according to their proportions, and for adults according to theirs.	0.89691633
Then you treat the cauterized area after three days with ghee until the burn scab disappears, then you treat it with various ointments until it heals. And let the patient lie on his back for forty days until the wound is sealed.	Then dress the site of the cauterization till it heals. After three days, treat the site of cauterization with butter until the eschar from the burn departs. Then treat with the usual ointments till healed. The patient should lie on his back for forty days so that the wound may cicatrize.	0.8985169
And it is necessary that you make his food during his treatment something that softens his bowels so that the intestine does not protrude when defecating and excreting.  Then if he wants to get up after forty days, you use a tight bandage and keep it for another forty days, and he should reduce exertion and fullness from food and drink and loud shouting.	Throughout the course of his treatment you must make his diet such as will be gentle with his inside, so that the intestine should not come down during the effort of defaecation. Then when he wants to get up after the forty days, employ a tight bandage and keep this on another forty days. He should be moderate in his exertion, his eating, drinking, and shouting.	0.86647886
For if this procedure is followed thus, he will heal completely, God willing. I will mention the treatment of hernias by incision in its chapter, God willing.  As for the hernia that occurs in the rest of the abdomen and is incipient, if you want it not to increase, then cauterize the hernia with a circular cautery according to its size. And let what you burn of the skin be like two-thirds of it. Then treat it with what we have mentioned, for it will not increase, God willing.  Some of the ancients have mentioned cauterizing the hernia with a triangular cautery in this way [accompanied by an image].	Thus under these rules he will be completely cured. I shall speak of the treatment of rupture by scission in the appropriate chapter. When a rupture occurs elsewhere in the belly and is at its inception and you wish it not to grow, cauterize the rupture with a round cautery in proportion to its size; burn about two-thirds through the thickness of the skin and treat as we have said; he will be cured and the rupture will not grow. One of the Ancients said that ruptures were to be cauterized with a three-armed cautery like this.	0.83007556
After you mark the hernia with ink, making the horizontal line on the upper side of the hernia and the other line downwards, and you bring down your hand in the middle with a single nail-shaped cautery.  The first cauterization is easier and better, God willing.	First mark the rupture with ink; put the transverse line on the upper margin of the rupture and the other towards the lower, and apply a single claviform cautery in the middle. But the first cauterization is easier and better.	0.73725307

If there occurs in some limb, due to a fall or a blow, a pain, and that pain persists for a long time and treatment with medicines does not work, then it should be cauterized with a point cautery. And the cauterization of each limb should be according to its size, smallness, weakness, and strength.	When pain occurs in some limb due to a fall or a blow and the pain becomes chronic and medical treatment has no effect upon it, you should cauterize it with the punctate cautery. In each case the cauterization should be in proportion to the size of the limb, its strength or weakness, and the chronicity of the pain and contusion in it.	0.89475167
And the pain and the callus will be located by it. If it heals from the first cauterization, then fine. Otherwise, repeat the cauterization on it, because it is the nature of these pains to move from the limb to what is near it, so it is necessary to follow it with the cautery until the patient recovers.	If it is cured at the first cauterization, good; otherwise repeat the cauterization. For it is customary for these pains to move from one part to a neighbouring part, and you must follow them with the cautery till the patient is cured.	0.811672

As for lepers, they may benefit greatly from cauterization, especially the type of leprosy that is caused by the putrefaction of phlegm and black bile.	Those suffering from elephantiasis are sometimes greatly helped by the cautery; especially that kind that arises from corruption of the phlegm and black bile.	0.7366713
If you want to cauterize it, observe. If the leprosy is in its early stages and you have treated it with what we mentioned in the division, and it has not subsided or stopped, and you fear that the corruption will take over the patient's entire temperament, then cauterize him on the head with five cauterizations. One in the customary center of the head, the second below it towards the forehead at the hairline, two on the temples, and one behind on the nape of the neck.  Press your hand firmly with the cautery until it slightly affects the bone.	When you wish to use the cautery, first look, and if the elephantiasis be in the early stage and you treat it with those remedies advised in the section but it does not abate and is not arrested, and you fear lest the corruption spread over the patient's whole constitution, then give him five cauterizations on the head: the well-known one in the middle of the head; the second one lower than that, toward the forehead, about the edge of the hair; and two at the temples; and one behind, on the nape of the neck.	0.8787997
Scales will peel off from it, which will facilitate the exhalation of thick vapors. Cauterize him also over the spleen itself as previously mentioned. However, if the leprosy has persisted in the patient and has manifested clearly, then it is necessary to cauterize these cauterizations that we mentioned on the head.	And maintain the application of the cautery a little while till a slight mark is impressed on the bone and the outer table is removed from it, that there be an easy exit for the thick vapours. Burn him also one cauterization over the spleen itself in the manner described earlier.	0.6556449
And be careful of the nerve that is on the back of the heels, lest you burn them. One may also cauterize the pubic bone, another on the cardia of the stomach, and another on the liver.  Know that the more you cauterize, the more beneficial and effective it is.	Be careful not to burn the posterior tendons of his heels. He may also be cauterized once on the pubic bone; another on the cardia of the stomach; and another on the liver. You should know that the more you cauterize the more beneficial and effective it will be.	0.8845186
And know that the sick person does not feel the pain of cauterization as the healthy person does, because his body is numb.  The cauteries should be large and small according to the limbs and joints, as previously mentioned regarding the characteristics of the irons.	You should know also that the patient will not find the cautery painful as a sound man would, since his body is benumbed. The cauteries should be of the types of instrument mentioned earlier, larger or smaller in proportion to the size of the limb or joint.	0.80559707

When some limb is affected with numbness and it is treated with drugs and ointments and plasters, but is not cured, burn the benumbed limb itself with cauterizations proportionate to its bigness or smallness.

When the cancer is in its initial stage and you wish to arrest it, burn all round the circumference of the cancer with the circular cautery. Some doctors have said that it may be cauterized with one extensive cauterization in the middle. This hardly seems right to me, for I should expect it to ulcerate out; which I have several times seen.	0.8564676

When a person gets a boil which is slow in coming to a head, either because of the superfluity causing it, or because of the patient's age if he be an elderly man lacking in blood, or because of the season, and you wish to hasten the ripening of the boil, then make a punctate burn around it with multiple small cauterizations, and then let be; it will speedily come to a head.	0.8723835

The corrosive ulcer is a corruption that spreads in the limb, consuming it as fire consumes dry wood. If you see the corrosive ulcer in a place that can tolerate cauterization by fire, heat many nail-shaped cauteries, small and large, according to what is appropriate for the place where the corrosive ulcer is.	Gangrene is a creeping corruption of a limb, consuming it as fire consumes dry wood. If you see gangrene in a part which can tolerate the actual cautery, heat a number of claviform cauteries, small or large to suit the site of the gangrene.	0.797352
Then cauterize it from every side until all of the corruption is eradicated and nothing of it remains at all. Then leave it for three days and apply powdered sulfur with oil to the cauterized areas until all the eschar and all the corruption are removed.	Then cauterize it all over till the whole corruption is eradicated and none remains. Then let be for three days, applying to the cauterized site sulphur beaten up with oil, until the whole eschar comes away, and all the corruption.	0.92582977
Then treat it with ointments that promote flesh growth. If you see after three days that the flesh is growing healthily without corruption, then [stop].

On Cauterizing Ingrown and Non-Ingrown Nails.	On the cauterization of corns, inverted and otherwise.	0.41780257
This ailment often occurs on the soles of the feet, and it is a rough thing that pains the man. Cauterization for it is done in two ways: either cauterization with fire or cauterization with a potent liquid.	This disease, which is something hard paining the foot, very often occurs in the soles of the feet. The cauterization in this case is twofold, actual or caustic.	0.7327628
Cauterization by fire is done by heating a hollow iron, similar to an eagle's feather, made of iron, the size of which surrounds the nail on all sides, and having a thin edge. Then you place it hot on the nail, then turn your hand with the iron around the nail until the iron reaches the depth of the nail.	The actual cautery is to heat a hollow cautery like a vulture's quill, made of iron, narrow of edge, of such a size as to surround the corn all round.	0.69730014
And you leave it for three days to fester with pus, then you dress it with crushed wild mallow with salt and leave the dressing on it overnight, for it will remove it from its roots. Then you treat the wound site with the flesh-generating ointment until it heals if the nails are not ingrown.	Then put it, hot, on the corn and rotate it till the cautery reaches the root of the corn; and let be for three days to draw the pus; then apply a plaster of wild mallows ground up with salt, and leave the plaster on one night; then it may be drawn out with its root. Then treat the site of the wound with stimulating salve till it heals.	0.8261514
And it often occurs on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet. You should take a tube of copper, iron, or eagle's feather, and place it on the nail or wart, then pour a small amount of potent liquid into the tube.	If the corns are not inverted, which usually happens on the surface of the body and particularly on the hands and feet, you should take a cannula made of bronze or iron or made of a vulture's quill, and place it on the corn or wart; then pour into the cannula a small quantity of caustic solution; keep your hand on it and rotate it, keeping up a slight pressure so that the edge of the cannula impresses a mark at the root of the corn and the caustic makes its way to the root of the corn.	0.7595929
And hold your hand while turning it with a slight squeeze of your hand so that the edge of the tube affects the base of the nail, and the potent liquid finds its way to sink to the base of the nail. The patient should endure the sting of the potent liquid for a short time.	Let the patient endure the action of the caustic for a while, then remove it; for the corn may be drawn out with its root.	0.40330422
Then leave it, for the nail will come off by its roots.  This is how you do it one by one until you have removed all of them from the body. Then, after they have been removed, treat their places with ointments that promote flesh growth.	Treat them in this manner one after another till you have accounted for all of them. Then treat the site of them, after eradication, with stimulating ointments.	0.7072913

If someone experiences tremors from a chill in a nerve or from quartan fever or other causes, it is necessary to cauterize him four or five times on the spinal vertebrae, one cauterization between each vertebra, and one cauterization on his chest. And one cauterization on his stomach with the olive-shaped cautery. The tremors will cease, and this speeds up the resolution of the cold ailment.	When someone has a tremor, either from chill in a nerve or quartan fever, or from some other cause, you should cauterize him four or five times over the vertebrae of the back, one between each vertebra, and one on his breast and one on his stomach, with an olivary cautery.

Ugly pustules may erupt on the body from cold, thick, and corrupt humors. It is necessary, upon their first appearance, to cauterize the head of each pustule gently with a myrtle stick whose tip has been ignited with fire or with the root of long birthwort or with a lentil-shaped cautery.	Foul pustules sometimes arise on the body, caused by heavy corrupt frigid matter. When they first appear you should cauterize the head of each one lightly with myrtle wood whose tip has been lighted in the fire; or with the root of the long birthwort; or with the lenticular cautery.	0.83877355
Warts may also be cauterized upon their first appearance in this manner, and they will not grow larger.  The excess matter causing them will dissipate, and the patient will recover. However, it is necessary that this be done after the patient has undergone bloodletting.	Sometimes furuncles also are cauterized in the same manner when they first arise; then they get no bigger and the superfluity originating them is dispersed and the patient is cured of them. But before you cauterize these, the patient must be depleted by bleeding.	0.81552744

Very often there occurs bleeding from an artery which has been cut either by an external wound or in opening an abscess or in cauterizing a part of the body and so on, and it is difficult to stem.	0.85709363
If this happens to someone, quickly place your index finger on the opening of the artery and press firmly until you stop the blood flow beneath your finger so that nothing comes out.

When this happens to anyone, quickly apply your hand to the mouth of the artery, putting your forefinger to it and closing it properly till the bleeding ceases under your fingers and nothing comes out. Then put in the fire several olivary cauteries, small and large, and blow on them to make them very hot.	0.92640233
Then take one of them, either small or large, depending on the wound and the place where the artery ruptured, and place the cautery on the vessel itself after quickly removing your finger. Hold the cautery there until the bleeding stops.	Then take one, small or large according to the size of the wound and the site of the opening of the artery, and bring the cautery down right on the artery itself, after promptly removing your finger, and hold the cautery upon it till the blood ceases.	0.9228058
If the blood gushes out when you lift your finger from the mouth of the artery and the cautery is extinguished, quickly take another cautery from those prepared in the fire and continue doing this, one after another, until the bleeding stops.	But if it bursts out after you have removed your finger from the mouth of the artery, and the cautery has cooled, promptly take another of the cauteries which you have ready in the fire. Continue doing this, with one after another, till the haemorrhage is stanched.	0.85802186
Be careful not to burn a nerve that may be there, which would cause the patient further harm. Know that if an artery bleeds, it cannot be stopped, especially if it is a large artery, except by one of four methods: either by cauterization, as we have said, or by severing it, if it has not already been severed. For if it is severed, its ends contract, and the bleeding stops. Or it can be tied tightly with threads, or medications that stop bleeding can be applied to it, and it can be bandaged tightly.	Mind you do not burn any nerve which may be there, so that another calamity afflicts the patient. You should know that when there is arterial haemorrhage it is impossible to stop it, especially when the vessel is big, except in one of four ways, to wit: by the cautery as we have said; or by division of the vessel when it is not completely divided, for when it is cut through the ends of it contract and the bleeding is stopped; or by a strong thread ligature; or by the application of styptics with tight bandaging.	0.91638136
As for those who try to stop it with a bandage or by tightening with rags or applying burning substances and the like, it will not stop at all, except rarely. If this happens to someone, and a doctor or medicine is not available, let him immediately place his index finger on the mouth of the wound itself, as we have described.	But those who try to stop bleeding with ligatures or cloths, or by the application of caustics and the like, never stanch it by these means, or at least very rarely.	0.62650144
And he should press it very hard until the blood is contained and emerges from above the wound and the artery, and the finger should not be removed from it.  Continuously apply very cold water until the blood congeals, thickens, and stops flowing. During this time, consider what is needed in terms of cauterization or medication.	And if this happen to anyone and there are available neither doctor nor remedies, let him at once apply his forefinger to the mouth of the vessel as we have bidden and close it firmly till the blood is stanched; and pour over the wound and over the artery, without removing the finger, water as cold as possible till the blood thickens and congeals and ceases to flow. And meanwhile one should be considering what kind of cautery or medicine is indicated.	0.73307705

On Incisions, and Lancing, and Phlebotomy, and Wounds, and Similar Procedures.	ON INCISION, PERFORATION, AND VENESECTION, AND WOUNDS AND THE LIKE	0.684739
Khalaf said: We have mentioned in the first chapter every disease suitable for cauterization by fire and burning medication, along with their causes, reasons, instruments, and shapes of the cauteries, and we arranged them in chapters from the head to the foot.	IN the first book I spoke of all those diseases for which cauterization is of value, either the actual cautery or that done with caustic medicines; and of their reasons and causes; also the instruments and the shapes of the cauteries. This I set out in chapters, from head to heel.	0.7250915
And I will follow in this chapter the same path so that the student may easily find what he seeks.	In this book I shall proceed along the same route so that it will be easy for the inquirer to find what he is looking for.	0.8286894
Before I begin this, it is necessary that you know, my sons, that this chapter contains more dangers than the first chapter on cauterization.	But before I begin this you ought first to know, my sons, that in this book there is more risk than in the first, which treats of cauterization.	0.8709216
And for that reason, the warning in it should be stronger, because the procedures in this chapter often result in excessive bleeding—the very blood upon which life depends—whether by opening a vein, or incising a swelling, or lancing an abscess, or treating a wound, or extracting an arrow, or incising for a stone, and similar procedures, all of which are accompanied by danger and fear, and in most cases, death.	Wherefore in this matter there should be greater circumspection. For in the course of the work of which this book treats there often occurs an effusion of the blood upon which life depends, in the opening of a blood-vessel or the incision of a tumour or the perforation of an abscess or the treatment of a wound or the extraction of an arrow, or in the incising for a calculus or similar cases; all of which are accompanied by uncertainty and fear; and in most death will supervene.	0.8388941
And I warn you against engaging in what is doubtful for you, for you may encounter in this profession all kinds of people with various ailments, and some of them may be weary of their illness and death may be insignificant to them.	So I warn you against undertaking any case in which there is any element of doubt to you; for in the exercise of the art you will be mobbed by all kinds of persons with all manner of afflictions; some being so weary of their sickness that death itself is a relief on account of the extent of their sufferings and the length of their miseries, their illness being so settled as to presage death.	0.80454147
Because of the intensity of their suffering and the length of their affliction, and their illness shows certain signs of death, while others will offer you their wealth and enrich you with it, hoping for recovery while their illness is fatal, so you should not at all assist those who come to you in this condition.	Some will lavish their wealth on you and enrich you, in the hope that they may be curable, when their disease is mortal.	0.54819846
Let your caution be greater than your desire and eagerness, and do not proceed with any of this except with certain knowledge that you have of what the good outcome will be, and in all the treatment of your patients, use foreknowledge and forewarning of what the outcome of the treatment will be.	You should not assist any of this kind who approach you; let your caution be stronger than your greed and desire for gain; and do not embark upon anything of this kind unless you have positive knowledge, which you judge adequate, about the way of bringing the patient a good outcome. In treating every patient be prescient and foretell the means whereby health may be restored to him.	0.79218376
For in that, you will have help in acquiring praise, glory, renown, and gratitude. May God inspire you, my sons, with His guidance, and may He not deprive you of rightness and success, for that is in His hand; there is no god but He.	That will help you to obtain renown, glory, fame, and praise. May God inspire you, my sons, with His guidance, and grant that you hit the mark and succeed; for it is in His hand; there is no God but He.	0.94451725
I have arranged the chapters of this section, as in the previous section on cautery, from the head to the foot, so that it may be easier for you to find what you want from it, God willing.	I have arranged this book in sections as I did with the previous book on cauterizations, from head to heel; so you will the easier find in it what you seek.	0.8186723

On the treatment of hydrocephalus in children.	On the cure of hydrocephalus.	0.81699705
This ailment often occurs in children at birth if the midwife squeezes the child's head without gentleness. It may also occur from a hidden, unknown cause.	This disease occurs most commonly in infants upon delivery when the midwife grasps the child's head roughly. It also sometimes happens from some hidden and unknown cause.	0.90373933
I have not seen this ailment in anyone but children, and all those I have seen have quickly died, so I have seen fit to abandon operating on it.  I have seen a boy whose head was filled with water, and the head grew larger every day. Until the boy could not sit up on his own due to the size of his head, and the fluid increased until he perished.	I have never seen this disease except in very small children; and death very quickly overtook all those that I have seen; therefore I have preferred not to undertake operation in these cases. I have seen a child whose head was filled with fluid and daily growing in size, until the child could not sit upright on account of the size of his head, and the humidity increased till he died.	0.9041927
This fluid either collects between the skin and the bone, or it collects under the bone, on the dura mater. The procedure, if the fluid is between the skin and the bone and the swelling is small, is that you should make a single transverse incision in the middle of the head. The length of the incision should be about two finger-widths, so that the fluid drains. This is the image of the scalpel.	Now this humidity sometimes collects between the skin and the bone; sometimes it collects beneath the bone and over the membrane. The operation is thus: when the humidity is between the skin and the bone and the swelling is small, an incision should be made in the middle of the head, transversely. The length of the incision should be about two thumb-joints, so that the humidity may flow out. This is the form of the scalpel.	0.80603886
If the fluid is greater and the swelling larger, make two intersecting incisions, in this manner:	If the humidity is more copious and the swelling greater, make two intersecting incisions to this pattern.	0.7640417
And if the fluid is under the bone—and the sign of that is that you see the sutures of the head open on all sides, and the water recedes when you press it with your hand—and that is not hidden from you—then you should make three incisions in the middle of the head, in this manner:	But if the humidity is beneath the bone—and the sign of that is that you will see the sutures of the skull gaping on all sides, the water manifestly yielding when you press in with your fingers—you should make three incisions in the middle of the head, in this pattern.	0.8528659
And after the incision, all the fluid comes out, then you tighten the incisions with bandages and compresses, then you anoint it from above with wine and oil until the fifth day, then you loosen the bandage and treat the wound with lint and ointments, and do not neglect to bind the head moderately, and you nourish the ill one with all dry foods of little moisture.	After incising, draw out all the humidity; then bind up the incisions with pads and bandages; and over the bandages foment with wine and oil till the fifth day. Then loose the bandage and dress the wound with lint and ointments. And do not forget to bandage the head lightly; and feed the patient with a dry diet with little fluid, until the part is strengthened and healed.	0.90263677
Until the organ strengthens and heals. Another method of incision is that you look where the bone of the swelling appears and where the water has collected, because it may be more in the back of the head, or in the front, or on the right, or on the left.	Another pattern of incision is to see where the tumefaction and collection of fluid is apparent. For sometimes it is greater in the posterior or anterior part of the head, or to the right or to the left.	0.655094
So direct the incision where the swelling and the fullness of the water appears to you, then incise it as you are able, and be careful not to cut an artery, causing bleeding, so that the patient does not die from that bleeding, along with the discharge of fluid.	Therefore make your incision where the tumefaction and dropsy are apparent; incise that place in whatever way you can. Be careful not to cut an artery lest you cause haemorrhage and the patient die of that haemorrhage at the same time that the humidity is evacuated.	0.86322767

Chapter Two.	CHAPTER TWO.	0.8483498
When someone experiences acute episodes affecting the eyes or the chest, and this becomes chronic, and drug treatment is ineffective, the most effective treatment in this case is the incision of these two arteries.	When a person gets painful defluxions into the eyes or chest which become chronic, and medical treatment is ineffectual in this case, then section of these arteries will be the most efficacious treatment.	0.85295665
So, if you want to incise them, you should shave the patient's head with a razor, then rub the area with a rough cloth so that the artery appears, then tie the patient's neck with the edge of his garment, then look where the vessel pulsates, and their two locations are the two lowered areas behind the ears, and they are rarely hidden except in some people.	When you decide on section, you should shave the patient's head with a razor; then rub the place with a rough cloth to show up the artery; then bind the patient's neck with an end of his garment; then you will observe where the artery is pulsating (the sites of both are the depressions behind the ears) for it is uncommon for them to remain hidden, except in a few persons.	0.79887164
Then mark them with ink, then cut them with the lancet to the bone, and that should be across the head, and if you wish, insert the lancet from under the artery and lift it upwards by cutting, and the length of the cut should be about two closed fingers.	Then do you mark with ink over both; then cut with a hooked scalpel, cutting down to the bone; the incision should be lateral to the head. Or if you prefer, introduce the scalpel beneath the artery and make a thrusting cut up at it. The incision should be of about two fingers' breadth.	0.821617
For when the vessel is severed, the blood comes out in a pulsating gush, spurting forward with repeated spurts.  If the artery does not appear to the touch, then you should measure about three fingers from the ear, then mark with ink and incise to the bone, and what is necessary is to...	When cut, the artery gives out a pulsating jet of blood spurting intermittently. If the artery is not discernible, you should measure three fingers' breadth from the ear, than mark with ink, and cut down to the bone.	0.77778244
Let six ounces of blood flow, on average, and perhaps you will let more or less than that, all according to what you see of the patient's strength and the fullness of his arteries. Then look at the wound, and if any membrane remains on the bone, cut it away.	The quantity of blood that should be let is six ounces on the average, but often more blood, or less, is withdrawn; all in proportion to the strength of the patient and the fullness of the arteries as they appear to you. Then examine the wound and if there remains on the bone any part of the membrane cut it off to avoid a haematoma.	0.8841017
So that a hot swelling does not occur, then pack the wound with a wick of linen cloths, then treat it with ointments until it heals.	Then bind up the wound with a bandage of linen cloth and dress with ointments till healed.	0.6647612

On venesection of the two arteries in the temples.	On the extraction of the temporal arteries.	0.53634506
If a person experiences chronic migraines or severe catarrh due to sharp humors and heat in the temples' muscles, or a severe chronic headache, and so on, and has been treated with various medical treatments without success, then we have tried, for these ailments, venesection of the arteries in the temples or cauterizing them as we have described.	When a man has a chronic migraine or acute catarrh, on account of acrid humidities and heat in the temporal muscles, or a violent chronic headache, or the like, and he has been treated with various medical treatments without success, we have sometimes in these diseases tried extraction of the arteries from the temples or cauterization of them, already described.	0.90200835
The method of venesection is to shave the patient's hair on the temples and aim for the artery that appears in the temple, as it is evident from its pulse, and it is rarely hidden except in some individuals. Or, in extreme cold, if it is hidden from you, have the patient tighten their neck with a piece of their clothing, then rub the area with a cloth or apply a hot water compress until the artery appears clearly and distinctly.	The manner of extraction is for the patient to shave the temporal hair; then you press upon the artery appearing on the temple; for it will be manifest to you by its pulsation, and is rarely invisible save in a few people or on account of severe cold.	0.80329436
Then gently incise the skin with it until you reach the artery, then insert a hook into it and pull it upwards until you extract it from the skin and free it from the membranes beneath it on all sides. If the artery is thin, twist it with the tip of the hook.	But if it is not plain to you then let the patient bind his neck with the end of his garment; then do you rub the place with a piece of cloth or foment with hot water, till the artery is obvious to you; then take a scalpel shaped thus; then with it gently scrape away the skin till you come to the artery, then stick a hook in it and draw it upward till you extract it from the skin and free it all round from the membranes that are beneath it.	0.696157
Then cut a portion of it to the extent that its ends separate and contract without causing bleeding, for if it is not severed and cut, the blood will not flow at all. Then draw from six to three ounces of blood.	But if the artery be thin, twist it with the tip of the hook and cut out enough of it for the two ends to be well separated from one another and contract so that no haemorrhage occurs; for if it is not divided and cut it will not let blood flow at all. Then let blood, from six to three ounces.	0.822427
If the artery is large, it should be tied in two places with a strong, doubled thread. The thread should be either silk or lute strings so that it doesn't decay before the wound heals, causing bleeding.	If the artery be large it should be ligated in two places with a strong double thread; the threads should be either silken or lute-string, lest corruption attack them before the wound is healed, and haemorrhage occur.	0.9325818
Then cut the excess between the two ties. You can do this at that moment or later.  If you wish, you can cauterize it to the bone with a cautery knife until its ends are severed, which serves the same purpose, or even better, as we have said.	Then cut away what remains between the two ligatures; do that immediately or later. If you wish, you may cauterize it down to the bone with an edged cautery so that the ends of the artery be divided; for this will replace that operation.	0.81130624
However, if the patient has a fever or a hot temperament, cauterization helps to eliminate the humors, so it is more beneficial. After incising the arteries, the area should be packed with aged cotton and secured with bandages. After the release, it should be treated with desiccative medications that promote flesh growth and with bandaging until it heals, God willing.	It is in fact better, as we have said, unless the patient is feverish or of a hot constitution; cauterization is one of the means of eliminating humidities, so it will be of surer efficacy. After extraction of the arteries the place must be packed with teased-out cotton wool, and on top of that must be put firm pads. And after loosening the ligature, dress with dry medicaments that encourage growth of flesh, and with bandages,, till it heals.	0.76462764
If bleeding from the artery occurs during the procedure, immediately stop it, either by cauterization or by filling the area with vitriol and pressing your hand until the bleeding stops.  If none of these are available, apply your finger until the blood clots.	But if arterial bleeding hinders you in the course of your operation, hasten to stanch it either by cauterization or by filling the place with vitriol, compressing it with your hand till the blood stays; or, if you have nothing of this kind by you, put your finger on it till the blood clots and rinse over the place till the flow dies down; then tie off as you should.	0.8765973
Wash the area with very cold water to reduce the inflammation and bandage it as needed.  A gentler and easier method than incising the artery is to cauterize the vessel with this two-bladed cautery after marking the two spots with ink.	Less serious and easier than excising the artery is to cauterize the vessel with this cautery provided with two blades, having first marked both places with ink.	0.7476155
Apply it very hot until it reaches the bone and severs the vessel in two places so that the ends are separated, as they will definitely not rejoin with this cauterization.  This is an image of the cautery.	Bring it down, very hot, till it reaches the bone and the artery is cut in two places, so as to put some distance between the two ends, for it will certainly not unite after this cauterization. This is the form of the cautery.	0.84870386
Its two blades are sharp, resembling small scalpels, though much less sharp than a scalpel, because if they were as sharp as a scalpel, they would cool down too quickly and not cut the flesh quickly. If they are somewhat thick, they retain the heat of the fire.	It should have two sharp blades like two small paring-knives, but they should be much less sharp than a knife, for if they are as sharp as a knife they will quickly lose their heat and the flesh will be slow in cutting. If they have a certain thickness in them the heat of the fire will be retained in them and they will speedily cut the flesh.	0.8763839
And it cuts the flesh quickly. This method is better than any other, gentler and easier.  The space between the two blades should be about the width of a finger.	This operation is superior to all and less severe and easier. Let the distance between the two blades be the breadth of a finger.	0.68733764

On the treatment of a constant flow of hot tears to the eyes.	On the treatment of a chronic flux of bitter tears into the eyes.	0.86553454
If the tears are constant and their flow is from the vessels on the outside of the skull, and nothing from medical treatment with medicines has been beneficial, and you see that the patient's face has reddened. And he feels a tingling in his forehead like the tingling of ants, and his eyes are loose and moist, their lashes eroded, and their eyelids stuck together from the sharpness of the tears.  The ancients were compelled in treating this to this procedure, and they call it "treatment with the sword." It is that you order the patient to shave the hair on his forehead.	When lachrymation is chronic and arises from the external vessels on the cranium, nor does treatment by any kind of medical remedy have any effect, and you see the patient's features flushed, and he feels a creeping in his forehead like that of an ant, and his eyes are wasted and moist, and the roots of the lashes itch, and the eyelids are burned by the bitterness of the tears, the Ancients were compelled to treat it by this operation which they called 'treatment by the sword'.	0.83230066
Then you make three parallel incisions in the forehead along the length of the forehead, and the length of the incision is about two fingers. One incision is parallel to the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, the second is a little distance from the movement of the muscle in the temple, and the third is on the other side.	You bid the patient shave the hair of his forehead; then you make three parallel incisions across his forehead a little apart; and let the length of each incision be two fingers' breadths; the first incision continuing the line of the nose in the middle of the forehead; and the second at a little distance from the temporal muscle; and the third incision on the other side of the forehead.	0.8479328
And beware of cutting the two arteries that are on the sides, and keep your hand away from the joining of the jaws.  Let the distance between each incision be the width of three fingers pressed together. And have with you prepared pieces of sponge or many dry rags with which to wipe the blood.	Beware of cutting the two arteries which are at the sides, and keep your hand away from the mandibular joint; and let there be a distance between each incision as of three fingers joined. Have ready by you some pieces of sponge or a number of linen towels to wipe away the blood.	0.9343762
Then you insert the sharp, two-pointed scalpel, which is pictured here. From the incision next to the temple to the middle incision, you peel with it all the skin between the two incisions, along with the membrane that is on the bone.  Then you also do this from the middle incision to the third incision. Then you take out this scalpel. And you also insert into the first incision another instrument called a scalpel, sharp on one side and smooth, not sharp, on the other side, and this is its picture:.	Then introduce the double-edged scalpel shaped thus through the incision near the temple to the middle incision, and with it pare off all the skin between the two incisions with the periosteum; then do the same from the middle incision to the third one; then draw out this scalpel and introduce into the first incision another instrument which is known as 'the knife-shaped': sharp on one side, smooth and blunt on the other, thus.	0.8738128
And you turn its sharp side upwards towards the flesh attached to the skin and its smooth side towards the bone, and push it until it reaches the middle incision, and you cut with it all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes, without the cut reaching the surface of the skin.	The sharp edge of it should be turned upward to the subcutaneous tissue and the smooth edge toward the bone; then push it on to reach the middle incision and with it cut all the vessels passing from the head down toward the eyes, without letting the incision come through the outer skin.	0.8355266
Then you do that in the middle incision to the other incision, and after a moderate amount of blood has flowed, you squeeze the places where the clotted blood has been cut. Then you put in each incision a cotton wick moistened with wine and oil or vinegar and oil, and place a compress on it.	Then do the same from the middle incision to the third. After a moderate quantity of blood has flowed, express the bits of blood-clot from the place and pack into each incision a pad of teased-out cotton wool. Over all put a pad soaked in wine and oil, or vinegar and oil, lest an effusion occur.	0.8672863
So that a hot swelling does not occur, and on the third day you loosen the bandage and use frequent washing with lukewarm water, then you treat it with basilicon ointment with rose oil and all the other things you treat wounds with, until it heals, God willing.	On the third day loosen the bandage and rinse with plenty of tepid water and afterwards dress with balm of basilicon with rose-ointment and other treatments for wounds, until healed.	0.79087937

When someone experiences copious, sharp, pungent, and persistent discharges, and you see their eyes weakened and small, their vision impaired, their eyelids ulcerated, and their eyelashes falling out. And there is a sharp, painful ache deep in the head, and continuous sneezing, then know from these symptoms that those materials and discharges come from numerous, deep vessels, and the best treatment for them is this treatment:  You order the patient to shave his forehead, then you make a single incision in the middle of the forehead.	When anyone has a quantity of painful defluxions, acrid and continuous, and you see the eyes wasted and sunken and their sight is weakened and the eyelids are ulcerated and lose their eyelashes; while deep in the head there may be a vehement and grievous pain with incessant sneezing, then you may know from these occurrences that those humours and catarrhs arise from many deep blood-vessels.	0.841843
And there is a sharp, painful ache deep in the head, and continuous sneezing, then know from these symptoms that those materials and discharges come from numerous, deep vessels, and the best treatment for them is this treatment:  You order the patient to shave his forehead, then you make a single incision in the middle of the forehead. Or slightly higher horizontally, and you begin the incision from the left temple to the right temple, and the incision should reach the bone. Keep your hand away from the temple muscles that move during chewing until the bone is exposed and you have dried all the blood with a sponge.	The best treatment in this case is that which follows: you bid the patient shave his forehead; then you make one incision in the middle of his forehead or a little above, crosswise (begin the incision from the left temple going toward the right temple; the incision should be down to bone; and avoid the temporal muscles that move during mastication) until the bone is laid bare.	0.6695297
Then separate the edges of the incision with absorbent cotton or a linen wick, then bandage over it with compresses soaked in wine and oil to prevent a hot swelling. When you remove the bandage and see that the hot swelling has subsided, you should scrape the bone until the flesh begins to grow in it.	Wipe away all the blood with a sponge and separate the edges of the incision with teased-out cotton wool or with rolls of linen; then bind up with pads over; the pads should be soaked in wine and oil to guard against an effusion. When you undo it, if you see that an effusion has erupted, you should scrape the bone until a growth of flesh begins in it; then treat with a drying treatment which generates flesh.	0.8487843
Then treat it with the drying method that promotes flesh growth, such as taking two parts wheat flour and four parts colophony, preparing an ointment from them, and using it for flesh growth in such wounds.	For example, two parts of wheat flour are taken and of colophonia four parts, and of them a salve is made which may be used to encourage the growth of flesh in wounds of this sort.	0.82216525

On the treatment of what falls into the ear.	On the treatment of things that fall into the ear.	0.93166363
Everything that falls into the ear is one of four kinds: either a mineral stone or something like stone, such as iron and glass; or a plant seed, such as chickpeas, kernels, and the like; or a flowing thing, such as water, vinegar, and the like.	All that falls into the ear comes under four categories: mineral stone, or what resembles stone, such as iron or glass; vegetable grain such as pea or date-stone or the like; or liquid such as water or vinegar; or animal.	0.9153552
Or an animal.  When a pebble or something like a pebble falls into the ear, something that does not grow in the ear, face the sun with the ear. If you see the pebble, drip some violet or iris oil into it, then try to remove it by moving the head or sneezing using hellebore. Block the nostrils when the sneeze comes after placing a ring of rags or wool around the ear and pulling the ear upwards, for it often comes out with this treatment.  If it does not come out, try to remove it with a delicate forceps, which is pictured here.	When a stone or something of that sort that does not grow gets into the ear, turn the ear toward the sun. If you see the stone, pour upon it a little oil of violets or sesame; then try to get it out by moving the head or by inducing sneezing with ptarmica and keeping the nose closed at the onset of sneezing, having first made round the ear a circle of pieces of cloth or wool and drawn the ear upwards. This treatment will usually bring it out. But if it does not come out, try to get it out with a fine pair of tweezers shaped thus.	0.87566316
If it comes out with the forceps, then good. Otherwise, try to remove it with a smooth, slightly curved, blunt hook. If it does not come out with that, then make a tube of copper and insert the end of the tube gently into the ear canal.	But if it does not come out, try to get it out with a fine pair of tweezers shaped thus. If it comes out with the tweezers, good. But if not, try to extract it with a fine blunt hook slightly curved.	0.8048773
Seal around the tube with pitch softened with oil so that the air has no passage except through the tube, then draw it out strongly with your breath, and it will often come out with this. If it does not come out with what we have described, then take a little bit of opopanax gum, or the prepared gum that is used to catch birds, and place it on the tip of a probe.	And if this does not bring it out, make a bronze tube and introduce the end of the tube well into the meatus of the ear and fill in round with wax softened with oil so that there may be no outlet save through the tube; then suck it out with all your breath; it will often come out with this.	0.7145637
After wrapping it tightly with cotton, insert it gently into the ear canal after drying the ear of moisture. If it does not come out with all that we have described, then proceed to incision before a hot swelling or convulsion occurs.	But if it does not come out with these means we have described, take turpentine resin or bird-lime, a very little; twist some compact cotton wool on the end of a probe and put this on the tip; then introduce it gently into the ear after you have dried out all the moisture from the ear. But if your treatment so far is unavailing, then be quick and incise before an abscess or spasm supervene.	0.64199984
The method of incision is that you first phlebotomize the patient in the cephalic vein and let out blood according to his strength. Then you sit the patient in front of you and turn his ear upwards and make a small incision at the base of the ear near the lobe in its lower part.	Now this is the way to incise: first, the patient's cephalic vein should be cut and blood drawn, in proportion to his strength; then seat the patient in front of you and turn his ear upwards; make a small incision at the lobule of the ear in the depression there (the incision should be crescent-shaped) until you reach the stone; then extract it with whatever instrument you may.	0.81103677
And the incision should be crescent-shaped until you reach the pebble. Then you remove it with whatever instrument you can, then you quickly sew up the incision and treat it until it heals.	Immediately afterwards sew up the incision and dress it till healed.	0.402395
If the thing that has fallen into the ear is one of the grains that swell and expand, try to remove it by what we have mentioned. If it does not come out, then take a thin, delicate scalpel like this.	If the object that falls into the ear is one of those grains that grow or swell, then try to extract it by the means already mentioned. If it does not respond to your efforts to get it out, take a fine narrow scalpel like this and with it attempt to cut out whatever kind of grain has entered the ear.	0.81403756
And try to cut that type of grain that has fallen into the ear. You only do this if you are certain that the grain has been moistened by the vapor of the ear so that it becomes many small pieces. Then remove it with the blind hook, or with a delicate forceps, or by suction.	You should not do this except when you are sure that this grain has become moist by reason of the vapours of the ear, so that you may cut up the grain into several small pieces. Then you may extract them with a blunt hook or fine-headed tweezers, or by suction, as we have mentioned; for their extraction will be easy.	0.80240315
As we have mentioned, it is easy to remove it.  As for water that has entered the ear, the patient should first use sneezing with hellebore, having filled his ear with some worn cotton, while lying on the ear that has the water in it. If it comes out with that, [then it is good].	As for water getting into the ear, the patient should first employ sneezing excited by ptarmica, his ear having been plugged with a piece of teased-out cotton; he should lie upon that ear in which the water is; and if it so come out, well and good.	0.70233786
If not, then take many pebbles about the length of the fingers, thin and smooth, and warm them slightly by the fire.  The patient inserts one into the opening of his ear and hops on one foot on that side, and strikes with another stone on the stone that is in the ear.	But if not, take a number of small stones about a finger's length, thin and smooth, and warm them a little in the fire; and have the patient put one of them into the meatus of the ear and let him hop on that one foot on that side; and, with another stone, tap upon the one put into the ear; he should keep this up with stone after stone till all the water has come out.	0.8320428
He continues to do this with pebble after pebble until all the water comes out.  The water may also be removed by taking a piece of papyrus or feather and inserting one end into the ear and setting fire to the other end until most of it burns, then repeating with another feather.	Sometimes the water is extracted by taking a reed or quill and introducing one end into the ear; then the other end is set alight till the greater part of it is burnt; then repeat time after time with more quills till all the water is got out. Or else suck it out with a cannula as described for a stone.	0.8180623
Do this several times until all the water comes out, or draw it out with the tube as mentioned previously regarding the pebble.  As for removing an animal that has entered it, see: if it is small-bodied, like a flea and the like, treat it with what I mentioned in the section; however,	As for the extraction of a creature getting into the ear, look to see if it is small of body, such as a flea or the like, in which case treat by those means mentioned in the section.	0.6404617
if it is large-bodied and perceptible to the senses, then attempt to remove it with forceps and hooks, and the matter is easier than all that which adheres in the ear.  As for removing worms generated in the ear, if you have treated them with what we mentioned in the section on ear drops in the treatise on drops, and your treatment has not been successful,	But if it has a large body, conspicuous to the touch, try to get it out with tweezers and hooks; for of all things that stick in the ear this is the easiest to extract.	0.7213161
it is appropriate to look into the ear in the sun.  If any worms appear to you, then extract them with forceps or delicate hooks.  If none of them appear to you, then take a tube, which is pictured here.	As for the extraction of a worm generated in the ear, when you have unavailingly treated it by those methods mentioned in the section in the treatise on instillations, you will need to examine the ear in the sunlight; and if you can see any worms, extract with tweezers or fine hooks.	0.73787916
Narrow at the bottom, wide at the top, insert the thin end into the ear as much as the patient can tolerate, then suck strongly with it. Do this several times until all the worms come out. If it does not respond to removal, seal around the tube with wax, as I mentioned to you regarding the pebble.	But if you cannot see any, then take a cannula of this form narrow in its lower part, broad above; and introduce the narrow part into the ear as far as the patient can bear it; then make strong suction through it, repeatedly, till all the worms are extracted. But if they do not come out in response to your treatment, plug all round the cannula with wax as bidden in treating for a stone.	0.77485806
If they do not come out with what we have mentioned, use the eardrops that I mentioned, which were tested by the ancients for killing worms, and you will find that in the treatise on eardrops.  And your pouring of oils and medications into the ear should be with this instrument, and this is its picture:	But if they do not come out in response to your treatment, plug all round the cannula with wax as bidden in treating for a stone. If nothing will bring them out, employ the instillations which I mentioned as having been tried by the Ancients for killing worms; you will find that in the treatise on instillations.	0.7509007
As you see, you make it from silver or copper, narrow at the bottom with a small hole, and wide at the top.  And if you wish, the injector that is inside the tube can be of sealed copper.  And if you wish, take a probe and wrap cotton around its tip, wrapping it tightly.	The instillation of oils or drugs should be done with an instrument like this, as you will see; you make it of silver or bronze, narrow at its lower end, with a small perforation, and wide at its upper part.	0.70975196
Then put the oil or juice, or whatever of these medicines you desire, into the tube while it is in the ear.  Then insert the probe with the cotton from above, and squeeze it with your hand with a moderate squeeze, until the oil is propelled into the cavity of the ear and is felt.	If you wish, you may make the obturator which goes in the cannula of strong bronze; or, if you like, take a probe and wrap cotton wool tightly round its tip; then pour into the cannula oil, juices, or whatever of these remedies you want, with the cannula in the ear. Then introduce the probe with cotton wool on it and press moderately until the oil is ejected into the meatus and the patient feels it enter.	0.77116233
The patient should feel it entering.  And whatever you pour into the ear should be warmed slightly over the fire.  Beware that the thing that is dropped in it is not extremely cold or extremely hot, for the ear cannot tolerate that.	Let that which you put into the ear first be slightly warmed at the fire; and be careful that it be neither very hot nor very cold, for the ear is not suited to bear that.	0.7991971

Some children may come out of their mothers' wombs with the openings of their ears unperforated.	Infants sometimes are born with an imperforated auditory meatus.	0.6128765
Blockage may also occur in some people in the ear canal due to a wound or flesh growing in it, and this blockage may be deep in the ear canal, imperceptible to sight.	Some people also get an obstruction in the passage of the ear, either from an injury or from flesh growing in it. Sometimes this obstruction is at the bottom of the ear out of sight, but sometimes it occurs a little outside the passage and is invisible.	0.82332814
It may also occur a little outside the opening and be perceptible to sight. The one that occurs deep in the ear and is imperceptible to sight is, in most cases, difficult to treat. As for the one that is perceptible to sight, you should place the patient's ear in the sun. And look into it. If you see the blockage apparent, open it with a delicate scalpel, the image of which is this:.	The sort which occurs in the depths of the ear and is invisible is, in general, difficult to cure. As for that which is within sight, set the patient's ear in the sun and examine it; and if you see that the object is something external you should make an opening with a fine scalpel like this.	0.85792494
Its tip should have some slight width, somewhat restricted, and the rest of the scalpel smooth on both sides so as not to harm the ear. If the blockage is from flesh that has grown in the ear canal, grasp it with delicate forceps and cut it very gently until all the flesh is extracted.	Let its extremity be slightly broad, with a sharp point; while the rest of the scalpel should be smooth on both sides so as not to harm the ear. But if the obstruction be from flesh growing in the auditory meatus, catch it with a fine hook and cut it, with the utmost gentleness, till all the flesh is gone.	0.8832338
If the blockage is deep in the ear, take a smooth, delicate probe, warm it slightly in the fire, then insert it into the ear canal. If you sense the blockage along with the heaviness of hearing that the patient experiences, pierce it gently.	If the obstruction be in the depth of the ear, take a fine smooth probe and warm it a little in the fire; then push it into the meatus. If you feel the obstruction (what time the patient will experience hardness of hearing), seek to perforate it gently, being careful not to injure the nerve of the ear.	0.86769104
And beware of injuring the eardrum. Then insert a wick into the ear, the size of the opening, having smeared it with the Egyptian ointment. Do this for several days until you are certain the wound will not close.  Or take a wick, soak it in water, and sprinkle powdered vitriol on it.	Then put in a plug the width of the meatus, which you will have anointed with Egyptian ointment; do this for some days till you are sure that the wound is healing. Or take a plug and dip it into water and sprinkle it with powdered vitriol and use that.	0.81319684
And use it.  If you see that the ear has become swollen with a hot swelling, you should remove the wick and replace it with another wick that you have smeared with a cerate made with rose oil, until the hot swelling subsides. Then treat it until it heals.	If you perceive the ear swelling with an abscess you should remove the plug and put in its place another previously prepared by soaking in wax made with oil of roses, till the abscess has subsided; then dress till it is healed.	0.7618668
If bleeding occurs, immerse a sponge or cloth in cold water and place it on the ear, and use all the other treatments that stop bleeding, which are mentioned in the chapter on ear drops.

If they bleed, cauterize them with a gentle lenticular cautery. Cauterization is best after cutting, and they frequently return if anything of their roots remains.

On the treatment of coldness occurring in the eyelids.	On the treatment of stones occurring in the eyelids.	0.79691386
Often something appears on the eyelids resembling coldness in its intensity and hardness.	There often occurs in the eyelids a thing resembling a hailstone in its strength and hardness, and therefore called 'hail'.	0.7156859
And for that reason it is called coldness, and it is a collection of thick moisture in the upper eyelid and the lower eyelid. The procedure for them is that you examine, and if the coldness is prominent on the surface of the eyelid, moving to every side, then its treatment is easy, so make a horizontal incision on it.	It is actually a collection of thick humours in the upper or lower lid. The operative treatment for it is thus: examine; and if the stone is external on the outer aspect of the lid, and mobile in all directions, dealing with it is simple.	0.6030205
Then peel it from every side gently until it is detached, then lift it with a hook and cut it. If it is not possible for you to cut it except after penetrating the eyelid with the cut, that will not harm the patient at all.  If the incision is large, bring it together with stitching and treat it until it heals.	You make above it a transverse incision; then scrape gently around it till it is free; then catch it up with a hook and cut it away. If it is in such a position that you cannot excise it without cutting through the lid, that will not harm the patient at all. If the incision be big, gather it up with a suture and dress it till it heals.	0.83812845
And if it is small, there is no harm for you from it, for the ointment will repair it and heal it. If the coldness is tending towards the inside of the eyelid, towards the inner surface, then turn the eyelid over and lift the coldness with a hook without needing to make an incision, and cut it away from every side.	If it be small, it will be no trouble, for ointment will restore it and heal it. If the stone is rather toward the inner aspect of the eyelid, then invert the lid and catch up the stone with a hook—you will not need to incise the lid—and cut it all round.	0.81930476
If you penetrate the eyelid with the cutting, that will not harm anything. Then wash the eye after cutting the coldness with salt water and treat the area with something that heals, until the patient recovers.	If the lid is pierced in the cutting, it will do no harm at all. Then, after cutting away the stone, wash the eye with salt water; then treat with cicatrizing medicines till healed.	0.82968795

On the treatment of pterygium that occurs in the eyelid.	On the treatment of hydatid in the upper lid.	0.48806998
Pterygium is a small fleshy mass that forms in the layers of the upper eyelid, and it most commonly occurs in children, and it makes their eyes heavy, and they experience discharges in the mornings, and they are unable to look at sunlight. Because tears flow to them quickly.	Hydatid is fat which arises in the folds of the upper lid. It is a disease chiefly occurring in children, irritating their eyes, giving them morning catarrh; they are unable to look full into the light of the sun, since they get an immediate secretion of tears.	0.72459394
Therefore, you see them always leaning on their faces, and they sleep on them, and their eyelids are moist under the eyebrows, swollen and puffy, and the pterygium appears clearly. When you press the area with your fingers, you feel the pterygium between them.  The procedure is that the patient places his head in your lap.	And for that reason you will find them lying always on their faces, and they also sleep on their faces; and the eyelids below the eyebrows are moist and covered with swellings, while the hydatid stands out prominently; and when you press upon the place with your finger you can feel the fat beneath it. The manner of operating is for the patient to let his head rest in your lap.	0.80359626
Then you take a linen cloth and prepare a wick from it and make a circle from that wick as large as it surrounds the pterygium from all sides, then you place it on it and press with your fingers from all sides to gather the pterygium in the center of the circle.	Then you take a scrap of linen and prepare a pad of it. Make it into a circle of sufficient size to enclose the whole of the hydatid on all sides, then place it on it and squeeze with your fingers on all sides, so as to gather up the hydatid in the centre of the circle.	0.8808253
Then you make a transverse incision in the middle of that moist area with a lancet. The incision should not be larger than the incision made in bloodletting. As for the depth, you should incise the entire skin until you reach the pterygium.	Then in the middle of this humidity make a crosswise incision with a lancet, but do not let the incision be larger than that made for a venesection. As to the depth, the skin should be incised right through till you come to the hydatid, which in most cases will come out from the incision, in the shape of a white piece of fat.	0.8199005
In most cases, the pterygium protrudes from the incision like a piece of white fat. You pull it out with a cloth wrapped around your fingers while rotating your hand right and left until it comes free. Beware of extending the incision, lest the lancet slip into the eye and injure it.	Draw it out with a cloth rolled between your fingers, turning your hand to right and to left till it is separated. Be careful not to go so deep with your scalpel that it sticks in the eye and injures it.	0.6497296
If the pterygium does not appear to you at the first incision, you should gently extend the incision a little until the pterygium appears, then pull it out as we have said. Then dip a cloth in vinegar and water and place it on the area and bandage it softly. Some people crush salt.	If you do not see the hydatid at the first incision, you must gently cut a little deeper till it comes forth, then draw it out as described. Then dip some cloth in vinegar and water, apply to the place and bind it up with pads. There are some who grind up salt and put it in the hollow of the incision to liquefy thereby the remains of the humidity.	0.83151585
And place it in the incision to dissolve what remains of that moisture, then treat it until it heals. If a hot swelling occurs in the area, treat it with soothing compresses until it heals.	Then dress till healed. If an effusion occur in the place, treat with sedative plasters till healed.	0.7244502

On the types of inverting the eyelid.	On the various methods of blepharoplasty.	0.45660794
If eyelashes grow on the eyelid excessively, unlike the natural way, beneath the natural eyelashes, and persist, they will harm the eye and cause various diseases such as constant tearing, relaxation of the eyelids, whiteness, and thickening, until it causes blindness.	When superfluous lashes grow on the eyelid outside their natural place, below the natural lashes, and continue, they injure the eye and give rise to many kinds of disease, such as chronic lachrymation, dropping of the eyelids (ptosis), and whiteness and opacity, eventually resulting in the destruction of the eye.	0.808877
Inverting the eyelid is done in four ways: either by cauterization with fire, or with a sharp medicine as mentioned in the chapter on cauterization, or the inversion may be by cutting and suturing, or with reeds, as I will describe.	The plastic operation on the eye is carried out in four ways: by the actual cautery; by caustic in the way mentioned above in the book on cauterization; by incision and suture; or with canes, as I shall describe.	0.8085147
You should place the patient's head in your lap, then turn the eyelid with your left hand. If it does not turn, then insert a needle with a thread from below the eyelid and pass the needle with the thread from above, and this should be near the hair itself.  Pull the thread upwards with the eyelid.	You should place the patient's head in your lap, then with your left hand turn out the eyelid. Now if it thus becomes everted, good; otherwise introduce a threaded needle beneath the eyelid and pass the needle up; let that be near the hair itself.	0.8898928
And turn it over with the probe, then make an incision inside the eyelid, below the excess hairs, with the lancet, from the greater angle to the smaller angle. Then pull the thread and place a small pad of cotton or cloth under the eyelid, then mark the eyelid with ink.	Then draw the thread up with the lid and invert the lid with a probe; then make an incision on the inside of the lid below the superfluous lashes with the lancet, from the greater to the lesser angle. Then draw out the thread and put beneath the lid a small pad of cotton or linen; then mark with ink on the eyelid the shape of a myrtle leaf.	0.86361057
Like the shape of a myrtle leaf, except that the shape should be according to how much you want to lift the eyelid, because people may differ in this, for some need to cut a suitable amount from the eyelid according to how much the eyelid has relaxed.	The shape should be according to the amount you wish to raise the lid, and varies in different people. In some cases you should cut away a fair amount in proportion to the ptosis but in others a smaller incision is enough; all this in due proportion to the extent of the ptosis.	0.5912266
And some need less cutting; all of this depends on the degree of eyelid relaxation. Then incise with the lancet on the two lines that you marked, starting from the greater angle to the smaller angle, and each incision should be near the natural hair, about the thickness of the probe.	In some cases you should cut away a fair amount in proportion to the ptosis but in others a smaller incision is enough; all this in due proportion to the extent of the ptosis. Then with a scalpel incise over the two lines you have marked, beginning at the greater angle and going toward the lesser angle; and let one incision be close to the natural lashes, at a distance of about the breadth of a probe.	0.77785635
Then insert the hook into one of the corners of the skin, then peel it all off.  Then join the two edges with sutures using a needle and fine wool thread. Wipe away the blood and stick down any excess threads on the eyebrows with something sticky.	Then introduce a hook into one angle of the skin and peel it all off; then join the edges with a needle and a fine woollen thread and wipe away the blood; and stick the ends of the threads to the eyebrow with adhesive, if you like; but if you do not it does not matter.	0.8596747
If you wish to do this, then do so, otherwise don't bother. Then leave the sutures and threads for about three or four days, then treat it. And if you wish, you can leave the wound without sutures and treat it with something that dries and constricts, for the eyelid will lift when the wound closes and joins.  Suturing is better.	Then let the suture and the threads remain for about three or four days, then dress. If you like, you may leave the wound without suture and treat it with drying medicaments and styptics; then the eyelid will be lifted as the wound heals and comes together; but suture is better.	0.87990403
This method of lifting I have mentioned from the ancients, except that it is troublesome for the patient, although it is good work and without danger.  There is also another method of lifting, which is to mark on the eyelid a shape like a myrtle leaf, as we have described. Then lift the eyelid with three hooks, which are either separate or joined, in this manner:	The Ancients mention this method of operating. It involves some burden for the patient; but the operation is good and safe. Yet another way of operating is to mark on the eyelid the figure of a myrtle leaf as we have described; then lift the eyelid with three hooks, either separate or joined thus.	0.8598627
Then cut the excess eyelid with small scissors in this manner, cutting evenly:	Then cut away the superfluous lid with a small pair of scissors with an even incision. The scissors are of this pattern.	0.65185905
If you cannot hold the hooks and it doesn't work for you, take a needle with thread and insert it in the middle of the shape. Insert another thread near the larger corner and a third thread near the smaller corner.  Gather the threads evenly between your fingers, then lift your hand with a moderate lift.	But if you cannot conveniently hold with the hooks, take a threaded needle and introduce it into the middle of the marking; and put another thread through near the greater canthus, and a third thread near the lesser canthus. With your fingers hold the threads evenly and then raise your hand evenly and you will raise up the whole of the marked skin as we have said.	0.88602734
And lift the entire marked skin as we have described, then join the edges of the wound with sutures and treat it until it heals.  If a hot swelling appears when you cut or incise, soothe that swelling with cerate and similar soothing ointments.	Then bring the edges together with a suture and dress till healed. But if in your incision, or the opening you have made, a swelling arises, then allay the swelling with wax and similar sedatives.	0.7262058
It can also happen that the lower eyelid turns in, and it is necessary to use what we have mentioned of cutting, suturing, and cauterizing with fire or with a sharp medication.  Cauterizing with fire or with a sharp medication is more effective and easier on the patient than cutting and suturing, while cutting and suturing are more effective in the other cases.	Sometimes the lower lid also has the lashes inverted. For this you should use any of the methods we have mentioned: the incision and suture, and the operation by the actual cautery and by caustic. ( The operation by the actual cautery or caustic) is more effective, and easier on the patient, than incision and suture, (but incision and suture) is more workmanlike in either lid.	0.70240766
Cauterization with reeds is done in this way: you turn the eyelid and make the incision on the inside as described, then make two thin reeds or pieces of wood the length of the eyelid and width less than the width of a scalpel.	Trimming the lid by means of canes is done as follows: you invert the eyelid and cut the inner slit as I have described; then you prepare two slender canes or rods of a length equal to that of the eyelid and a breadth less than that of a scalpel; and at either end of each you make a notch to hold the threads.	0.83118296
Notches are made at their ends on both sides where the threads are held. Then they are gently placed on the excess eyelid and tied firmly from both ends and left there for several days.  Thus, the tightened skin dies, turns black, and decays.	Then gently put them together over the superfluous part of the eyelid and tie them firmly together at both ends and leave for a few days; for the ligated flesh will necrose and turn black and putrefy and eventually fall away spontaneously.	0.83235765
Until it falls off by itself. If it is slow, cut it off with scissors then treat it until it heals.  When it heals, the eyelid will be lifted, and the lashes will not irritate the eye.  This is a picture of the two reeds, made in this shape and this exact size in length and width:.	But if it is slow in sloughing, cut off with shears; then dress till healed. And when it is healed the eyelid will be raised and the lashes will no longer irritate the eye. Now this is the figure of the canes; you should prepare them exactly in this shape and of this length and breadth.	0.7513538

If there is a hair or two, the procedure is to take a thin needle and thread it with a smooth, thin silk thread. Then, bring the two ends together and tie them in a very delicate knot. The length of the thread should be about a span.	If it be one or two hairs the operation will be to take a fine needle, thread it with a fine smooth silk, bring the ends together, and knot them with a tiny knot; the thread should be about a span in length.	0.8774993
Then, attach to the loop another thinner thread, shorter in length, and tie its ends if you wish.

Then in the loop insert another fine thread, shorter than the first, and join the ends with a knot if you wish. Then let the patient put his head in your lap in full sunlight, so that the operation may be clearly seen, because it is very fine work.	0.86905694
And quickly pass it through the eyelid until you bring it out above the natural hair. Then, pull the thread over the loop and insert the extra hair(s) into the loop, whether one, two, or three, no more.	Then introduce the needle with the loop to the root of the superfluous hair and run it quickly through the eyelid till you make it come out above the natural hair. Then draw the thread to the top of the loop and introduce that hair into the loop if it be one, two, or three, but not more.	0.806659
Then pull your hand with it until the hair comes out with the loop in the eyelid, along with the natural hairs. If you pull the loop and the hair does not come out with it, pull the loop down with the thread that you attached to it until the loop comes out of the upper hole.	Then draw away your hand with it until the hair emerges with the loop on the eyelid among the natural hair. If you pull the loop and the hair does not come out with it, you draw the loop down by means of the thread which you have previously passed through it, until the loop comes out at the upper perforation.	0.915087
Then replace the hair in it and pull them both. Do this until it rises in the upper hole and you can see it clearly. Then, release the loop and thread and remove them. Tighten the eye and leave it tightened for two or three days until the hair takes hold in its place and the flesh grows over it.	Then put the hair back in and draw them both up; keep on until the hair rises up in the upper perforation and you can see it. Then extract loop and thread and take them both out, and bind the eye and leave it bound for two or three days till the hair be fixed in its place and there is regeneration of flesh over it.	0.9299066
If the hair is short, you can either add a long natural hair to it so it rises with it, or leave it until it grows longer after a while, at which point you can lift it.	If the hair be short, put with it a long natural hair so that it may be raised together with that; or let the hair grow till it reach a greater length, then raise it.	0.87506217

On the treatment of ectropion that occurs in the upper eyelid.	On entropion occurring in the upper eyelid.	0.79253364
The condition that causes this ectropion is called "hare eye." This ectropion can be either congenital or acquired. The acquired type results from the healing of a wound, tear, cauterization, or something similar.	The eye that suffers this inversion of the lid is called 'leporine' (i.e. hareeye). Now sometimes this inversion is natural, sometimes acquired. It is acquired either from the cicatrization of an injury, or an incision, or cauterization, or the like.	0.7420461
The way to treat it is to incise the scar tissue, separate its edges, insert a linen wick between them, and tie it until it heals.  Things that dry and constrict should not be used in its treatment.	The idea of the operation is to excise the scar, separate the edges of the wound, pack linen between them, and bandage up till healed. In the treatment of it you should not use anything styptic or drying, for if you do the inversion will return worse than ever before.	0.80806124
If you do that, the ectropion will return worse than it was. Rather, use things that soften, such as fenugreek, and fomentation with water in which marshmallow root and flaxseed have been steeped, and diachylon ointment melted with some oil, and smear it on the wick and treat it with it.	Employ relaxing substances such as fenugreek; and fomentation with water in which mallows and linseed have been boiled; and diachylon plaster which has been previously softened with one of the oils and spread on the packs; and treat it with this.	0.75042033
The key to its treatment is to strive by every means that it does not heal in the way it was originally. This procedure that we have mentioned is only a partial correction of the ectropion, not that the appearance of the area will return to exactly how it was.	The main thing in the treatment is to use every device to prevent the healing up of the place as it was before. This operation which we have described is but some correction of the inversion, not that the appearance of the place will necessarily revert to what it was.	0.8009742

On the treatment of ectropion that occurs in the lower eyelid.	On the treatment of entropion of the lower lid.	0.770632
This ectropion, which occurs below, is what is truly called ectropion.  It may be natural or accidental.  The accidental type occurs from a wound, a laceration, cauterization, or the like.	This inversion in the lower lid is that which is truly called entropion; and it is either congenital or acquired. It is acquired by injury or incision or cautery or something like that.	0.7806392
The method of operating is to take a needle with a double thread and insert it into the flesh, passing it from the left canthus to the right canthus, until the thread is at both edges of the flesh. Then pull the flesh upwards with the needle and cut it with a wide scalpel.	This is the method of operating for it: you take a needle through which has been passed a double thread and you run it into the flesh, making it penetrate from the left angle of the eye to the right angle so that the thread is fixed in flesh both ends. Then with the needle stretch the flesh upwards and make an incision with a broad scalpel; and if the eyelid returns to its proper shape, well and good.	0.83597803
If the eyelid returns to its proper shape, then [stop]. Otherwise, take a probe, place it on the location of the incision, and turn the eyelid with it. Make two incisions on the inside of the eyelid, with the ends of the incisions starting from the corners of the cut that you made, until they meet, forming an angle. So that when they are joined, their shape resembles this form:.	But if not, take a probe and put it on the site of the incision and with it turn back the lid. Then make two incisions on the inner side of the lid; the two incisions should begin from the angles of the incision already made and run together making an angle so that when they join they are like this.	0.7483891
Which is the Greek letter lambda. Then remove the flesh, making the acute angle lower than the eyelid. Then join the separated parts with two sutures using wool thread. Then treat it with the softening medications and bandages we mentioned until it heals.	It is the Greek letter lambda. You remove that flesh in proportion as the angled side is lower than that adjoining the lid; then bring the divided parts together with two sutures made with a woollen thread. Then treat with the relaxing medicaments and dressings we have mentioned, till healed.	0.8749001
If the ectropion resulted from an incision, a suture, or cauterization, it is necessary to make a simple incision, again below the eyelashes as described before, then separate the two lips [of the wound] with bandages as we mentioned.	But if the inversion is acquired, from incision, suture, or cautery, you should make a simple incision below the eyelashes, as has been described, then bring apart the two edges with a packing, as we have said.	0.8230053
In summary, the treatment of ectropion, whether upper or lower, should be carried out according to the form the ectropion takes, as it can vary greatly in appearance.  The experienced practitioner will devise a strategy by whatever means possible.	The sum of what there is to say about the treatment of inversion, whether it is in the upper or the lower lid, is that you should make your procedure follow the actual lines of the inversion itself ; for this is of varying shape. The experienced practitioner will make use of his skill in any way he can to re-establish the natural form or approximate to it.	0.69887054
Until the form is restored to its natural state, or close to it.  The condition itself, in most cases, will guide you to the appropriate action and instrument.	The experienced practitioner will make use of his skill in any way he can to re-establish the natural form or approximate to it.

On the Adhesion of the Eyelid to the Conjunctiva or to the Cornea.	On adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or cornea.	0.93392444
This adhesion may occur in many people, where the upper eyelid adheres to the white of the eye, preventing its easy movement and hindering its natural functions.  Therefore, you should insert the end of a probe under the eyelid.	This adhesion happens to many people, the upper lid sticking to the white of the eye and hindering its movement and preventing its natural functions. You should introduce the end of a probe beneath the lid and raise it upward; or stretch it with a hook.	0.8707837
And lift it upwards or extend it with a hook, then cut the adhesion with a delicate scalpel, not as sharp as cutting scalpels, but somewhat blunt, so that the patient does not become agitated during the procedure and cause the scalpel to slip and injure the eye with its sharpness.  And your cutting should be as if you are peeling that adhesion.	Then cut the adhesion with a fine scalpel; it should not be so sharp as a cutting scalpel, but somewhat blunt, lest during the operation the patient should shake, and the scalpel slip, and the edge injure the eye. Let your incision be as if peeling off the adhesion.	0.85030556
And wait until the eyelid returns to its natural state and the entire adhesion heals. Then pour salt water into the eye to wash it, or drop in dissolved copper sulfate eye drops. Then separate the eyelid and the eye with a linen wick.	Wait until the lid regains its natural shape and the adhesions be wholly healed. Then rinse the eye with saline and cleanse it; or instil into it drops of a watery solution of eye-lotion of verdigris.	0.79079425
And place cotton wool moistened with egg white over the eye. After the third day, use soothing eye drops until it heals.

On Cutting the Pterygium and the Excrescence of the Eyes.	On incision of ungula and excrescence of the canthus.	0.6293462
The pterygium is of two types: either it is nerve-like, resembling a thin, hard membrane, or it is not nerve-like, resembling a solid white moisture which, if touched with iron or if you try to take it with a hook, breaks apart.	Ungula occurs in two forms: either the nervous, which resembles a fine hard membrane; or the non-nervous, like a white congealed humidity; which, when the iron touches it or you try to pick it up with a hook, is cut through and the hook has no hold on it.	0.7575338
And the hook will not hold in it. Both types begin from the larger canthus until they gradually creep until they cover the pupil and obstruct the light and the movement of the eye. The method of operating in cutting them is that the patient places his head in your lap.	Both kinds grow from the greater angle of the eye, whence they spread little by little until they cover the pupil and block both the vision and the movements of the eye.	0.6380589
Then he opens his eyes and you lift the eyelid with your hand, then you pick up the pterygium with a slightly curved hook and pull it upwards. Then you take a needle and thread it with a hair from a horse's or cow's tail and a strong thread, and bend the tip of the needle slightly and insert it in the middle of the pterygium.	This is the method of incision: the patient places his head in your lap and opens his eyes; then you raise the lid with your hand; then with a gently curved hook pick up the ungula and pull it upward; then take a needle threaded with a horse hair or an ox hair, and a strong thread; slightly curve the end of the needle; then thrust it into the middle of the ungula, piercing it with the needle; and tie the ungula with the thread and pull upwards; and, with the hair, peel the side of the ungula adjoining the pupil, and divide it with a sawing motion right through.	0.78616923
And pierce it with the needle and tie the pterygium with the thread and pull it upwards and peel the side of the pterygium that is next to the pupil with the hair, as if you were splitting it with the hair to its end. Then you cut the rest at the base of the canthus with a fine scalpel or small scissors, and leave the natural flesh of the canthus.	Then what is left in the root of the angle cut out with a fine scalpel, or with small scissors; and leave the natural caruncle in the canthus lest, in cutting it away, a chronic flux of tears occur.	0.6453381
So that a constant flow of tears does not occur from its cutting.  And the pterygium may be pulled with the hook alone or with the thread as we have said, then peel with the smooth scalpel the edge, which this is its image:	The ungula may be drawn out with the hook alone or with the thread as we have said, and scraped away with the smoothtipped scalpel of this form.	0.6015606
And be careful that the scalpel does not touch the cornea, causing a hernia in it, so the pupil is damaged. Then, after cutting, put in the eye some powdered salt or vitriol collyrium and leave it until the next day. Then treat it appropriately until it heals.	But beware lest the scalpel touch the corneal covering and cause a fissure in it and the pupil protrude. Then after the incision put into the eye a little powdered salt or an eye-lotion of verdigris, and leave it till the following day; then treat as may be necessary till it heals.	0.7747495
If the pterygium is not fleshy and you cannot insert a needle into it or fix a hook in it, then this type of pterygium is often treated with medications and heals as described in the classification.  If you want to cut it, open the patient's eye.	If the ungula is non-nervous in origin and you cannot transfix it with a needle nor get a hook to hold fast in it, this sort is often successfully treated by medical means. So treat as described in the section.	0.6937432
And take a fine, smooth scalpel with a weak edge, like this image:. And gently scrape the pterygium with it from above.  If you see that it loosens and crumbles and is affected by the scraping, then immediately instill in the eye vitriol collyrium, red collyrium, or powdered salt, and bandage the eye until the next day.	So treat as described in the section. But if you prefer to cut it, open the patient's eye, and take a fine smooth scalpel, rather blunt, like this and with this gently scrape away the ungula from above; and if you see that it is crumbling away and breaking down under the scraping, then immediately instil into the eye some eye-lotion of verdigris, or the red eye-lotion, or a little powdered salt, and bind the eye up till next day.	0.74928313
Then repeat the procedure until it is all gone, unless a hot swelling occurs in the eye.  Then leave it and treat the hot swelling until it heals, then repeat the scraping procedure until it heals. As for the fleshy growth of the conjunctiva...	Then repeat the operation on it till you have removed it all, unless an abscess forms in the eye, in which case cease the operation and treat the abscess till cured. Then repeat the treatment with the same scraping till healed.	0.778999
If the growth severely harms the eye, then grasp that growth with a hook and cut off some of it. Do not cut deeply, lest tearing occur. Then instill red or vitriol collyrium into the eyes until it heals.	As for a protuberance of flesh in the angle, if it causes great hurt pick it up with a hook and cut part of it away, with not too big an incision lest there be a flux of tears. Then into the canthus instil red eye-lotion or lotion of verdigris till healed.	0.7685181

On the excision of pterygium and the removal of excess flesh that grows in the eye.	On cutting for chemosis and superfluous flesh in the eye.	0.69894564
A red, overlapping fleshy growth may develop in the eyes of some people until it covers the pupil, or nearly covers it, or spreads over the eyelids, and sometimes the eyelids turn outward, and it resembles a pomegranate blossom.	Sometimes in the eye of certain people a red granulation grows up and increases so as to block the pupil or nearly so; or it grows over the eyelids and often turns the lids outward, and it resembles the blossom of the pomegranate.	0.87801605
The procedure for this is to have the patient place their head in your lap, then open their eyes, and you grasp all of that red flesh with hooks suitable for that.	You operate for this by having the patient put his head in your lap; then he opens his eyes and you gather up the granulation whole, with suitable hooks, or hold it with tweezers or forceps.	0.7213404
Or you grasp it with forceps or tweezers, then you cut the flesh bit by bit until you completely excise it all, taking care with the eye so that you don't harm it during the procedure, and your cutting of it should be either with the scalpel that we described for excising pannus or with small scissors. Like those with which eyelashes are grasped, as their image will appear in the chapter following this one.	Then you cut away the first bit of flesh and then the next, until you have cut it all away; and beware of damaging the eye in the course of operation. Your incision should be made with the scalpel which we described for the incision of pterygium; or with small scissors like those with which one gathers up pannus, as shown in the chapter after this.	0.8064038
When your excision is completed and all the fleshy growth is gone, fill the eye with powdered salt or instill red vitriol and similar corrosive medications, and apply cotton with egg white on the outside of the eye to prevent hot swelling.	And when you have finished your incision and removed all the chemosis, fill the eye with powdered salt or instil the red powder or similar corrosive; and apply to the outside of the eye cotton wool with white of egg to ward off an abscess.	0.8317545
If any of the fleshy growth remains and the blood overwhelms you, and you fear hot swelling, then leave the eye and treat it with what calms the swelling, then return to it with the procedure until it heals. And likewise, do this with excess flesh of this type that occurs in the eye.	If there is any chemosis left and blood is getting the better of you and you fear an abscess, then desist and treat the eye with those means for settling a tumour. Thereafter return to your operation till cured. So must you do with superfluous flesh that arises in the eye.	0.8244827
Except that you should avoid treating any eye weakened by nature or by accidental cause with iron instruments, and do not put your hand to any of these procedures until you see that the organ is able to withstand the procedure.	But you must avoid treating surgically any eye that is weak, whether congenitally or by acquired disease.

On Extracting Trachoma from the Eye.	On gathering up pannus from the eye.	0.5391519
Trachoma are red vessels that grow over the eye, preventing it from seeing and weakening it over time. So you should first look, and if the eye that has the trachoma is strong and has no other disease besides the trachoma.	Pannus is a network of blood-vessels spreading over the eye so as to interfere with the function of sight and, in the course of time, weakening the eye. You must first examine, and if the eye with the pannus be strong, with no fault other than the pannus, then the pannus should be gathered up.	0.578341
then extract it, which is to have the patient place his head in your lap, then catch those vessels with one or two hooks, depending on your skill, and the hooks should be gently curved in this manner:.	This is done by bidding the patient put his head in your lap; then, as skilfully as you may, pick up those blood-vessels with one or two hooks. The hooks should be of a gentle curve, like this.	0.8090223
or there may be two double hooks in one body, like this:.	Or there can be two hooks joined together on one handle, thus.	0.73259443
Then gently grasp those vessels with fine scissors and wipe the blood from time to time until you see the eye and those vessels are gone from it and the blood is drained. Be careful not to injure the eye with the tips of the scissors, and let your work be done at midday facing the sun.	Then take up the blood-vessels gently with the fine scissors, and wipe away the blood constantly, till you see all those blood-vessels removed from the eye, and the blood wells forth. But be careful of the eye lest you damage it with the points of the scissors.	0.8536264
And be very steady in your work, lest you cut anything other than those vessels, then when you are finished, instill into the eye the green or red collyrium so that it may consume with its sharpness what remains of the trachoma. If you cannot extract it all at that time, then dress the eye with something that soothes eye pain.	Let your work be done in broad sunlight at midday; and be very steady in your action so as to cut nothing beside the bloodvessels. When you have finished, instil the red or green lotion into the eye to destroy by its caustic action the remnants of the pannus.	0.73181856
And leave it for a few days until the pain subsides and you are safe from the hot swelling, then repeat the procedure in this same manner until it heals. This is a picture of the smooth scissors.	If you are unable to gather it all up at that one time, apply a plaster to the eye such as will allay the pain, and leave him* for a few days till* the pain be eased and there is no danger of an abscess. Then repeat the operation in the same manner till it is healed. This is a figure of the scissors. [	0.66192496

Then repeat the operation in the same manner till it is healed. This is a figure of the scissors. [ The principle in the operation is that the eye be opened with double or triple openers held by a skilful pupil, the patient's head being in that pupil's lap, while another wipes away the tears and carefully watches the internal and external angles of the eye.

Then attach hooks below the points of the first two, and hold them between your third and fourth fingers. Raise your hand slightly until you see that the whole pannus has been lifted. Then cut from the lesser angle, with scissors or a fine scalpel, as you wish.	0.8594762
And insert the probe on a needle and probe the entire trachoma until it rises onto the probe, and do not cut while wiping because the tears and blood will make it difficult (liquefy) for you.

Physicians call the septum a fistula. If you treat it with cautery or with a sharp, burning medication, as described previously, and it does not heal, then there is no recourse but to incise the swelling when it is ripe and extract all the moisture or pus that is in it.	Doctors give the name 'fistula' to what laymen call 'a quill'. When you have treated it with the cautery or with caustic according to the instructions given previously, and it is not healed, there is no clear method of treatment except to cut down on the tumour at its ripening and let out all the humidity or pus therein, till you reach the bone.	0.8167511

Place it on the corrupted part of the bone, then rotate it between your fingers, while you tighten your hand a little, until you know that the corruption has been scraped away.	It is called 'rough-head' and is made of Indian iron. Its head is round like a button but is engraved with markings finely engraved, like those of a file or a rasp. Place it on the site of the diseased bone and spin it between your fingers, pressing down a little with your hand, till you are sure all the diseased bone has been scraped away.	0.90411973
Do this several times, then dress the area with desiccating, astringent medications. If the area heals over and flesh grows in it and the discharge stops, and this remains for forty days, and it does not recur, and there is no swelling, and no incident occurs,	Do this several times. Then let the place be dressed with stanching and styptic remedies. And if the place heals and flesh is generated there and the flow of sanies is stayed and there is no return after leaving for forty days, and there is no swelling, and nothing emerges, you may know it is perfectly healed.	0.8615884
then know that it has healed. Otherwise, there is no recourse but to return the fistula to the nostril in this way: you must expose the bone again with an iron instrument or with a sharp medication. When the bone is exposed, take a probe shaped like this:	But if not, there is no other means for it but to turn the fistula into the cavity of the nose, in this style, namely, that you lay bare the bone a second time, either by an instrument or by caustic; and when the bone is uncovered, then take a drill like this.	0.77366024
The tip of the instrument should be triangular, and its shaft conical, tapering towards the tip as you see.  Then place it on the bone itself, close to the nostril, and move your hand slightly away from the eye. Then turn your hand with the probe until it penetrates the bone, and the patient feels it.	Its extremity, which is of iron, should be triangular; and its wooden handle should be conical in shape, and, as you see, tapering to the extremity. Then put it to the bone itself near the canthus; but keep your hand a little away from the eye; then with your hand rotate the drill till the bone is perforated; and the patient will have the sensation of this, since, if he holds his hands over his nose he will find the breath coming out through the hole.	0.82528794
He will notice air coming out of it if he holds his hand over his nose. At that point, dress the area with astringent, desiccating medications as I have taught you. When the flesh grows and the area hardens, the matter that was draining outwards will return to the nose, and this will be less distressing for the patient, God willing.	And then dress the place with styptic and stanching remedies as I have taught you.

If the eye protrudes in its entirety without causing any damage or impairment to vision, you should first reassure the patient.

When the whole eye is prominent and there is no reduction or impairment of vision, you should get the patient's bowels open.	0.5862967
Then, apply a poultice to the eye made from acacia, aloe, frankincense, and sarcocolla.  Then bandage the eye tightly over the poultice with many compresses.  The method for the compresses is to take many soft rags and fold each cloth into four layers, making many of them.	Then venesect him in the cephalic vein; then apply cupping vessels to his neck without scarification and draw off by gentle suction; then put to the eye a poultice made of acacia and aloes and olibanum and sarcocolla; then bandage the eye over the application with many pads. The way to make pads is to take a number of soft rags and fold each into four thicknesses. Prepare a good many.	0.8305826
Then place them one on top of the other as much as the eye requires, then tie them tightly with a strong cloth. Reapply the cupping glass with suction, without scarification.

If the bandaging slackens during that time, it must be tied properly. Then remove the bandaging after a day and a night, as we have said. If you see that the eye has receded, good. Otherwise repeat the applications and pads and bandages and the cupping till it does recede.	0.8939423

On incising the uvea.	On cutting for staphyloma.	0.40864837
If a hernia occurs in the uveal layer, then it swells and protrudes outside the eyelids like a grape, thus disfiguring the person, and you want to remove it, the procedure is as I describe.	When a rupture befalls the uveal membrane so that it swells and protrudes outside the eyelids looking like a grape, and on this account the man's features are disfigured; if you intend to cut it away the operation will be as I am about to describe.	0.8118067
That is, you insert a needle into the base of the growth from below to above. Then you insert another needle threaded with a double thread from the side of the canthus, and pass it through.  Leave the first needle as it is.	You introduce a needle to the root of the uvea from the lower to the upper segment; then you introduce another needle threaded with a double thread, from the region of the canthus major where you will perforate it; and leave the first needle in its place.	0.8253794
Then you cut the doubled thread at the loop and tie some of the growth around the needle and tighten it gently. Then remove the needle and apply wool moistened with egg white to the eye, and leave it until the threads fall off with the growth.  Then treat the eye with something that strengthens it.	Then cut the place of doubling of the doubled thread, and with it ligature that part of the excrescence around the needle and tie it well. Then remove the needle and apply to the eye wool moistened with egg-white; and leave till the thread falls away with the growth. Then treat the eye with fortifying dressings till the wound be healed. Sometimes the uvea is tied all round with a circle of material so that the prominence of the eye is greatly increased.	0.86571485
Until the wound heals. You can also tie the growth from all sides with a circle of cloth, so that the eye swells up gently, then lance it with a thin scalpel reaching to the depths of the eye, so the aqueous humor flows and the eye shrinks and withers on the spot, then bandage it until it heals.	Then treat the eye with fortifying dressings till the wound be healed. Sometimes the uvea is tied all round with a circle of material so that the prominence of the eye is greatly increased. Then you perforate it with a fine scalpel going to the depth of the eye; and an albuminous humour will flow out and the eye will shrink and return at once. Then bandage till healed.	0.7832532

On the Treatment of Pterygium.	On the treatment of hypopyon.	0.6706316
This condition, which is called pterygium, is a growth that gathers in the eye, resembling but not actually, flowing water.  The way to operate is to sit the patient upright on a chair, then take his head in your two hands.	This disease which is called 'hypopyon' is a collection of pus in the eye which resembles cataract but is not so. The method of operating in this disease is to make the patient sit upright on a chair before you.	0.6656638
And move it until you see the growth descend in the eye, then it becomes fixed and does not move, and the light breaks through and the patient sees things as he used to. If it does not descend, we know that it is fluid. If the descent of the growth cannot be achieved by what we have described…	Take his head on either side with your hands and shake it about till you can see the pus come down; then it will be fixed and not move; and the light will pass and the patient will see things as he was before. But if it does not come down, we know it is cataract.	0.7480601
Otherwise, sit the patient before you, then take a thin scalpel and make a small incision above the cornea at the junction of the conjunctiva with the cornea in the limbus until the material comes out.	But if the pus is not ready to be brought down by this method, then seat the patient in front of you; then take a fine scalpel and cut a little above the corneal tunic near the coronal junction of conjunctiva and cornea, till the pus comes out.	0.75381637
Once it comes out, instill into the eye hot water mixed with honey, or water in which fenugreek and honey have been boiled. Then treat with other medications until healed.	When it comes out, instil warm water mixed with honey, or water boiled with fenugreek and honey. Then treat as usual till healed.	0.8625062

We have mentioned the types of fluids in the classification and which ones are suitable for cupping with detailed and explanatory words. Take them from there correctly. Then you should sit the patient before you, cross-legged, facing the light, near the sun.	We have already mentioned in the appropriate section the varieties of cataract and those in which depression is useful, in full detail; so you may take it accurately from there. You should cause the patient to sit down cross-legged before you, facing the light in full sun, and firmly bind up his sound eye.	0.80152345
And you bandage his healthy eye and tighten it well, then lift the eyelid of his eye with your left hand if the eye containing the fluid is the left eye, or with your right hand if it is the right eye.	Then lift up his eyelid with your left hand, if it be the left eye in which the humour is; or with the right hand if it be the right eye.	0.7513757
Then you place the tip of the lancet near the iris, about the thickness of a probe, in the white of the eye itself, towards the smaller canthus, then push the lancet forcefully while rotating it with your hand until it penetrates the white of the eye and you feel with the lancet that it has reached an empty space.	Then put the tip of the needle near the corona, about the thickness of a probe away, onto the white of the eye itself, on the side of the lesser canthus. Then thrust the needle firmly in, at the same time rotating it with your hand, until it penetrates the white of the eye, and you feel that the needle has reached something empty.	0.908041
And the depth of the lancet's penetration should be equal to the distance between the pupil and the edge of the black, which is the iris of the eye, because you will see the lancet in the eye of the observer due to the clarity of the cornea. Then turn the lancet upwards to the place where the fluid is.	The depth the needle goes in should measure as the distance from the pupil to the edge of the iris, which is the corona of the eye; you will see the metal in the pupil itself because of the transparency of the corneal tunic.	0.7119677
Then press it downwards repeatedly. If the fluid descends immediately, the patient will see whatever he opens his eyes to immediately, while the lancet is still in his eye. Then wait a little. If the fluid rises, lower it again without removing the lancet.	Then put the needle up to the place containing the humour; then press the point downwards time after time. If the humour comes down at once, the patient will at once see whatever his vision is opened upon while the needle is still in his eye. Then let him rest a little while; and if the humour goes back up again depress it a second time without taking the needle out.	0.8580705
When it has settled and does not rise, remove the lancet gently while slowly rotating it with your hand. Then dissolve some pure Indian salt in water and wash the inside of the eye with it. Then place a compress or moistened wool over the entire outside of the eye.	When it stays down firmly and does not come back again, gently draw the needle out, twisting it ever so slowly with your hand. Then dissolve a little pure rock-salt in water and wash the eyeball with the solution; then apply all over the outer aspect of the eye carded linen or wool moistened with oil of roses and egg-white, and bandage it up together with the sound eye.	0.826282
With rose oil and egg white, and bandage the healthy eye as well. But we and the people of our time apply crushed cumin with egg white on it. If the lancet does not enter the eye due to its hardness, because some people have very hard eyes. Then you should take the scalpel called "al-bared," which looks like this:.	Now we and our contemporaries apply pounded cumin with the egg-white. But if the couching needle does not serve, failing to enter the eye on account of its hardness (for there are some whose eyes are hard indeed), you should take the scalpel called al-baridl figured thus.	0.7744851
Pierce the conjunctiva only with it, and do not penetrate deeply.  The purpose is just to prepare a small place for the lancet. Then insert the lancet as we have described. When your work is complete, prepare a comfortable bed for the patient to lie on his back in a darkened room.	With this make a perforation in the conjunctiva only, not piercing any further; for that is only to make a little entrance for the needle. And then thrust in the needle as we said before. At the end of your operation, prepare a solidly-built bed on which the patient may lie on his back, in a dark room; and keep him from all movement or coughing.	0.8255211
He should refrain from all movement and coughing. His food should be what softens his nature. He should not move his head right or left at all. The bandage should remain in place until the third day, then you loosen it in that darkened room and test his vision.	And prescribe such a diet for him as will relax his system; neither let him move his head to right or to left. Let the bandage remain in the same position till the third day.	0.66177005
Show him some things, then replace the bandage until the seventh day. You should not do this during the treatment or immediately after the incision. Rather, you should avoid this beforehand, because water rises quickly with intense looking.	Then loosen it in the same dark room and make trial of his sight, putting before him objects to be seen; then replace the bandage till the seventh day. You should not do this at the time of treatment nor immediately after the perforation by the needle; but on the contrary you should avoid it, for intensive use of the eye causes a rapid ascent of the humour.	0.75517106
If a hot swelling appears, you should uncover the eye before the seventh day and treat it with what will reduce the swelling. When it subsides, you can then release his sight and put a veil over his face, training his vision under it for a few days while he is in the darkened room. Then...	But if an abscess occur you should unbandage the eye before the seventh day and restore it to health by those methods that allay swelling. When it has subsided, allow him free sight, putting over his face a dark veil beneath which his vision may be exercised for a few days while he is still in the dark room. Then let him come out of the room gradually and take up the exercise of his business.	0.8435162
He may gradually leave the house and manage his affairs.  Know that the learner cannot dispense with observing the incision many times before proceeding with the operation. I have heard from some Iraqis that they mentioned making a hollow lancet in Iraq that sucks out the water.	Then let him come out of the room gradually and take up the exercise of his business. But you should know that in the case of a depression of a cataract the student cannot manage without having seen that operation performed several times; then he may perform it himself. I have heard that a certain Iraqi has said that in Iraq he makes a hollow needle by which the humour is sucked out.	0.76365125
I have not seen anyone in our country make it, nor have I read about it in any of the books of the ancients. It may be a recent innovation. This is a picture of the types of lancets, so those who are unfamiliar with them may understand them:.	In our land I have never seen anyone do it in this fashion, nor have I read of it described in any of the books of the Ancients; perhaps it is newly invented.

Various excess growths may develop in the nose. Among these are some that resemble a multi-legged scorpion. Some are hard, cancerous growths, the color of dark blood. And some are soft growths, not the color of dark blood.	Sometimes there arise in the nose various superfluous fleshy growths. One of these is a thing resembling a centipede; another, a cancerous growth, stony, hard, and pale in colour; another again is a soft growth, not pale.	0.8265969
If any of these growths are soft, and are neither malignant nor cancerous, you should have the patient sit facing the sun. Open his nostril and insert the hook into the growth, then draw it outwards. Then cut whatever you can reach of it with a delicate, sharp scalpel, cutting from one direction.	Any of these growths that is soft is not malignant or cancerous. You should make the patient sit before you, facing the sun, and dilate his nose and introduce a hook into these polyps and draw them out; then amputate what you can take hold of, with a fine scalpel sharp on one side, till you know that all the growth is gone.	0.89400613

If it be a malignant swelling, then speedily cauterize till the bleeding stops and all the polypi are gone.

...and tie many knots in it, leaving the space of a finger or less between each knot. Have the patient contrive to insert one end of the thread into his nose with a probe or whatever he can, after twisting it like a wick.

In this case you must take a linen thread, rather thick, and tie many knots in it with a space of a finger's breadth or less between each pair of knots; and let the patient try to get one end of the thread into his nose with a probe or anything he can, after making it into the form of a button; and let him make a full inspiration till it reaches the cartilage and comes out through the throat.	0.8173758

Therefore, it should be cut off at its first appearance and completely excised. Then, either cauterization or a caustic medication that acts as cauterization should be applied to the area. If its excision is delayed until it grows large, examine it.  If it is hardened, solid, dark in color, and has little sensation.	So you should cut them out when they first appear; totally eradicate them and apply to the place cauterization, either actual or by caustic. But if excision of them has been overlooked till they have grown big, then examine, and if the growth is stone-like, hard, and pale in colour, and with little sensation, do not interfere with it with an instrument, for it is a cancerous tumour.	0.78818274
Do not apply iron to it, for it is a cancerous tumor. I have often seen that when this tumor is cut, a great affliction returns upon its owner.  If the tumor is soft to the touch, not dark in color, and you see that complete excision is possible, Then have the patient vomit and cut it without hesitation or delay. Treat the site with something that dries and constricts until it heals.	For I have often seen people cut these tumours, and great affliction resulted to the sufferer.

On suture of nose, lip, and ear, when there is discontinuity from a wound or the like. You should know that when discontinuity occurs in one of these cartilages, treatment of them rarely does any good, except in a few people.	0.9090018
So when something like this happens to someone, see if the wound is fresh with blood, then bring the edges of the wound together with sutures and then treat it until it heals.  And if the separation has separated its edges and each side has become sound, then you should scrape each side to the thickness of its visible skin until it bleeds.	When such a thing happens to anyone, look carefully, and if the wound be fresh and bleeding, bring the edges of the wound together with a suture, and dress them till they are healed.	0.7827522
Then bring the two edges together with sutures and tighten them, and sprinkle on them powdered acacia and frankincense, and apply over the powders a plaster of palm ointment or other healing ointments, and leave it tight for two or three days, then loosen it.	If the discontinuity has separated the edges, and both edges have healed, it is necessary to scrape both edges on the external skin till they bleed; then bring the edges together with a suture and dust over it dragon's blood and olibanum; and put over the powder a plaster of Palm ointment or some other of the regenerative ointments, and leave bandaged for two or three days; then unbandage and change the medicine, and let the sutures come away of themselves; and afterward dress with ointment till healed.	0.7396285

Rough, unsightly scales may accumulate on the surfaces of the teeth, inside and out, and between the gums.

Sometimes there collect upon the inner and outer surface of the teeth and also between the gums, rough scales, ugly, sometimes black or yellow or green, from which corruption is communicated to the gums and thus the teeth become unsightly.	0.8289751
You should seat the patient before you with his head in your lap, and scrape the molar and the tooth on which you see the scales and the sand-like substance, until nothing of it remains. Likewise, you should do with the blackness, greenness, yellowness, and so forth, until you clean them.	The patient should sit before you, putting his head in your lap; and you should scrape the teeth or molars on which you can discern crusts or gritty substance, till nothing remains; do them all in the like manner, black, green, yellow, and the rest, until they are all gone.	0.8942689

On the Extraction of Teeth.	On the extraction of teeth.	0.93285555
You should treat the tooth for its pain by every means and delay its extraction, for there is no replacement for it once it is extracted, because it is a noble substance. Until, when there is no alternative to extracting it.	You should treat toothache with every device and be reluctant to extract; nothing can replace the tooth when it is extracted, for it is a noble substance—until there is no means of avoiding extraction.	0.8482615
So when the patient resolves on its extraction, you should be certain, until you are sure about the aching tooth. For often the pain deceives the patient, and he thinks that it is in the sound tooth, and so extracts it, then the pain does not go away until the diseased tooth is extracted. We have seen this done by cuppers repeatedly.	When the patient is determined to have it out, act with deliberation till you are sure which is the painful tooth; for often the pain deceives the patient and he thinks the pain is in a tooth that is sound, so he has that one extracted; but the pain does not abate until the diseased tooth is removed. We have frequently seen this happen in the practice of the barber-surgeons.	0.9054905
So when you are certain of the specific aching tooth, then you should incise around the tooth with a somewhat strong scalpel until you loosen the gum on all sides. Then move it with your fingers or with fine forceps, first little by little, until you loosen it.	When you are quite sure which is actually the painful tooth you should cut away all round the tooth with a scalpel having a certain measure of strength, until the gum is separated all round.	0.77523255
Then grasp it firmly with the large forceps, and the patient's head should be between your knees, held firmly so that it does not move. Then pull the tooth straight, so that you do not break it. If it does not come out, then take one of those instruments and insert it under it from every side gently and softly, moving it as you did before.	Then, with your fingers, or with a pair of fine forceps, first move the tooth slowly and gently till you stir it; then get a good grip on it with a pair of large forceps, holding the patient's head between your knees so that it does not move. Then draw the tooth straight out so as not to splinter it. And if it will not come out, then take one of these following instruments and gradually introduce it beneath the tooth all round; then try to move it as you did before.	0.8782898
And if the tooth is perforated or decayed, then you should fill that hole with a piece of cloth and plug it well with the tip of a thin probe, so that it does not crumble when you pull on it with the forceps. And you should incise completely around the gum on every side, yes indeed.	If the tooth has a hole in it or is decayed, you should plug the hole with a rag, forcing it in with the tip of a fine probe so that it will not break when you grip it with the forceps. You must completely scarify all round the gum.	0.8725184
And take care not to break it, leaving some of it behind, which would cause the patient a worse affliction than his initial pain. And beware of imitating the ignorant cuppers in their boldness and haste in extracting it without using what we have described.	Take the utmost care not to splinter the tooth lest a piece should remain behind and arouse the patient's ills afresh, causing greater pain than before. Take care not to do those things that the ignorant barber-surgeons do in their rashness and haste in dental extraction, neglecting to employ the methods we describe.	0.7718377
For they often cause people great harm, the least of which is breaking the tooth and leaving all or some of its roots behind. Or they may extract it with some of the jawbone, as we have witnessed repeatedly. Then after its extraction, the patient should rinse his mouth with wine or vinegar and salt. If bleeding occurs from the site, as often happens, then grind some vitriol and pack the site with it.	For they often bring great troubles upon people, the least of which is to break the tooth off short, leaving the whole or part of the root behind; or to remove the tooth together with a piece of the jaw bone, as I have often seen. Then after the extraction let the patient rinse with wine or vinegar and salt. If there occur haemorrhage from the place—a common occurrence—then pound up a little vitriol and stuff the place with it.	0.9312012
Otherwise, cauterize it if the vitriol is not effective.  A picture of the delicate forceps, which are used to loosen the tooth first: they should have long ends, short handles, and be thick so that they do not bend when you grip the tooth with them. And this is a picture of the large forceps:	If the vitriol does not avail, cauterize. The shape of the fine forceps with which you first move the tooth should be with long jaws and a short handle, thick, lest they bend when you take hold of the tooth. And this is the shape of the large forceps.	0.8505424
They are, as you see, thick-handled so that when you grip them they do not give way or bend, and they have short ends. Let them be made of Indian steel or well-tempered steel, with polished ends.  And at their ends are teeth that interlock, gripping firmly and tightly.	As you see, they have thick handles so that when you apply pressure with them they do not give or bend; and short jaws. They should be of Indian iron or of steel, strongly made, the jaws tempered and having teeth fitting into each other so that a sure and firm grip may be obtained.	0.8980381
The ends may also be made like a file, thus making the grip strong as well.	Sometimes the jaws are made like a file, also to give a strong grip.	0.7656455

On Extracting Tooth Roots and Removing Broken Jaw Bones.	On the extraction of roots and of broken pieces of mandible.	0.7234926
If, when extracting a tooth, a root remains broken, you should place cotton with oil on the area for a day or two until the area softens, then insert the forceps or hooks.	When, in extracting a tooth, a broken-off root remains behind, you should apply to the place cotton wool soaked in butter for one or two days to soften it; then insert the tongs or forceps with stork-bill jaws; this is the figure of the forceps.	0.81239605
It should be made like a rasp on the inside, or like a scalpel.  If it does not yield to extraction with these hooks, then you should excavate around the root and expose all the flesh with the scalpel, then insert the instrument that resembles a small lever, which is pictured here:.	The point should be made like a file or rasp on the inside. If it does not respond to your attempt to extract it with these forceps, you must dig down over the root and remove all the flesh, and then insert the instrument that resembles a small crowbar; this is its figure.	0.8718357
Short-tipped, slightly thick, and not pointed, lest it break. If the root comes out with that, then good; otherwise, use these other instruments, which are pictured here. The first has a triangular tip and is somewhat thick:	It has a short rather thick extremity, and should not be tempered lest it fracture. If the root comes out, good; if not, get assistance from the other instruments figured here. First, with a triangular point, somewhat stout.	0.876373
Another delicate triangular image:.	Another, triangular and slender.	0.54351413
We may also use this two-pronged instrument, which is also pictured here:.	Sometimes also we get help from this forked instrument and beside this, from other instruments and appliances mentioned above under scraping of teeth.	0.45314205
And with other instruments and irons that were mentioned earlier in the extraction of molars. We may also use this instrument that resembles a large hook, which is pictured here:.	Sometimes also recourse may be had to this instrument resembling a large hook, figured thus.	0.5139086
Triangular-tipped, curved, somewhat thick so that it does not break, and not pointed.  Know that the instruments for molars are many, as are all other instruments, and they are almost countless. The skilled and experienced craftsman may invent instruments for himself according to what the work and the diseases themselves indicate to him.	The hooked extremity is triangular in section, of some thickness lest it break, not tempered. You should know that dental instruments are very numerous, as are the other instruments, almost beyond reckoning. And the experienced worker with a knowledge of his craft may devise fresh instruments according as his work on actual cases suggests them to him.	0.84469724
Because there are some diseases for which the ancients did not mention instruments, due to the variation in their types. If a bone of the jaw or one of the bones of the mouth is broken or decayed, then investigate it in its place with whatever is appropriate for it from one of these instruments and hooks that were mentioned for extracting roots.	For there are certain diseases for which the Ancients did not mention any instruments, on account of the variety of them. Now if the mandible or one of the bones of the mouth be broken or decayed, explore the site with some instrument that is suitable for it, namely one of the instruments or forceps mentioned for extraction of roots.	0.92969346
And we use a forceps, which is pictured here:.	We also make use of forceps of this form.	0.6101988
It should have some thickness so that the bone can be grasped with it and not escape until the bone is extracted. And we treat the area with appropriate medications. If there is slight decay in the bone, scrape it from its decay and blackness until it is clean, then treat it until it heals.	They are fairly thick, to grip the bone firmly lest it slip before the bone has been got out. Then cicatrize the place with suitable drugs.

When molars grow in other than their natural course, they make the appearance ugly, especially if this happens in women and slaves. So you should examine them. If the molar has grown behind another molar,	When teeth grow in other than their natural place the appearance is very bad, specially when it occurs in women or slaves.	0.6896921
and sawing it or filing it down is not possible, then extract it. If it is attached to another molar, cut it with this instrument, which is pictured here:	So you should examine; if the tooth has grown out behind another tooth and it is impossible either to saw or file it down, then extract it. But if it be attached to another tooth, cut it down with an instrument of this kind.	0.72709006
It resembles a small beak and should be made of sharp Indian steel, very sharp at the tip. You should cut it over the course of several days, due to the hardness of the tooth and so as not to loosen other molars. But if it is protruding in a way that allows filing, file it with a file made of Indian steel, which is pictured here.	It resembles a small chisel and should be of Indian steel with a well-sharpened end. You should spread your cutting with it over several days on account of the hardness of the tooth and so as to leave the others undisturbed. If the tooth projects in such a way as to make filing possible, use a file of Indian iron, shaped like this.	0.9227694
It should be entirely made of Indian steel and its cutting edge should be very finely engraved, like the file used for making needles. File the tooth with it a little at a time, gently over several days, so you don't loosen the tooth and cause it to fall out. Then, finally, smooth and polish it with a polisher.	It should be wholly manufactured of Indian iron, its handle too, and covered with very fine points to resemble the file used in making needles. You should file the tooth with it very slowly and gently over a period of many days so as not to shift the tooth and cause it to fall out; then finally smooth it and scrape it with one of the scrapers.	0.93800485
If a part of a molar has broken off and it hurts the tongue when speaking, you should also file it down until the roughness of the break is gone and it becomes even and smooth and doesn't hurt the tongue or impede speech.

On Splinting Loose Teeth with Silver or Gold Wires.	On interlacing loose teeth with silver or gold wire.	0.92896056
If the front teeth become loose and shaky from a blow or a fall, and the patient cannot bite on anything that is eaten for fear that they will fall out, and you have treated them with astringent medicines but the treatment has not been successful.	When the front teeth are loosened by some blow or fall and the patient cannot bite upon what he is eating lest they fall out, and you have without avail treated them with styptic medicines, the technique in this case is to bind the teeth with gold or silver wire.	0.764102
The remedy is to tie them with a gold or silver wire, and gold is better because silver tarnishes and corrodes after a few days, while gold remains in its original state forever and is not affected by this. The wire should be of medium thinness and thickness, as much as fits between the teeth.	Gold is the better, for silver oxidizes and corrodes after some days, but gold remains for ever in its state and does not suffer this change. The wire should be moderate in thickness in accordance with the distance between the teeth.	0.8460303
The method of splinting is to take the wire and insert its bend between the two sound teeth, then weave the ends of the wire between the loose teeth, whether one or more, until you reach the sound tooth on the other side with the weaving.	The method is to take the wire and run it doubled between two sound teeth; then with the two ends of the wire you weave between the loose teeth, either one or several, until you bring your weaving to a sound tooth on the other side; then you repeat your weaving back to the side whence you began; tighten it gently and judiciously till they do not move at all.	0.7816999
Then you return the weave to the side you started from and pull gently and skillfully so that they do not move at all, and your tightening of the wire should be at the roots of the teeth so that it does not slip, then you cut the excess ends of the wire with scissors and gather them and twist them with pliers and hide them between the sound tooth and the loose tooth.	You should tie the wire at the root of the teeth lest it slip. Then with the scissors cut off the two ends of the wire remaining over, and bring them together and twist them with forceps and hide them between a sound tooth and a loose tooth so as to not injure the tongue; then for the future leave them thus bound.	0.7714728
So that it does not hurt the tongue, then you leave it tightened like this as long as it remains. If it becomes loose or breaks, you tighten it with another wire, so they enjoy it like this for a lifetime. And this is a picture of the teeth and the form of splinting in two sound teeth and two loose teeth, as you see:.	But if it comes undone or breaks, bind them with another wire; so may he have the use of them all his life. This is a figure of the teeth and the manner of interlacing two sound and two loose teeth, as you see.	0.7591919
And a single tooth or two may be returned to its place after falling out, and it is splinted as we described, and it remains. But this is done by a skilled and delicate craftsman. And he may carve a bone from the bones of cattle and make it like a tooth and place it in the place from which the tooth has gone.	After one or two teeth have fallen out they may be restored to their place and bound in as instructed, and become permanent. This can be done only by an expert and gentle practitioner. Sometimes a piece of ox-bone may be carved and made into the shape of a tooth, and placed in the site where a tooth was lost, and fastened as we have said, and it will last and he will get long service from it.	0.8131895

On cutting the frenulum that occurs under the tongue and prevents speech.	On incising the ligament below the tongue which is an impediment to speech.	0.7755357
This frenulum that occurs under the tongue may be either natural, with which a person is born, or accidental, from a wound that has healed.	Sometimes this ligament that occurs under the tongue is natural and congenital; or it may be accidental, owing to scarring from an injury.	0.774071
The procedure for it is that you open the patient's mouth with his head in your lap and lift his tongue, then cut that sinewy frenulum transversely so that the tongue is released from its constraint. If there is some hardness and knotting in it, and that is from the healing of a wound, then insert a hook into it and incise it transversely until the frenulum is severed and the knots are loosened.	The operation for it is to open the patient's mouth, having his head in your lap, and lift his tongue; then cut that sinew-like ligament transversely till the tongue is freed from its hold. If it is hard and nodular, arising from scarring after an injury, catch it with a hook and slit it transversely until the ligament is severed and the knots undone.	0.9030889
And beware that the incision not be deep in the flesh, lest you cut an artery there and bleeding occur.

A swelling resembling a small frog may occur under the tongue, preventing the tongue from its natural function, and it may grow until it fills the mouth. The procedure for this is to open the patient's mouth facing the sun and examine the swelling.	Sometimes there occurs under the tongue a swelling resembling a small frog, which hinders the natural movements of the tongue; sometimes it grows so as even to fill the mouth. The operation for it is to open the patient's mouth in the full light of the sun and inspect the tumour.	0.8475971
If you see it dull-colored or black, hard, and the patient does not feel it, do not touch it, for it is cancer.  But if it is whitish and moist, insert a hook into it and incise it with a delicate scalpel, and free it from every side.

On the Treatment of Swelling of the Tonsils.	On the treatment of swelling of the tonsils and other swellings in the throat.	0.6359834
And what grows in the throat from all other swellings.  Swellings similar to those that appear externally, called tonsils, may appear inside the throat, if you treat them with what I mentioned in the incision and they do not heal.	Sometimes there occur in the throat buboes called 'tonsils', which resemble the buboes occurring externally. When you have employed the remedies described in their own place, without effect, examine, and if the tumour be hard, dark coloured, and devoid of sensation, do not touch it with an instrument.	0.6150025
So observe, if the swelling is hard, dark in color, and with little sensation, do not treat it with iron.  And if it is red in color and its base is thick, do not treat it with iron either, for fear of bleeding.  Rather, leave it until it ripens, then either incise it or let it burst on its own.	When you have employed the remedies described in their own place, without effect, examine, and if the tumour be hard, dark coloured, and devoid of sensation, do not touch it with an instrument. If it be of a red colour, with a thick root, do not touch this with an instrument either, for fear of a haemorrhage; but let it be till it come to a head; then you may perforate it or let it burst of its own accord.	0.7808929
And if it is white, round, and its base is thin, this is what should be cut. The procedure for it is that you observe, before operating, if its acute swelling has completely subsided or decreased somewhat.	But if it be pale coloured, round, with a slender pedicle, this is the kind that should be cut. The operation for this is first to see, before operating, whether his inflamed tumour has already completely subsided or to some extent diminished.	0.81129587
Then, sit the patient near the sun with his head in your lap. Open his mouth and have an assistant in front of you press his tongue down with an instrument like this:	Then make the patient sit down in the full light of the sun with his head in your lap; open his mouth; and have an assistant before you to press back the tongue with an instrument like this.	0.8828907
It is made of silver or copper, thin like a knife. When you have pressed down the tongue and the swelling is apparent and visible, take a hook and insert it into the tonsil, and pull it outwards as much as possible without pulling any of the membranes with it.	It should be made of bronze or silver, and slender like a knife. And when the tongue is depressed with its help, the tumour will be made manifest to you and your direct vision will fall upon it. Then take a hook and fix it in one tonsil and pull it forward as far as it will go; but be careful to not pull away with it any of the mucosa.	0.780916
Then cut it with an instrument shaped like this, resembling scissors except that its two ends are curved, with each blade facing the other, very sharp, made of Indian iron or Damascene steel:	Then cut it with an instrument of this form; it is like scissors except that its extremities are curved, the beak of each meeting the other, and very sharp. It should be made of Indian iron or Damascene steel.	0.91919976
If this instrument is not available, then cut it with a scalpel shaped like this:	If you have not this kind of instrument, cut it with a scalpel of this form, on the one side sharp, on the other quite blunt.	0.6396786
Sharp on one side and blunt on the other. After you have cut one tonsil, cut the other in the same manner.  Then, after cutting, have the patient gargle with cold water or vinegar and water.	And when one tonsil has been cut away, remove the other in exactly the same manner. Then after the excision let the patient gargle with cold water or vinegar and water.	0.8270596
If bleeding occurs, gargle with water in which pomegranate peels or myrtle leaves or similar astringents have been boiled until the bleeding stops, then treat him until he recovers.  Other swellings may grow in the throat besides the tonsils, so cut them as I mentioned regarding cutting the tonsils.	But if there occur a haemorrhage let him gargle with water in which have been boiled pomegranate peel or myrtle leaves or similar styptics till the haemorrhage is stanched; then treat till healed. Sometimes there grow in the fauces tumours other than the tonsils; remove them just as described for tonsils.	0.8898934
I treated a woman with a swelling that had grown inside her throat, extending somewhat towards the uvula, almost completely blocking the throat.  The woman was breathing through a narrow passage, and it had prevented her from eating and drinking water.	I once treated a woman for a tumour that had grown in her throat and was rather dark in colour and had little sensation. It had almost blocked the throat and the woman had only a narrow opening to breathe through, and was quite prevented from eating or drinking, so that she was at death's door, if she had so remained for a day or two.	0.76013184
She was near death, if she had remained a day or two longer. The swelling had put forth two branches that extended to her nostrils. I acted quickly, inserting a hook into one of them, and then I pulled it, extracting a good-sized piece.	From the tumour there arose two offshoots, which had eventually emerged through the nostrils. So I made the utmost haste and, fixing a hook in one of them, drew it forward, and out came a sizeable piece.	0.7029663
Then I cut it where it reached her nostril. Then I did the same with what protruded from the other nostril. Then I opened her mouth and depressed her tongue, and inserted the hook into the swelling itself, and cut some of it.  Only a little blood flowed from it.	Then I cut it off where I had hold of it near the nostril. Then I did the same with the one projecting from the other nostril. Then I opened her mouth and depressed the tongue; then fastened the hook in the tumour itself and cut off a part of it, with only a little haemorrhage; and the woman's pharynx was freed and immediately she had a drink of water, then took some food.	0.9115006
The woman's throat was opened, and she immediately began to drink water and then took some food. We continued to cut from that swelling repeatedly for a long time, and the swelling would regrow in place of what was cut, until I and she became weary of it.	And from time to time, for long after, I continued to cut away this tumour. But fresh growth continually replaced what was excised till we both grew weary of it.	0.56079876
So I resorted to cauterizing the swelling inside her throat with a cautery iron, and it stopped growing. Then I left the area and I did not know what God did with her after me.	Then I went about it astutely and cauterized the tumour high up in the throat, and it stopped growing.

On the Excision of a Uvular Swelling.	On removal of the tumour of the uvula that is called 'uva'.	0.5974128
Which is called a grape. If a discharge descends to the uvula and it swells and is white and elongated, then it is called a column. And if it is thick at the bottom and round, then it is called a grape. This is if it has been treated with what we mentioned in the section on cauterization, but the treatment has not been successful.	When a flux descends to the uvula and it swells and the uvula becomes white and elongated, then it is called 'columella*. And if it should be swollen below and rounded then it is called 'uva'. When it has been treated as mentioned in its section, and the treatment is unavailing, and you see the inflamed tumour subsiding and the uvula becoming thin, you should amputate it.	0.75825906
And I saw the hot swelling had subsided from it and it was thin, so it should be cut. But anything from it that is collected and round, and does not have length, and is blood-colored or saffron-colored or black or has no feeling, should be avoided cutting.	Now those of them that are bunched up and rounded and not elongated, full of blood, or of a dark colour or black, and without sensation, these you should avoid incising; for this course is dangerous for the patient.	0.6403407
There is danger in it for the patient.  So, if you see it with the characteristics I mentioned, of its whiteness and length, you should sit the patient beside the sun and depress his tongue with the instrument previously described. Then insert the hook into the grape.	But when you see them as I have described, somewhat pale and elongated, get the patient to sit in the sunlight and depress his tongue with the instrument described above; then take hold of the uva with a hook and draw it down and cut it off with one of the two instruments described for excision of the tonsils.	0.6781094
And pull it downwards and cut it with one of the two instruments I mentioned for cutting the tonsils. And you should not cut from it except what is in excess of the natural state, no more. Because if you cut more from it, you will damage the voice and speech.	You should not cut away more than up to the natural limit. For if you cut more off you cause injury to the voice and speech.	0.6266517
Then, after cutting, use what we described for cutting tonsils and treat it until it heals. If the patient is afraid of cutting it, then you should use a trick to cauterize it without fear or caution.  The method of cauterizing it is with a sharp medication, which is that you place the patient's head in your lap.	Then, after excising, carry on the treatment on the lines described under removal of the tonsils, and treat till healed. But if the patient flinch from operation, then you must contrive to cauterize it, fearlessly and boldly.	0.72297597
Then depress his tongue with the instrument that we mentioned. Then take some of the sharp water that I mentioned in the chapter on cauterization and mix it with quicklime, making it neither thick nor thin.  Fill the hollow of this instrument with it, and this is its picture:	The method is to employ a caustic; you put the patient's head in your lap; then, having depressed the tongue with the instrument described above, take some of the corrosive fluid mentioned in the book on cauterization, make it up with quicklime to a medium consistency, and fill with it the hollow in this instrument, whose form is thus.	0.65863127
Its end, which you put the medication in, has a hollow like the hollow of an ointment spoon. Place the instrument with the medicine on the uvula itself, with the patient lying on his side so that saliva flows from his mouth, from inside his throat, lest anything from it descend into his throat and harm him.	The end of it where you put the caustic should have a hollow like that of the spoon of a spoonprobe. With the patient lying on his side, letting the mucous secretions flow from his gullet out of his mouth so that none of the corrosive may run down his gullet and cause harm, you place the instrument right on the uvula.	0.8533826
Then hold your hand on the medication, while pressing it on the uvula for about half an hour, until you see that it has blackened and the sting of the medicine has subsided. And if you wish, you may take cotton and wrap it on the tip of a probe, and wet the cotton in the medicine.	Then, steadying the hand that is holding the medicament, press it out on to the uvula for the space of half an hour until you see the uvula turn black and the corrosive action cease. If you wish, you can take some cotton wool twisted on the end of a probe, and, having soaked it in the caustic, apply the probe with the wool, down through a cannula till the wool sticks on the uvula.	0.9132501
And insert the probe with the cotton into a tube from above until the cotton sticks to the uvula. Do this repeatedly until you achieve what you want from cauterizing the uvula. Then leave it, for it will wither and fall off after three or four days. If you need to reapply the medicine, reapply it.	Do this over and over again till you have done all the cauterization you want, then let be; for it will shrink and fall off in three or four days. If you need to repeat the treatment, do so.	0.7309282
And after the cauterization, wipe around the uvula with cotton soaked in ghee and dry the medication around it with it. Then gargle with cold water and treat it externally with poultices and internally with gargles until it heals. This type of treatment is safer than excision and further from danger.	After the cauterization, wipe all round the uvula with wool soaked in butter, and with that mop up all the caustic remaining round about it. Then let him rinse his mouth out with cold water and do you treat with external embrocations, and gargles within, till he is well. This kind of treatment is safer than incision and less to be feared.	0.8588278
The uvula may also be treated with something gentler than cauterization and excision; it is treated with fumigation in this way: Take lavender, hyssop, thyme, rue, wormwood, chamomile, artemisia, and similar herbs. Gather them all, or some of them, in a pot and immerse them in vinegar.	Sometimes uva is cured by a method milder than either incision or cautery, namely by means of vapour in the following manner: take pennyroyal and artemisia absinthium and organy and rue and wormwood and chamomile and southernwood and similar herbs and put them all, or some of them, in a pot, cover them with vinegar, and boil them.	0.78372085
And boil it, with the pot sealed with lute, and in the middle of the lid there should be a hole on which the hollow instrument is fitted in this way: it is made of silver or copper.	The pot should be luted with clay; and there is to be a hole in the middle of the lid to which is fitted a hollow instrument like this, made of silver or bronze, and the end in which is the protuberance should be put in the patient's mouth so that the vapour passes up the tube to the uvula, which becomes of a very dark colour.	0.7045398
And insert the end that has the pomegranate into the patient's mouth so that the vapor ascends to the uvula through the tube until the uvula is well fumigated. Then repeat it several times until it withers. Beware of performing this treatment at the first appearance of the swelling.	Do this repeatedly till it sloughs away.	0.4385628
For it often increases the swelling, and it should only be done when its hot swelling subsides. If you don't have this instrument, then take a reed and attach an eggshell to its end so that the patient's mouth doesn't burn.	Be careful not to apply this treatment at the first appearance of the tumour, for often you will aggravate the tumour; but you should do it at the decline of the inflammation. If you do not have this instrument, take a reed and fit an egg-shell on the end so that the patient's mouth is not burned; for the egg-shell will prevent the heat of the vapour from burning the mouth.	0.81186336

Or they can swallow a bite of dry bread, or you take a piece of soft sea sponge, tie it to a thread, and then they swallow it. When it reaches the location of the thorn, pull the string quickly. Do this several times.	Or let him swallow a piece of turnip or a heart of lettuce or a morsel of dry bread; or take a marine sponge, dry, and tie it on a thread; then let him swallow the sponge and when it reaches where the sharp body is then quickly pull on the thread.	0.7859206
Often the thorn or bone will stick to it and come out. If it does not come out with what we have mentioned, then use a lead instrument of this shape:	Do this a number of times; for often the sharp body or bone will stick to the sponge and will come out. If it does not come out by the methods described, in this case employ an instrument made of lead, thus.	0.7871242
It should be slightly thicker than a probe and have a hook at its end.  The patient inserts it gently into their throat with their head raised upward, taking care not to touch their larynx so as not to cause coughing and dislodge the bone or thorn further. Or the physician inserts it with their hand.	It should be a little thicker than a probe, with a crook at its extremity. The patient himself should introduce it into his own throat gently; he should raise the head backwards and take care not to touch the larynx lest coughing be aroused. And let him remove therewith the bone or sharp body.	0.8881638
Having the patient insert it is better, as they know the location of the embedded object. They push downward or pull upward with the instrument, as they are best able, until it comes out.	Or else let the doctor introduce it with his hand (although it is better if the patient himself introduce it, since he knows the site of the obstruction) and push it down and then draw up his hand with the instrument; all this according to the way it presents itself to him, till it is removed.	0.6821995

On the Extraction of Leeches Stuck in the Throat	On the removal of a leech sticking in the throat.	0.7568157
If you have treated the leech as we have mentioned in the section on treatment with medications, and it is ineffective, then look into the patient's throat in the sunlight, after depressing their tongue with the instrument that was described to you.	When you treat a leech by the medical means spoken of in the appropriate section, with no effect, then inspect the patient's throat in full sunlight after depressing the tongue with the instrument I have described.	0.86007607
If you see the leech, extract it with a small hook or with carefully crafted forceps. If you cannot manage it this way, then take a hollow tube and insert it into the patient's throat near the leech, then insert a fire-heated iron rod into the lumen of the tube.	If your gaze falls upon the leech, pull it out at once with a small hook or a fine pair of forceps. But if you cannot get hold of it, take a cannula and introduce it into the patient's mouth near the leech, then pass through the cannula a red-hot iron; do this repeatedly; while the patient must not drink at all that day.	0.79183
Do this several times and the patient should abstain from water for the entire day. Then he should take a vessel filled with cold water and open his mouth into it and gargle with it and not swallow a drop.  He should move the water around from time to time with his hand.	Then let him take a vessel full of cold water, open his mouth in it and rinse out with it, but let him not swallow a drop of it; and he should keep the movement of the water going by hand time after time; for the leech straightway falls off when it feels the water.	0.7104814
The leech will immediately fall off when it senses the water. If it does not come out using what we have described, then fumigate the throat with urine and asafoetida with the instrument that we described for fumigating the uvula. Do this several times and it will fall off.	If it does not come away by these means, fumigate the patient's throat with urine or with the juice of asafoetida, using the instrument described for fumigating the uvula. Do this several times, for then it will fall away.	0.72616345
The method for fumigation is as follows: take a pot containing embers heated by fire, and the pot should be covered with a lid with a hole in its center. Insert the tip of the instrument into that hole, then drop in the fumigant.  The patient places their mouth at the tip of the tube and closes their mouth so that the fumes do not escape, until it is certain that the fumes have reached the throat.	In fumigating, this is the way to set about it: take a pot containing live coals, fitted with a lid and a hole in the middle of the lid into which is fitted the end of the instrument. Then put in the aromatic; and the patient should apply his mouth to the end of the cannula, with his mouth closed to prevent the escape of the vapour, until he knows that the vapour has reached his throat; for the leech will at once come away.	0.87705857
The leech will immediately fall off. If it does not fall, then repeat the fumigation several times. The patient should endure thirst, eat salty foods and garlic, and not drink water. It must come out with this treatment. This is an image of the instrument with which you extract the leech from the throat if you see it.	But if it does not come away, let the inhalation be repeated many times. Let the patient endure his thirst, and eat salty food and garlic and drink no water. It will inevitably be removed by this treatment. This is the figure of an instrument for extracting the leech from the throat when visible.	0.85143113
It resembles hooks as you see, except that it has this curvature which enters the throat and its ends resemble the beak of a bird.  It has the roughness of a file, so when it grasps something it does not let go.	It resembles forceps, as you see, except that it has this bend for entry into the throat; and the two extremities are shaped like a bird's bill, with the roughness of a file. When they have hold of a thing they do not let go.	0.86628735
Another instrument presses down on the tongue. It is a wide ring of iron, large enough to fit in the mouth over the tongue. It is introduced into the mouth standing on its side, keeping the mouth open without the patient's volition. They are absolutely unable to remove it until you take it away.	And another instrument with which to depress the tongue. It is a wide ring of iron, of such a size as to go into the mouth above the tongue. It is inserted into the mouth standing on its side, and the mouth stays open without the patient's volition; nor can he dislodge it at all until you turn it.	0.9160538

On cauterizing and incising tumors.	A general dissertation on the perforation and incision of tumours.	0.68454397
Tumors have many diverse types, as will be mentioned one by one in this book.  They differ in their cauterization and incision in two ways.  One is the type of tumor itself and the humors it contains.	The kinds of tumour are many and various, as will be mentioned in order in this book. They differ in the way they are to be perforated or incised, according to two criteria. One is the kind of tumour it is in itself and the humidities it contains.	0.89261097
The second type stems from the locations they arise in the body, because a tumor occurring on the head is different from a tumor occurring on the buttock, and a tumor occurring in a fleshy place is different from a tumor occurring in a joint; the treatment for each of them differs.	The other is the part of the body where it occurs. For the tumour occurring in the head is different from the tumour occurring on the posterior, and a tumour occurring in a fleshy part differs from one on the joints; each having its separate category of operation.	0.83757865
Some tumors should not be cauterized until the pus in them has matured and is complete, and some should be cauterized while they are fresh and have not fully matured, such as tumors that are close to the joints.	There are some tumours that should not be opened till after the pus in them is matured and ripe. But others should be opened when still raw and immature, such as a tumour near the joints.	0.85108674
Because if a tumor occurs near a joint and remains there for a long time until it putrefies what is around it, it may damage the ligaments or nerves of that joint, causing a chronic illness of that limb, or the tumor may be near a principal organ.	For when a tumour occurring near a joint lasts long enough to putrefy its surroundings, it often breaks down the ligaments or the tendons of the joint and causes paralysis in the limb. Or if the tumour be near a major organ, if you delay the opening of it until it ripens you will damage that major organ.	0.89698434
For if you delay its cauterization until it matures, you will harm that principal organ, or it may be near the anus, so you cauterize it fresh. The reason it is necessary to cauterize the immature tumor that is near the anus is so that the abscess does not putrefy and penetrate into the anus, becoming a fistula.	In the same way, if it be near the anus you must open it, although unripe for opening. The reason why you must open an abscess near the anus while still unripe, before it is brought to a head, is to prevent it from putrefying the cleft and penetrating to the inner part of the anus and becoming a fistula, and incurable.	0.74015194
And it becomes incurable. You should know the time to cauterize tumors that have fully matured, which is when the pain of the tumor subsides, the fever goes away, the redness and throbbing decrease, the head of the tumor softens, and all the other signs.	It is necessary too to know the time to open fully mature swellings: it is when the pain of the swelling is lessened, the fever departs, the redness and the throbbing are reduced, and the head of the abscess becomes wrinkled, with other signs.	0.7653082
The cautery should be applied at the lowest point of the tumor, if possible, so that it is easier for the discharge to flow downwards, or at the thinnest and most protruding point of the tumor.  The cautery should be applied lengthwise along the body if the tumors are on the hands or feet.	The perforation should be made in the lower part of the swelling if possible, so that the pus may more easily drain downwards; or else in the thinnest and most swollen part of the swelling.	0.7740883
And the locations of the muscles, tendons, nerves, and arteries, and in general, in all flat areas that have no curvature. As for those that bend, the cautery should be applied according to the location. But if the tumor is in fleshy areas, it is best to leave it uncauterized.	Your incision should be longitudinal if the swellings are in such places as hands or feet or in the site of joints, tendons, nerves, or arteries; and, in short, in all flat places where there is no curvature. In curved places let the perforation proceed according to the place.	0.70020974
Until its maturation is complete, as we have said. For if you cauterize it before that, the pus will flow from it for a long time, and it will be very harmful and messy, and perhaps its lips and depths will harden. Some tumors may be cauterized across the body when necessary or depending on the need of the limb.	But when the swelling is in the fleshy parts it is best to leave the perforation, as we have said, until it is fully matured. For if you perforate it prematurely the sanious discharge will go on longer and will be excessively foul; and often both the edges and the depths of the opening will become indurated. Some swellings are perforated latitudinally if necessary, or having regard to the requirement of the part.	0.76394784
A single cautery should be used for small tumors, and a wide cautery or many incisions for large tumors, depending on the size of the tumor. Some tumors may need to have the skin scraped and cut if it has become like a rag.	In small swellings you should use a single perforation; while in large ones you should use wide or multiple perforations according to the size of the swelling. There are also some swellings that need a circular incision of the skin, and should be cut when they have become like a rag, and necrosed —which actually happens often in abscesses and sinuses.	0.80820817
And it reaches a point where it has died, such as what happens in many boils and abscesses. Some are incised with a triangular incision, and some are cut in the shape of a myrtle leaf, like inguinal tumors.	And there are some that should be incised triangularly; and others with an incision of myrtle-leaf form; e.g. a tumour on the groin.	0.70921284
Some use a circular incision, a crescent-shaped incision, and similar incisions. If it does not have a head, such as smooth, flat tumors, it should only be cauterized simply. If the tumor is large and has accumulated for a long time, and you cauterize it, do not rush to remove all the pus at that time.	a tumour on the groin. There are others again to which should be applied circular and lunate and similar incisions. Those that have no head, such as the smooth and flat ones, should be incised with only a simple perforation.	0.68955505
Rather, remove some of it, then dress the tumor until the next day, then remove some of the pus again. Do this repeatedly, gradually, until you remove it all.	When a swelling is large and has collected a large quantity of pus, and you perforate it, do not be in a hurry to get it all out at once; but get some of it out and then bandage it till another day; then again remove part of the pus; and so do, again and again, gradually, till it is all got out.	0.6913935
Especially if the patient is weak, a pregnant woman, a small child, or an elderly person, as the vital spirit often dissolves with the sudden exit of pus, so the patient may die without you realizing it. So beware of this matter with great caution.	This particularly applies if the patient be in a weak state, or a pregnant woman, or a baby, or a decrepit old man; for the animal spirit is very often dissolved with the sudden evacuation of the pus, and the patient dies unexpectedly. Be very careful therefore, with this sort.	0.8762888
After you cauterize these tumors, you should wipe the wound and examine it. If the wound of the tumor is small or the incision is single and simple, use linen or worn-out cotton wicks. If the tumor is large and the cautery incisions are numerous...	Then, after you have opened the tumour, you should cleanse the wound and consider: if the tumour has only a small opening, or it is one simple incision, employ swabs of lint or cotton wool; but if it is a large tumour with multiple incisions, introduce a swab into each incision so that they meet.	0.8504007
you should insert a wick into each incision so that they reach each other. If part of the skin of the tumor has been cut or scraped, you should pack it with worn-out cotton or linen lint without moisture and bandage it until the third day.	And if the tumour was such that you cut away a part of the skin, or sliced the tumour, you will need to pack it with cotton wool or plucked linen, dry; and bandage until the third day.	0.8238187
Then remove it and treat it with the appropriate ointments until it heals. If bleeding occurs during your work, use cold water and vinegar after soaking a linen cloth in them and applying it to the bleeding site repeatedly.	Then remove it and treat with the needful ointments until healed. If a haemorrhage occurs while you are operating, use cold water and vinegar, soaking a lint rag in both and frequently applying it to the place.	0.89838946
If the bleeding continues, you should use the procedures, treatments, and powders that we have described in many places in this book and in the section. If it is winter and the site of the tumor has many nerves, you should moisten the bandages with syrup and hot oil.	And if the bleeding still persists then it is necessary to employ the method and the treatment and the powders that we have prescribed in many parts of this book and in their own sections. Now if this should be in winter and the site of the tumour abound in nerves, you should have some pads soaked in hot wine and oil and then apply to the place.	0.8790119
and place them on the site. If it is summer and the areas are fleshy, you should apply bandages soaked in water and oil or syrup and oil, all cold, until the third day, as we have said. Then you should unbind the tumor and wipe it.	But if it be in summer and the parts be fleshy, apply the pads soaked in water and oil, or wine and oil, all being cold, till the third day, as we have said. Then unbandage the tumour and wipe it and give it the treatment suitable to it, until cured.	0.83805466
Use similar treatments until it heals. This is what you need to know about the treatment of tumors in general. As for the detailed method, I have mentioned each tumor and how to treat it, categorized and summarized.	This is the information you need about the treatment of tumours in general. As for the particulars, I now review the way to treat each tumour, by chapters, in detail.	0.7887551

On incising tumors that occur on the scalp.	On opening superficial tumours of the scalp.	0.75910866
Small tumors appear on the scalp, and they are of the types of sals. Membranes surround them, which are their envelopes, like the crop of a chicken. And their types are many, some of them are fatty, and some of them contain moisture resembling mud.	Small swellings form in the scalp, which are of the various kinds of cyst, contained within membranes which form a capsule to them like the crop of a chicken. There are many kinds of these.	0.8010664
And some of them contain moisture resembling pus and broth, and so on. And some of them are hardened and solid. All of them have no danger in incising and removing them, unless you encounter an artery during the incision.	There are fatty ones, there are those containing a liquid resembling black slime, there are those containing a liquid resembling porridge and gruel and the like, while others are stony hard. It is not dangerous to open and extract any of them, so long as you do not encounter an artery in excising them.	0.78462565
The procedure for incising them is to first probe them with the instrument whose image comes after this, which is called the probe, until you know what they contain. If what they contain is moisture, then incise them lengthwise with a simple incision like this image:.	The operation for incising them begins by exploring them with the instrument called an explorer, figured lower down, so as to get to know what sort of contents they have. If they are the sort that contain fluid, incise them with a simple longitudinal incision, thus.	0.80635685
And begin the incision from line B to line C. When the moisture is emptied, peel the sac that contained that moisture and cut it all out, leaving nothing of it at all, for it often returns if anything of it remains.	Begin your incision at the letter b, to letter g; and when the humidity is emptied dissect away the capsule containing it, whole, not leaving the least remnant. For often it comes back if any has been left behind.	0.8379922
Then dip cotton in the Egyptian ointment if it is available, and if not, in salt water, and fill the wound with it, and leave it until the next day, as it will eat away what remains of the sac. Then repeat the application of the cotton with the Egyptian ointment a second and third time if necessary.	Then dip some cotton wool in Egyptian ointment if you have some; if not, in saline; and pack it in the wound and leave till next day, for that will destroy the remains of the capsule. Then repeat the cotton wool with Egyptian ointment a second time, or a third if need be, till it is certain there is nothing of the cyst left.	0.8976582
Until you are certain that nothing of the sac remains. Then treat the wound with ointments until it heals. And if the swelling contains a fatty substance, incise it in this way:.	Then treat the wound with ointments until healed.	0.4859985
A cruciform incision, and place hooks in the lips of the wound and peel it from every side, and strive to remove the membrane that contains it.  If an artery obstructs you, do what I described to you later. And do the same with the swelling if it is hardened, as regards the incision.	If the tumour contains a fatty cyst, incise thus, a cruciform incision; then hook up the edges of the incision, dissect away every direction, and strive to extract the containing capsule. If you should come across an artery, deal with it in the manner already described.	0.78472364
And the treatment is the same as I mentioned.  The incision on the hardened swelling is easier because it has little blood and moisture. Some of these swellings that are on the head in some people may have no moisture at all, for I have incised a swelling on.	Carry out the same manner of incision and treatment for a stony tumour, just as I have described. It is easier to open a hard tumour, for it has little blood and humidity; and sometimes these tumours on some people's heads have no humidity at all.	0.7990935
the head of an old woman and I found the swelling like hard, rough, white stone. No one could break it, and if someone threw it, it would cause injury.  And what is other than this of the various swellings occurring on the head, such as the swellings that appear on the heads of children.	I myself cut down upon a tumour in the head of an elderly woman and I found the tumour as hard as a stone, rough and white, which it was impossible to break, and which if thrown at anyone would have injured him. For all tumours arising in the head other than these, such as those which occur in children's heads and those at the root of the ear, make a simple incision.	0.82692325
And at the bases of the ears, incise them all with a simple incision and make their lower part lower so that the flow of matter to the bottom is facilitated, then treat them with the appropriate treatment.	You should always begin your incision from below to allow an easy downward flow for the pus. Then treat with suitable after-treatment.	0.60385025

On Incising Scrofulous Swellings that Appear on the Neck. These swellings frequently occur on the neck, under the armpits, and in the groins. They may occur on the rest of the body. Those that appear on the neck may be single or multiple, and some of them arise from others.	On the incision of scrofulous glands in the neck. Tumours of this kind often occur in the neck and in the axilla and in the groin; and sometimes in other parts of the body.	0.81228256
Each scrofulous swelling has its own membrane, as is the case with lipomas and head swellings, as we have described.  The types of these scrofulous swellings are numerous: some are hardened, some contain fluids, and some are malignant and do not respond to treatment.	Those occurring in the neck are sometimes single and sometimes multiple, one arising from another; and each scrofula is contained in a capsule of its own, like the cysts and tumours of the head that we have described. There are many kinds of these glands; some are stony, some contain humidities, some are malignant and do not respond to treatment.	0.78190744
If you find one that feels healthy to the touch, and its appearance is close to the color of the skin, and it moves in every direction, and is not attached to a neck nerve, vein, or artery, and it is not deep. Then you should incise it simply from top to bottom of the swelling in this manner from line C to line B.	But those that you find by touch to be benign and are of a colour not greatly differing from the skin, freely movable in any direction, not adherent to the nerves of the neck nor to a jugular vein, nor to an artery, and are not deep-lying; these should be incised with a simple incision from above downwards, from line g to line b	0.7824913
And dissect it from all sides and retract the edges of the skin with a hook or two hooks, or with many hooks if needed, as we have said regarding head swellings, and remove it little by little, and be careful not to cut a vein or nerve, and let the scalpel not be too sharp.	and dissect away all round and draw the edges of the skin apart with one or two hooks or with several if necessary, as we said on the subject of tumours of the head, and draw them out very slowly. Be most careful not to cut a blood-vessel or nerve.	0.8840383
So that your hand does not cut more than intended or the patient moves causing you to cut what you do not need to cut.  If you cut a vein or artery and it hinders your work, put powdered vitriol or some of the styptics that stop bleeding in the wound.	The scalpel should not be over sharp lest you make the incision too big, or the patient flinches and so you cut open that which does not need cutting. If you cut a vein or artery and be thus hindered in your operating, apply powdered vitriol or some styptic powder to the wound, and bandage the wound and let be till the worst of the swelling has subsided and the opening is relaxed and threatens to turn purulent; for then the bleeding will stop.	0.80872047
And tighten the wound and leave it until the intensity of the swelling subsides and the wound relaxes and begins to suppurate, for the bleeding will stop then. Then return to your work until you are finished, then check with your index finger if any other small swellings remain, and cut them out and clean them.	Then return to your operation and finish it. Then feel with your forefinger to see if there are any small glands left, in which case dissect and clean them away.	0.68980837
If there is a large vein at the base of the swelling, then you should not cut that swelling from its base, but you should tie it with a strong double thread and leave it until it falls off by itself without harm. Then pack the wound with used cotton that has been dipped in Egyptian ointment, and then treat it.	If there is a large blood-vessel at the root of the gland, then you should not cut that gland at its root but should ligature it with a strong double ligature and leave it till it sloughs away of its own accord without harm. Then pack the wound with cotton wool previously soaked in Egyptian ointment; then continue dressing.	0.91444314
And if you cut the entire swelling, then you should bring the edges of the wound together and sew it immediately after you know that no remnants of the swelling remain. If you see that remnants of the swelling's base remain.	If you excise the whole gland, you should at once draw together the two edges of the wound and suture them, when you are absolutely certain there is nothing of it left.	0.7149055
Then you should aim to cut to its base and root and use stitching and what we have mentioned.  As for swellings containing fluids, lance them gently and superficially where they appear ripe to you and make the lancet from the lower part as we said.	But if you see that, on account of the size of the scrofula, there is still some superfluity left behind, you should carry the incision to the root and base of it, and employ suturing and the rest of the remedies mentioned. The glands that contain humidities you should open with a single perforation where they seem to have matured; make your perforation from below, as we have said.	0.70824873
Then, after lancing, use a wick with Egyptian ointment or similar to consume what remains of the corruption, until you see that the wound has become clean, then treat it with ointments that promote flesh growth until it heals.	Then after opening use swabs soaked in Egyptian and similar ointments to do away with the unhealthy remains, till you see that the wound is clean; then dress with nourishing ointments until healed.	0.83516765

On incising the larynx for a swelling occurring inside the throat.	On incising the larynx for a tumour arising in the throat.	0.87505966
The ancients mentioned this incision in the larynx, but I have not seen anyone in our country perform it, and this is the gist of their words. As for those with diphtheria, they should avoid incising the larynx, as they will not benefit from it.	The Ancients mentioned this laryngeal incision, but I have not seen anyone in our parts who has done it. Now here is the gist of what they say. Incision should be avoided in those suffering from quinsy, for they will not benefit from it, since all the passages and the lung will be diseased.	0.84637535
Because the tonsils and lungs will be diseased.  As for those with a hot swelling in the mouth, throat, or tonsils, if there is no ailment in the trachea, then incising the larynx is necessary to escape the harm that results from choking.	But in those with an abscess in the mouth, throat, or tonsils, and when there is no disease in the windpipe itself, you must employ laryngotomy to avoid the mischief of suffocation.	0.7118871
It is necessary, if we wish to do this, to incise the larynx below three or four rings of the trachea, with a small transverse incision between two rings, as much as the incision is in the membrane, not in the cartilage.  And this place is suitable for the incision.	Now when we wish to undertake this we should incise the larynx under the third or fourth ring of the windpipe with a small incision transversely between two rings, so that the incision may be through the membrane, not the cartilage. This spot is suitable for incision, for it is deficient in flesh, and there are no blood-vessels near.	0.88982135
Because it is without flesh, and the blood vessels are far from it. If the practitioner is timid, it is necessary to stretch the skin of the throat with a hook, then incise the skin until, when he reaches the trachea, he avoids the blood vessels if he sees any of them.	If the practitioner be nervous, he must stretch the skin of the throat with a hook, then cut down through the skin till he reach the windpipe, and avoid blood-vessels if he see any.	0.74893856
Then he incises the membrane that we described. And the incision of the trachea is indicated by the phlegm that comes out of it with what is pierced and by the cessation of the voice. Leave the wound open for a time.  When the time in which choking was feared has passed, bring together the edges of the skin wound.	Then let him incise the membrane which we have spoken of. You can be certain of having opened the trachea by the emission of phlegm when it is pierced, and by the loss of voice. Then leave the wound open for some while.	0.80642074
And stitch it alone without the cartilage, then use the medications that promote flesh growth until it heals.  The author of this book said: The explanation of all of these words that we have related is only if they see that the patient's throat has been blocked by one of these swellings that they mentioned.	When the danger of suffocation is passed, bring the two lips of the wound together by the skin, which alone must be sutured, without the cartilage. Then use medicaments stimulating granulation till healed. The author of this book says, the interpretation of this account that we have given is this: when they see that one of the tumours that they mention has obstructed the patient's throat and he is approaching death and is anxious himself to be incised, they resort to laryngotomy so that the patient may breathe somewhat through the wound and his life be saved.	0.6916715
And when the patient is near death and his breathing is about to cease, they proceed to incise the larynx so that the patient can breathe somewhat at the site of the wound and be saved from death.  And they are instructed to leave the wound open until the crisis of the illness has passed, and its crisis is three days or so.	They bid leaving the wound open till the worst of the disease abates; its height will last about three days; then they bid sew up the wound and dress till healed.	0.6299726
Then they are instructed to suture the wound and treat it until it heals. And what I myself witnessed was a servant girl who took a knife and threw it at her throat, cutting part of her trachea with it. I was called to treat her and found her gasping like a slaughtered animal. So I uncovered the wound.	My own experience was this: a slave-girl seized a knife and buried it in her throat and cut part of the trachea; and I was called to attend her. I found her bellowing like a sacrifice that has had its throat cut.	0.7479683
And I found the blood that came out of the wound to be slight, so I knew that she had not cut a vein or artery, and air was coming out of the wound.  So I quickly stitched the wound and treated it until it healed.  And nothing happened to the servant except for some hoarseness in the voice, nothing more.	So I laid the wound bare and found that only a little haemorrhage had come from it; and I assured myself that neither the jugular vein nor an artery had been cut, but air passed out through the wound. So I hurriedly sutured the wound and dressed it until healed. And no ill befell the maid except for a hoarseness in the voice, but nothing more; and after some days she was restored to the best of health.	0.8863336
And after a few days she returned to her best condition.  Therefore, we say that there is no danger in incising the larynx.	Hence we may say that laryngotomy is not dangerous.	0.45761997

On the incision over the swelling that appears in the larynx from the outside and is called elephant of the larynx.	On cutting down upon the tumour which occurs on the outside of the throat, and is called 'Elephant of the throat'.	0.77844685
This swelling, which is called elephant of the larynx, is a large swelling, the color of the body, and it is common in women, and it is of two types.	This tumour which is called 'Elephant of the throat' is a large tumour of the colour of the body; it commonly occurs in women.	0.71202064
Either it is natural or it is acquired. As for the natural, there is no remedy for it. As for the acquired, it is of two types, one of which is similar to fatty tumors, and the other type is similar to the swelling that results from a thickening of the artery, and there is danger in incising it. So you should not approach it with the iron at all, except for what is small, if you examine and inspect it with the probe and find it similar to the fatty tumor, and it is not connected to any of the veins, then incise it as you incise on tumors. And extract it with what contains it of the sac if it is in a sac, and if not, then excise all of it, then treat the area with the appropriate treatment.	It is of two kinds, congenital and acquired. As to the congenital, there is no treatment for it. The acquired is of two kinds: one resembles a sebaceous cyst, the other resembles the tumour arising from an arterial aneurysm, and it is dangerous to incise it, so on no account must you apply a knife to the latter kind, except any that are small; if you try and explore them with a probe and you find they are like sebaceous cysts and not adherent to any blood-vessel, then immediately cut down upon them as you would a cyst and remove them with whatever capsule may surround them, if they are contained within a capsule; and if not, dissect away the whole accurately; then treat the place with suitable remedies.	0.8787522

Chapter Forty-Five.	CHAPTER FORTY-FIVE.	0.85588497
On Incising the Types of Tumors.	On incision for various kinds of cyst.	0.6250933
Tumors have many types, and I have mentioned all of their types in the classification, and it is necessary for us to describe here the difference between the tumor and the abscess, as it is problematic.  So I say that the abscess comes with heat and fever and terrible pains until the boiling of the excess subsides.	There are various kinds of cyst. We have already mentioned all their varieties in the proper place. But we need here to set forth the difference between a cyst and an abscess, for it is complicated.	0.74371755
And the putrefaction is completed, at which time the fever and the sharpness subside.  And the tumor does not come with heat nor fever nor pains, and a peritoneal sac contains it, which is its specific container, and it is the color of the body, and its beginning is like a chickpea, and it becomes like a duck egg, and larger and smaller.	The abscess will be accompanied by heat and fever and fearsome pain, until the boiling-up of the superfluous matter settles down and the suppurating process is completed: then will the fever and intensity subside. But with a cyst there is neither heat nor fever nor pains, and a membranous capsule encloses it, its own particular covering.	0.7570636
And it is of two types: either fatty, or it contains moisture, and the colors of the moisture are many, as I mentioned in the classification. So it is necessary, when you proceed to the treatment of the tumor, that you probe it and examine it first with the instrument that is called the probe, as its image will come in the chapter after this.	The cyst is flesh-coloured, and it begins like a pea and becomes like a melon, more or less; and is of two kinds: either fatty or containing humidity; and the colours of the humidities are several, as we mentioned in the appropriate section. When you come to treat the cyst, you should first sound it and examine it with the instrument called the explorer, which is figured in the next chapter.	0.769066
as large as the tumor, then remove the probe and look at what comes out after it. If flowing moisture comes out, whatever color it is, then incise it with a simple incision, as I have mentioned in the other tumors. But if moisture does not come out after the probe, then know that it is fatty.	Then remove the explorer and see what comes out after it. If a humidity should flow, whatever the colour, make a simple incision, as I said for the other tumours. But if no humidity come out along the track of the explorer you know at once that it is fatty.	0.87743586
So make a cruciform incision on it in this way, as I have shown you, and suspend it with hooks, and gently peel the skin from every side, and preserve the sac, if you are able to do so, to remove it whole with the tumor.	Therefore make a cruciform incision upon it in this shape, as I have told you, and attach hooks and dissect away the skin gently from all sides. Be careful with the capsule; if you can, get it out whole, together with the cyst.	0.89756036
If the sac is ruptured during the operation and you cannot remove it whole, then this often happens, so remove it piece by piece until nothing remains of it, for if anything remains of it, little or much, the tumor will return, most commonly.	But if the capsule is torn in the course of the operation, and you cannot get it out whole, which frequently happens, remove it bit by bit until there is none of it left. For if a part of it is left behind, either great or small, the cyst will generally return.	0.8607544
If it overcomes you and a little of it remains, then cauterize the wound when you are finished with some of the sharp, corrosive powders and tighten the wound and put on top of it what soothes the hot swelling and treat it with all other treatments until it heals. If the tumor is large, then suture its lips and treat it with what causes it to heal.	If it defeats you and some little piece of it remain, pack the wound, when you have done all you can, with some caustic powder and bandage it and put on it something to ease the inflamed tumour, and treat in the usual way until healed. If the tumour be large, sew the edges of the incision together and treat with stimulants.	0.8715285
If you encounter a pulsating or non-pulsating vessel and bleeding occurs, then quickly cauterize the area with ground vitriol and leave it bandaged for two or three days until the wound putrefies and the boiling of the blood subsides, then return to cutting what remains of the tumor.	If you should come across a blood-vessel, pulsating or not, and there be haemorrhage, hasten to pack it with pounded vitriol; and leave bandaged for two or three days until the wound becomes purulent and the boiling-up of the blood is allayed; then resume cutting open the rest of the cyst.	0.88452804

Probes can also be made of black lead, and they are suitable for probing fistulas that have a curvature in their depth, so that they bend with their flexibility with that curvature.  They are also of three types, because some of them are long, some are medium, and some are short.	Sometimes probes are made of black lead, for investigating fistulas whose deeper course is devious; so that by reason of their softness they can adapt themselves to the curves.

The cutting edges should be sharp, and the other ends blunt. The reason for making them like this is so that they can be utilized in dissecting away cysts where there is a fear of cutting a vein or nerve, and also that the patient may console himself thereby and find some small relief from the pain involved in the dissection of a tumour.	0.8661897

However, they are not used to stop bleeding in every part of the body, but rather they are used on fleshy areas such as the muscles of the leg and thigh, the muscles of the arm, the breast, the abdomen, the groin, and similar fleshy, moist organs.	But they are not to be used for suppressing haemorrhage in all parts of the body, but only in the fleshy parts such as the calf and thigh muscles, the arm muscles, the breasts, belly, and groin, and other similar fleshy soft parts.	0.93021804

Then dissect away all the fatty tissue and pack the wound with a cicatrizing compound and sew the lips together and dress until healed.	0.6442846
It is necessary to make two incisions on its upper sides resembling crescent shapes, each one joining the other at their ends, so that the larger line encircles the smaller one in this way: From line B to line C.  Then excise the skin between the two incisions and remove the fat, and employ what we have mentioned regarding suturing, bandaging and the necessary treatment until it heals.	But if the breast is pendulous and flabby on account of its size, as happens with women, you should make two semicircular incisions on the upper side, the ends joining one another, in such wise that the longer incision encircles the other like this, from b to g. Then dissect away the skin between the two incisions and remove the fat and sew up as we have described; and apply styptic powder and the necessary dressings until healed.	0.73689276
If you cannot excise all that you need to excise because of the patient's restlessness or due to bleeding, then you should pack the wound with cotton soaked in the corrosive ointment and leave it until it corrodes what remains of the fat, then treat it until it heals.

On the incision of the tumor that occurs because of an artery or vein, and is called aneurysm.	On opening a tumour arising from a bloodvessel, called an aneurysm.	0.80062425
If the artery is wounded and the skin above it heals, a swelling often arises from that. Likewise, a swelling and tumor can also arise in a vein.	When an artery is injured and the overlying skin scars, a tumour very often arises from this; the same thing happens to a vein: a swelling and a tumour.	0.86517876
The signs by which one knows whether the swelling and distension are from an artery or a vein are these: if the swelling is from an artery, it will be oblong, concentrated in the depth of the body, and if you press the swelling with your finger, you will feel a sort of creaking.	And these are the signs by which you may diagnose whether the swelling and tumour arise from an artery or a vein: if it be from an artery the tumour will be a deep and elongated mass; and when you press upon it with your finger there will be a feeling of pulsation.	0.8730241
If it is from a vein, the swelling will be round, on the surface of the body.  Incising these swellings is dangerous, especially those in the armpit, groin, and neck, and in many places of the body.  And they are extremely large, so you should avoid treating them with iron.	But if it arises from a vein the swelling will be circular and superficial. It is dangerous to make an incision on tumours of this kind, specially in the axilla, the groin, the neck, and in many other parts of the body; it is indeed highly dangerous, so in these you must avoid treatment by the knife; also in those in the limbs and in the head it must be avoided.	0.84926975
And likewise avoid those that are in the extremities or in the head. As for the kind that results from the bulging of the mouth of an artery, make a lengthwise incision in the skin over it, then open the incision with hooks, then dissect the artery and free it from the membranes.	But any such that arises from the inflation of the mouth of an artery, you may cut down in the skin over that with a longitudinal incision; then open up your incision with hooks and dissect away the artery, freeing it from the tissues till it is laid bare.	0.7704513
Until it is exposed, then insert a needle under it and pass it through to the other side, and tie the artery with a double thread in two places as I showed you in the suturing of the two arteries in the temples, then puncture with a scalpel the area between the two ligatures until all the blood in it comes out.	Then run a needle beneath the artery to reach the other side, and tie the artery in two places with a double thread, as I showed you for the extraction of the temporal arteries. Then with the scalpel prick the part between the two ligatures to let out all the blood and get the tumour down.	0.82156706
And the swelling will subside, then employ the treatment that generates pus until the ligatures fall off, then treat it with suitable ointments until it heals.	Then apply dressings to excite suppuration until the ligatures fall away; then dress with suitable ointments until healed.	0.8096341
If the swelling is from an incision of a vein, you should grasp with your hand as much of the swelling with the skin as possible, then insert a needle below the place where you grasped with your hand and pass it through, with a double thread in it, until you bring it out the other side.	If the swelling be due to a vein that has been penetrated, you should gather up with your hand as much of the tumour as you can, together with the skin; then pass a needle beneath the place which you have grasped in your hand and run it through, threaded with a double thread, until it emerges at the other side; then with it tie a strong ligature round the swelling as I mentioned to you on ligaturing the swollen uvula, from either side, with the ends of the thread.	0.8915483
Then tie the swelling well with it, as I mentioned to you regarding tying the uvula from both sides with the ends of the thread. If you fear the threads will slip, insert another needle with another thread under the entire swelling at the intersection of the first needle.	If you fear that the threads may come loose, pass a second needle and thread beneath the whole tumour to intersect with the passage of the first needle; and tie your threads in four places.	0.7339355

Just as swelling occurs in the artery and vein, swelling also occurs in the nerve if it receives a blow or results from excessive fatigue or the like and this is most common in the wrists and heels.	As a tumour arises on an artery or a vein, so may it also come in a tendon when it has been bruised; or it may arise from excessive fatigue, or such causes. This occurs mostly at the wrists, at the heel, and at all sites of articular movement.	0.8143963
And in every place where the joints move, it is a protruding swelling, similar in color to the rest of the body, and in most cases without pain, and if pressed hard, the patient feels a kind of numbness, and the swelling is not deep in the body.	This occurs mostly at the wrists, at the heel, and at all sites of articular movement. It is a hard tumour of the same colour as the rest of the body, and is generally painless, and when strong pressure is put upon it the patient has a numb feeling in it.	0.7166527
Rather it is under the skin, and it moves in every direction, and it does not go forward or backward. So whatever of it is in the joints, it should not be exposed to iron, for it may cause chronicity, and whatever of it is in the head or in the forehead...	It is a tumour that does not form in the deeper tissues but is subcutaneous. It is freely movable laterally, but will not go forward or backward. Those that are situated on joints should certainly not be tackled with the knife, for that often causes palsy.	0.68164945

On the excision of warts that appear on the abdomen.	On the amputation of warts occurring on the belly.	0.8927659
Often, many people have warts on their abdomens and on other parts of their bodies. These warts are called "fungating" because they resemble mushrooms: their stalks are thin and their heads thick, and their lips are transformed. Some of them are small, and some become very large.	Some people often get warts on the belly and on the rest of the body, called fungous warts, because of their resemblance to fungi. They have a slender pedicle and a broad head, the edges of which are sometimes inverted ; and some are small, whereas others of them grow very big.	0.79504013
I have seen a man with two warts on his abdomen that were very similar to mushrooms, no difference, white with thin stalks and transformed, cracked lips, from which moisture constantly seeped. I excised them, and the weight of one was about eighteen ounces, and the other about six ounces.	I myself once saw a man who had two warts on his belly that looked more like fungi than anything else; they were white and had thin pedicles. Their edges were inverted and had split open, and a humour flowed continually from them. I amputated them both and weighed them: one came to about eighteen ounces, and the other six ounces.	0.87152636
The procedure for excising them is as follows: observe; if the patient has a moist humor, and if the wart is white, moist, and thin-stalked, then excise it with a wide scalpel. Have cauteries ready in the fire, because often much blood gushes out when they are excised.	This is the operation for amputating them: examine the patient carefully, and if he be of a humid temperament and the colour of the warts be white, and if they are soft, with a thin stalk, amputate them with a broad scalpel. But you should also have at hand cauteries in a fire; for often in amputating them there is much haemorrhage.	0.8622497
Therefore, be prepared, and if the bleeding overwhelms you, cauterize it.  If you see that the patient is cowardly and frightened of being cut with iron, then take a strong lead thread and tightly tie it around the wart that has these characteristics. Leave it for two days, then tighten the lead thread further, and continue tightening the lead thread.	So, if the bleeding be a hindrance to you, be quick and cauterize them. On the other hand if you see that the patient is frightened and dreads the cutting of them with the scalpel, take a wire of stout lead, and ligature this type of wart and leave for two days.	0.84715164
Do this every time it affects the wart until it is severed and falls off by itself without trouble. If the wart has a thick stalk, there is some danger and risk in excising it, especially those on the abdomen. However, it may be possible to excise half of it or part of it.	Then increase the stricture by the lead wire and go on doing this as it sinks into the wart, until the wart is cut through and spontaneously falls away with no trouble. But if the warts have stout pedicles there is some risk and fear in the cutting of them, especially those that occur on the belly. Sometimes, however, you can cut away the half, or some part, and then cauterize to prevent recurrence.	0.79553205
Then cauterize it so that it does not return, then treat it until the wound heals. Beware of attempting to excise a wart that is dark in color, minimally sensitive, and has an unpleasant appearance, for it is a cancerous tumor, and we will discuss cancer after this.	Then dress until the wound is healed. But beware of trying to cut away growths that are dark in colour, with little sensation and hideous in appearance, for they are cancerous tumours. I shall soon be mentioning cancer.	0.79105407

On the Treatment of Umbilical Protrusions.	On the treatment of protruding navel.	0.72059584
Umbilical protrusions occur from many causes: either from a rupture of the peritoneum that covers the abdomen, from which omentum or intestine protrudes, as occurs in all hernias; or from blood emitted from a vein or artery, as has been explained; or from wind that collects in it.	The navel becomes prominent from many causes; either from a rupture of the peritoneum over the abdomen, so that omentum or intestine comes through it as in other ruptures; or from blood extravasation from an artery or vein, as we have mentioned; or else from wind trapped in it.	0.89468837
If it is due to a rupture of the peritoneum and protrusion of the omentum, the color of the swelling will be similar to the color of the body, and it will be soft without pain, and its position will appear varied. If it is due to protrusion of the intestine, its position will be, in addition to what we have described, more varied. If you press it with your fingers, it disappears and then returns, and perhaps there will be gurgling with it, and it greatly enlarges upon entering the bath and with strenuous exertion. If it is due to moisture, then it will be soft.	If it be due to ruptured peritoneum and protruding omentum, the colour of the tumour will be the same as the rest of the body; it will be soft and painless and will seem to change its position; But if it be due to an escape of bowel the change of position, compared with what we have described, will be greater, and it will disappear on digital pressure, and then will recur; and often there will be crepitus with it, and it will increase in size on entering the bath or on violent exertion.	0.86873305
It does not disappear if you press it with your hand, and it does not increase or decrease. If it is due to blood, then, in addition to these signs, the swelling appears blackish. If it is due to newly grown flesh, the swelling will be hard and solid and will remain a uniform size.	If it be due to fluid, it will be soft and will not disappear on manual pressure, nor will it grow larger or smaller. If it be due to blood, then in addition to these signs the tumour will appear blackish. If it arise from a fleshy overgrowth, the tumour will be solid and hard, remaining always constant in bulk.	0.8721646
If it is due to wind, its touch will be soft. The procedure in this case is to observe. If the protrusion of the umbilicus is due to blood from an artery or vein, or wind, then you should refrain from treating it, for in that there is danger and risk, as I informed you in the chapter in which I discussed swellings that occur from an artery and a vein.	If it be due to wind, it will be soft to the touch. The operation for these is to examine, and if the exomphalos be due to arterial or venous blood, or wind, you should withhold treatment since it is dangerous in these cases, with an uncertain outlook, as I taught you in the chapter on tumours arising from an artery or vein.	0.8618189
If the protrusion of the umbilicus is due to the intestine or omentum, then you should instruct the patient to hold his breath and stand upright, stretched out. Then mark with ink around the entire umbilicus. Then instruct him to lie down on his back in front of you. Then make an incision with a broad scalpel around the umbilicus at the place you marked with ink. Then pull the middle of the swelling upward with a large hook, then tie the site of the incision tightly with a strong thread or silk string.	But if it be due to bowel or omentum, bid the patient hold his breath and stand stiffly upright; then make an ink mark all round the umbilicus; then tell him to lie on his back before you; then with a broad scalpel cut all round the umbilicus along the line marked out; then draw up the middle of the tumour with a large hook; then ligature the site of the incision with a strong thread or silk cord, tying it securely with a slip-knot.	0.92139864
The knot of the tie should be a slip knot. Then open the middle of the tightened swelling above the tie and insert your index finger into it and search for the intestine. If you find that the tie has caught it, loosen the slip knot and push the intestine back into the abdomen. If you find omentum, pull it out with a hook.	Then open the middle of the tied tumour above the ligature and insert your forefinger and search for the bowel; and if you find it caught in the ligature slacken the slip-knot and push the bowel back into the abdomen. But if you find omentum, stretch it with a hook and cut off what is superfluous.	0.8847439
And cut off the excess. If an artery or vein obstructs you, cauterize it gently and return to your work. Take two needles and thread two strong strings through them. Insert the needles into the incision you made around the swelling, hardened and passed through. Then tighten the swelling in four places onto the needles.	And if you come across an artery or vein, tie it securely and go on with your work: take two needles and thread them with two strong threads and insert the two needles into the incision that you have made around the tumour, pushing them in so that they cross one another. Then ligature the tumour in four places over the needles.	0.8789444
If you wish, remove the needles and leave the area until the tightened flesh rots and falls off on its own, or cut it off when it thins and rots. Then treat it with appropriate ointments until it heals.  If the protrusion of the umbilicus is from flesh growing in it...	If you wish, you may remove the needles and let be until the ligatured tissue necroses and falls away of its own accord; or cut it away when it is thin and necrosing. Then dress with the needful ointments until healed.	0.84815675
or from moisture, then it is necessary to scrape out the swelling as we said, and remove the blood or moisture that you find in it. Then treat it with what will heal the area.	But if the prominent navel be due to an overgrowth of flesh there or from humidity, you should slice the tumour as we have said and get out all the blood or humidity to be found there. Then dress it with stimulating dressings.	0.68631893

On the Treatment of Cancer.	On the treatment of cancer.	0.94987404
We have mentioned in the classification the types of cancer and how to treat it with medications and the warning against treating it with iron lest it ulcerate. We have also mentioned cancer generated in the uterus and the warning against treating it.	We have spoken, in the relevant section, of the kinds of cancer and of the way in which medical treatment of them is to be attempted; with a warning against treatment by the knife lest they ulcerate. We also mentioned the cancer arising in the uterus and gave a warning against its treatment.	0.8941339
The ancients mentioned that when the cancer is in a place where it can be completely excised, such as cancer that is in the breast or in the thigh and similar accessible organs, to remove it entirely, especially if it is incipient and small. But when it is advanced and large, it should not be touched.	The Ancients said that when a cancer is in a site where total eradication is possible, such as a cancer of the breast or of the thigh, and in similar parts where complete removal is possible, and especially when in the early stage and small, (then surgery was to be tried). But when it is of long standing and large you should leave it alone.	0.8664949
I have not been able to cure anyone of it, nor have I seen anyone before me achieve that. The procedure for it, if it is accessible as we said, is to first give the patient several doses of black bile, then bleed him if there is clear fullness in the veins.	For I myself have never been able to cure any such, nor have I seen anyone else succeed before me. The procedure in a case amenable to treatment, as we have said, is first for the patient to be purged several times from black bile; then bleed him if his veins seem full.	0.8836936
Then place the patient in a position suitable for the operation, then insert the appropriate hooks into the cancer, then excise it from all sides with the skin completely so that nothing of its roots remains, and let the blood flow and do not stop it quickly.	Then put the patient in the most convenient position for operating. Then attach to the tumour hooks suited to it; then make a circular incision all round to include the skin with the utmost thoroughness so that not the least root of it remains; let the blood flow and do not stanch it quickly; but put pressure upon the place and squeeze out all the thick blood, either by hand or with any instrument you can.	0.771374
Rather, squeeze the areas and extract all the thick blood with your hand or with whatever instruments you can. If during the procedure you encounter profuse bleeding from a severed artery or vein, cauterize the vessel until the bleeding stops, then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.	If in operating you get a very severe haemorrhage from cutting an artery or vein, cauterize the vessel until the bleeding stops; then dress in the usual way until healed.	0.75485754

On the Treatment of Acne.	On the treatment of dropsy.	0.7220717
We have already explained in the classification the types of ascites, how the water gathers, the signs of each type, and its treatment with medicines. The type that is treated with iron is only the ascitic type, and the tympanitic type and the fleshy type are not approached with iron at all.	We have mentioned in the section the kinds of hydrops, and the manner in which the fluid collects; the signs of each kind; and the medical treatment of them. The only kind which is to be treated by operation is the one called 'ascites'.	0.8042345
For that is deadly. If you have treated this ascitic type of dropsy with medicines and your treatment has not been successful, then observe: if the patient is extremely weak or has another disease besides dropsy, such as having...	When you have been trying medical treatment for this kind, for ascites, and your treatment is ineffectual, then consider; and if the patient be in a low state or suffer from other disease beside the ascites, such as cough or diarrhoea or some such, then beware of attempting operative treatment since it will be of uncertain outcome.	0.7828146
a cough or diarrhea, and so on, then beware of treating him with iron, for it is dangerous. If you see that the patient is strong, has no disease other than dropsy, and is neither a child nor an old man, then the way to proceed is to have the patient stand upright before you. And an assistant behind him should squeeze his abdomen with his hands and push the water downwards towards the pubic area. Then you take a pointed scalpel like this:.	But if you see that the patient has plenty of strength and suffers under no other complaint beside the dropsy, and is of neither tender nor advanced age, then the operative procedure in this case is for you to place the patient, standing, before you, with an assistant behind him to apply manual pressure to his abdomen and push the fluid down into the pelvis.	0.7107276
Sharp on both sides, long, with a pointed tip like a scalpel, except that it has a slight bluntness so that when operating you do not penetrate the intestine and harm it. Then observe: if the dropsy originated near the intestines.	Then take a pointed scalpel of this shape, sharp along both sides, long, and very sharp at the end like a scalpel, but slightly stubby so that in operating you do not reach the intestines and damage them.	0.71979904
it is best to make the incision three fingers below the navel, directly above the pubic bone. If the dropsy originated from a liver disease, let your incision be three fingers to the left of the navel. If it originated from a spleen disease, let the incision be three fingers to the right side.	Then consider; and if the dropsy arises from the region of the intestines then you should make an incision three fingers' breadth directly below the umbilicus, above the pubes. If the dropsy arises from disease of the liver, let your incision be three fingers to the left of the umbilicus. If it arises from disease of the spleen, let the incision be three fingers to the right.	0.8752611
Also, the incision should not be on the side on which the patient wants to lie down, so that the fluids do not flow to that weakened area. Then puncture the entire skin with the instrument, then insert the instrument into that incision and raise your hand.	Moreover, the incision must not be on the side which the patient wishes to lie on, so that the superfluities may not flow to the damaged part.	0.7809345
with the scalpel between the skin and the peritoneum as if you are skinning it, and the amount that you skin should be about the size of a fingernail, or thereabouts.  Then pierce the peritoneum until the scalpel reaches an empty space, which is where the water is. Then remove it and insert into the hole the instrument, which looks like this:.	Then pierce the skin with the instrument, introduce the instrument into that incision, and bring the scalpel up between the skin and the membrane, as if excoriating, over an area about the size of a fingernail.	0.65333104
It is like a small tube, a thin reed made of silver or copper or polished smooth lead.  It has a small hole in its bottom and three holes in its sides, two on one side and one on the other, as you see.	Then pierce through the membrane till the scalpel reaches a cavity, which will be where the water is; then withdraw the scalpel and put into the opening the instrument shaped like this; it resembles a fine section of reed, made of silver, bronze or white copper; smooth and well polished, with a small opening at the lower end and three at the sides, two on one side and one on the other, as you see.	0.7501284
Its tip can also be sharpened, like the point of a pen, like this:	Its extremity may be cut to the shape of a writing reed like this; the upper end of it is supplied with a ring.	0.6171361
At its top end is a ring. When the instrument reaches the water, it will immediately flow down the instrument.  So drain a moderate amount of water at a time, because if you drain more than is necessary at once, the patient may die due to the collapse of his vital spirit.	When the instrument reaches the fluid, the fluid will at once pass down into it. Evacuate at one time only a moderate amount of fluid; for if you evacuate more than you should at a time, the patient may die through a dissolution of his animal spirits, or he will undergo a fainting that is next door to death.	0.78544354
Or he may experience fainting close to death.  Instead, drain an amount appropriate to his strength and as indicated by the patient's condition, from the strength of his pulse and the good color of his complexion. Then remove the instrument and stop the flow of water, as it will stop immediately.	But let out such quantity of fluid as is proportionate to his strength and as is indicated to you by the patient's condition: the strength of his pulse and the goodness of his colour. Then withdraw the instrument and keep (the rest of) the fluid in.	0.71207774
This is due to the skin that closes the hole on the peritoneum, which I told you to pad in that way. Then repeat the procedure another day if you see that the patient can tolerate it.	For it will be immediately held back by the skin that closes the opening in the peritoneum, which, as I have told you, must be perforated in that manner. Then repeat the use of the instrument another day if you see that the patient can tolerate it, and withdraw again a small quantity of fluid.	0.82242036
And also drain a small amount of the water. Do this for several days while being cautious and guarding against error, until only a small amount of water remains. If you are concerned about the patient and leave a large amount of water, treat him by burying him in hot sand.	And do this daily, watchful and on guard against error, until there is only a trace of fluid left.	0.6051443
And [promote] profuse sweating in the bath and sun, and restrict him from drinking, and treat him with drying medications until he recovers.  Cauterize him on the stomach, liver, and spleen after draining the water as I described previously.	But if you are afraid for the patient and leave a large amount of fluids treat him by burying him in hot sand, and by heavy sweating in the bath and in the sun, and letting him go thirsty; while you treat him with drying medicines, till he is well. He should also be cauterized on the abdomen and on the liver and spleen after the paracentesis, as I have previously described.	0.76091117

On the treatment of children born with imperforate urethras, or with narrow openings, or openings in the wrong place.	On the treatment of boys born with imperforate urinary meatus; or with the meatus small or not in the proper place.	0.7526756
Some boys may emerge from their mother's womb with an imperforate urethra.  It is necessary to proceed immediately with its perforation as soon as he is born.	Sometimes a boy is born from his mother's womb with the glans penis not perforate.	0.5965504
With a very fine scalpel, like this:	So at the moment of his birth you should be quick and make a perforation with a fine scalpel figured thus.	0.44389033
Then place in the hole a thin lead probe and tie it in place and keep it there for three or four days. When he needs to urinate, remove it and after he urinates replace it. And if you do not insert the lead, it is possible that the urine which flows through the opening will prevent it from closing.	Then put in the opening a slender leaden sound, tie it and keep it in for three or four days. When he wishes to make water, it will be removed and he will do so; then put it back. If you do not put in the leaden sound it may be that the urine passing through the place will prevent the wound from healing.	0.86046153
As for the one whose opening is narrow, it is treated with the lead probe as we have described for many days until it widens. And those whose opening is in the wrong place, that is, some are born with the opening at the end of the penis, so they cannot urinate forward.	The case having too narrow a meatus should be treated with the leaden sound, as we have said, for many days until it is wide enough.	0.5429882
So he must lift the penis with his hand in order to urinate. And he is not born this way because the semen cannot reach the uterus in a straight line, and this is a very ugly condition.  The way to operate in this case is to have the patient lie on his back.	In those cases having a misplaced meatus—for example, there are some born with the opening at the edge of the glans so that they cannot make water forwards until the opening of the penis is lifted up by hand, nor can they beget, since the semen cannot reach directly to the uterus, a disorder which is very ugly.	0.6026472
Then you stretch his penis with your left hand, stretching it firmly, and you cut the tip of the urethra with a blade or a sharp scalpel, the size of a pen, or as if you are carving something so that its middle protrudes, resembling a penis, and so that the opening is located in the middle as it should be.	The manner of operating in this case is for the patient to lie back; then with your left hand draw out his glans firmly and cut the end of the glans at the place of the meatus with a broad knife or sharp scalpel, as if sharpening a pen, or as if you were whittling something, so that the middle of it protrudes like a glans penis and the opening falls in the middle as it should.	0.741687
And be cautious during the procedure of bleeding, for it often happens, so counteract it with what stops the bleeding and treat the wound until it heals.	And beware, in your operating, of haemorrhage, which often happens; meet it with styptics and dress the wound until it heals.	0.7151989

On pustules that occur on the foreskin and penis, and blackness, and corruption, and adhesion of the foreskin to the penis.	On pustules occurring on the prepuce and on the glans; and blackness and necrosis and adhesions between glans and prepuce.	0.80682397
This pustule often appears in the urethra, and it is a vile fleshy growth, and there is a malignant and non-malignant type of it, so the non-malignant one should be hung with a fine hook.	These pustules very frequently occur in the urinary meatus and are excrescences of foul tissue. Some are malignant and some are not.	0.67024124
And cut it until you have cleaned it all, then apply cotton dipped in Egyptian ointment to it, then treat it afterward with palm ointment until it heals.  But if the pustule is malignant, vile in color, then cauterization should be used on it after cutting and scraping it.	The nonmalignant you should seize with a fine hook and pare away until they are altogether gone; then apply to the place cotton wool soaked in Egyptian ointment; then afterwards dress with Palm ointment until healed. But when the pustules are malignant, of a dirty colour, for these you should employ the cautery after cutting and scraping them.	0.85835934
If the pustule is on the foreskin of an uncircumcised boy, and some of the pustule is on the inside of the foreskin and some of it on the outside, then the pustule that is on the inside should be removed first, so that when it has healed, then treat it from the outside.	If the pustules be on the prepuce of an uncircumcized unbeliever and there are some inside the prepuce and some outside, those that are inside should be removed first; and when they are healed over, then treat those outside.	0.86541325
Because if you treat them both together, you cannot be sure the foreskin will not be perforated.  Blackness and corruption can also occur on the labia and on the foreskin, and it is necessary to excise everything that has blackened and is about to decay or has decayed.	For if you deal with both at the same time you are in danger of going through the prepuce. Sometimes there occurs a blackness and necrosis in the testicles and prepuce; then you should scrape away all the black part which looks ready to go necrotic or has already necrosed.	0.7311019
Then apply honey to it afterward, with the sifted, pounded peels of pomegranate and frankincense, then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it is healed. If bleeding occurs, use cauterization with a crescent-shaped iron in this way:	Then afterwards smear on the place honey with pounded and sifted pomegranate peel and bitter vetch. Then carry on with the usual treatment until healed. If haemorrhage set in, cauterize with a lunate cautery figured thus.	0.82251334
For cauterization is beneficial for both conditions, I mean bleeding and a wound if it putrefies. If the glans is corroded and consumed in its entirety at some point, it is necessary to insert a lead tube into the urethra so that the patient can urinate through it. As for the adhesion of the foreskin to the glans...	For the cautery serves a twofold purpose, namely against haemorrhage and for a putrefying wound. If at any time the penis mortifies and goes entirely, you should pass into the urethra a leaden cannula so that the patient can make water.	0.813428
This adhesion only occurs in someone whose foreskin was healthy and did not require circumcision. Adhesion can also occur from a wound or a tumor. It is necessary to dissect it with a blunt scalpel so that the adhesion is released and the glans is freed from every side.	As to the adhesion of the glans to the prepuce (which occurs in him who has his prepuce intact, being under no obligation to be circumcized; sometimes too adhesion may occur by reason of a wound or an abscess) you should scrape it with a flat-nosed scalpel until the adhesion is divided and the glans penis is freed all round from the prepuce.	0.6931382
If it is difficult to distinguish it completely, it is necessary to dissect some of the glans and some of the foreskin, because the foreskin is thin and may be quickly perforated due to its thinness. Then separate the foreskin and the glans with a thin linen cloth soaked in cold water so that they do not stick together again.	But if the complete separation of the two be difficult then you should dissect away a little of the glans and of the prepuce; for the prepuce is thin, and consequently it is often pierced quickly. Separate then between the glans and the prepuce with a piece of fine linen dipped in cold water to prevent further adhesions.	0.84922945
Then treat it with an astringent syrup until it heals.	Then let it be dressed with some styptic wine till it heals over.	0.7538833

On the Hygiene of Boys and Treatment of Accidental Injuries that Occur to Them.	On the circumcision of boys; and the correction of their erroneous treatment.	0.7156209
Circumcision is nothing but the separation of a connection, like other surgical procedures, but since it is done by our own will and is performed specifically on boys, we must describe the best practice for it.	Circumcision is nothing but a solution of continuity like other wounds: but as it is a result of our deliberate action, and as it is done particularly to boys, we should plan in this case the very best operation, and the easiest way that leads to safety.	0.7846197
And the easiest way that leads to safety. I say that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books because it was not practiced in their religions, but rather it is something we have adopted.	Now the Ancients made no mention of circumcision in any of their books, since it was not practised in their religion; but it is something we have acquired by experience.	0.7260907
Through experience, I have found that most surgeons and cuppers perform circumcision using a scalpel and scissors, and they use a fibula, thread ligature, and cutting with the fingernail. I have tried all of these methods.	I have myself seen the common run of practitioners and barbers carry it out with razor and with scissors; they use a spindle-whorl, a ligature of thread, and incision by means of the finger-nail. I have personally tried all these ways and have not found a better than circumcision with scissors and a thread ligature.	0.8197541
I have not found anything better than circumcision using scissors and ligature with thread, because when circumcising with a scalpel, the skin often adheres to it because the foreskin has two layers, and sometimes the outer layer is cut while the inner layer remains.	I have personally tried all these ways and have not found a better than circumcision with scissors and a thread ligature. For circumcision carried out with the razor is often eluded by the skin; for the skin of the prepuce is of two layers; and often the outer skin is incised and the inner is left intact, so that a second incision is needed, and renewed pain; while when the circumcision is done with a spindle-whorl you are in danger of cutting the tip of the penis, since the tip often goes into the aperture of the whorl.	0.7657553
This necessitates another cut and renewed pain. Circumcision with a fibula risks cutting the tip of the urethra, as it may enter its opening. As for circumcision with the fingernail, the skin may slip and ruin your work, or the boy's foreskin may be naturally short...	As for circumcision by the finger-nail, the nail will often slip off the skin and your operation be spoilt; or the boy's foreskin may be naturally short, for many are born thus, not needing circumcision.	0.58592176
They are often born like this, not needing circumcision, and I have seen this. As for circumcision with scissors and ligature with thread, experience has revealed its superiority to me, because the scissors cut evenly since the upper blade is like the lower blade.	I have seen this myself. Experience has taught me the superiority of circumcision with the scissors and the thread ligature.	0.62763727
So when you squeeze your hand, coordinating the two blades, they cut evenly and at the same time, so the ligature becomes like a wall for the skin of the urethra on all sides, so no error occurs at all. The method is, first, to distract the boy.	For scissors cut evenly, since the upper edge of the scissors is exactly the same as the lower edge; and so, as you compress your hand, thanks to the correspondence of the two blades you cut equally and simultaneously; and you make the girdle of the thread like a wall all round the skin of the tip of the penis: thus no error can occur.	0.6678851
Especially if he is one of those who understand a little, that you are only tying the thread around his urethra and leaving it until another day. Then make him happy and delight him in every way you can and that his mind accepts. Then have him stand between your hands, upright.	The manner of operating is first to make the boy, especially if he is one who understands a little, imagine that all you are going to do is tie a ligature on the tip of the penis and leave it for another day.	0.5730418
He should not be sitting. Hide the scissors in your sleeve or under your foot; the boy's eye should not fall on them at all, nor on any of the instruments. Then insert your hand into his foreskin and blow into the skin, and lift it up until the tip of the urethra emerges.	Then amuse him and cheer him as much as you can, according to his intelligence; then stand him upright before you, not sitting; and hide the scissors in your sleeve or under your foot and do not let the boy's eye chance upon that or any other instrument.	0.80784893
Then clean it of any dirt that has accumulated in it. Then tie the marked area with a double thread, then tie a second ligature a little below it. Then grasp firmly with your thumb and index finger the place of the lower ligature, and cut between the two ligatures. Then quickly lift the skin upwards and expose the tip of the urethra. Then let the blood flow a little; this is better and causes less swelling of the urethra. Then dry it with a damp cloth, then sprinkle on it some ash of burnt dried gourd, for it is the best thing I have tried, or knotgrass flour, which is also excellent.	Then with your hand take hold of the tip of the penis, blow into the foreskin, and draw it back till the glans penis is exposed; then cleanse from it all unclean matter that has collected. Then ligate the indicated place with a double ligature, and a second right round beneath; then take hold at the site of the lower ligature with thumb and forefinger, very firmly, and cut between the ligatures; then quickly push back the skin and draw out the glans penis; then let a little blood flow, for that is all the better and prevents the swelling of the tip of the penis; then wipe it with a piece of soft cloth, then sprinkle on it ashes of dried gourds (this is the best of all that I have tried) or else fine white flour, which is also good; then apply on top of the powders a piece of linen with egg-yolk cooked in rosewater, beaten up with fresh oil of roses of good quality.	0.90057933
Then quickly lift the skin upwards and expose the tip of the urethra. Then let the blood flow a little; this is better and causes less swelling of the urethra. Then dry it with a damp cloth, then sprinkle on it some ash of burnt dried gourd, for it is the best thing I have tried, or knotgrass flour, which is also excellent. Then apply over the powder, in a cloth, the white of a cooked egg beaten with fresh, fragrant rosewater and rose oil, and leave it on him until the next day. Then continue treating him with other remedies until he recovers.	Then ligate the indicated place with a double ligature, and a second right round beneath; then take hold at the site of the lower ligature with thumb and forefinger, very firmly, and cut between the ligatures; then quickly push back the skin and draw out the glans penis; then let a little blood flow, for that is all the better and prevents the swelling of the tip of the penis; then wipe it with a piece of soft cloth, then sprinkle on it ashes of dried gourds (this is the best of all that I have tried) or else fine white flour, which is also good; then apply on top of the powders a piece of linen with egg-yolk cooked in rosewater, beaten up with fresh oil of roses of good quality. Leave this on the wound until the following day; then dress it in the usual way till healed.	0.85777634
This is a picture of the scissors that are suitable for circumcision:	This is the type of scissors most suitable for circumcizing.	0.5972379
They should be sharp, cutting, without any bend, with a secure screw, and the length of the two blades should be equal to the length of the two handles. As for the mistakes that occur in circumcision, sometimes the inner skin, all or part of it, folds over during the cutting, so it is necessary to immediately extend it with your fingernail before the area swells.	They should be fiat-nosed, sharp, with no bend in them, and with the pivot tempered ; and the length of the handles should be equal to that of the blades. Now the mistake often occurring in circumcision is for the inner layer of skin, either the whole or the part, to be inverted at the cutting. So you should at the start draw it out with your finger-nail before the place swell; then make an even incision.	0.7958777
And cut it evenly. If you cannot hold it with your fingernail, pull it with a hook and cut it.  If three days have passed and what is under the tip of the urethra remains swollen and inflamed, leave it until the acute swelling subsides and then gently peel it off.	And if you are unable to get a hold with your finger-nail then pick it up with a hook and make your incision. If after three days there still remains some inflation and swelling of the part below the tip of the penis, let it be until the effusion subsides, and then gently peel it away and cut it as best you may.	0.85518026
And cut it as much as is feasible for you, but be careful of the tip of the urethra. If a part of the tip of the urethra is cut, it will not cause harm. Treat it with wound-healing powders that we have described in the chapter on powders.	Be careful of the tip of the penis; though if any of the tip is cut away that will do no harm. And dress the wound with stimulating medicaments from among the powders that we described in the treatise on powders.	0.7709558
And if more than necessary is cut from the skin and it retracts upwards, it will not cause much harm either. Treat it as we have mentioned until it heals.	Should more of the skin be cut away than necessary and the skin is wrinkled up, that will do no great harm either. Continue such treatment as we have mentioned, until healed.	0.8697121

On the treatment of urine retention in the bladder.	On the treatment of retention of urine.	0.9118316
Urine retention in the bladder occurs due to blockage from a stone, clotted blood, pus, or growth of tissue, and the like. If you have treated it with the various treatments we described in the section,	Retention of the urine is caused by an obstruction, from a stone or a clot of blood or pus or a fleshy tumour, or similar cause.	0.7864526
and the urine has not been released, and you believe that its retention is due to a stone that has become lodged in the neck of the bladder, then it is necessary to have the patient kneel on his knees, then someone should mount his back, stretch his belly towards his back, and have the patient hold himself as much as he can.	When you have carried out treatment in the ways we have prescribed in their place and the urine is not released; and when you see that it is held back by a stone sticking in the neck of the bladder, then you should have the patient down on his knees, squatting; then mount a man on his back to press his abdomen against his back; and let the patient himself hold his breath as tightly as possible; for then pressure will be put on the neck of the bladder to force the stone back and liberate the urine.	0.7700434
The neck of the bladder will then be forced to push the stone backwards, and the urine will be released. If it is not released by what we have described, and the patient's condition worsens, it is necessary to use the instrument called a catheter to extract it, which is depicted here:.	But if these measures do not free it and the matter is very urgent with the patient, then you should attempt to bring it out with the instrument called a catheter, of which this is the figure.	0.614656
It is made of silver, and it is thin, smooth, and hollow, like a bird's feather quill in its thinness and length, about a span and a half long, with a delicate funnel at its head.  The way to draw urine with it is to take a doubled thread and tie good knots with wool or cotton at its end.	It is made of silver, slender and smooth and hollow like the quill of a bird's feather; as slender as a probe; about a span and a half in length; and with a tiny funnel at the end.	0.84837335
Insert the end of the thread into the bottom of the catheter and cut with scissors any excess wool so that it enters the tube and plugs it like a button. Then lubricate the catheter with oil, butter, or egg white and have the patient sit on a chair.	This is the manner in which you draw off the urine through it: take a double thread and with a strong knot tie a little wool or cotton on the end, introduce the end of the thread into the lower end of the catheter, and trim off with scissors any superfluous wool, so that it will go into the tube and close it like a tassel. Then smear the catheter with oil or butter or egg-white.	0.68313575
Anoint his bladder and urethra with moist ointments or oil and lukewarm water, then gently insert the catheter into the urethra until it reaches the base of the urethra, then bend the urethra upwards towards the navel, then push the catheter inside it.	Make the patient sit down; then anoint the bladder and the meatus of the penis with humid oils or with olive-oil and warm water. Then gently introduce the catheter into the urethra until it reaches the root of the urethra.	0.8256149
Once the urethra is bent, push the catheter inside until, when it reaches near the anus, tilt the penis downwards with the catheter inside, then push it until it reaches the bladder, and the patient feels it has reached an empty space.	Then turn the end of the penis upward toward the umbilicus; then push the catheter inwards until the curve of the catheter ends, and push the catheter in until it reaches nearly to the seat. Then turn the penis down, with the catheter in it, and push until it reaches the bladder, and the patient now feels that it has entered a hollow.	0.839095
It is made in this manner because the passage through which urine flows has curves. Then pull the thread with the wool gently, and the urine will follow the wool.  Then remove it and the urine will pour out.  Reinsert the catheter.	The reason why the operation is done in this manner is that the passage by which the urine is excreted is curved. Then withdraw rather firmly the thread with the wool plug attached, for the urine follows the wool; then pull it right out and the urine will pour out.	0.857901
Continue doing this until the bladder is emptied and the patient feels relief.	Apply the catheter again and again until the bladder is emptied and the patient finds relief.	0.7670815

How to inject the bladder with a syringe.	On the manner of irrigating the bladder with a syringe, and the forms of the instruments that serve for that.	0.45536107
And the forms of the instruments that are suitable for it are made of silver or of hollowed ivory, having a long thin tube like pus.  And if you wish to instill fluids and medications in it, this is done with an instrument called a syringe, and this is its form:	When there occurs an ulcer in the bladder, or there is a clot of blood or a deposit of pus in it, and you wish to instil into it lotions and medicaments, this is done with the help of an instrument called a syringe.	0.60482824
It is made of silver or hollowed ivory, having a long, thin tube like a probe, all of it hollow except the tip, which is solid. It has three holes, two on one side and one on the other, as you see.	It is made of silver or ivory, hollow, with a long fine tube, fine as a probe; entirely hollow except for the end, which is solid with three holes in it: two on one side and one on the other, as you see.	0.93233097
And the hollow place in which the piston is should be of a size that fills it completely, without excess, so that when you pull something of the fluids with it, they are drawn in, and when you push with it, they are propelled to a distance, like how the pump is made with which naphtha is thrown in sea battles.	The hollow part containing the plunger is exactly of a size to be closed by it, so that any liquid is drawn up with it when you pull it up; and when you press it down it is driven in a jet, as is done by the projector whereby naphtha is thrown in naval battles.	0.78465605
If you want to introduce fluids into the bladder, insert the tip of the syringe into the fluid and pull the piston upwards, then the fluid will be drawn into the cavity of the syringe. Then insert its tip into the urethra as we described for catheters, then push the fluid with the piston.	So when you wish to inject fluid into the bladder, dip the end of the syringe into the fluid and draw up the piston, for the fluid will be drawn up into the cavity of the syringe.	0.77160424
Then that fluid will reach the bladder as intended until the patient feels it. And this is the image of another fine syringe with which the bladder is injected:	Then introduce the end into the urethra as we described for catheterization; then expel the fluid by means of the piston; the fluid will immediately flow into the bladder and the patient will have a sense of its entry. This is the illustration of a fine clyster also for irrigation of the bladder.	0.6594243
It is made of silver or lead, its upper head resembling a small funnel, and below it a groove in which the tie is placed. Then you take a camel's bladder and put in it the fluid with which you want to inject the bladder, then you tie it tightly between the two partitions with doubled thread.	It is made of silver or white copper. The upper part of it is like a small funnel and beneath it is a groove where falls the thread of the ligature. Then take a camel's bladder and fill it with whatever fluid you wish to wash the bladder out with, and tie it to the syringe with a strong ligature of double thread between the two ridges.	0.92731154
And warm that liquid a little over the fire, then insert the tip of the syringe into the urethra, then firmly squeeze your hand on the bladder containing the liquid so that the patient feels that the liquid has reached the bladder.	Warm the fluid a little over the fire; then introduce the end of the siphon into the end of the urinary meatus. Then apply strong pressure to the bladder containing the fluid until the patient can feel the fluid has entered his own bladder.	0.8638731
If you don't have a bladder, take a piece of parchment, make a circle out of it, and pierce it all around its edge, then insert a strong thread into those holes as you rotate, then gather the circle like you gather a tablecloth after you put in it what you want of fluids, oils, and waters.	But if you have not a bladder, then take a piece of parchment and cut out a circle; then make holes in the edge all round the circle; then pass a strong ligature through these holes all round and draw the circle in, as a bag is closed with a draw-string, first putting into it whatever fluid, oil, or water, you desire.	0.88074857
Then tie it to the instrument and do with it as you did with the bladder, squeezing your hand until the fluid reaches the bladder.	Then tie it to the instrument and do with it as with the camel's bladder, squeezing until the fluid reaches the bladder of the patient.	0.87506586

Chapter Sixty.	CHAPTER SIXTY.	0.8197362
On extracting the stone.	On the extraction of the stone.	0.9706541
We have mentioned in the classification the types of stones and their treatment with medicines, and I mentioned the difference between the stone generated in the kidneys and the stone generated in the bladder and the signs of all of that, and I mentioned the stone in which the work is done by hand and incision.	We have already in the due place reviewed the different kinds of stone and the medical treatment of them. I mentioned too the difference between stones arising in the kidney and those arising in the bladder, and gave all the symptoms of them. I also mentioned the kind of stone to which manipulation and incision are appropriate.	0.8661343
And it is the stone generated specifically in the bladder and that which sticks in the urethra, and I will describe that with a clear explanation and brevity.	This is in particular the stone arising in the bladder, and the sort impacted in the urethra. I shall now give a short description of this with a clear explanation and summary.	0.83513796
So I say that the stone generated in the bladder most often occurs in boys and among its signs is that the urine comes out of the bladder resembling water in its thinness.	Now I say that a vesical calculus most frequently occurs in boys.	0.6101531
And sand appears in it, and he rubs his penis and fiddles with it, and it often hangs low then spreads out, and the anus protrudes with it in many of them, and recovery from it is easy for boys until they reach fourteen years, and it is difficult in old men, and as for youths, it is intermediate between that.	Among the symptoms is that the urine passed out of the bladder is of a thin consistency like water, and sand appears in it; and the patient keeps on rubbing and playing with his penis; and often it hangs flaccid and then is erected; at the same time many of them get a prolapse of the rectum. The cure of boys under the age of fourteen years is easy; but the treatment of old people is difficult; and that of young men midway between the two.	0.7486451
And the one whose stones are larger, his treatment is easier, and the small ones are the opposite of that. So if we proceed to the treatment, it is necessary first to inject the ill person with an enema that expels all the filth that is in his intestines, for it may prevent the discovery of the stone during the examination.	And the larger the stone the easier the cure; with a small stone the cure is otherwise. When we undertake treatment the patient must first have an enema to empty his bowel completely; for sometimes the faeces prevent the calculus being found when it is looked for.	0.8302902
Then the sick person is taken by his feet and shaken and jolted downwards so that the stone descends to the neck of the bladder, or he jumps from a high place several times. Then you sit him upright before you with his hands under his thighs so that the whole bladder inclines downwards, then you examine him.	Then the patient should be taken by the feet and jarred to and fro and shaken downwards to bring the calculus down into the neck of the bladder; or else let him jump down from a height a number of times. Then have him sit down upright before you with his hands beneath his thighs, to make the whole bladder incline downwards.	0.89817554
And you palpate him from the outside. If you feel the stone in the open space, then immediately proceed with the incision over it. But if it does not fall under your touch at all, then it is necessary to anoint the index finger with oil from the left hand if the patient is a boy, or the middle finger.	Then examine him and palpate him externally. If you feel the stone in the empty place, immediately hasten and cut down upon it. But if there is not the slightest sign of it to the touch then you should anoint with oil the forefinger of your left hand if it be a boy, or the middle finger if it be a fully grown young man, and introduce it into the anus and search around for the calculus, until, when it comes under the finger, you can work it slowly towards the neck of the bladder.	0.81809574
If he is a mature youth, you insert it in his anus and search for the stone until, when it falls under your finger, you move it little by little to the neck of the bladder, then you press on it with your finger and push it outwards toward the place where you want to make the incision.	Then press upon it with your finger and push it outwards toward the place where you wish to make your incision.	0.4567474
And you order an assistant to squeeze the bladder with his hand, and you order another assistant to stretch the testicles upwards with his right hand and with his other hand to stretch the skin that is under the testicles away from the location where the incision will be. Then you take the extracting scalpel which has this form:.	And bid an assistant squeeze the bladder with his hand; and bid another assistant raise the scrotum with his left hand and with the other hand stretch the skin under the testicles away from the place where the incision is going to be.	0.8624743
And you make an incision between the anus and the testicles, not in the middle, but to the side of the left buttock, and the incision should be directly over the stone with your finger in the anus and you pressing it outwards obliquely, so that the incision is wide on the outside and narrow on the inside, just enough for the stone to come out.	Then do you take a lancet like this and make your incision in the space between the anus and the testicles, not in the mid-line but on the side of the left buttock; and cut down upon the calculus itself, keeping your finger in the anus and pressing it outwards. The incision should be oblique, wide externally and narrowing inwards down to dimensions allowing the exit of the stone, not larger.	0.8664116
No larger, for perhaps the finger that is in the anus might press the stone at the time of the incision so that it comes out without difficulty.  And know that there may be some stones that have angles and edges, which makes their exit difficult for that reason.	Now you may press with the finger that is in the anus upon the stone as you make the incision, and it comes out without difficulty. You should know that sometimes there are stones which have angles and edges, on which account their extraction is difficult.	0.83769774
And some of them are smooth, resembling acorns, and rounded, so their exit is easy. As for those that have angles and edges, you widen the incision a little. If it does not come out this way, then it is necessary to use a trick on it, either by grasping it with strong forceps, the tip of which is like a file.	Some are smooth like acorns and rounded, and these come out easily. But in those cases where the stone is rough and angular you should slightly increase the incision.	0.7716621
so that it grips the stone and does not slip from it, or you insert a delicate instrument with a curved end under it.  If you are unable to get it with that, then widen the incision a little.  If some of the blood overwhelms you, stop it with vitriol.	Then if it still will not come out you must then resort to a device— namely to catch hold of it with strong forceps having an extremity like a rasp, to get a tight hold of it so it shall not slip out; or else introduce beneath it a narrow instrument with a crooked end. And if you then cannot get the stone out, widen the incision slightly; and if there is any bleeding stanch it with vitriol.	0.80435747
If there is more than one, first push the larger one to the mouth of the bladder, then incise over it, then push the smaller one after that, and likewise if there are more than two. If it is very large, then it is foolish to make a large incision over it, because it exposes the patient to one of two things.	If there should be a number of stones first push the largest of them into the neck of the bladder, then cut down upon it; then push a smaller one down after it; and do the same if there be more than two. But if the stone be very large it is foolish to make a great incision down upon it; for the result is that the patient either dies or has a chronic urinary fistula because the place will not heal at all.	0.8144886
Either he dies or he perpetually dribbles urine because the place will not heal at all. But try to push it until it comes out, or contrive to break it with forceps until you get it out piece by piece.	But if the stone be very large it is foolish to make a great incision down upon it; for the result is that the patient either dies or has a chronic urinary fistula because the place will not heal at all. Try rather to manipulate it so that it protrudes; or else attempt to break it up with the forceps so that you can extract it piecemeal.	0.6648721
When you have finished your work, stuff the wound with frankincense, aloe, and acacia, and bandage it, and place over it rags moistened with oil and syrup or rose oil and cold water to soothe the burning swelling. Then the patient should lie on his back and do not loosen the bandage until the third day.	And when you have completed the operation pack the wound with frankincense and aloes and dragon's blood, and bind it up and apply a pad soaked in olive oil and wine or oil of roses and cold water, to reduce the swelling. The patient should lie flat on his back and the bindings should not be undone before the third day; and when they are undone foment the place with plenty of oil and water.	0.90927345
When it is loosened, wash the area with plenty of water and oil, then treat it with the palm ointment and the basilicon ointment until it heals.  If excessive burning swelling occurs in the wound, and erosion, and the like, such as if blood congeals in the bladder and blocks the urine, and this is known by the discharge of blood with the urine,	Then dress it with Palm ointment and basilicon ointment until it heals. If an increasing and cankerous abscess occur in the wound, or anything similar such as clotting of blood within the bladder, with stoppage of the urine (which would be signified by the urine being accompanied by blood) pass your finger into the wound and remove the blood; for if it lies in it it will lead to sepsis and necrosis of the bladder.	0.737911
insert your finger into the wound and remove that blood, for if it remains, it will lead to corruption and putrefaction of the bladder. Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt, and treat each type with its corresponding treatment until it heals.	Then wash out the wound with vinegar and water and salt, and apply whatever treatment is suitable for the case until it heals.	0.7182036
And it is necessary at all times of treatment to tie the thighs and bring them together to secure the medicines that are placed on the area.  If the stone is small and has entered the urethra and become lodged in it and prevents the passage of urine, treat it as I have described before it enters the perineum.	Also at all times during treatment his hips should be bound and kept together so that the medicaments applied to the place may not be disturbed. Now if the calculus be small and be impacted in the opening of the urinary passage, preventing the exit of the urine, treat it with the means I am about to describe before you go on to make your incision, for often I have found this treatment suffice without incision; I have experience of this.	0.78804195
For I have often avoided the perineal incision with this treatment, and I have tested it, which is that you take a forked instrument of steel whose form is this:.	You take a drill of the finest steel, of this shape.	0.45660874
Triangular at the tip, sharp, and inserted into a handle.  Then you take a thread and tie it around the penis below the stone so that it does not return to the bladder. Then insert the forked instrument gently into the urethra until the fork reaches the stone itself.	It should be triangular at the point and sharp, with a wooden handle. Then take a thread and with it bind the penis beneath the calculus to prevent the stone from returning to the bladder. Then introduce the iron of the drill gently into the meatus until the drill reaches the stone itself, and then very very gently revolve the drill upon the stone with your hand, and try to perforate it, till you pierce it through to the other side.	0.8296143
And rotate the fork with your hand around the stone little by little as you intend to pierce it until you penetrate it from the other side, for the urine will flow immediately. Then squeeze your hand on what remains of the stone from outside the penis, for it will crumble and come out with the urine, and the patient will recover.	Then the urine will at once be released. Then, with your hand outside the penis, squeeze the remains of the stone, and they will crumble and be washed out by the urine and the patient will be cured.	0.72295094
If this treatment is not feasible for you due to an obstacle preventing you from doing it, tie a thread below the stone and another thread above the stone, then incise over the stone in the penis itself between the two ties, then extract it.	But if this treatment is not possible for you on account of some impediment, then tie a thread beneath the stone and another above; then make an incision down upon the stone in the penis itself between the two ligatures, extract it, then undo the ligature and clean away the blood that has clotted in the wound.	0.8900946
Then untie the thread and clean the clotted blood that has formed in the wound. The reason for tying the thread below the stone is to prevent it from returning to the bladder, and the other tie above is so that when the thread is untied after the stone is removed, the skin returns to its place and covers the wound.	The purpose of the ligature beneath the stone is lest it return to the bladder; and the purpose of the one above it is that when you loosen the ligature after removing the stone the skin may fall back into place so as to cover the wound.	0.76435506
Therefore, when you tie the upper thread, you should lift the skin upwards so that it returns when you are finished and covers the wound as we have said.	On this account, when you tie the upper ligature, you will have to raise the skin so that when you have finished operating it may go back and cover the wound as we have said.	0.83276135

On extracting the stone in women.	On the extraction of a stone from the female.	0.86963594
Stones rarely form in women. If one of them develops a stone, its treatment is difficult and avoided for many reasons. One is that the woman may be a virgin, and the second is that you do not find a woman who permits herself to be examined by a physician.	It is very uncommon for women to have stone. But if it should happen to a woman the treatment is indeed difficult and is hindered by a number of things. One is that the woman may be a virgin. Another is that you will not find a woman who will expose herself to a (male) doctor if she be chaste or married.	0.7911205
If she is chaste or has close male relatives, a third reason is that you will not find a woman who is skilled in this craft, especially manual work; and fourth, the place of incision for stones in women is far from the location of the stone, so it requires a deep incision.	A third is that you will not find a woman competent in this art, particularly not in surgery. Then a fourth is that the place for cutting upon the stone in a woman is a long way from where the stone lies, so the incision has to be deep, which is dangerous.	0.7953176
And in that is danger.  If necessity calls for it, then a skilled female physician should be sought, but she is rarely found. If you cannot find her, seek a kind, gentle male physician. Or have a midwife skilled in women's matters present, or a woman with some knowledge of this craft.	If necessity compels you to this kind of case, you should take with you a competent woman doctor. As these are very uncommon, if you are without one then seek a eunuch doctor as a colleague, or bring a midwife experienced in women's ailments or a woman to whom you may give some instruction in this art.	0.80900085
Have her attend and instruct her to perform all that you command her, beginning with the examination for the stone. That is, she should see if the woman is a virgin. She should insert a finger into her rectum and examine for the stone. If she finds it and can press it with her finger	Have her with you and bid her do all that you enjoin; first of all, in searching for the stone. If she perceive that the woman is a virgin she should pass her finger into the anus and palpate for the stone.	0.81054443
then instruct her to make the incision.  If she is not a virgin but is married, instruct the midwife to insert her finger into the patient's vagina and examine for the stone after placing her left hand on the bladder and squeezing it well.	If she finds it and keeps her finger on it, then bid her cut down upon it. But if the patient be not a virgin bid the midwife pass her finger into the vulva and palpate for the stone, after she has placed her left hand upon the bladder and applied a good pressure.	0.8445894
If she finds it, she should move it from the opening of the bladder downward as far as she can until it reaches the base of the thigh.  Then make the incision opposite the middle of the vulva at the base of the thigh, on whichever side is easiest and where the stone is felt.	If she finds the stone she should gradually push it down from the outlet of the bladder as far as she can until it reaches the bottom of the pelvis. Then she should cut down upon it from about the middle of the pudenda near the root of the hip on whichever side she can conveniently feel it; she must keep her finger on the stone, pressing from below.	0.8475409
Her finger should not move from the stone, pressing down upon it. The incision should be small at first. Then insert the probe through this small incision. If the stone is felt, enlarge the incision as needed until you know the stone can be extracted. Know that there are many types of stones.	The incision should start by being small; then let her introduce a sound into the small incision, and when she finds the stone then she will enlarge the incision until she knows that it is big enough for the exit of the stone.	0.76402736
Some are small and large, smooth and rough, long and round, and branched.  Know their types so that you may be guided by this in what you intend. If bleeding is excessive, sprinkle powdered vitriol on the area and hold it for a while until the bleeding stops, then return to your work.	You should know that there are many kinds of calculus: some are large and some are small; smooth and rough; long, rounded, and pronged. Learn to recognize these types and you will have an indication of what to do. If you are hindered by a haemorrhage, scatter powdered vitriol on the place and keep it there for a time until the haemorrhage has ceased, and then return to your operating until the stone is out.	0.7960248
Until the stone is extracted. And be sure to prepare for yourself the instruments mentioned for the removal of stones in men to help you in your work. If you are overcome by bleeding, and know by the pulse that it is from a severed artery, apply cautery to the area.	See also that you have ready the instruments mentioned for the extraction of stone from the male, to assist you in operating.	0.55661744
Bind it tightly with bandages, leave it, and do not return to it.  Leave the stone and do not extract it, for the patient might die. Then treat the wound.  When the bleeding has subsided after a few days, and the area has become less inflamed, return to your work until you extract the stone.	If you are hindered by a haemorrhage and you know, by the spurting of the blood, that it comes from an artery that has been cut, then put styptic powder on the place and bind up tightly with bandages and leave it and do not come back to it; let the stone be and do not extract it, for often that loses the patient; then dress the wound. And after some days, when the acute haemorrhage has subsided and suppuration has set in, return to your operating until you get the stone out.	0.7622055

The varicose vein is simply a collection of moisture in the white membrane which is under the skin of the testicles surrounding the testicle and is called the scrotum. It may also be in its own special membrane which nature prepares on one side of the testicle.	A watery hernia is a collection of fluid in the white membrane lying beneath the skin surrounding the testicle, which is called the scrotum.	0.77652717
So that it is thought to be another testicle, and it is between the skin of the testicles and the white membrane which we mentioned.  This is rare.  This vein arises from a weakness affecting the spermatic cords, so this substance flows to them, and it may also arise from a blow to the spermatic cords.	Sometimes it has a capsule of its own which nature has formed alongside the testis so that one would think it another testicle; it may also form between the skin of the scrotum and the white membrane which we mentioned; however, this occurs very rarely. This hernia arises from a weakness occurring in the testicles and this matter drains into it; sometimes it happens from a blow upon the testicles.	0.7916039
This moisture is of many colors, either yellowish, or bloody red, or turbid black, or watery white, which is most common.  The signs by which it is known:	The fluid is of different colours, sometimes yellowish, sometimes blood-red, sometimes like lees, black, and sometimes the fluid is watery-pale; this actually is the commonest.	0.7811079
Where the water collects, if it is in the white membrane that we mentioned, the swelling is somewhat elongated and round, like the shape of a testicle, and the testicle does not appear because the moisture surrounds it on all sides.	Now these are the signs whereby we know where the fluid is collecting: if it be in the tunica albugínea, as we have said, the tumour will be round and slightly elongated like the shape of an egg. The testis is not apparent since the fluid hems it in all round.	0.72389543
And if the moisture is in its own membrane, then the swelling is round on one side of the testicle.	But if the fluid be contained in a capsule of its own the tumour will be round, to one side of the testicle; therefore one imagines that it is another testicle.	0.63361025
For this reason, one imagines that it is another testicle. And if the moisture is between the skin of the testicle and the white membrane, then it lies beneath the senses. As for if you want to know the color of the moisture, probe the swelling with the square probe whose image has been presented previously, and whatever comes out after the probe, judge by it what is inside.	If the fluid be situated between the skin of the scrotum and the tunica albugínea it will be obvious to the touch. If you wish to know the colour of the fluid, take a sample from the tumour by means of the four-sided exploring needle which has been figured previously; and by what comes out in the track of the explorer you may know the colour of the contained fluid.	0.73790973
When we proceed to treatment with iron, you should order the patient to be bled, if he can tolerate it and you see that his body is full. Then he should lie on his back on something slightly elevated and you place many cloths beneath him, then you sit on his left.	When we begin operative treatment the patient should be told to be venesected, if possible, if you see that he is of a plethoric bodily habit. Then let him lie on his back upon something a little raised, and have a heap of material placed beneath him.	0.7771268
And you order an assistant to sit on his right, extending his penis to one side of the scrotum and toward the side of the abdomen. Then you take a wide scalpel and incise the skin of the scrotum lengthwise from the middle to near the pubis.	Then sit down on his left side, and bid an assistant sit on his right side and draw out his penis toward one side or other of the scrotum and toward the hypogastrium. Then take a broad scalpel and make a longitudinal incision in the scrotum, from the middle almost to the pubes.	0.8752969
And make the incision in a straight line parallel to the line that divides the skin of the scrotum in half, until you reach the containing white membrane, then peel it back and take care not to cut it, and your peeling of it should be from the side that adheres more to the testicle. And continue the peeling as much as you can.	The incision should be straight, on a parallel with the median raphe of the scrotum, down to the tunica albuginea, and dissect away from it carefully lest you cut it. You should dissect chiefly on the side where the testicle is most adherent, and take your dissection as far as possible.	0.7030203
Then you open the water-filled membrane with a wide opening and remove all the water. Then separate the edges of the incision with hooks and pull the membrane upwards, but do not touch the containing skin of the testicle, and cut the membrane however you can cut it, either all at once or piece by piece.	Then open up the membrane containing the fluid with a wide perforation and draw off all the fluid. Then with hooks separate the two edges of the incision and draw the membrane upwards but do not touch the skin overlying the testes; then cut away the membrane in whatever way is possible, either as a whole or piecemeal, particularly the side piece; for unless you use the utmost diligence in cutting it away you cannot be certain that the fluid will not come back.	0.8631023
Especially its thin side, because if you do not completely cut it, you cannot prevent the water from returning. If the testicle protrudes out of its skin during your work, when you have finished cutting the membrane, return it, then bring the edges of the skin of the scrotum together with stitches.	If the testicle should protrude from its covering of skin while you are operating, return it when you have finished cutting the membrane; then bring together the two edges of your incision with a suture.	0.616717
Then treat it as you would treat other wounds until it heals. If you find the testicle has been corrupted by another disease, it is necessary to tie the vessels that are in the spermatic cord, fearing bleeding, then cut the testicle from the spermatic cord and remove the testicle, then treat it as we have mentioned.	Then dress with the usual dressings for wounds until healed. If you find the testicle corrupted by some other disease, you will have to tie off the vessels which are in the suspensor, for fear of haemorrhage. Then cut the testicle from the suspensor and remove it and dress as we said above.	0.8329924
If the collected water is in both sides, know that they are two hydroceles. So incise the other side as you did the first, similarly. And if it is possible for you to perform the operation as one, do so. Then wipe away the blood.	If the accumulation of fluid be on both sides you may know it to be a double hydrocele; so make another incision on the other side as you did for the first. If it is convenient for you to make one operation of it, do so.	0.8797435
And insert into the incisions wool that you have dipped in oil or rose oil, and place outside other wool that you have dipped in wine and oil and spread it over the testicles and the abdomen and place folded cloths on top, which are the compresses. And tie it from above with the bandage which has six ends in this way:	Then wipe away the blood and apply to the incisions wool that has been soaked in olive-oil or oil of roses and on that again more wool that has been soaked in wine and oil, and spread that over the testicles and over the hypogastrium; and over that again folded pieces of linen forming pads and bind them down with a bandage having six heads.	0.8010204
Then take two pieces of cloth, sew them together, and stuff them with carded wool in this manner, and make the straps that are tightened with it from cotton or damp wool and gather them by tightening them at the trouser belt, and one of the straps takes from the buttocks to the back.	Two pieces of cloth should be taken and sewn together and packed in between with carded wool to this pattern. The ends by means of which it is attached should be made of cotton or soft wool and should be drawn tight at the waist of the breeches.	0.81586623
And the second you take towards the pubis and the two ends on the thighs from below and the two remaining ends on the groins, and you gather all the tightening at the trouser belt.  This hydrocele can also be treated with cautery instead of incision with iron.	One of the ends you take over the seat toward the back: the second end you take toward the pubes, the two ends round the thighs below, and the remaining two ends over the groin, and the whole is bound up tight with the belt of the breeches. This rupture may also be treated by cautery instead of surgery.	0.7863809
Which is that you take a fine scalpel-shaped cautery and incise the skin of the testicle with it while it is hot as we have described until the white membrane containing the water is exposed, then take another cautery of this form:	This will mean taking a knife-edged cautery and cutting with it the skin of the testicles; it should be hot, as we told you before, and used until the white membrane covering the hydrocele be exposed. Then take another cautery of this type, which resembles the Greek letter tau; and with it perforate that membrane.	0.7509856
And it resembles the Greek eye, then you dab that membrane with it while it is hot until all the moisture comes out, then you stretch the membrane with hooks and peel off the containing layer with the cautery and cut it as much as you can until you remove it all and take care that the testicle is not touched by the fire.	Then take another cautery of this type, which resembles the Greek letter tau; and with it perforate that membrane. It should be hot so as to draw out all the humidity. Then stretch the membrane with hooks, dissect away the capsule with the cautery and cut it away as best you are able until you have completely removed it. But be careful that the heat do not touch the testicle.	0.7916672
And know that this procedure is safer and further from bleeding and better than the procedure with incision. If you encounter during the incision or during the cautery a hot swelling or bleeding or something else, then it is necessary that you treat whatever you encounter of that with the appropriate treatment as has been previously mentioned.	You should know that this operation is safer, further removed from the danger of haemorrhage, and better, than operation by incision. If, while operating either with the knife or the cautery, you are hindered by an inflammatory swelling or haemorrhage or anything else, you should deal with all of them by suitable treatment in accordance with what has been said before.	0.88167036
If the patient is cowardly and does not bear this procedure because of its unpleasantness, then let him use the dabbing as I will describe it, which is if it is deemed correct by you with the proofs we presented earlier.	If the patient be timid and will not suffer this operation on account of its unpleasantness, then treat by perforation as I shall now describe.	0.8004429
If the hydrocele is watery, then you should sit the patient on a high chair, then dab the swelling at its bottom with a wide scalpel, and make the dabbing along the body and make the opening wide so that all the water flows out, then place cotton on the area and bandage it.	When by the signs we have mentioned you are certain that the hernia is watery, you should seat the patient on a high chair and pierce the tumour in its lower part with a broad scalpel. The perforation should run in the long axis of the body, and it should be an ample opening to let all the fluid run out.	0.7632507
And leave it to drain the remaining water, then treat it until the wound heals. If the exit of the water is difficult while you are dabbing it, it is because the white membrane obstructs the mouth of the wound and prevents the exit of the water.	Then put cotton on the place and bind it on and leave it so as to soak up the rest of the fluid; then dress the wound until it heals.	0.5581242
Then it is necessary to insert into the wound a goose feather or the instrument with which the water of lovers is extracted, the image of which has been presented, or increase the opening of the wound a little.	But if the fluid fail to flow out when the opening is made, which would be due to the tunica albuginea's obtruding into the opening and preventing the outlet of the fluid, you should then introduce into the wound a goose-quill or an instrument such as is used for ascites, already described; or else the opening should be widened a little.	0.5757003
And know that the water may return and collect after six months or so. If it collects, dab it in the same manner and the patient should fend off its recurrence.	But you should know that after six months or so the fluid may come back and collect again; when it does so, perforate him in exactly the same manner; so will the patient prolong his life.	0.7771035

Chapter Sixty-Three.	CHAPTER SIXTY-THREE.	0.83822435
On the Incision of a Fleshy Vein and its Treatment.	On cutting for a fleshy hernia and its treatment.	0.8038471
Know that incising this vein is one of the errors leading to death in most cases, therefore, we recommend leaving it alone for safety.  However, I will describe the procedure on it and the types of swelling.	You should know that cutting for this kind of hernia has an uncertain outcome and in most cases results in death; and therefore I think it better to let it be and to safeguard the patient. However, I shall mention the manner of operating for this and all kinds of tumour.	0.7945523
I say that many swellings occur in the testicles, and this is due to many causes, either from a sharp humor flowing to the testicles or from a blow.  The color of the swelling is the same as the body's color and there is no fluid in it.	Now I say that many tumours arise from the bodies composing the testicles; and this from several causes. It may be from an acrid superfluity running down into the testicles, or from a blow. The colour of the tumour will be like that of the rest of the body and there is no water to it.	0.83155525
The swelling is hard, and sometimes the swelling is petrified, its color is dark, and it has no feeling.  It may be from a thickening and swelling of the arteries, as previously mentioned, or from swelling of the veins.  As for what comes from swelling of the arteries, this is known by the dissipation of the swelling.	The lump will be solid and often will be stony hard, of a dark colour, and without sensation. Sometimes also it arises from a knotting and inflation of the arteries, as has been mentioned, or from an inflation of the veins.	0.7898845
When you press it with your fingers, it should not change at all. As for what results from swelling of the veins, nothing dissipates from it when pressing with the fingers.  This type can be incised, as well as other fleshy (swellings).	The sort arising from a swelling of the arteries may be recognized by a dispersal of the lump when you press upon it with your fingers; this should not be interfered with at all. The sort arising from a swelling of the vein will not disperse when you press upon it with your fingers.	0.71283054
That is, you incise the skin of the testicle, then pull the testicle upwards and take it out of the white membrane, and free the spermatic cord from the vessels, tie the vessels, and cut the spermatic cord after you free it from every side of the testicle.  If the testicle has adhered to the proliferating tissue.	It is sometimes possible to cut down on this kind and also on the other fleshy tumours thus: make an incision in the skin of the testicles; then draw the testicle upward and out of the tunica albuginea, and free the suspensor from the vessels and tie the vessels, and cut the suspensor after you have freed it from all round the testicle.	0.6944716
It is necessary to remove the testicle and cut it off.  And if the adhesion is between some of the membranes or between the vessels, it is necessary to free all of that adhesion and cut it with a circular cut.	Should it happen that the testicle is adherent to the fleshy growth, you will have to cut away the testicle itself and remove it. But should the adhesion have formed somewhere inside the membranes or in the space between the vessels, then you must free the adhesion as a whole and cut it away with a circular incision.	0.8205507
If the fleshy growth is in the place of adhesion, which is from behind, it is necessary to cut all of it and remove the testicle, as we have said. When you have finished your work, pack the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and syrup, then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.	If the fleshy growth should be at the site of the junction which is behind, you will have to cut the whole thing away and remove the testicle as we have said. And when your operation is finished, pack the wound with wool moistened with oil of roses and wine; then dress in the usual manner until healed.	0.9048846

Chapter Sixty-Four.	CHAPTER SIXTY-FOUR.	0.83874613
On the treatment of hydrocele with varicocele.	On the treatment of hernia with varix.	0.7668234
Varicocele is a tortuous, somewhat twisted swelling, similar to a cluster of grapes, with relaxation of the testicles, and it makes movement, exercise, and walking difficult for the patient.  The treatment of this disease is nearly the same as what has been mentioned previously.	A varix is a twisted tumour resembling a cluster of grapes, with relaxation of the testicles, which makes movement and exercise and walking difficult for the patient. The treatment of this condition is of uncertain outcome, akin to those conditions just spoken of.	0.841189
However, it is necessary to describe the procedure as the ancients did. I say that it is necessary to sit the patient on a high chair, then push the scrotum downwards, then grasp the skin of the testicles with your fingers, along with the vessels that are close to the penis.	Nevertheless we must describe the operation for this condition as it was performed by the Ancients. So I begin by saying that you must have the patient sitting upon a high seat; then push down the suspensor of the testicles and take hold of the skin of the testicles with your fingers together with the blood-vessels near the penis; then let your assistant take hold instead of you and draw out strongly.	0.85453904
And let another assistant hold it and stretch it tautly. Then, with a wide, sharp scalpel, make an oblique incision next to the vessels until the vessels are exposed. Then dissect them from every side, as I described to you in the chapter on dissecting the arteries in the temples. Then insert a needle with a double thread through them.	Then with a broad sharp scalpel make an oblique incision in the direction of the vessels so that the vessels are laid bare. Then dissect on all sides in the same way as I told you for extracting the temporal vessels.	0.7304168
And tie them at the beginning of the places where the varicocele appears, and tie them also at the end.  Then cut them in the middle with an incision lengthwise along the body, and drain the turbid, corrupt humors that have collected in them.	Then run through them a needle doubly threaded and tie at the spot where the varix begins and tie it again where the varix ends, then cut through the varix in the middle with an incision at right angles to the length of the body and draw out the turbid corrupt humidity that has gathered in it.	0.7930449
Then treat the wound with the usual treatment for wounds that you want to suppurate so that the vessels that nourish one of the testicles fall off, and there is no harm in that. If the varicocele affects all the vessels, then it is necessary to remove one of the testicles with the vessels so that the testicle does not lose its nourishment. Because of cutting off the vessels, it withers and becomes useless.	Then dress the wound with the wound dressings usual where you wish to encourage suppuration, so that the vessels nourishing the one testicle may perish; there is no harm in that. But if all the vessels are varicose then you will have to remove one testicle with its vessels lest the testicle be deprived of nourishment through cutting into the vessels; for it will wither and be of no use.	0.8780068

Chapter Sixty-Five.	CHAPTER SIXTY-FIVE.	0.8407421
On the Treatment of Inguinal Hernia.	On the treatment of intestinal hernia.	0.8135176
This hernia occurs from a tear that happens in the peritoneum extending over the abdomen around the groins from the thin part of the abdomen, so the intestine falls from that rupture to one of the testicles.	This hernia is due to a split occurring in the membrane stretched from the hypogastrium over the belly in the region of the groin. Through this opening the bowel descends upon one of the testes; this opening is due to the membrane's splitting or stretching.	0.79747474
This rupture occurs either from a tear in the peritoneum or from its distension, and these two types occur from many causes, either a blow or a jump or a shout or lifting something heavy and so on. And its sign, if it is from distension of the peritoneum, is that it occurs little by little over a long period of time.	And these two kinds occur from a number of causes: from a blow or jumping or shouting, or lifting a heavy weight, or a similar cause. The symptoms of it, when it arises from a stretching of the membrane, are that it is a slow and chronic development and does not happen on a sudden, and the swelling is even and deep down, because the membrane is pressing the bowel.	0.7863195
And it does not happen suddenly, and the swelling is level towards the depth because the peritoneum constricts the intestine. And its sign, if it is from a tear in the peritoneum, is that it causes great pain from the beginning suddenly, and the swelling is different, appearing under the skin nearby.	When it is due to a split in the membrane, the signs will be that it starts with a sudden severe pain, and the lump varies in consistency, appearing close under the skin; that is due to the emergence of the bowel and its passage outside the membrane.	0.7401527
That is by the intestine exiting and going outside of the peritoneum, and the omentum may also exit with the intestine, so this hernia is called intestinal and omental, and it may be with air.  And the stool may run into the intestine and be trapped there, so it results in the death of the patient.	Sometimes also the omentum comes out with the bowel, and this hernia is called intestinal and omental; sometimes it contains wind. Sometimes also the excrement comes down with the bowel and gets held up there, and this involves the patient's death, for thence arises an intractable pain and borborygmi, specially when pressed upon.	0.78641516
Because it causes severe pain and rumbling, especially when squeezed, and treating these types of ailments with iron is dangerous, so you should avoid engaging in it. The method of operation is that you order the patient to return the intestine with his hand into his cavity if it is possible to return.	The treatment of the varieties of this disease with the knife is dangerous; so be cautious of rushing at it. The manner of operating is to bid the patient reduce the bowel back into the belly if it be disposed to return, then lie back before you and raise his legs.	0.71291083
Then he lies on his back between your hands and raises his legs, then you stretch the skin adjacent to the groin upwards and incise the entire skin of the testicle lengthwise, then you insert hooks in the lips of the incision to the extent needed to open the incision with them.	Then do you stretch upward the skin adjacent to the groin, and cut the whole length of the skin of the testicles; then attach to the edges of the incision as many hooks as are necessary to open the incision.	0.79302
And the incision should be as much as allows the testicle to come out, then you dissect the membranes that are under the skin of the testicle until, when the hard white peritoneum is exposed from all sides, then insert your index finger next to the testicle.	The incision should be sufficiently large to allow the testicle to be drawn out. Then dissect away the tissues that lie beneath the skin of the scrotum so that the hard tunica albugínea be exposed all round.	0.7059127
Between the white peritoneum that is under the skin of the testicle and between the second peritoneum, and with it you release the adhesion that is behind the testicle, then fold with the right hand inside the skin of the testicle, and with this you stretch the white peritoneum upwards with the left hand and raise the testicle with the peritoneum toward the incision.	Then introduce your forefinger in around the testis in the space between the white membrane beneath the skin of the testicle and the second membrane, and with your forefinger free the attachment at the back of the testicle.	0.7805083
And you order the assistant to stretch the testicle upwards, and you release the adhesion that is behind it completely, and you search with your finger lest there be something from the twisted intestine in the hard white peritoneum, and if you find something of it, then push it into the abdomen below.	Then with your right hand explore within the scrotum and fold back the covering of the testicles, at the same time stretching the tunica albugínea upwards with the left hand, and bring the testis with the membrane up into the opening, and bid your assistant to stretch the testis upwards; and do you fully free it from the posterior attachment.	0.65082026
Then you take a needle containing a thick thread spun from ten threads and insert it at the end of the peritoneum that is under the skin of the testicle adjacent to the incision, then you cut the ends of the doubled thread so that there are four threads. Then you arrange them on top of each other in a crossed manner and tie with them the peritoneum that we said is under the skin of the testicle, a tight knot from two sides, then you also wrap the ends of the threads and tie them tightly so that none of the vessels that nourish it are able to reach it. So that a hot swelling does not arise from that, and it also becomes a second ligature outside the first ligature, distant from it less than two fingers, and after these two ligatures, you leave from the peritoneum that is under the skin of the testicle the amount of a finger's breadth.	Feel with your finger that there be no part of the intestine that has got twisted within the tough white membrane; and should you find any push it back into the abdomen. Then take a needle with a stout tenfold thread and enter it near the end of the membrane which lies beneath the skin of the testicles alongside the rupture; then cut the end of the loop of thread to make four sutures and arrange one over the other in the form of a cross; and with these ligate the membrane of which we have spoken with a strong ligature on each side; then twist the ends of the thread and tie them with a strong knot to prevent anything from reaching the nutrient vessels of the testicles, lest an abscess occur thereby; and make also another ligature outside the first one, rather less than two fingers' breadth from it; and after making these two ligatures leave a finger's breadth of the membrane that is beneath the skin of the testicles and cut the rest away round, and with it remove the testis.	0.8952336
So that a hot swelling does not arise from that, and it also becomes a second ligature outside the first ligature, distant from it less than two fingers, and after these two ligatures, you leave from the peritoneum that is under the skin of the testicle the amount of a finger's breadth. And you cut all the rest around it and remove the testicle with it, then you make an incision below the skin of the testicle, an incision from which blood and pus flow, as we described previously, then use wool dipped in oil and place it in the wound and use the bandage that we described.	Then take a needle with a stout tenfold thread and enter it near the end of the membrane which lies beneath the skin of the testicles alongside the rupture; then cut the end of the loop of thread to make four sutures and arrange one over the other in the form of a cross; and with these ligate the membrane of which we have spoken with a strong ligature on each side; then twist the ends of the thread and tie them with a strong knot to prevent anything from reaching the nutrient vessels of the testicles, lest an abscess occur thereby; and make also another ligature outside the first one, rather less than two fingers' breadth from it; and after making these two ligatures leave a finger's breadth of the membrane that is beneath the skin of the testicles and cut the rest away round, and with it remove the testis. Then make a counter-incision in the lower part of the skin of the testicles, to let the blood and matter drain away as we bade you before.	0.7868546
And the white peritoneum that we mentioned may be cauterized after cutting it, to prevent bleeding, as that often occurs, and leave the ligature until it falls off by itself; if its falling is delayed, then it should be moistened with hot water and something that makes it sweat should be applied to it until it falls off.	Then apply wool soaked in oil to the wound, and the bandage that we prescribed (sometimes also the white membrane that we spoke about is cauterized after the incision to forestall haemorrhage, for that usually happens) and let the ligatures be until they fall away spontaneously. If they are slow in coming away, then foment with hot water and apply something to sweat them off.	0.76478785
Then the wound is treated with the rest of the treatment for wounds until it heals.	Then dress the wound in the usual manner until it heals.	0.72959214

On the varicose vein.  This varicose vein, I have not seen anyone dare to treat it with iron. The ancients mentioned that it should be done as we described for the vein that is with the scrotum, that is, that the vessels should be tied gently below, after the incision on them.	On flatulent hernia. I have not seen anyone pluck up enough courage to attempt the operative treatment of this kind of rupture. The Ancients indeed said it ought to be done in the same way as hernia with varicocele; namely, to ligate the blood-vessels after cutting down upon them, gently, and lower down.	0.79156566
Then it is incised in the middle, and the swelling is treated with what opens it until the vessels fall off, and the wound is treated as we mentioned until it heals.	Then make an incision in the middle and apply to the tumour such things as will keep it open until the blood-vessels fall away. And dress the wound in the manner we have already mentioned until it heals.	0.8227014

Chapter Sixty-Seven.	CHAPTER SIXTY-SEVEN.	0.85809934
On the hernia that is in the groin.	On the treatment of the rupture that occurs in the groin.	0.6476687
A hernia may occur in the groin, as we have said, and the place swells but nothing of the intestine descends into the testicles. And if it does descend, it is a small amount and returns at all times.	Sometimes there occurs a rupture in the groin as we have said, and the part protrudes. No portion of the intestine descends into the scrotum; or if anything it will be only a tiny portion and will reduce at any time.	0.761812
But if it continues for a long time, the tear in the peritoneum increases until the intestine and omentum descend into the scrotum, and this happens from the extension of the peritoneum that is in the groin, as we have said. That is, the peritoneum stretches and then relaxes, and the place swells and protrudes, and its treatment is with cautery, as I have previously described.	But if it goes on for a long time the rupture in the membrane increases until the bowel and omentum descend into the scrotum. It arises from a stretching of the membrane in the groin, as we said; the membrane stretches and then relaxes and the place swells. Its treatment by the cautery is as I have already described.	0.9145847
It can also be treated with iron in this way: The patient lies on his back in your hands, then you incise the swollen, protruding hernia transversely for a length of three fingers, then you pack the peritoneal layers that are under the skin.	Sometimes also it is treated with the knife in this manner: With the patient lying back before you, make an incision three fingers wide, transversely across the swelling of the rupture which projects.	0.7352569
Until the white peritoneum underneath it is exposed, then you take a probe and place it on the protruding part of the peritoneum and press it into the depth of the abdomen, then sew the two protruding parts on the edge of the probe from the peritoneum and attach one to the other with the stitching.	Then perforate the subcutaneous tissues so as to expose the white membrane that lies under the skin alongside the rupture. Take a probe and place it upon the projecting part of the fascia and push it back into the depths of the abdomen. Then sew together the two swollen portions of membrane over the end of the probe and suture the one to the other.	0.74421954
Then remove the tip of the probe and do not cut the peritoneum at all, nor touch the testicle or anything else, as I have instructed you in the treatment of intestinal hernia, then treat it with the treatment of wounds.	Then take out the probe. On no account make the incision into the fascia nor touch the testis nor anything else, as I taught you on the subject of treating the intestinal hernia.	0.8238087
When the sutures have dissolved, clean it and dress the wound until it heals, for the peritoneum contracts and the hernia protrusion does not increase.	Then dress the wound, and when the stitches come apart remove them and bandage the wound again until it is healed over. For the membrane will draw together and the rupture will not come out again.	0.6447258
Cauterization is better in this area because it is closer to a cure.	But the cautery is better at this spot, for it is safer.	0.6111822

On the Relaxation of the Scrotum.	On the loosening of the skin of the scrotum.	0.76425207
Often the skin of the scrotum relaxes in some people without the flesh inside it relaxing, and its appearance becomes unsightly.  So, whoever wishes to treat it should have the patient lie on his back.	In some men there often occurs a loosening of the skin of the scrotum without any loosening of the organs within. This has a horrible appearance. He who desires to treat this condition should make the patient lie on his back; and he should cut away all the loose skin that is over and above the normal.	0.76548696
And he cuts all the skin that has relaxed to the thick skin, then brings the two edges together. And if you wish, first sew the excess relaxed skin with three or four stitches and make sure of the stitching, then cut between the stitches.	Then he should bring together the two edges of the incision with a suture. Or, if you prefer, first suture the excess of loose skin together, with three or four stitches, and make the suture firm. Then cut away what is taken up between the stitches.	0.8475715
Then treat it with the treatment of all other wounds until it heals and the stitches fall out.	Then dress the wound with the usual dressings till it heals and the stitches come away.	0.74427986

On Castration.	On castration.	0.8808354
Castration is forbidden in our religion.	Castration is forbidden in our law and I ought therefore to make no mention of it in my book.	0.605556
Therefore, it would have been fitting for me not to mention it in this book of mine, but I mentioned it for two reasons: one is so that it may be within the physician's knowledge if he is asked about it and so that he knows the treatment for anyone afflicted by it, and the other reason is that we often need to castrate some animals for our benefit.	But I must speak of it for two reasons. One reason is that it should be part of the doctor's medical knowledge when asked about it, and that he should know how to treat anyone whom it befalls. Another reason is that often we need to castrate certain animals for the sake of the benefits that accrue from them, such as rams, he-goats and cats, and such animals.	0.7908803
Like lambs, goats, cats, and other such animals.  I say that castration is of two types: either by crushing or by incision and cutting. The one that is by crushing, the way to perform it is that we sit the animal in hot water until its testicles relax, soften, and hang down.	Another reason is that often we need to castrate certain animals for the sake of the benefits that accrue from them, such as rams, he-goats and cats, and such animals. So I say that castration can be performed in two ways: either by contusion; or by opening up and cutting away. The method by contusion is that we make the animal sit in warm water until his testes are relaxed and become soft and pendent; then rub them with your hand until they are so loosened that they are no longer palpable.	0.81555414
Then you crush them with your hand until they dissolve and cannot be discerned by touch. As for castration by incision and cutting, it is necessary to hold the animal and squeeze the skin of its testicles with the left hand, then tie the spermatic cords and make one incision on each testicle.	As to castration by open operation and excision, the animal should be held and pressure put upon the scrotum with the left hand. Then tie the spermatic cord and with one incision cut down upon both testicles so that both are brought up out of the scrotum.	0.73602945
So that when the testicles protrude, you cut them after peeling them, and leave nothing of the membranes on them except the thin membrane that is on the vessels.  This type of castration is better than the one that is by crushing.	After dissecting them away cut them off; do not leave any of the coverings upon them except the thin membrane covering the vessels.	0.6932595
Because crushing may leave something of the testicles, so the animal desires intercourse. Then treat the wound until it heals.	This manner of castration is better than the contusion method, for contusion often leaves something of the testicles, and the animal desires to couple. Then dress the wound until healed.	0.68145657

On the Treatment of the Hermaphrodite.	On the treatment of the hermaphrodite.	0.94652104
Hermaphroditism occurs in men in two ways: one is that there appears below the perineum or in the scrotum's skin between the two testicles a form as if it were a woman's vulva, with hair in it. And urine may flow from the one that is in the scrotum's skin.	There are two kinds of male hermaphrodite: one has the appearance as of female pudenda with hair in the region of the perineum; the other has the same in the skin of the scrotum between the testes. Sometimes also urine is excreted through that which is in the skin of the scrotum.	0.86783266
As for in women, it is of one type, and it is above the vulva on the pubis, like very small male testicles, protruding outward, one of them as if it were a man's penis, and the two like testicles. And the treatment of the three types...	There is also one kind among women, in which there is, above the female pudenda, on the pubes, what resembles the male organs. These are small indeed, but protuberant, one being like the penis and the two others like testicles.	0.78860277
The two types in men and the one type in women, it is necessary to cut off those excess growths until their trace is obliterated, then treat them with the treatment of all other wounds until they heal. As for the second type in men, from which urine comes out, the one that is in the scrotum's skin, there is no treatment for it, nor any hope of recovery at all.	This is the treatment of all three kinds, that is, two male and one female: the superfluous growths must be cut away so that every trace is destroyed; then the usual treatment for wounds should be applied until they are healed. As to the second kind, in man, where the opening is in the scrotum and the urine runs out of it, there is no operation for this, and no cure.	0.8443023

On the Excision of the Clitoris and Excess Flesh Protruding from Women's Genitalia.	On cutting the clitoris and fleshy growths in the female genitalia.	0.7165396
The clitoris sometimes increases in size beyond the natural state, so that its appearance becomes unpleasant and ugly. And it may enlarge in some women until it spreads out like men's, and becomes suitable for intercourse.	The clitoris may grow in size above the order of nature so that it gets a horrible deformed appearance; in some women it becomes erect like the male organ and attains to coitus.	0.84451497
It is necessary that you grasp the excess of the clitoris with your hand or with a hook and cut it. Do not go deep in cutting, especially at the root of it, lest bleeding occurs.	You must grasp the growth with your hand or a hook and cut it off. Do not cut too deeply, especially at the root of the growth, lest haemorrhage occur.	0.84532195
Then treat it with the treatment of wounds until it heals. As for the protruding flesh, it is flesh that grows at the mouth of the womb until it fills it.	Then apply the usual dressing for wounds until it is healed.	0.4716024
And sometimes it protrudes outward like a tail. Therefore some of the ancients called this ailment "the tail disease." So it is necessary that you cut it just as you cut the clitoris and treat it until it heals.	As to the fleshy growth, that is, flesh growing in the cervix and filling it, and also often protruding like a tail (on which account some of the Ancients called it 'caudate disease'); this too you should cut away as you do for the clitoris, and dress until healed.	0.6801709

On the Treatment of Imperforate Anus	On the treatment of unperforated female pudenda.	0.64018106
Imperforate anus is when the woman's vulva is not perforated or the opening is small. This can either be congenital, something she is born with, or accidental. The accidental type occurs due to a preceding cause, and it results from excess, protruding flesh.	This condition is when a woman's pudenda have no opening or have only a tiny opening; it may be either congenital or acquired. The acquired sort is due to some preceding disease; either to a fleshy growth or to a membrane, thick or thin.	0.77814806
Or a thin or thick membrane, and it may be in the depths of the uterus, or in its sides, or in its top or bottom.  It prevents intercourse, conception, and childbirth, and sometimes it prevents menstruation.  Knowledge of it is through examination by the midwife.	It may be in the fundus of the uterus or in its walls or in the upper part or in the lower part; and it prevents intercourse, conception, and delivery; it often also hinders the menses. This is recognized by inspection by the midwife, if the obstruction be obvious and low.	0.8570446
If the obstruction is apparent and near, (treat it). If it is not apparent, then examine it with your fingers or with a probe. If the obstruction is of a thin membrane and it is near the labia, then immediately perforate it. That is, you should place something like supports on the labia, then place both of your thumbs.	But if it be not visible she should palpate with her fingers or with a probe. And when the obstruction is due to a thin membrane near the labia you should lose no time in breaking it down. This is done by applying some sort of pad to the labia; then put both thumbs upon it.	0.7456257
With the woman on her back and her legs spread apart, then stretch the labia forcefully until the thin membrane ruptures and the obstruction opens. Then take some wool, soak it in oil, and place it on the area. Have the woman engage in intercourse every day so that the area does not rejoin.	The woman should be upon her back with her legs spread wide apart; then the labia are to be stretched strongly till the thin membrane is ruptured and the obstruction is laid open. Then take wool soaked in oil and apply to the place, and let the woman engage in coitus every day lest the place close over.	0.90419674
If the membrane is thick and dense, it should be incised with a wide scalpel resembling an ace of spades. If the obstruction is from protruding flesh, grasp it with hooks and cut it. You should have with you medications that stop bleeding without stinging, such as acacia, dragon's blood, and frankincense, mixed with egg white.	If the membrane be thick and strong you should incise it with a broad myrtle-leaf scalpel. But if the obstruction be due to a growth you should catch hold of it with two hooks and cut it away. And have at hand remedies for allaying haemorrhage without pain, such as acacia and dragon's blood and olibanum, all mixed with egg-white.	0.7988554
Then use a wide lead tube so that the wound does not heal quickly; keep it in for several days.  Use a wick of dry linen. Then treat it with other wound-healing treatments until it is cured.  Another fleshy growth may occur in the uterus; it should be cut in this same manner.	Then use a cannula of lead to prevent the wound healing up too quickly. She should keep it in position for some days and employ a bandage of dry linen. Then treat with the usual healing dressings until it heals.	0.8233316
Unless it is a cancerous tumor, for a cancerous tumor that occurs in the uterus should never be touched with an iron instrument.	Sometimes other growths of flesh arise in the uterus itself; you should cut away in this manner all except cancerous tumours; for a cancerous tumour arising in the uterus is under no circumstance to be treated with the knife.	0.6111208

On the Treatment of Hemorrhoids, Warts, and Red Pustules That Occur in Women's Genitals.	On the treatment of haemorrhoids and warts and red pustules arising in the female pudenda.	0.8699041
Hemorrhoids are the swelling of the openings of veins until much blood constantly flows from them. When hemorrhoids become chronic, they turn into warts. I have mentioned their types and signs in the classification, and we will mention them here.	Haemorrhoids are an inflation of the heads of the blood-vessels leading to abundant and constant bleeding. When haemorrhoids are chronic they turn into warts. I have already mentioned in their place the kinds of wart and their symptoms.	0.8815478
What can be treated and what cannot be treated. I say that hemorrhoids and warts, if they are deep in the uterus and cannot be felt, cannot be treated with an iron instrument. Those that are at the mouth of the uterus and can be felt are the ones that can be treated.	Now here I shall say which kinds permit of treatment and which do not. I begin by stating that haemorrhoids and warts in the depths of the uterus that are not palpable are not able to be treated operatively. Those at the orifice that are palpable you can treat.	0.75024325
The woman should enter a cool room, then stretch the warts with forceps or a coarse cloth and cut them from their roots. Then, when the blood flows, sprinkle on them one of the styptic powders that stops bleeding without cauterization.	So you should get the woman into a cool place and then draw on the warts with forceps or catch hold with pieces of rough cloth, and cut them away from the roots. Then if that cause a flow of blood sprinkle with one or other of the powders that stop bleeding but are not corrosive, such as acacia or dragon's blood or olibanum or the like.	0.7212924
Such as acacia, dragon's blood, frankincense, and the like. Then raise her legs against the wall for an hour, then lower them into cold water. If the bleeding continues, have her sit in a decoction of sumac, pomegranate peels, gallnuts, and the like. Then take barley flour and knead it with honey and vinegar.	Then if that cause a flow of blood sprinkle with one or other of the powders that stop bleeding but are not corrosive, such as acacia or dragon's blood or olibanum or the like. Then raise her legs up against the wall for a while and then bring them down into cold water. And if the haemorrhage persist for a long time make her sit in an infusion of sumac and pomegranate rind and oak-galls and the like. Then take barley flour and beat it up with honey and vinegar, and apply to the back a plaster made of this.	0.83559823
And apply it as a poultice on her back. If the bleeding stops, then good. Otherwise, apply cupping to the back and breasts without scarification. Then take cotton and soak it in the juice of purslane or the juice of plantain or the juice of blackberry branches with a decoction of gallnuts and apply it to the area.	And if the bleeding cease, good; but if not, apply to the loins and breasts cupping-vessels without scarifying. Then take wool and dip it in the juice of red cynomorium or plantain or wild eglantine, together with syrup of oak galls, and apply to the place.	0.7708417
When the swelling subsides, treat the area with the ointment until it heals. As for the red pustule, it resembles the tips of nettles, rough in appearance.  You should cut off what appears of it in the same way as I mentioned for warts, and treat it until it heals.	And when the swelling has subsided treat the place with ointment until it heals. Now red pustules resemble the heads of thyme, and are of rough appearance. All that appears on the surface should be cut away in the manner mentioned for treating warts; and dress the wounds until healed.	0.86127603

On lancing the abscess that occurs in the uterus.	On the perforation of eruptions occurring in the uterus.	0.8640821
Many types of tumors may occur in the uterus, such as cancer, the hardened tumor, ulcers, abscesses, corroding ulcers, fistulas, hemorrhoids, fissures, warts, and the hot tumor.  I have mentioned all of these diseases and their types and signs in the classification.	From time to time there occur in the womb various kinds of tumour, such as cancer and the stony tumour and ulcer and abscess and gangrene and fistulae and varicosities and cracks and warts and inflamed tumours; all these diseases I have mentioned, with their varieties and their symptoms, in the appropriate section.	0.8134093
We should mention in this section the hot tumor that occurs in the uterus if it is among the tumors that collect over time how its lancing with iron is done. You should observe, if the pain of the tumor in its beginning is acute with throbbing, inflammation, and fever.	But now in this treatise we must mention an inflamed tumour of the kind where there is a collection of pus, and the manner of its opening with the knife.	0.57199436
And you see it red, if the sensation falls upon it, do not rush to lance it, and treat it with what helps it ripen until, when these symptoms subside, then you should sit the woman on a chair with two seats and have her lean back.	You should inspect it, and if the pain of the tumour is acute from the outset, with pulsation and inflammation and fever, and, if it is visible, you see that it is red, then do not be in a hurry to open, but treat it with applications helpful for suppuration till these symptoms have subsided. Then you should get the patient to sit in a chair having a double seat, lying back.	0.699103
And she brings her legs together towards the lower abdomen and her thighs are spread apart, and her arms are placed under her knees, and you tie them with a suitable bandage.	She should put her feet together upon her abdomen, with the thighs apart and the arms joined under the knees and bound together in a suitable manner.	0.7940475
For this, then the midwife sits on the right side and uses the instrument with which the opening of the uterus is opened, whose image will come later. It is necessary, if you want to use this instrument, that you estimate with a probe the depth of the woman's uterus, lest what enters from the instrument be more than the depth of the uterus.	Then the midwife should sit on the right side and employ the instrument for opening the orifice of the womb, which will be described later.	0.7093766
It would harm the patient, so if the instrument is longer than the depth, it is necessary to place supports on the lip of the cervix to prevent the entire instrument from entering the depth of the uterus, and it is necessary for the screw that runs in the instrument to be on the upper side.	When you are going to use this instrument, you should measure with a probe the depth of the womb so that the instrument be not introduced beyond this measure lest the patient be harmed; if the instrument be longer, pads should be put over the rim of the cervix to prevent the passage of its whole length.	0.7410451
And you hold the instrument and the assistant turns the screw until the cervix opens. So when the abscess appears and is touched by the hand, and it is soft and thin, then it should be incised at its head with a wide scalpel when the entire period has been completed.	You must put the screw that runs in the instrument, in from the top and hold the instrument while your assistant turns the screw until the entrance of the uterus is opened. When the abscess is exposed, and on manual palpation is found to be thin and soft, you should make an incision at its head with a broad scalpel.	0.8183811
It is necessary to place in the wound a soft wick dipped in rose oil or green oil with some astringent, and the wick extends from the incision in the cervix, and on the outside, on the uterus and on the pubis, place clean wool dipped in water in which mallow has been boiled.	And when all the matter is evacuated you should place on the wound a soft wick soaked in oil of roses or green oil with some styptic quality, and let it come outside from the incision into the cervix uteri. Over the area of the uterus and pubes there should be clean wool soaked in an infusion of mallows.	0.79521215
Then treat after two days with the ointment suitable for it until it heals.	Then after two days dress with a suitable ointment until healed.	0.93142295
The uterus and the wound may be washed by injecting with water and honey, then with water in which licorice root or long birthwort has been boiled, then return to the ointment if the abscess is hidden inside the uterus.	Sometimes also both the wound and the uterus are washed out with a douche of honey and water, then of a decoction of liquorice root or long aristolochy; then go back to the ointment.	0.7345108
It is necessary to refrain from treating it with iron, but rather treat it with what we mentioned in the chapter on incisions.	But if the lesion be hidden in the depths of the womb then you will have to abstain from operative treatment but carry out treatment as spoken of in its place.	0.4814868

On teaching midwives how to treat living fetuses if they come out in an unnatural form.	On the training of midwives in how to treat living foetuses when not brought forth in the natural manner.	0.8981301
The midwife should first know the form of a natural birth. Its signs are when you see the woman pushing downwards, desiring to smell the air, and feeling relief from her labor pains.	To begin with, the midwife must know the manner of normal labour. Among the signs of it are these.	0.5762905
And the exit of the fetus is quick. Know that this birth will be in the natural form, and its exit will be headfirst, with the placenta either with it or hanging from its umbilical cord. So if you see these signs, it is necessary to press her abdomen so that the fetus comes out quickly.	If you see the woman strain her abdomen and desire to breathe more air, and the pangs come easily to her and she hastens to deliver the child, by this you may know that the labour will follow a natural course and that the presentation will be vertex with the afterbirth, either together with the child or hanging by the umbilical cord. And when you observe these signs it will be necessary to put pressure upon the abdomen to bring forth the foetus quickly.	0.7797982
For if it descends headfirst, the placenta descends with it and she is cleansed well of those excesses. Any birth other than this is unnatural and undesirable, because the fetus may come out feet first, or its hands may come out before its head and feet.	For when it presents the vertex the afterbirth comes down with it and she is thoroughly cleansed of those superfluities. But a delivery that is contrary to this is unnatural and wrong. Sometimes the infant is delivered by its feet; or by its hands before either head or feet; or a single hand or foot; or the head comes out together with a foot.	0.80272835
Or one hand or one foot may come out, or its head and hand may come out, or it may come out folded, and perhaps it is turned on its back, and similar undesirable forms.  So it is necessary for the midwife to be skillful and gentle with all these things, and to beware of slips and errors.	Or it comes out all twisted, often with the nape of the neck first; or in other wrong positions. So the midwife must have wisdom and dexterity and be skilled in all these cases and beware of failures and mistakes.	0.72187614
And I will explain each of its forms and the remedy for it, so that you may be guided by it and understand it.  If the fetus comes out headfirst, the natural way, and that is difficult for the woman and labor is hard on her, and you see that her strength has weakened, then sit her on a chair and order women to hold her steady.	I shall explain the technique in these modes of delivery so that she may be instructed and may be acquainted with them all. When the foetus comes out by the vertex in the normal manner and yet the delivery is with great difficulty for the woman and you see that her strength is getting exhausted, then make her sit on a seat and have her held firmly, and foment her womb in a decoction of fenugreek and in bland oils.	0.7882502
And apply a poultice of cooked fenugreek and moist oils to her womb. Then the midwife inserts a small scalpel between her fingers and cuts the placenta with it, or cuts it with her fingernail, so that the moisture in it flows out. And she presses the woman's abdomen until the fetus descends.	Then the midwife should take between two fingers a little scalpel and make an incision in the foetal membrane or open it with the finger nail, to allow the contained waters to flow out; and put pressure upon the woman's abdomen until the foetus comes down.	0.78303444
If it does not descend, it is necessary to inject the woman with fenugreek mucilage and rose oil. Then, after the injection, order her to strain and make her sneeze with pellitory, and hold her mouth and nose, for the fetus will come out immediately. If the hands of the fetus come out first, it is necessary to push them back gently, little by little.	But if it will not come down then the woman should have an enema of mucilage of fenugreek with oil of sesame. Then bid her bear down after the enema, and with ptarmica stimulate her to sneeze; and close her mouth and nose for a while and the foetus will quickly come out.	0.8218765
If they cannot be pushed back in, place the woman on a platform and raise her legs upwards, then shake the platform on the ground, and the woman holds on so that she does not fall when shaking. If the hands do not go in and the fetus dies, cut them off and pull the rest of the fetus.	If the hands of the foetus present, you should slowly and gently push them back; and if they will not go back then place the woman upon a seat, have her feet raised and meanwhile shake the seat; but the woman should be held lest the shaking cause her to fall off. But if the two hands will not go back and the foetus is dead cut them off and draw out the remains.	0.8078676
Or tie its hands with a cloth and pull them moderately, for it will come out.  The exit of the fetus on its feet: If the fetus comes out feet first, it is necessary to push them upwards, then turn the fetus little by little until you straighten it. Then take one of its legs and pull it little by little.	Or tie tapes to the hands and pull on them evenly and it will come out. Foot presentation: when the foetus presents feet first you should raise them both; then you should very gently turn the foetus so as to straighten it. Then take one of its feet and stretch it gently.	0.8552437
When they have come out to the thighs, order her to strain and make her sneeze with pellitory, for it will come out. If it does not come out as we have described, then return the fetus little by little until you return it to its natural form, for it will then come out smoothly. If it is retained despite all we have described.	When they come down as far as the hips, bid her bear down, make her sneeze with ptarmica, and it will come out. But if it will not come out with these means we have described, you should return the foetus gently until you have placed it in the natural position; then it will come out easily.	0.81461024
Take marshmallow root mucilage, fenugreek mucilage, rose oil, and dissolved gum, and beat it all together well in a mortar. Then apply it to the woman's vulva and lower abdomen, then sit her in lukewarm water up to the hips.	But if it defies all that we have described, take mucilage of marsh mallow and fenugreek and oil of sesame and dissolved gum, and pound them all well together in the mortar and anoint the woman's pudenda and lower abdomen; then make her sit down in warm water reaching to the costal margin.	0.8138712
When you see that her lower part has softened, make a pessary of myrrh for her, which she can tolerate. When she has held the pessary for an hour, seat her on a birthing chair, then make her sneeze and close her mouth and nose, and gently squeeze her lower abdomen, for the fetus will come out immediately. The exit of the fetus on its knees and hands.	And when you see the lower parts are softened, make a suppository of myrrh and let her introduce it; and when she has had the suppository in for a while make her sneeze, stopping her nose and mouth; and press gently upon the abdomen; then will the foetus immediately emerge.	0.80124867
And tell the woman to strain until the fetus comes out. The exit of the fetus transversely, with one of its hands hanging out. Maneuver to return its hand. If you cannot return it, have the woman stand up and make her walk. If she cannot walk, have her lie down on...	Presentation by the side with one hand hanging down: attempt to manœuvre the hand back again; but if you cannot reduce it then make the woman stand up and walk. But if she cannot walk then have her lie on a couch, and agitate her feet violently.	0.75158054
her bed and shake her legs vigorously. Then use the poultice I described from the saliva-inducing agents. If labor pains take her, seat her on a birthing chair. Then work on returning the hand and adjusting the fetus to its natural position. Make the woman sneeze and tell her to strain until it comes out.	But if she cannot walk then have her lie on a couch, and agitate her feet violently. Then employ the ointment which I described among the mucilages. If parturition begins, make her sit upon a seat and attempt the reduction of the hand and version of the foetus to the natural position, and make the woman sneeze and bear down until the child is born.	0.81488776
The exit of the fetus on its back, extending its arms, with its face towards its mother's back. The midwife should grasp the hand of the fetus and then turn it little by little and adjust it gently. Once adjusted, apply to the vulva what we described of the ointment and saliva-inducing agents.	Presentation on the back, with hands outstretched and face towards the mother's back: the midwife should take the infant's hand and then turn him very slowly, and gently rectify his position. Then when he is in the correct position apply to the maternal passage the oil and mucilage prescribed.	0.8142134
Then tell her to move little by little. When she has done that, sit her on the chair and tell her to lean towards the right side. Then tell her to push and make her sneeze with the kalamus, as it will come out.  The exit of the fetus upright on its side.	Then bid the woman move gently and when she has done so make her sit down upon a seat and bid her lean over to her right side; then bid her bear down, and with ptarmica make her sneeze ; then the foetus will come forth.	0.8083837
If it descends to the opening of the uterus in this manner with the placenta, tear the placenta with your fingernail so that it releases the fluid. If it adheres to the face and neck of the fetus, cut it from the umbilical cord so that it does not suffocate and die. Then push the fetus back inside until you position it as it should be.	The foetus presenting laterally, doubled up : when it presents at the os in this manner together with the membrane, open the membrane with your finger nail and let out the waters. And if it adhere over the infant's face and neck, cut it away from the umbilicus lest he be strangled and die.	0.7549168
And tell the woman to push repeatedly, for it will come out easily. The exit of twins or multiple fetuses. Know that twins are often born, and sometimes three or four are born and live, although that is rare. As for five, it is something outside of nature; they do not live at all.	Then push the foetus back till it is in the proper position, and bid the woman bear down a few times until the foetus comes forth. The birth of twin or multiple foetuses: you should know that it is a common occurrence for twins to be born alive, and sometimes three or four infants, but this is a rarity; while five after this manner is altogether unnatural and they never live.	0.81690496
And a single placenta surrounds them, however many there are, and they are separated by a dividing membrane between them, connected to the umbilical cord of each one of them. And they may come out just as a single fetus comes out, with a natural, easy exit, and they may come out with a problematic exit, as we have described.	Although they may be more than one, they are enveloped in a single membrane but separated one from the other by a dividing membrane joined to the umbilicus of each one. And when they are born they may come in the natural easy manner of a single foetus; or by any abnormal presentation such as we have described.	0.7957643
If one of them has difficulty during birth and becomes one of the unnatural forms we mentioned, treat it as we have described. And let the midwife be gentle and do what she does with gentleness and patience. And let her manage each form with whatever appropriate technique she can to achieve a safe outcome.	And if one of them be born with difficulty, presenting in some unnatural manner as described, the treatment is also as described. Let the midwife be delicate and do whatever she does gently and calmly, adopting in each case whatever technique it demands that will conduce to a safe result.	0.91028017
Mention of what is conceived in the uterus of fetuses that are miscarried.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and more than ten may be conceived in the uterus. It has been confirmed to me that a woman miscarried seven and another fifteen, all of them conceived.	A note on the foetuses that may be formed in the womb and abort. Sometimes in the womb there may form one or two or three or four or five or six or seven or more than ten. And I can vouch that one woman had an abortion of seven foetuses and another woman of fifteen, all of them formed.	0.88437283
By the decree of the Mighty, the Knowing. All of this should be in the midwife's knowledge, for perhaps she will encounter something like this someday, so she can deal with it appropriately.	This is by the decree of the Almighty, the Wise. And all this should be part of the midwife's knowledge, for one day she may meet such a case and she must deal with it in the proper way.	0.8619584

On extracting the dead fetus.	On the extraction of the dead foetus.	0.9557867
If you treat the dead fetus with what I mentioned in the section on treatment and it does not come out, and the matter compels you to work with the hand, then you should observe. If the woman is of sound strength and there are no symptoms that you fear will cause her harm, then the woman should lie down on a bed on her back.	When you have dealt with a dead foetus by those methods mentioned in their chapter, and it does not come out, and you are compelled to operate, you should examine to see if the woman be in a healthy state and not having any disease on account of which you might entertain a fear for her life.	0.7626336
And her head should be inclined downward and her legs elevated, and an assistant should hold her on both sides, or she should be tied to the bed so that her body is not pulled when the fetus is extended.	The woman should lie on her back on a couch, her head tilted back and her legs raised. An assistant on either side should hold her down firmly or she should be bound down to the couch, lest the body be drawn out of position in extracting the foetus.	0.81905407
Then the mouth of her womb is moistened with moist oils along with marshmallow mucilage, fenugreek, and flax seeds.  Then the midwife anoints her hand with these oils and mucilages, then inserts it gently into the womb. Then she searches for a place to insert the hooks into the fetus, and suitable places for that.	Then the opening should be anointed with moistening oils and with mucilage of marsh mallow and fenugreek and with linseed. Then the midwife should anoint her hand with these oils and mucilages and gently introduce it into the vagina and with it locate a place in the foetus to fix hooks in.	0.8707886
Observe, if the fetus is coming headfirst, then insert the hooks into its eyes, or into the nape of its neck, or in its mouth, or in its palate, or under its chin or its collarbone, or in the places near the ribs, or under the shoulder blades.	The suitable places for that: consider, and if the foetus present the vertex then she should fix the hooks in its eyes or in the neck or in the mouth or palate or beneath the chin, or the collarbone, or about the ribs, or beneath the false ribs.	0.7512045
And if it is coming feet first, then in the pubic bone and the middle ribs. And the hook should be held in the right hand and its curve placed between the fingers of the left hand, and the hand inserted gently, and the hook inserted into one of those places that we mentioned.	But if it present the feet let the hooks be fixed in the pubic region or middle ribs. She should hold the hook in the right hand and put the curved part between the fingers of the left hand, and introduce the hand gently and fix a hook in one of the places before mentioned, driving it in until it comes to a hollow.	0.8198958
Until you reach an empty space, then insert opposite it another hook, or a third if needed, so that the pulling is even and does not tilt to one side.  Then pull evenly, and the pulling should not be straight only, but move it in every direction.	Then opposite it let her fix another or a third if need be, so as to give even traction, not pulling to one side.	0.7471125
So that its exit is easy, as is done with a tooth when extracting it. And in between, the pulling should be relaxed. If one side of it is stuck, the midwife should anoint some fingers with oil and insert them from the side to turn what is stuck. If part of the fetus comes out, move the hooks to other places.	Then she should pull evenly, not just in a straight line but with the foetus moved from side to side so that its exit may be eased, as is done in extracting a tooth. From time to time the tension must be relaxed, and if any part of it be held up the midwife must oil some of her fingers and introduce them to one side to manipulate the retained part.	0.7794483
They are a little higher up. Do this until the entire fetus comes out. If a hand comes out before anything else and it cannot be put back due to its compression, then it should be wrapped with a cloth, then pull it until, when it has come out completely, you cut it off.	And if a part only of the foetus come away she should shift the hooks to other parts a little higher up, and so on, until the whole of the foetus has come out.	0.5758349
Either at the wrist joint or at the elbow, and thus should be done with the other hand and with the feet. If the head of the fetus is large and experiences compression during birth, or if there is fluid accumulated in its head, then a sharp scalpel should be inserted between the fingers.	If the hand should come out before any other part and it is impossible to reduce it on account of the pressure, then a tape should be wound round it and she should pull on it until it is all out; then it should be cut off at either the carpal or the elbow joint. In the same manner should the other hand be dealt with, and the feet.	0.64120704
And with it the head is incised so the fluid comes out, or extract it with the instrument that is called the extractor, whose image appears with the images of all the other instruments in the chapter after this one.	If the foetal head be large and it is tightly squeezed in exit, or if there be a collection of fluid in the head, you should introduce between your fingers a spike-shaped scalpel and split the head to let the water out; or you should smash it with the instrument called cephalotribe which will be illustrated, together with figures of the other instruments, in the chapter following.	0.57482696
Likewise, do this if the fetus is naturally large-headed: the skull should be incised or crushed with the extractor, as we said, then extract the bones with the forceps. If the head emerges and gets compressed at the clavicle, make an incision so that the moisture in the chest pours out.	In the same manner you act if the foetus have a naturally large head: either you should cut the skull open or smash it with the cephalotribe as we said; then you should draw out the bones with forceps. If the head comes out and the foetus is held up at the collar bones, an incision should be made to let out the humidity in the thorax, for the thorax will then shrink.	0.8783767
For the chest then contracts. If the chest does not contract and birth is not possible, then cut piece by piece as best you can. If the lower abdomen is swollen or there is a hernia, it should be lanced so that the moisture drains from it.	But if the thorax does not shrink and is not disposed to emerge then you should cut off pieces in any manner possible. If the lower belly be swollen or dropsical then you should make an opening to draw out all the fluid.	0.76289284
If the fetus is by its feet, then pulling it is easy and its alignment at the mouth of the womb is simple. If it gets compressed at the abdomen or chest, then you should pull it with a cloth that you have wrapped around your hand and cut the abdomen or chest so that what is in them drains out.	If the foetus present the feet then the extraction will be easy and it will be a simple matter to guide it to the maternal opening. If it be stuck about the abdomen or thorax then pull on it with a cloth wound around your hand and cut an opening in the abdomen or thorax to allow the contents to flow out.	0.88578683
If you have extracted all the limbs and the head retracts and gets stuck, the midwife should insert her left hand. If the mouth of the womb is open, she should insert the hand into the cervix and search for the head and pull it with the fingers to the mouth of the womb, then insert a hook or two hooks into it and pull it with them.	If all the limbs are removed but the head is turned backwards and is jammed, the midwife should introduce her left hand and, if the mouth of the womb is open, should put the hand into the cervix of the womb and investigate the head and, with her fingers, draw it down toward the opening and fix a hook or two in it, and extract it with these.	0.9144274
If the mouth of the womb has closed due to a hot swelling that has affected it, you should not be rough with it, but rather use moist, fatty pours and apply compresses, and sit in baths that relax and moisten.	If it should be that the mouth of the womb is closed on account of an abscess, then one must not be rough with it but should use in this case instillations of moistening greasy substances; plasters also should be applied; and the woman should sit in a bath of softening and moistening waters.	0.74611974
If the fetus is on its side, if it can be adjusted, use what we mentioned for the live fetus. If that is not possible, then cut it piece by piece and extract it. It is important not to leave any part of the placenta inside at all. When you are finished with your treatment, use what we have mentioned regarding the treatment of hot swellings that occur in the womb.	If the foetus present laterally and it is possible to reposition it, there should be applied the things mentioned for a living child. But if this be not possible then it should be cut away piecemeal and extracted. It is necessary that not a scrap of the afterbirth be left behind in the womb. When you have completed your treatment then also apply those treatments we have mentioned for abscesses occurring in the uterus.	0.85221696
If bleeding occurs, she should descend into astringent baths and use all other treatments. I have seen a woman who was pregnant and the fetus died in her womb, then she became pregnant again on top of it.	If haemorrhage occurs, the woman should be put into styptic fluids and the usual treatment applied.	0.60669017
Then the other fetus also died, and after a long time a swelling appeared in her hypogastrium and swelled until it opened and began to discharge pus. I was called to treat her, so I treated her for a long time, but the wound did not heal, so I placed on it some of the ointments with strong drawing power.	Now I myself once saw a woman who had become pregnant and the foetus had then died in utero; then again she conceived and the second foetus also died; and after a long while she got a swelling in the umbilicus which grew and eventually it opened and began to produce pus. I was called in to attend her, and I treated her for a long while but the wound did not heal up.	0.7712001
A bone came out of the area, then after a few days, another bone came out. I was surprised by this, as the abdomen is a place without bones.  I estimated that they were from the bones of the dead fetus. I explored the wound and extracted many bones from the skull of the fetus.	So I applied to it certain very strongly drawing ointments, and then a bone came away from the place; then a few days passed and another bone came out; and I was mightily astonished at this, seeing that the abdomen is a place where there are no bones. I formed the opinion that these were bones from a dead foetus. So I investigated the place and got out many bones belonging to the head of the foetus.	0.88126016
I continued to follow this until I extracted many bones from her, and the woman was in the best of health. She lived in that state for a while, discharging a little pus from the area. I have only mentioned this unusual case here.	I continued this procedure and got a great number of bones out of her, the woman being in the best of health; indeed she lived for quite a while like that, with a little pus being exuded from that place.	0.87059814
Because it contains knowledge and assistance for what the skillful physician attempts with his hand in treatment.	I bring forward this uncommon occurrence here since it gives knowledge and help about the sort of treatment that the doctor who practises surgery may contrive.	0.6356578

On extracting the placenta.	On extracting the afterbirth.	0.8355557
If the placenta is retained after childbirth, you should instruct the patient to hold her breath, then make her sneeze with white hellebore, and tightly close her mouth and nostrils with your hand. If it comes out with this, then fine. Otherwise, take a measure.	When in a confinement the afterbirth is left behind, you should bid the woman hold her breath then make her sneeze with ptarmica, with your hand holding her mouth and nose; and if it come away thus, good.	0.7481793
Pierce a hole in the lid, and place in it herbs that open the mouth of the womb, such as rue, oregano, dill, chamomile, wormwood, savory, and centaury. All of these medications, or some of them, immerse them in water, and place them on the fire. Then place a silver tube on the hole in the lid of the pot, and the other end in the mouth of the womb.	But if not, then take a pot, pierce a hole in the lid, and put in it herbs that will open the womb, such as pennyroyal, rue, anise, chamomile, artemisia, cassia, and centaury, some or all of these remedies, submerge them in water, and place on the fire. Then fix a silver tube to the hole in the cover and bring the other end into the orifice of the womb and hold it in position so that the vapours may reach the body of the uterus.	0.7940748
Hold it until the steam reaches the bottom of the womb, then make her sneeze as we said, for the placenta will come out quickly. If it remains after this treatment and does not come out, instruct the midwife to immerse her left hand in sesame oil or marshmallow mucilage.	Then let her sneeze, as we said, and the afterbirth will quickly come away. But if, after this treatment, it still remains and does not come out, then tell the midwife to dip her hand in oil of sesame or mucilage of marshmallow and introduce it into the vulva and search for the afterbirth, and when she has found it, to take hold of it and very gently draw it until she bring it out.	0.83858037
Then insert it into the vagina and search for the placenta with it. If she finds it, she should grasp it and pull it little by little until she extracts it. If it is adhered deep in the womb, insert the hand as we described, so that when you find the placenta, pull it little by little, gently.	But if it be adherent to the depths of the uterus, then let her pass her hand in as we described until she find the afterbirth; then let her draw very slowly and gently lest by violent pulling she cause a prolapse; and she should slowly move it from side to side, left and right; then let her increase the traction, for then it gives way to the pull and is freed from its adhesions.	0.7163461
Lest the womb fall out with strong pulling, rather it should be moved gently to the sides, right and left, then increase the amount of pulling, for then it will respond and be released from the adhesion. If the mouth of the womb is constricted, we have described the treatment with sneezing and the treatment of the pot and herbs.	If the uterine opening be narrowed, we have earlier mentioned the treatment by induced sneezing and that of the pot and herbs.	0.49313197
If it does not come out with all that we have described, beware of violence in pulling it again, but it should be tied to what has come out of it at the mouth of the womb to the woman's thigh, then inject her with the quadruple ointment, for it will rot it after a few days.	But if it does not come away by all the means we have described, beware of treating her roughly with repeated traction. Whatever of it comes out of the opening should be tied to the woman's thigh, and then syringe her with Tetrapharmacon ointment; for that will cause putrefaction in a few days and it will loosen and come out.	0.8052758
And it dissolves and comes out, except that when it rots, a foul odor rises from it to the stomach and head, and this harms the patient, so it is necessary to use suitable fumigations.	However, when it necroses foul odours arise from it that ascend to the stomach and head and these cause harm to the patient; so she should have suffumigations appropriate for this.	0.73848176
For that, some of the ancients tried fumigation with the herb and dried figs.  Image of the instrument with which a woman is fumigated when there is retention of menses, placenta, and so on:	One of the Ancients tried suffumigation with nasturtium and dried figs.

On the treatment of unopened anal fistula.	On imperforate anus.	0.5082611
Many boys are born with their anuses unopened, blocked by a thin membrane. The midwife should perforate this membrane with her finger, or else incise it with a sharp scalpel, taking care not to touch the muscle.	Infants are quite often born with the anus imperforate, closed by a fine membrane; then the midwife should perforate the membrane with her finger or pierce it with a sharp scalpel, being careful not to touch the muscle.	0.8720832
Then she should place on it wool dipped in wine and oil, then treat it with ointments until it heals. If you fear it will close, place a lead tube in the opening for many days and remove it whenever the child needs to defecate.	Then wool dipped in oil and wine should be applied, and treat it with ointments until healed. If you are afraid it may close up, put into the opening a leaden tube for many days, which will be removed when the child wants to evacuate the bowel.	0.91939723
Blockage of the anus can also occur from the healing of a wound or swelling.  This healed area should be incised, then treated with the aforementioned remedies and lead tube.

On the treatment of fistulas that occur in the lower part of the body.	On the treatment of fistulae occurring in the lower parts.	0.92631906
Fistulas that occur in the lower part of the body are a thickening and hardness that occurs near the anus externally, or in the perineum on one of its sides.  The fistula may be singular or multiple.	Fistulae in the lower parts are a knotting and thickening of the tissues occurring externally near the anus or in the perineum to one side. A fistula may be single or multiple.	0.9391995
If this thickening persists, it opens and a watery white fluid or thin pus flows from it.  Some of these fistulas may open into the anus and into the intestine, and some may not be open.  Open fistulas can be recognized by the feces and gas that emerge from them when the patient defecates.	When a thickening of this kind has become chronic it opens and there flows out a white watery humidity or thin pus. These fistulae may be perforating into the rectum or bowel, or non-perforating. The former may be known by faeces or flatus coming out of them when the patient opens the bowel.	0.88375014
Worms may also emerge from them. Sometimes, if they are in the perineum, fistulas may open into the bladder and into the urethra, and some of them may open into the hip joint and into the coccyx.  How to distinguish a fistula that opens into the anus from one that does not.	Often also worms come out of them. Sometimes also there are fistulae occurring in the perineum which penetrate to the urinary bladder and to the urethra; and some also penetrate to the hip-joint and to the coccyx.	0.8457099
Insert your index finger into the anus and insert a thin probe made of copper or iron into the fistula if the fistula is not curved. If it is curved, insert a thin lead probe or a horsehair into it.	A fistula penetrating to the anus may also be distinguished from one not so penetrating by introducing the finger into the anus and a fine probe into the fistula, made of either bronze or iron, if there be no bend in the course of the fistula. But if the course of the fistula be tortuous, then introduce a thin leaden probe or a horse-hair, until you feel the probe or horse-hair come on to your finger.	0.8158772
Until you feel the probe or the hair with your finger. If you do not feel it at all and nothing comes out of the opening, neither feces, nor gas, nor worms, as we have said, then know that it is not open, so proceed with treatment.	But if you do not feel it at all and if no faeces nor flatus nor worm come out of the opening, as we said, you may know it is not perforating; so hurry on with treatment.	0.77180266
If the fistula opens into the bladder or into the urethra, the evidence is the passage of urine from it and the inability of the area to heal with medications.  If it opens into the hip joint or into the coccyx, the sign is that the probe reaches there.	When the fistula penetrates to the bladder or the urinary passages it is signified by the passage of urine and by the fact that medical remedies cannot cure it.	0.7592145
If there is no curvature towards the bone, and if there is pain in the area and pus constantly coming out of it, and treatment is ineffective and it does not heal with ointment, then these open fistulas are not curable at all.	But if it penetrate to the hip-joint or coccyx, this will be signified by the probe's passing right through to there if it be a straight passage to the bone; and by the pain felt in that part; and by the chronic purulent discharge; and the fact that medical treatment does no good and ointment does not heal it.	0.61128986
Their treatment is a futile effort for any ignorant doctor who attempts them. But those that are not open and not chronic may be hoped to be cured with iron, as I will describe and as I have tested.  You lay the patient before you on his back.	There is in these perforating sinuses no cure whatever; and their treatment is labour in vain for all the ignorant doctors who pretend that they understand them. But there is hope in operative treatment for those that are not perforating and chronic, as I know from experience and shall now describe.	0.74477744
And raise his legs upwards with his thighs inclined towards his belly. Then you insert a copper or lead probe, if there is a curvature in the fistula, until you know where the probe ends. If the patient feels it near the anus, you should insert your index finger into the anus.	Thus: have the patient lying on his back before you and let both his legs be raised with the thighs flexed back upon his belly; then introduce a probe of bronze, or of lead if the course be tortuous, until you determine where the probe reaches. Then, if the patient feel the probe somewhere in the region of the anus, put your forefinger into the anus.	0.8432076
If you feel in your finger that the probe has emerged by itself, exposed, without feeling any membrane or flesh between your finger and it, then know for certain that it is open, so do not bother with it, for it is incurable, as we have said.	If you feel the probe itself with your finger, coming through bare, and you do not feel anything interposing between your finger and the probe, either membrane or flesh, then you may know for certain that it is a perforating fistula; do not spend your energy over it, for, as we have said, there is no cure.	0.829713
They have said that it heals in some rare people.  And among the treatments which may be hoped to be beneficial is that you heat a thin cautery, according to the width of the fistula as described previously, and insert it hot into the fistula until it reaches the vicinity of the anus. Then you repeat it two or three times.	Yet some have said that it may be cured in certain cases, but rarely. The treatment from which some relief may be hoped is to heat a fine cautery corresponding to the width of the fistula, as we have said before, and pass this, hot, through the fistula to the anus; then repeat this two or three times until you know that all those compact tags of superfluous flesh, which resemble quills, are burnt away.	0.8416443
Until you know that all the excess clotted flesh, which resembles the tube of a bird's feather, has been burned. Then you treat it with wicks soaked in oil until the burned flesh comes out. Then treat it with healing ointments, if it heals.	Then dress with a pad soaked in oil until the burnt tissue comes away. Then treat with healing ointments and, if it heals, well and good.	0.62348247
Otherwise, it will never heal with any other treatment.  But if you insert the probe and it does not reach your finger which is in the anus, and there is a thick barrier of flesh or membrane between it and the probe, and you see the fistula on the side of the skin surface, then cut the skin from the beginning of the fistula.	If not, it will never heal with any other treatment. If you introduce the probe and it does not come through to your finger in the anus, and there be between your finger and the probe something firm interposing, either tissue or lining, and you see the fistula to be close under the skin, then cut open the skin at the origin of the fistula and continue your incision, with the probe in the fistula, until you come to the place where the tip of the probe has reached and the probe is freed and falls out.	0.91178435
Then treat it with healing ointments until it heals. If the blood overcomes you and prevents you from working to cut the flesh, the best thing to do, and the quickest benefit, is to cauterize it with fire or with a sharp medicine because cauterizing with fire combines two good things: burning the excess flesh.	Then treat with healing salve until healed. If the haemorrhage be too much for you and interferes with your operating when cutting away the tissues, then the best and most speedily efficacious thing you can do is to cauterize, either with fire or with caustics. For cauterizing with fire unites two good characteristics, the burning away of those superfluous tissues, and the stanching of the bleeding, as well as the drying-up of humidity.	0.847897
And stopping the blood and drying the moisture.  Then treat it with wicks soaked in oil or powdered sulfur with oil until the area suppurates and the burned flesh comes out in the pus. Then treat the wound with healing ointments that promote the growth of solid flesh.	Then treat with a dressing soaked in butter, or sulphur pounded with oil, until the place putrefies and the burnt tissue comes away in the pus. Then treat the wound with salves to encourage healing and the growth of firm flesh, these remedies having also a styptic and drying quality.	0.82501173
These are the medicines that have astringency and dryness, for when it has healed, it is cured and will not relapse. If the fistula has reached the depth of the anus and is far from the surface of the body, insert your finger into the anus and examine with it.	Then when the wound is healed over it is cured for good and there is no fear of a recurrence. If the fistula reaches deep into the anus and is far from the surface of the body, then put your finger into the anus and palpate.	0.65551984
If you feel the probe and there is a barrier of membrane or flesh between you and it, and it is close to penetrating, then the action in it is only by way of hope and expectation. That is, you employ in it one of three methods: either you cauterize it, as we said,	If you feel a barrier of flesh or membrane interposed between the probe and your finger, and it be nearly through, then there is nothing to be done except to try a remote hope. There are three methods that you may employ. The first is to cauterize it, as we have said.	0.8258593
Or you incise it until you reach its bottom so that you can, by inserting wicks and treatment, be close, and do not overdo the incision, lest you cut the muscle surrounding the anus, causing the patient to involuntarily pass stool. Then treat it with what we have mentioned, and perhaps it will heal, as we have said.	Or you may cut it open until you reach the termination so as to be able to insert a dressing and bring the medicament into contact with it, but do not extend your incision too far lest you cut into the sphincter muscle and the patient become incontinent of faeces; then dress in the manner we have said and perhaps it may heal.	0.82772887
Or you penetrate that barrier and pierce it after you incise it close to the anus, as we have said, either with the probe or with another sharp-edged instrument. Then you clean all the clotted flesh that is in the incision to where you are able with thoroughness.	Or you may perforate the barrier and pierce it through, after incising to the vicinity of the anus, as we have said, either with the probe or with some other sharp-pointed instrument; then clear away the fleshy granulations in the incision as far as you are able; then attempt the repair of the whole wound with the incision and the upper opening, until it heals.	0.9055225
Then dust the entire wound with powder, including the incision and the upper opening, until it seals, and keep the fistula open within the anus, so it will be easier for the patient. The fistula may sometimes perforate in this way.	Let the inner end of the fistula remain open, for this will ease the patient.	0.58574677
That is, if you insert the probe into the fistula, and it is on one side of the anus toward the surface of the body along with the skin and edge of the anus, then take a probe with a perforated end like a cobbler's needle, in this way:	Sometimes also a fistula is cut out in this way: namely, you pass a probe into the fistula; it should be near the circle of the junction of the outer skin with the anal mucosa; then take a probe with an eyed point like a shoemaker's needle; put into it a thread twisted of about five threads, and insert into the fistula until it reaches the end.	0.7165518
And insert into it a thread twisted from five threads or so. Then insert the probe with the thread into the fistula until it reaches its bottom. If it opens into the edge of the anus from the inside nearby.	If it has perforated through at the anal margin within, nearby, draw the thread out of that perforation by introducing your finger into the anus.	0.56034017
Then bring the thread out from that hole by inserting your finger into the anus and bring out the end of the thread. Gather both ends together and tie them, and leave it for a day or two. Every time the thread cuts into the flesh, tighten it well until the flesh between the ends of the threads is severed and falls off. Then treat the wound until it heals and recovers.	Draw out the end of the thread and tie the two ends together and leave for one or two days. As the thread cuts into the tissues, tighten it up well until those tissues enclosed in the thread are cut through and fall away. Then dress the wound until it be healed and sound.	0.8319154
If the opening of the fistula is not perforated, then perforate it however you can, unless it is very deep, then you should not do that because of the muscle, lest you cut it. Then do with it as we have mentioned until it heals.	If the mouth of the fistula is not perforated, perforate it as best you can, unless the depth is too great; in which case you must not do so lest you cut the muscle. Then treat as we have said until it heals.	0.92265034

On Lancing Hemorrhoids that Bleed, Excising Them, and Treating Fissures.	On cutting and incising piles that are bleeding, and the treatment of fissures.	0.78215164
Hemorrhoids are of two types. Either they are inside the anus, resembling red blisters or like grape seeds, and they are small and large, and blood flows from them constantly.	Haemorrhoids are of two kinds: either internal, resembling red bubbles or grape-seeds, small or large, with blood perpetually flowing, and they may be single or multiple; or they may be external, round about the anus.	0.88496304
And they are single and they are many, and they are outside the anus and on its edges, except that those that are outside the anus are mostly less moist, and a yellow fluid or a little blood flows from them constantly, and they are the color of the skin.	External ones are for the most part fairly dry; a little yellowish fluid or blood constantly oozes from them, and they are of the colour of the body.	0.6839761
And the treatment for those that are inside the anus is that you order the patient to defecate and strain until the anus protrudes and the warts appear to you, then you quickly grasp them with hooks or hold them with your fingernail, then you cut them at their roots if the hooks will not hold in them due to their moisture and looseness.	The treatment of internal piles: bid the patient open his bowel and bear down until the anus opens out and the swellings are disclosed to you; then quickly take hold of them with hooks or with your finger-nail and cut them off near the roots.	0.72592044
Then rub it with a coarse cloth or a piece of rough bread, or pull it with your fingers, then cut it. Then sprinkle on it after cutting some sharp powders to act as cautery for it, or cauterize it as described previously in the chapter on cautery.	If the hook does not retain its hold on them because of their humidity and softness, then cut them with a piece of rough material or a rag of goat-hair, or draw them out with your fingers and cut them off; and after excision sprinkle some caustic powder on to act instead of the cautery; or cauterize them as previously described in the book on cauterization; then dress in the usual way until healed.	0.70612156
Then treat it with other treatments until it heals. If the anus does not respond to you for protrusion, then give the patient an enema that has a little pungency to wash what is in the anus, and it will come out quickly when the patient strains. As for external hemorrhoids, their treatment is easy and simple.	But if the anus will not open out for you then give a slightly corrosive enema so as to wash out what is within, and then, the anus will open out quickly when the patient bears down.	0.692166
And that is that you take it with your fingernail or hook it with a hook and cut it, then treat it with what we mentioned until it heals.  And whoever dislikes cutting with iron should try piercing it in this manner: take a twisted thread and insert it into a needle.	Now the treatment of external piles is easy and simple: take hold of them with your finger-nails or catch them up with a hook and cut them away; and treat as before mentioned until cured.	0.56853926
Then pull the wart upwards and pierce it with the needle at its base from the other side, and wrap the ends of the thread under the needle while it is transverse, and tighten the wart tightly and firmly, then knot the thread and remove the needle. Do this with all the warts, leaving one that you do not pierce.	But with the patient who refuses excision with the knife, this manner of removal should be practised: thread a twisted thread into a needle, then draw the piles upward and run the needle through the root of each, from one side to the other, and wind the ends of the thread round beneath the needle as it lies crosswise, and bind the pile firmly; then knot the thread and remove the needle. Do this with each pile, but leave one not destroyed so that the superfluous blood may flow from it.	0.74615633
so that excess blood may flow from it. Then place a cloth dipped in rose oil or cerate on the anus and place it on the anus, and tell the patient to remain still. Then leave him until they fall off. When the hemorrhoids fall off, treat them with ointments and other treatments until they heal.	Do this with each pile, but leave one not destroyed so that the superfluous blood may flow from it. Then apply to the anus a piece of material soaked in oil of roses or wax; apply it and bid the patient lie quiet; then leave him until the piles fall away. When they fall away, dress with ointments and the usual dressings until healed.	0.7981853
As for the treatment of fissures, they often occur from dryness of the stool and constipation. If it becomes chronic and no medicine is effective for it, then it should be scraped with the blade of a scalpel or your fingernail until it becomes moist and the top layer that prevents it from healing is removed.	The treatment of fissures: these often arise from dryness of the faeces and from constipation. If they become chronic, and medical treatment is unavailing, you should scrape them with the edge of a scalpel or with your finger-nail until they become soft and the upper layer, that prevents healing, is removed; then dress until they mend as they should.	0.8296679
Then treat it until it heals as it should. If it does not heal, repeat the scraping, more severely than the first time, until it bleeds slightly and peels. Then treat it, and it will heal.	But if they do not heal, repeat the scraping more strongly than at first until they bleed freely and become raw; then apply dressings and they will heal.	0.6942832

On the Treatment of Ingrown and Non-Ingrown Nails, Dry Warts, and Calluses.	On the treatment of corns, inverted and otherwise, and dry warts and pimples.	0.6912152
A corn is a round nodule, the color of flesh, resembling the head of a nail. It occurs all over the body, especially on the soles of the feet and toes, and causes pain when walking.	A corn is a round knob, the same colour as the body and resembling the head of a nail. It occurs in all parts of the body but particularly in the soles of the feet and the toes, whence arises pain in walking.	0.9363035
It should be incised around the nail, grasped with forceps or a hook, and extracted from its root. Then treat it. If you wish, cauterize it as described previously in its chapter. As for dry warts, each one is a small, rough, compact, round protuberance on the surface of the body.	You should cut away what is round the corn and take it with forceps or a hook and tear it out by the root; then dress it. If you wish you may cauterize it in the manner already described in the book on cauterization. Then concerning dry warts: a wart is a little round rough compact eminence on the surface of the body; it occurs often on the hands of boys.	0.7975055
It often occurs on the hands of children. Its treatment is to stretch the wart and cut it off, or to pierce it with silk thread or a hair until it falls off. If you wish, cauterize it as described previously with fire or a caustic medication.	Now the treatment is to draw out the wart and cut if off; or tie it off with a silken thread or a hair until it falls out; or if you wish, cauterize as said before, either with the actual cautery or with caustic. Sometimes warts, inverted or otherwise, are uprooted with the instrument I shall describe under the treatment of pimples.	0.78453314
Ingrown and non-ingrown nails can be removed with the instrument I will describe in the treatment of calluses. As for a callus, it is also a small, compact, thick protuberance on the surface of the body, going very deep.  When cold affects it, one feels a sensation similar to the sting of ants.	Sometimes warts, inverted or otherwise, are uprooted with the instrument I shall describe under the treatment of pimples. A pimple is also a little compact thick prominence on the skin surface, going deep; when it gets cold there is a feeling as of an ant's sting in it.	0.71857715
It occurs all over the body, but mostly on the hands. Its treatment is to take a tube made of a goose feather or a strong eagle feather and place that tube over the callus so that the circumference of the tube surrounds it on all sides. Then rotate your hand with the tube until you incise around the callus.	It is found all over the body but mostly on the hands. The treatment is to take the quill of a strong feather of the goose or the vulture, and place the quill over the pimple so as to encircle it with the circumference of the tube; then revolve the quill with your hand so as to cut all round the pimple, and go deep into the flesh, and then the pimple may be drawn out by the roots.	0.90648806
Insert it deep into the flesh and extract the callus from its root. If you wish, you can do this with a copper or iron tube in this manner:.	If you wish you may extract it with a tube of bronze or of iron, of this form.	0.6108833
The top of the tube should be thin, solid, and twisted to make it easy for the fingers to grasp and twist. If you wish, you may cauterize the callus as described previously for cauterizing warts, in the chapter on cautery.	The upper closed part of the tube should be fine, solid, and twisted, to give easy purchase for the fingers in holding and revolving it. If you wish you may cauterize the pimple as described earlier on the cauterization of warts in the book on the cautery.	0.8863092

The syringe may be made of silver, or tin, or cast or hammered copper.  This instrument may be made small or large depending on the user.	A clyster may be made of silver or of Chinese alloy or of cast or hammered bronze.	0.63690925
Those used in the treatment of young children will be small, and for those whose anuses are narrow or painful, their syringes will be very gentle. Illustration of a large syringe:	Large and small varieties of this instrument are made, to suit those on whom they are to be used; those for the treatment of children will be small. Patients with stricture of the anus, or pain, will have very slender clysters.	0.7843039
Its upper funnel, to which the bladder is attached, should be wide, in this manner, with a rim where the bladder is attached, as you see.  Its lower end, which enters the anus, should be solid, very smooth, and thin.  On one side are two holes and on the other side one hole.	The upper end of the funnel to which the membrane is bound should be broad like this; it should have a rim where the membrane may be bound down, as you see. The lower extremity, which is introduced into the anus, should be closed and smooth, and on one side of it should be two holes, and on the other, one; the width of the holes should be about that of a probe or a little wider.	0.85499585
The size of the hole should be the thickness of a probe or slightly thicker. The bladder in which the medications are placed is made from an animal bladder or from thin sheepskin, made in the shape of a small wineskin, its diameter being a span.	The membrane to hold the medicament is made out of an animal's bladder or of parchment, made up in the form of a small bag, a span in diameter.	0.7562873
Many holes are pierced around it, the distance between each hole being the width of a finger. Then, a strong thread of two-ply yarn, of ten threads or so, is passed through these holes, and the bladder is gathered like a wineskin. When the medication is placed in it, the top of the syringe is tightened firmly between the two stones, and then it is injected. This is an illustration of the circumference of the bladder and the holes:	It should be pierced with a number of holes in a circle a finger's breadth apart; and into these holes pass a strong thread of yarn, twisted of ten or so threads, and with this gather up the skin like a bag; and when the medicament is placed in it tie it down firmly between the two rims on the upper end of the clyster; and then give the enema. This is the figure of the circle of skin with the holes.	0.8026655
The method of administering the enema is to fill the skin or bladder with the medication, warmed to a temperature the patient can tolerate. Be careful that it is not too hot or too cold. Then the patient lies on his back and raises his legs upward.	Now the way to give an enema with this instrument is for the parchment or bladder to be filled with the medicament, which should be warmed so as to be tolerable for the patient; but beware lest it be too hot or too cold. Then let the patient lie back and raise his legs; and put under them a leather mat or a blanket.	0.83397764
A mat or blanket is placed under him. Then the tip of the syringe is lubricated with oil, egg white, fenugreek mucilage, or something similar. Then insert it gently into the anus. Then an assistant takes the bladder with both hands and squeezes it firmly until all the contents of the syringe have emptied into the intestine.	Then anoint the tip of the clyster with oil or egg-white or mucilage of fenugreek or the like; then gently pass it into the anus; then let an assistant take the membrane in both hands and together firmly squeeze it until all the contents are squirted into the bowel.	0.8658644
Then the syringe is removed, and the patient raises his legs against the wall. If the medication stimulates him to defecate, let him hold it as long as he can. If he sleeps with it the whole night, it will be more effective. If it is administered for diarrhea and its expulsion is hastened, repeat the enema until he is cured.	Then the clyster should be removed and the patient should raise his legs against the wall. If the enema stimulates him to evacuate, let him hold it as long as he can; if he delay all night long, it will be all the more efficacious. If the enema be given in a case of diarrhoea and he has to evacuate hastily, then the use of the enema should be repeated until he is cured.	0.89680725
If there are hemorrhoids or painful swellings in the anus, the syringe should be very smooth, like those used for children. This is an illustration of a smooth syringe with its skin stretched over it:	If there be haemorrhoids or painful tumours in the anus, the clyster should be exceedingly slender and smooth, of the sort employed for children. Here is a figure of a fine clyster with its skin tied on.	0.7644942

Chapter Eighty-Four.	CHAPTER EIGHTY-FOUR.	0.84605944
On the Treatment of Wounds.	On the cure of wounds.	0.90802795
I have mentioned in the section on cauterization the treatment of similar things, and here I will discuss their complete treatment by hand and with medications. I say that wounds differ according to the object causing the wound and according to the location where the wound occurs.	I have already mentioned in the appropriate section the treatment of such wounds as are suitable for cauterization. Here I shall describe the operative and medical treatment in full. So I begin by saying that wounds differ according to that which causes them and according to the site.	0.86302507
The things that cause wounds are many, such as the blow of a stone, or the cut of a sword or knife, or the thrust of a spear or stick or arrow, and many other such things.	Those things that cause wounds are many: a knock from a stone, a cut from a sword or a knife, a blow by a spear, stick, or arrow; and many such things.	0.9342911
As for wounds according to the locations on the body, they are like the wound that occurs on the head, or the neck, or the chest, or the abdomen, or the liver, and other such organs.	To consider wounds according to their site on the body, they are such as a wound occurring in the head, or neck, or chest, or belly, or liver, and so on.	0.8931956
I will describe the treatment of some wounds so that you can use them as a standard and rule for all other wounds, and I will begin with simple head wounds specifically, because complex ones will be mentioned at the beginning of the third book of this work.	Now I am going to describe the treatment of certain wounds, so that you may take them as a standard and a guide for other wounds. I shall begin particularly with the simple wounds of the head; for mention of the compound wounds will be made at the beginning of the third book.	0.8849397
I say that when a simple wound occurs on the head and there is no bone fracture, you should examine it. If it is from the blow of a stone or similar object, and the skin is only torn, and the wound is large, and you fear the occurrence of a hot swelling in the patient, then hasten to perform phlebotomy at the appropriate site. Do not delay this, and draw blood according to his strength, if there is no impediment preventing phlebotomy, especially if the blood coming out of the wound is slight. Let the phlebotomy be on the opposite side of the wounded area.	I say then, that when there occurs a simple wound of the head, with no accompanying bone-fracture, you should look; and if it be caused by a knock from a stone or the like, and has only broken the skin, but it is a big wound and you fear lest there occur an abscess, then bleed the cephalic vein at once without delay; draw off from him blood in proportion to his vigour if there is no contra-indication to venesection; and particularly if the haemorrhage from the wound be slight.	0.8219235
Warn the patient against fullness, drink, and coarse foods. If something prevents him from being phlebotomized, then he should reduce his food intake and avoid meat and drinks.  Apply to the wound, if a hot swelling develops in it, cotton dipped in rose oil alone, or with an astringent drink.	The venesection should be on the opposite side to the wound; and caution the patient against gluttony and wine and rich food. But if from any cause venesection is prevented, he should be on a light diet and avoid meat and wines. And apply to the wound, if there be any inflammation, cotton wool soaked in oil of roses, either alone or with a somewhat astringent wine.	0.7432256
If you are sure there is no hot swelling, then dress the wound, if it is fresh with its blood and the air has not changed it, with the powder that I will describe to you shortly.  But if the air has changed it, apply some ointments to it.	And if you are sure there is no inflammatory swelling, then apply directly to the wound, if its blood is fresh and it is unaltered by the air, the powder that I shall describe to you a little later. But if the air has already changed the wound, apply to it one of the ointments to cause it to discharge the pus; then dress until healed.	0.8560311
Until pus forms, then treat it until it heals.  If the wound is large and is from the cut of a sword or similar object, and its edges do not come together with bandages, then bring it together with sutures as I will describe in suturing abdominal wounds.	Now if it be a great wound, being caused by a sword-cut or the like, and dressings will not bring the edges of the wound together, you should suture them together in the manner I shall describe in dealing with the suture of abdominal wounds.	0.75249004
If the skin has peeled back, exposing the bone, and is attached only by a small piece, cut it off, then treat the wound with medications that will generate solid flesh in place of the skin. Instruct the patient to eat strengthening foods like heads, porridges and the like.	But if the skin has actually disclosed the bone, and is attached by a small strip only, then cut it away and dress the wound with medicaments that will produce firm flesh to replace the skin, and bid the patient go on a diet of solid food such as brawn and gruels and the like.	0.7573303
If putrefaction occurs in the skin and it does not adhere to the bone, cut away all the putrefied part and discard it, then treat it.  If in these wounds there is an artery or vein bleeding, and the bleeding does not stop with medication, search for the artery/vein.	And if decomposition arise in the skin and it will not adhere to the bone, then excise all the diseased part and discard it and then dress.	0.6313299
If you find it and it is not severed, sever it with a scalpel and tie it off. If necessary, if what we have mentioned does not work, cauterize it until the bleeding stops.  If these wounds are small and simple, their treatment is easy, it is sufficient to treat them by sprinkling this powder on them while they are still bloody.	If in these wounds there be an artery or vein shedding blood, and medicinal applications do not stanch it, then examine the artery, and if you find it not quite severed then cut it through with a scalpel and ligature it; and if you are compelled, our directions being unavailing, then cauterize until the haemorrhage stops. If these be small and simple wounds their treatment will be a light and easy matter; it is sufficient to sprinkle some of this powder on while they are still bleeding, before the atmosphere causes a change.	0.81591916
Before the air changes them. The recipe for the powder is: take one part frankincense, two parts mastic, and three parts slaked or unslaked lime. Grind all together, sift, and pack it into the wound, and bandage tightly so that it adheres well.	Description of the powder: let one part of olibanum and two parts of dragon's blood be taken, and three parts of quick or slaked lime, all beaten up together and passed through the sieve; and let the wound be packed with this and bound up tightly so that the powder sticks in position and coagulates with the blood.	0.6666676
It will congeal with the blood. Then bandage it over with compresses and leave it undressed as long as it does not swell, for the medication will not come off until it heals. Lime alone can be used for this, if you do not have frankincense and mastic.	Then bind pads above and let it be, not undoing it so long as it remains without swelling; for the dressing will not come away of itself until it is healed. Lime alone can do this if you have no olibanum and dragon's blood at hand.	0.75963366
This same action can also be performed with bandages on many large wounds if it is applied skillfully and bandaged tightly, and the wounds are fresh with blood that has not been altered by the air. However, if the air has altered them somewhat, especially if it is summertime...	It has exactly the same effect too on most large wounds, when the application and bandaging are properly done, and when the haemorrhage is recent, so long as the air has not changed them. If, however, the air has brought about some change, especially if it be in the summer season, then there is no point in the application of this powder.	0.7804593
...then applying this powder is pointless. Treat it as we have mentioned, by applying some ripening ointments or a poultice of barley flour made with water and honey until pus forms. Then treat it with other remedies until it heals.	Treat it then as we have said, by applying one or other of the suppurative ointments; or by applying a gruel of barleymeal with water and honey, so that the pus flows; then treat by all the usual methods until cured.	0.7447883
If, however, a slight bone fracture occurs with the wound, then set it with splints. I have described the treatment of skull fractures previously, in the section on neck surgery. Now, if the wound occurs on the neck, there is no difference in treatment between it and a simple head wound.	If, with the wound, there be also fracture of a bone, if it be slight, you should extract it with forceps. I mention the treatment of fractures of the head later on. On wounds in the neck: If a wound occur in the neck the treatment of it does not differ from that of a head wound, if it be simple.	0.82244515
However, if a nerve or artery in the neck has been severed, if it is a nerve, there is no other recourse but to avoid treating it with anything strongly astringent, such as verdigris, vitriol, and the like, because they harm the nerve and cause it to spasm.	But if a nerve or artery in the neck happens to be cut: if it be a nerve, there is no device that will serve except to avoid treatment of it by strong styptic remedies such as verdigris and vitriol and the like; for these injure the nerve and cause spasm; and under no circumstance let anything cold be applied to the wound, for the substance of the nerve is cold and it is continuous with the brain, which is the most noble among the organs.	0.8430269
Nothing cold should be placed on the wound at all, because the essence of the nerve is cold and it is connected to the brain, which is the noblest of organs.  And what you treat it with should be softening medications, such as nūra washed with fresh water several times, moistened with oil or rose oil and tutty.	But let your remedy for it be mild, such as lime slaked in sweet water many times and moistened with olive-oil or oil of roses; and with tutty, likewise washed in sweet water; and other minerals according to this prescription, and with bland ointments.	0.56405926
If it is also washed with fresh water, and all the metallic stones in this manner and moist ointments. However, if the wound is large, use sutures or bring its edges together with bandages, then treat it until it heals.	If the wound be large, use stitches or draw the edges of the wound together with pads; then dress until cured.	0.5833969
If the wound is deep and an abscess has formed at its bottom where pus has collected, lance it at its lowest point. If an artery has been severed in the wound and you find its blood flowing, cauterize it, ligate it, or cauterize it if necessary.	But if there be depth to the wound and a sinus appears at the bottom of it, in which pus has collected, then make an opening at the site of greatest depth. Now if an artery has been cut in the wound and you are in time to find it still bleeding, divide it or ligature it; or cauterize it if you are compelled to.	0.87034464
If the wound has severed some or all of the cartilages of the larynx, but the jugular veins are intact, bring together the edges of the skin with sutures over the trachea. Do not touch the larynx, but smooth it and return it to its natural shape, then tie it tightly and leave it for several days.	If it be such a wound that some of the cartilages of the trachea are laid open, or the whole trachea, the jugular veins being safe and sound, then join the skin edges together with a suture over the windpipe, and do not touch the windpipe, but straighten it and restore to its natural form; then tie firmly and leave for some days; then treat with salves having some styptic and astringent quality, until healed.	0.8086055
Then treat it with ointments that have astringent and drying properties until it heals. If the wound has affected the bone, examine it. If there are bone fragments, extract them all, or as many as possible.  And what you cannot extract, leave it until the wound putrefies, heals, and its removal becomes easy.	If the wound has affected bone, examine it, and if there be fragments of bone in it get them all out, or all you can. Those you cannot get hold of, leave until the wound suppurates and heals, and it will be easy to extract them.	0.83985996
If the wound is fresh, sprinkle on it the powders that we have described. If the bone putrefies in the wound and becomes a fistula, treat it as will be mentioned in its chapter, on surgery of the chest and between the shoulders.	If it be a fresh wound, sprinkle on the powder I have described ; and if any bone corrupt in the wound and it becomes a fistula, treat it by those means we shall mention in their place. On wounds in the chest and between the shoulders:	0.8631346
If it is a stab wound from a spear or knife and you see that it is deep, observe.  If air comes out of it when the patient breathes, know that it is a fatal wound. If it is not deep and is fresh with its blood, do not put powders in it at first, and do not bind it so that blood is not trapped in its depth.	If it be a piercing wound by a spear or a knife, and you see that it is deep, examine if there be a passage of air out of it when the patient breathes; whence you may know that the injury is mortal.	0.82136977
It would be driven back to the heart and kill the patient. But put in it a drawing ointment and change it twice a day. If you do not have an ointment, place a piece of worn cotton at the mouth of the wound to absorb the moisture that comes out of it, and have the patient sleep on the wounded side.	But if it is not deep and the haemorrhage is fresh, then do not straight away apply powder or bandage lest it keep the blood in the depths, so that it be returned to the heart and kill the patient; but apply to it a drawing ointment, and uncover it twice daily. If you have no ointment, apply carded cotton to the opening of the wound to soak up the humidities issuing from it.	0.7646512
So that whatever gathers in it will drain.  And if three or more days have passed since the injury, and the patient has not developed convulsions, a bad pulse, or shortness of breath, and you see that all his other conditions are good, know that the wound is healthy. Treat it with bandaging and other treatments until it heals.	And make the patient sleep on the (side of the) wound so that what collects therein may flow out. And if three or four days pass by after the wound, and the patient have no spasm or harmful palpitation of the heart nor obstruction to drawing breath, and you see that in other respects he is doing well, you may know that the wound is not dangerous; so treat it with pads and the usual dressings until it heals.	0.8337048
If it is difficult to see it, and the stench continues, know that it has become a fistula, so treat it according to its chapter. [Have] the patient [lie] on the wound so that whatever gathers in it will drain.  And if it has passed to a wound of the chest or back, treat it with the suturing we have previously described.	But if it will not heal and it permanently discharges pus, you may know that it has become a fistula; look for the treatment of this in the proper place. If the wound be from a cut with a sword or knife, a straightforward surface wound in the breast or back, then treat it as described before; that is, by suture if it be a great wound or by powder if it be a small one.	0.7102418
If it is large, or with powders if it is small.  If it has affected the bone and broken off fragments, examine the wound and proceed to remove those fragments if they are loose.  If they are not loose, leave them until...	But if there has also been injury to the bone, cutting out fragments from it, you should explore the wound and hasten to draw out the fragments if they are detached from the bone; but if they are not detached then let be until the wound suppurates, when the removal of the fragments will be easy.	0.6699002
the wound putrefies, for it will be easier to remove them. As for other wounds occurring in other parts of the body, their treatment follows the same rules as we have described.	Then with regard to other wounds occurring in other parts of the body, the same class of treatment should be used for them as for those already mentioned.	0.64068854

Chapter Eighty-Five.	CHAPTER EIGHTY-FIVE.	0.82781607
On Wounds of the Abdomen, Protrusion of the Intestines, and Their Suturing.	On wounds of the abdomen, and protrusion of the intestine; and on suturing them.	0.8599601
The rupture that occurs in the abdomen may be large, or it may be small or medium.  From a large one, an intestine or several intestines may protrude, and their repositioning and suturing is more difficult and complicated.	The tear that occurs in the abdomen may be great or small or it may be middle-sized. From a large tear one or more segments of gut may protrude. The reduction of this and the suture of the wound is an exceedingly hard and difficult matter.	0.8884331
The small rupture is also difficult in another way, requiring a more complicated repositioning.  If the intestine is not immediately returned to its place, it will swell and thicken, making its repositioning difficult. Therefore, the best rupture is the medium-sized one because the repositioning of the intestine is not as difficult as with these two types.	Small openings may also be difficult in another way, for they are bound to be harder to reduce, and if you do not hurry to return the gut to its place at once it will swell up and enlarge, thus rendering reduction difficult. So the best tear is the medium-sized, for in this case the reduction of the intestine will not be as difficult as in the two other cases.	0.8772108
And know that the suturing of the abdomen is of four types. Two types of sutures are general and suitable for suturing the abdomen and for suturing all other wounds of the body. The other two types are specific, common to all wounds, except that they are more specific to suturing the abdomen.	Then you should know that suturing the abdomen may be carried out in four ways. Two of them are general; suitable both for suture of the abdomen and for other wounds of the body. The other two sutures are special; they may be used for other wounds, but are more suitable for abdominal wounds.	0.8818986
And I will describe them to you one by one, with explanation and clarification. I say that if the wound is small and some of the intestine has come out and its repositioning is difficult, that is for one of two reasons: either because of the smallness of the rupture, as we have said, or because the intestine has become swollen due to the coldness of the air.	I shall describe each one to you separately, with comments and explanation. I begin then by saying that when the wound is small, and a piece of intestine protrudes from it, rendering the reduction of it difficult, the difficulty will be due to one of two causes: either on account of the smallness of the fissure, as we said; or because the gut has become inflated on account of the coldness of the air.	0.9177292
If this is the case, then it should be warmed by dipping a sponge or wet cloth in lukewarm water alone, or in which has been boiled spikenard, rue, and spikenard, and dabbing the intestine with it until the swelling subsides.	If the latter case obtains, the gut must be warmed by fomenting with a sponge or piece of cloth bathed with warm water or water in which have been boiled rushes and cyperus and hyacinth, bathing the gut until the inflation is gone down.	0.78112125
This can also be done with a drink that has astringency, which is better than water alone in reducing swelling.  When you see that the swelling has subsided, wet the intestine with water in which marshmallow or mallow has been boiled, as this will make it easier to insert.	Wine that is somewhat astringent may do; in bringing down the swelling it is better than plain water. When you see that the swelling has come down, bathe the gut with water in which have been infused althea and mallows; for with this the reduction of the bowel becomes easy, using the lightest effort.	0.8221994
If its return is difficult after this treatment, make a small incision in the rupture with the instrument used to incise fistulas. The first treatment, if possible, is better than the incision.  The incision is only resorted to after necessity and exhaustion of other options.  This is the image of the instrument:.	But if after this treatment the reduction is still difficult, open up the wound a little with the instrument for opening up haemorrhoids. The first method, if possible, is better than incision, but one may be compelled to incise when other means have failed. This is the form of the instrument.	0.71323925
One of its curved sides is sharp, the other is blunt, and the thin end is not as thin as a scalpel, but rather slightly blunted. It is an instrument resembling a small probe, as you see. If the wound is enlarged and the intestine enters, it should be returned to its natural shape.	The curved side should be sharpened, but not the other; the slender extremity should not be as slender as a scalpel, but rather blunt; it is an instrument like a small polo-stick, as you see. When the wound is opened up a little with the instrument and the bowel is reduced, it is important to return it to its natural shape and proper position, if you can, for that is better.	0.8218322
And its proper place, if you are able to do so, is best. But if the rupture is large and in the lower abdomen, the patient should lie on his back and put his legs higher than his head, and if it is in the upper abdomen, he should put his head and chest higher than his lower body.	When the wound is large and in the lower abdomen the patient should lie on his back and have his legs higher than his head; but if it be in the upper abdomen his head and chest should be placed higher than his lower parts.	0.8138525
And likewise, if the rupture is on one of the sides of the abdomen, always make your intention and purpose to have the side where the surgery is higher than the other side.  And this is how it should be done in major surgeries and in moderate surgeries.	And in the same way if the opening be on one side of the abdomen you should always make it your object to put the wounded side higher than the other. So must you proceed in large or middling wounds.	0.82835984
As for minor surgeries, place him as best you can. Then have an assistant at hand, a gentle one, hold the entire rupture with his hands and bring the edges together, then reveal a little bit at a time to the one performing the stitching.	But in small wounds put the patient in a position convenient to yourself. Then have an assistant under your direction to enclose within his hands the whole of the wound and bring the edges together, and then uncover it bit by bit for the one who is putting in the stitches.	0.7549435
This is the method for the single common suture: take a needle, or several needles, according to the size of the wound. Then leave a space the width of the little finger from the edge of the rupture and insert a single needle, without any thread in it, into the edges of the skin.	Now this is the description of one general suture, namely: one or more needles are taken, depending on the size of the wound; then, leaving about the width of the little finger from the end of the opening, pass an unthreaded needle from within through both edges of the skin together with both edges of the peritoneum which lies beneath the skin, piercing from one side to the other; thus you will have brought together both skin edges and both peritoneal edges, making four layers.	0.7994664
Along with the edges of the peritoneum that are under the skin from the inside, until you pass it through that side, having brought together the edges of the skin and the edges of the peritoneum, making four layers. Then tie a doubled thread around the needle several times on both sides until the edges of the wound are tightly joined.	Then wind a double thread several times round the needle, and tighten up from both sides so as to bring the two edges of the wound perfectly together.	0.5806677
Then leave a space the width of a finger and insert another needle, then tie it with the thread as you did with the first needle. Continue doing this with the needles you need until you have completely sewn up the wound.  The needles should be of medium thickness, between thick and thin.	Then again leave about a finger's breadth and put in another needle and fasten it with thread as you did in the first instance; and go on doing this with as many needles as you need until you have finished mending the whole wound.	0.8543681
Because very thin needles quickly cut the flesh, and thick ones are difficult to insert into the skin, therefore they should be medium in thickness, between thin and thick. And the needle should not be inserted into the edge of the skin too close to the wound.	The needles should be of medium fineness; for the very fine needles soon cut into the flesh; while thick needles, on the other hand, are difficult to pass through the skin; so they should be medium between fineness and thickness. You should not introduce the needle too near the edge of the skin lest the tissues be soon cut through and the wound gape before it has joined.	0.8639111
So that the flesh does not quickly tear and the wound open before it heals.  And do not sew too far apart, lest the wound be prevented from healing. Then cut off the ends of the needles so that they do not hurt the patient while he sleeps, and make for him supports of linen cloth on each side to hold the ends of the needles.	Nor should there be too great an interval between the stitches, lest the wound be prevented from scarring up. Then cut off the ends of the needles lest they hurt the patient during sleep; and make for him pads of linen scraps to cover the needle ends on both sides; and let them be until you know the wound is healed up.	0.88310444
And leave them until you know that the wound has healed. This type of stitching with needles is more suitable for small wounds, because it is sufficient to sew them with one needle or two or so.	This method of suture with needles is most suitable in small wounds, for one or two needles or thereabouts will probably be enough for such.	0.6307671
The manner of the common, or layman's, suture is to bring together the four edges, that is, the two edges of the skin and the two edges of the peritoneum, at once with a needle threaded with a twisted thread of moderate thinness and thickness. Then, when you have passed the needle through these four edges, you return the needle through the same side from which you began.	Now the second kind of general suture is to bring together all four edges, the two skin edges and the two peritoneal edges, at one and the same time, with a needle furnished with a twisted thread of medium thickness.	0.74021846
So the thread lies intertwined on top of the wound, the stitching being like the stitching of sacks that are used to tie up goods.  And you should leave the space of a small finger's width between each stitch. This stitching is known to everyone.	Then when the needle has pierced these four edges bring it back precisely to where you began, so that the thread may lie knitted over the wound to make a stitch in the manner of sewing up the bags in which goods are packed. The distance between stitches should be a little finger's breadth. Everybody is familiar with this stitch.	0.7616335
With this stitching I sewed a wound in a man's belly. He had been wounded with a knife, and the tear of the wound was more than a span, and about two spans of his middle intestine had come out. The tear was in the middle of the belly.	With this stitch I once sewed up a wound that a man got in the belly. He had been wounded with a knife; and the opening of the wound was more than a span long; and by that time there protruded some two spans' length of his mid-gut.	0.8858069
I put it back in after his intestine had remained outside the wound for twenty-four hours. The wound healed in about fifteen days, and I treated him until he recovered and lived after that for many years, managing all his affairs.  The doctors had judged that he would certainly not recover.	The opening was in the middle of his belly; and I reduced it after the bowel had been outside the wound for twenty-four hours. The wound healed in about a fortnight, and I treated him until he was better; and he lived for many years after this, carrying on as usual. The verdict of the doctors was that he could not be healed.	0.8782423
It is remarkable that I did not treat him with an ointment, because I was in a place where there was no medicine. I would place worn-out cotton on the wound twice a day and make sure to wash it with honey water until it healed.	The remarkable thing is that I did not treat him with any ointment, for I was in a place where there was no sort of medicine; so twice a day I applied teased-out cotton wool to the wound, and carefully washed it with honey-water until he was healed.	0.9424674
As for one of the two types of special stitching, I mention it according to the text of Galen: that you begin stitching from the skin, inserting the needle from the outside to the inside. Once you have passed the needle through the skin and through the muscle running lengthwise along the entire abdomen...	I shall now describe one of the two kinds of special suture according to the text of Galen. You begin at the skin, running the needle from without inwards.	0.82017684
...leave the edge of the peritoneum on the side where you inserted the needle. Then pass the needle through its other edge, from the inside to the outside, on the other edge of the peritoneum. Once you have passed it through, pass it again through this same edge of the peritoneum, from the outside to the inside.	When you pass it through the skin and the muscle that runs the length of the belly, leave the edge of the peritoneum on that side where the needle was introduced; and pierce the other edge of the peritoneum from within outwards through the other edge of the abdominal wall.	0.74486583
Leave the edge of the peritoneum that is on this side and pass the needle through its other edge, from the inside to the outside. As you pass it through the peritoneum, pass it through the edge of the peritoneum that is on its side, until it passes all the way through it.	When you have done this, pierce the same edge of the abdominal wall from the outside inwards, leaving the edge of the peritoneum which is on that side, and pierce the other side from within outwards. As you pierce, make the needle pass through the peritoneum to the edge of the abdominal wall that is adjacent to that part until it pierces right through the whole.	0.7967014
Then begin again from this same side and sew it with the edge of the peritoneum on the other side. Bring the needle out from the skin that is next to it. Then return it to that skin and sew the edge of the peritoneum that is on the other side together with this edge of the peritoneum.	Then begin again on that same side and sew it together with the peritoneal edge on the opposite side and bring the needle out through the skin nearby. Then reintroduce into the same skin area and sew the opposite peritoneal edge with that abdominal skin edge and bring the needle out through the adjacent skin.	0.8987263
Bring it out from the skin that is on its side.  Do this again and repeat it until you have sewn the entire wound according to this example. The overall description of this suture is that you sew like furriers sew furs.	Do this once again and repeat until you have sewn up the whole wound after this fashion.	0.6081859
Sew the peritoneum once on one side with the edge of the skin, and leave it once on the other side until you are finished. As for the second type of specific suture that Galen also mentioned, these are his words verbatim.	In short, this way of suturing is to sew with the stitch used by furriers in sewing skins; thus you stitch the peritoneum once one way with the skin edge and leave it once the other way, until you have done. Now the manner of the second type of special stitch which Galen mentioned is this (these are his own words): that you suture it in the same way as many practitioners.	0.7522401
It is that you sew it similar to how some practitioners sew, in that they bring together each part to its naturally corresponding similar part.  So, they join the edge of the peritoneum to its other edge and the edge of the omentum to its other edge, and that is as I will describe to you.	That is, they suture each part to the part that corresponds naturally to it; so they join one peritoneal margin to the other and one skin margin to the other, in the manner I shall describe.	0.78376675
You should insert the needle into the edge of the omentum closest to you from the outside and pass it inwards into it alone, leaving the two edges of the peritoneum.  Then return the needle and pass it from the outside to the inside into both edges of the peritoneum.  Then return it again.	You should put the needle from without inwards, in that edge of the abdominal wall that is nearest to you, and make it pass inward through that alone, leaving out the peritoneal edges; then turn the needle round and run it from without inwards through both peritoneal edges. Then turn it round again and make it pierce, from within outwards, the other edge of the abdominal wall, on the opposite side.	0.8574863
And pass it from the inside to the outside into the other edge of the omentum which is on the opposite side. This type of suture is better than the common, easy suture, which is the suture mentioned previously. These are the words of Galen verbatim.  Some have said that suturing of the abdomen may be performed with two needles.	This type of suture is better than the easy general suture that has been mentioned. These are Galen's very words. Some have said that the suture of the abdomen may be performed with two needles, thus: you thread one thread into both and begin by introducing the needle into that part near you and carrying it through to the other side.	0.80708706
That is, you insert a single thread into them both, and you begin by inserting the needle from your side and passing it to the other side. Then insert the other needle from the opposite side, and pass it from your side, similar to the cobbler's stitch.	Then you insert the other needle on the far side and bring it through to the near side, after the manner of the shoemaker's stitch.	0.5505211
And know that if the perforation is in the middle of the abdomen, then its suturing is more difficult than in other areas of the abdomen. As for the treatment of the wound, its management in its treatment is the same as the management of other wounds, that is, if you find the wound fresh with its blood before the air changes it, and you return the intestine and suture it and secure it, then apply the desiccating, healing powders to it.	You must understand that when the fissure is in the middle of the abdomen the sewing of it is more difficult than in other parts of the abdomen. But the medical treatment of the wound comes under just the same heading as that of other wounds. When you find a wound with its blood quite fresh, before the atmosphere has altered it, and you have reduced the intestine and have sewn it up and closed it firmly, apply to it powder to encourage fresh growth.	0.84063804
If the wound has been changed by the air, then apply to it some of the ointments that you have prepared until it suppurates and the sutures fall off and the peritoneum and omentum heal.  Then treat it as you would treat other wounds until it heals.	But if the air has altered it, then apply to it some of the available ointments until it suppurates and the threads come away and the peritoneum and abdominal wall heal; then dress it as you would any other wound, until it is better.	0.83737445
If you do not have medicines available, then apply worn cotton to it from the time it begins to suppurate, and change it twice a day, as I have instructed you, until it heals.  You will not need any other treatment in most cases if the wounds are simple.  If you fear that the principal organs might share in the pain of the wound,	If you have no medicaments to hand, apply cotton wool as soon as suppuration begins, and change it twice daily, as I have taught you, until it heals. You will need no other treatment in the majority of cases when the wounds are simple.	0.9163425
then you should dip soft wool in moderately warm oil or in rose oil and place it around the areas between the groin and the armpit.  If he feels pain or putrefaction in his intestines, which often happens, then inject him with a tepid, black, astringent syrup.	But if you fear that the important organs may share the hurt of the wound, then you should dip some soft wool in moderately warm olive-oil or oil of roses and bind it round the various sites between the groin and the axillae. If pain or gangrene be felt in the bowels—and that frequently happens—then clyster him with tepid astringent black wine, particularly if the gangrene has already set in in the bowel and has become a wound penetrating to the abdominal cavity.	0.81281245
Especially if the putrefaction has reached the intestine and has become a penetrating wound into its cavity. And know that whatever part of the intestines is thick, it is easier to heal, and whatever part of them is thin, it is more difficult to heal.	You should know that if the injured bowel be the large intestine it will heal the more easily, while if it be the small its healing is more difficult.	0.60932267
As for the intestine known as the jejunum, it does not accept healing from a wound that occurs in it at all, due to the abundance of its vessels and their size, the thinness of its substance, and its proximity to the nature of the nerve. But if what protrudes from the wound is the omentum and you find it soft, then return it just as you return the intestine.	But the part of the bowel called the jejunum is not likely to recover from an injury to it at all; and that is due to the number and size of arteries in it and to the thinness of its structure and to its nearly approaching a nerve in its character. If what protrudes from the wound be omentum, and you find it freshly protruding, then reduce it as you do intestine.	0.88517785
If some time has passed and it has become green or black, then you should tie it with a thread above the place where it has blackened, lest bleeding occur, for there are veins and arteries in the omentum. Then cut what is below that ligature.	But if some time has lapsed and it has turned green or black, you should ligate it above the site where it has gone black lest there be a haemorrhage; for the omentum contains veins and arteries.	0.90262794
And make the ends of the thread hanging from below the wound outside of it, so that it is easy for you to pull it and remove it when the omentum falls off and the wound suppurates.  Mentioning the wound that occurs in the intestine.  Now, if a small tear occurs in the intestine...	Then cut off what is below the ligature and leave the ends of the thread hanging out from the lower part of the wound, so that it will be easy for you to draw upon it and extract it as the omentum falls away and the wound suppurates. A note on the wound occurring in the intestine.	0.81191653
It is possible that it may heal in some people, because I saw a man who had been wounded in his belly by a spear thrust, and the wound was to the right of the stomach. The wound became chronic and became a fistula from which feces and gas emerged.  I began to treat him although I did not expect him to heal.	When a break occurs in the intestine and it is a small one, it is possible, in some men, that it may mend. For I myself saw a man who had been wounded by a spear-thrust in the abdomen. The wound was to the right of the stomach, and, being chronic, became a fistula whence issued faeces and flatus.	0.8459729
I continued to treat him gently until he healed and the area closed.  When I saw that the area had closed, I feared that some misfortune would happen to the patient inside his abdomen, but no misfortune happened to him at all, and he remained in the best of conditions.	I set about treating him, though I had no hope of his recovery, and I continued to attend him, and eventually he recovered and the place healed over.	0.6487953
Healthy, he ate and drank and had intercourse and went to the bathhouse and exerted himself in his work. Some experienced people have mentioned that whenever a small wound occurs in the intestine, it should be stitched in this manner.	And when I saw that the place had healed over I was afraid for the patient lest some harm should occur in the abdominal cavity; but absolutely no harm arose from it, and he remained perfectly well and healthy, eating and drinking and engaging in coitus and going to the bath and carrying out the duties of his office.	0.5021609
That is, large-headed ants should be taken, then the edges of the wound brought together, then one of these ants, with its mouth open, should be placed on the edges of the wound. When it grips it and tightens its mouth, its head is cut off, for it adheres and does not dissolve. Then another ant is placed near the first.	Some men of experience have said that when a wound occurs in the intestine and it is small, it should be sutured in this manner, namely: ants with large heads are taken; then the edges of the wound are brought together and one of these ants is applied by its open jaws to the two edges of the wound, and when it seizes it and closes its jaws then the head is cut off, and it will stick and will not loosen.	0.67625755
You continue to do this with a number of ants according to the size of the wound, then return it and sew the wound.  Those heads remain adhering to the intestine until the intestine heals and recovers, and no harm happens to the patient at all.  It is also possible to sew the intestine with fine thread.	Then another ant is applied near the first; and you proceed after this manner with a number of ants according to the size of the wound. Then reduce the intestine and sew up the wound; for the heads will remain sticking to the intestine until it is healed up; and no harm will come to the patient. The intestine may also be sewn up with the fine suture which is extracted from an animal's gut and sticks to it after being threaded in a needle.	0.80525553
which is drawn from the mesentery of the animal attached to it after it is threaded into a needle.  That is, the end of this thread from the mesentery is drawn gently, then a thin, twisted linen thread is tied to its end, then that thread is inserted into the needle. And in it is the mesentery thread, with which the intestine is sewn, then returned to the cavity. This type of stitching with ants and mesentery is only by way of hope and expectation.	The intestine may also be sewn up with the fine suture which is extracted from an animal's gut and sticks to it after being threaded in a needle. The method is that the end is taken of this suture made of gut, well scraped; and to this end is fixed a fine linen thread, twisted, and then that thread is passed through the needle affixed to the suture of animal's gut, with which the intestine is sewn and then replaced in the abdominal cavity. These kinds of suture, with the ants and with the gut, are by way of a remote hope.	0.84492767
But if the perforation is large and wide, especially if it is in one of the thin intestines, there is no remedy for it, nor is there any cure at all.	But if the opening be great and wide, and especially if it be in one of the small intestines, there is no technique to deal with it, nor any cure.	0.90518486

Chapter Eighty-Six.	CHAPTER EIGHTY-SIX.	0.84618664
On the Treatment of Coryza and Fistula.	On the treatment of defluxions and fistulae.	0.71726745
Know that every wound or swelling, if it becomes chronic and old and becomes an ulcer and does not heal, and it constantly suppurates without ceasing, it is called in general, in whatever limb it may be, a fistula, and we call it coryza, and the fistula.	You should know that any wound or tumour, when it becomes old and chronic, and turns into an ulcer, and does not heal over, but discharges pus chronically and constantly, is generally called a fistula, in whatever part of the body it may be; but we call it a defluxion.	0.83490753
It is in reality a hard, solid, white concretion, without pain, having a cavity like the cavity of a bird's feather.	The fistula proper is a compact hard white painless induration with a central hollow like a bird's quill; on which account some call it a quill.	0.7011274
And for this reason some have called it a feather, and it is sometimes moist, constantly suppurating, and perhaps the moisture ceases at times, and this moisture may be copious or scanty, thick or thin.	At certain times it may be moist, constantly discharging pus; and again at certain times the moisture may cease; and the discharge may be greater or less; and it may be thick or thin.	0.75431645
And I have already stated in the classification, when mentioning wounds, that every ulcer that does not heal and in which flesh does not grow is due to one of nine causes, one of which is either a lack of blood in the body, or its poor quality, or because there is hard flesh inside it and on its lips that prevents the growth of good flesh. Or it is very dirty and filthy, or because the ulcer itself is putrid and the matter that supplies it is of poor quality, or because the medication is not suitable for its treatment, or because of corruption that has occurred in the town, such as a plague, or because of a particular characteristic of the town.	I said previously in the appropriate section, when I was discussing abscesses, that any ulcer that would not heal nor show growth of tissue was due to one of nine causes. One is lack, or poorness, of blood in the body; or it may be because the hardness of the tissues, internally and at the edges of the opening, prevents the growth of sound tissue; or it may be because of the abundance of foul and evil matter; or it may be because the ulcer is necrotic in itself and the matter that it discharges is of bad quality; as also it may be because the remedy used in treating it is not suitable; or again it may be because of corruption arising at that locality, of the nature of pestilence; or it may be due to something special and peculiar in the locality—as happens in the city of Saragossa, where diseases tend to linger and tumours are naturally slow to heal; or it may be due to one or more bones in it.	0.85396767
Or it is very dirty and filthy, or because the ulcer itself is putrid and the matter that supplies it is of poor quality, or because the medication is not suitable for its treatment, or because of corruption that has occurred in the town, such as a plague, or because of a particular characteristic of the town. As happened in the city of Zaragoza, where the maturation of diseases is difficult and the healing of swellings is naturally slow, or because there is one bone or several bones in it, and I have explained all these causes and their signs and treatments with medicines in the classification.	One is lack, or poorness, of blood in the body; or it may be because the hardness of the tissues, internally and at the edges of the opening, prevents the growth of sound tissue; or it may be because of the abundance of foul and evil matter; or it may be because the ulcer is necrotic in itself and the matter that it discharges is of bad quality; as also it may be because the remedy used in treating it is not suitable; or again it may be because of corruption arising at that locality, of the nature of pestilence; or it may be due to something special and peculiar in the locality—as happens in the city of Saragossa, where diseases tend to linger and tumours are naturally slow to heal; or it may be due to one or more bones in it. I have indeed already, in their proper place, explained all these causes and their symptoms and their medical treatments.	0.85155153
And it is necessary for me here to acquaint you with the treatment of fistulas and nasal catarrh, which is by manual operation. Know that fistulas can occur in all parts of the body. Some fistulas end at large veins and arteries or at a nerve.	Now here I must explain to you the operative treatment of fistula and defluxion.	0.47974563
Or to the peritoneum, or to the intestine, or to the bladder, or to a rib, or to a vertebra of the back, or to a joint of the many-jointed joints, such as the hand and the foot, and some of them lead to near a principal organ and so forth.	You should know that a fistula may happen in any part of the body; and some fistulae reach as far as some great vein or artery or nerve or membrane or intestine or the urinary bladder, or one of the ribs or dorsal vertebrae, or some highly complex joint such as the hand or foot, while some terminate quite near some major organ, and so on.	0.70060265
So what is of these fistulas of this description are among the diseases that are difficult to heal, which do not accept treatment, and working on them is hardship and ignorance. If there are fistulas that do not reach these places that I mentioned, and I hoped and aspired to treat them.	Fistulae of this kind are among the diseases from which recovery is difficult; they are not amenable to treatment and to occupy oneself with them is labour in vain. But if there are any fistulae which do not reach in depth the places we have mentioned, and you have some hope and expectation of curing them, and you wish to attain to recognizing these, then you take a probe of bronze or iron, if the fistula run in a straight line, and investigate it with that.	0.7311358
And you wanted to reach the knowledge of that, then take a probe of copper or iron if the fistula runs straight, then examine it with it. If there is a curvature in the fistula, then examine it with a probe of thin lead, because the lead softens its body.	But if there are any fistulae which do not reach in depth the places we have mentioned, and you have some hope and expectation of curing them, and you wish to attain to recognizing these, then you take a probe of bronze or iron, if the fistula run in a straight line, and investigate it with that. But if the fistula be tortuous then investigate it with a thin leaden probe; for lead is soft, so as to flex on entry and follow the curves of the fistula.	0.7583104
So it slips upon entry and bends towards the curvature. If the fistula has many openings, you cannot investigate them with the probe, so inject one of its openings, for the moisture that you inject with it will travel towards the other openings and flow out.	But if the fistula have multiple openings so that you cannot explore it with the probe, then make an injection into one of the openings. The fluid you inject into that one will run to the other openings and flow out from them.	0.8693253
From them, then investigate thoroughly in any way you can, so that you know if there is a bone or a nerve, or if the bottom of the fistula is far or near, or if it is a single fistula with many openings.  Understand all of that to the best of your ability by inquiring of the sick person about the presence of pain when you press your hand on the place.	Then make a complete exploration by whatever means you can, to find out whether there be at that place a bone or nerve, and whether the fistula be deep or superficial, and whether the fistula be one with multiple openings. Inform yourself of all these points, exerting yourself to inquire of the patient whether he feels pain while you are compressing with the hand, and seeking other indications and causes of tumour that may arise.	0.8703167
And such as that of the signs and causes incidental to the swelling. So, if you understand all of that with certainty, then at that time proceed to the treatment with confidence, which is that you consider, if it is.	When you have made quite certain of all these points, then proceed confidently with the treatment, namely: see if the fístula be obvious and accessible, or in a harmless situation far removed from a joint or vein or artery or tendon or any of the other places I have mentioned to you.	0.44738686
The fistula is superficial and near, or in a healthy place, far from a joint, nerve, artery, vein, or one of the places that I mentioned to you, then incise the fistula according to what preceded in my description, and extract what is in it of induration, corrupt flesh, and excess flesh.	Then lay open the fístula by the method I have described and fetch out of it all the granulations and diseased and superfluous tissue and whatever tissue or growth be arising in its opening, and dress until healed.	0.5981451
And what grows in its opening of flesh or caruncle, and such as that, and treat it until it heals. If the fistula is deep-seated, and it is straight, it is appropriate that you incise it in the depth as much as you can, then cleanse it from all of its corrupt flesh.	If the termination of the fistula lies deep and its course be straight, you should cut it open as far in as you can and then clean out of it all diseased tissue; then use swabs soaked in corrosive, and push them to the bottom of the fistula, which is as far as you can reach with the probe.	0.6574092
Then use twisted pledgets dipped in sharp medications and insert them to the bottom of the fistula, which you reach with the iron instrument.  Do this to it repeatedly until that sharp medication consumes all that remains in the bottom of the fistula of corruption.	Do this repeatedly until the caustic has destroyed all the superfluous matter remaining at the bottom of the fistula.	0.557309
Then dress it with the ointments that generate healthy flesh until it heals.  If it does not heal with that, then cauterize it according to what preceded its description.  If the cause of the fistula is bone, and that is confirmed for you, then explore it and incise it according to what I informed you, if a preventative does not prevent you from that.	Then dress it with ointments that make the flesh grow sound, until it heals. But if it does not heal thus, then cauterize it in the prescribed way. If a bone be the cause of the fistula, and you are sure of that, then examine the fistula and open it up in the way I have told you, if there be nothing in the way like a blood-vessel or nerve or important organ, as we said.	0.85101855
A vessel or nerve, or a principal organ as we said.  If the bone is revealed to you and there is some corruption and blackness in it, scrape it until its corruption is gone, then treat it with what makes it heal until it heals.  If it does not heal and pus continues as it was doing,	And if the bone is laid bare to you and there be in it some corruption and blackening, then scrape it until all the corruption be removed; then put on dressings that will encourage granulation, until it be healed. If it does not heal but discharges pus in the way it did before, then you may know that you have not yet managed to extirpate the corruption completely.	0.6647546
then know that you did not reach all of the removal of the corruption.  Expose all that is on it again and be thorough in its scraping and cleansing with your utmost effort, then dress it.  If it heals, then good, otherwise know that that corruption is in a deep recess of corruption, expose all that is on it again.	If it does not heal but discharges pus in the way it did before, then you may know that you have not yet managed to extirpate the corruption completely. Therefore you must expose it again and with the utmost diligence carry out the scraping and cleaning of it. Then dress it; and if it heals, good; if not, then you may know that this corruption is very deep-seated in the body and out of reach, and there is nothing you can do for it but leave it to nature.	0.7797614
And be thorough in its scraping and cleansing with your utmost effort.  If the corrupt bone is a small bone and you are able to extract it, then extract it with the delicate hooks which are suited for that.	If the diseased bone be a small one, and it be possible for you to extract it, then do so with a pair of fine forceps suited to the purpose.	0.71790093
If they are many bones, then be thorough in extracting them all, and do not leave anything of them to the best of your ability.  If something of the ligaments obstructs you before them, and there is no danger in cutting them, then cut those ligaments and flesh, if there is any there, and free the bones.	And if there be a number of bones then you must accurately carry out the extraction of all of them, and spare no effort to ensure that none is left. If any ligaments lie in your way and there be no danger in incising them, then make an incision into the ligaments and whatever tissues are there, and free the bones.	0.87615293
If you are unable to extract the bones at this time, then apply to the wound what will make it putrefy and leave it for days until what is around those bones of flesh and ligaments putrefies. And protect the wound so that the incision that you made during your work does not close.	If it is not possible for you to extract the bone immediately, apply over the wound something to induce suppuration, and leave it for some days until suppuration has set in in the tissues and ligaments around the bones.	0.78026724
Rather, if you fear that, place upon it cotton dipped in powdered sulfur with oil or cotton dipped in Egyptian ointment or one of the green ointments. For if those ligaments putrefy and the bones are freed, it will be easy to extract and pull them.	Keep an eye on the wound lest the incision that you made during your operation close up; if you fear this, apply to it cotton wool soaked in sulphur beaten with olive-oil, or cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment or in one of the green ointments. Then, when those ligaments have been softened by putrefaction and the bones crumble, it will be easy to shift them and take them out.	0.8307897
If it is one large bone, such as the tibia or femur bone and the like, and what has become corrupt of it is its surface only, then scrape it thoroughly until that blackness and corruption is gone, then treat the wound. If what is corrupted of it is a large part, and the corruption has reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to saw it.	If it be one large bone such as the tibia or the femur or the like, and the diseased part be only the surface, then scrape it thoroughly until all the blackness and corruption is gone, then close the wound. If the corrupt portion be very extensive and reach to the marrow of the bone, you will not be able to avoid sawing it off and cutting it all away to the point where the corruption ends; then dress until healed.	0.91463965
And cut it all the way to where the corruption ends, then treat it until it heals.  And I will tell you about a case that occurred to a man in his leg, for you to take it as an example and aid in your treatment.  This man was young in age.	Now I shall tell you of a defluxion that once occurred in a man's leg, as an example and a help to you in your treatment.	0.62382114
About thirty years old, he experienced pain in his leg due to a cause that affected him from inside the body until the substances reached the leg, and it swelled with a great swelling, and there was no external cause. Then time passed with errors by the doctors until the swelling opened.	This man was young, about thirty years of age. He once got a pain in the leg from something internal, which so worked that eventually matter came into the leg and caused it to swell greatly, there being no external cause.	0.79744637
And many substances flowed from it, and his treatment was mishandled until the leg became putrid and developed many openings, all of which exuded pus and bodily fluids. A group of doctors treated him for about two years, and among them was no one skilled in surgery.	And time passed by, to the accompaniment of error on the part of the doctors, until the tumour opened and much discharge came away; and the treatment was so mismanaged that fistulae formed in the leg and many sinuses opened up, all of which discharged pus and body humours. A whole host of doctors had been treating it for a matter of two years, not one of whom had any skill in the surgical art.	0.81738734
Until they came to me, and I saw his leg, and the substances were flowing profusely from those openings, and the man's body had become thin, and his color yellow. I inserted the probe into one of those openings, and the probe reached the bone. Then I examined all of the openings.	Eventually he sought me. I saw his leg, with matter coming away from the orifices in large quantities; and the man's body was wasted and jaundiced. So I introduced a probe into one of the openings and the probe touched bone.	0.79545724
And I found them leading to one another from all sides of the leg, so I proceeded and made an incision on one of the openings until I exposed some of the bone.  I found it corrupt, eroded, blackened, putrefied and perforated until the perforation reached the marrow.  So I widened what was exposed to me.	Then I investigated all the openings and found them all communicating with one another in all parts of the leg. So I quickly cut down upon one of these openings until a part of the bone was laid bare, and I found it diseased, by now eaten away, and black and foul and full of holes, down to the marrow. So I sawed off as much of the diseased bone as I had exposed and could get at.	0.8582922
And I dealt with the corrupt bone, thinking that there was no other corruption in the bone other than what I had cut and exposed, and that I had eradicated it. Then I began to dress the wound with healing medications for a long period, but it did not heal. Then I returned and exposed the bone again, above the first exposure.	So I sawed off as much of the diseased bone as I had exposed and could get at. In fact I thought that there was no more disease in the bone beyond what I had cut and sawn away, and that I had completely eradicated it. Then I tried for a very long time to heal the wound with medicines encouraging growth of flesh, but it would not heal. Then I again uncovered the bone, above the first opening, and found the corruption co-extensive with the bone.	0.8628527
And I found the corruption connected to the bone, so I also exposed what appeared to me of that corruption. Then I tried to heal it, but it neither healed nor closed. Then I examined it again, and I continued to cut the bone piece by piece and tried to heal it, but it did not heal, until I had cut off about a span of the bone.	So again I sawed away as much of the corruption as I could see; then I tried to heal it, but it would not heal nor unite. Then I opened it up once more and went on cutting away the bone piecemeal and trying to heal it, and it would not heal until I had cut away about a span of bone with the marrow; then I treated it medicinally and it quickly healed over and was cured.	0.8829789
And I removed it with its marrow, then I dressed it with medications, and it healed quickly and he recovered. This repetition in the procedure and incisions was necessary because of the patient's weakness and low tolerance, and my fear of his death, because he was experiencing severe fainting from excessive vomiting at all times.  Then he recovered completely.	But it would not have been necessary to repeat the operation and the incision thus, were it not for the patient's weakness and inability to tolerate much at a time, and because of my fears for his life, since an evil faint was constantly seizing him on account of the heavy drain.	0.65663075
And solid flesh grew in the place of the bone, and his body was restored to health, and his strength returned, and he managed his affairs.  And he did not experience any harmful affliction in walking whatsoever. If a protruding bone in a part of the body is broken…	But he was completely cured, and in place of the bone there grew up firm tissue; his bodily state was sound and his strength was restored. He went about his business, and no hurt whatsoever came to him from walking.	0.81671894
It should be exposed in this manner: Take a bandage and tie it to the end of the protruding bone, and have someone pull it upwards. Then use another bandage, made of wool thicker than the first bandage.	Now in the case of a prominent bone that has been broken in any part of the body, it should be sawn off in this manner: you take a ligature and tie it to the extremity of the prominent bone and bid someone keep it stretched upward; then you put on another ligature of wool thicker than the first, tying it to the tissue that is beneath the bone, and pull on the end so that the flesh is drawn down and you lay bare of flesh the spot where you intend to saw, so that the saw does not injure the flesh.	0.6519301
Then tie it to the flesh beneath the bone and pull its end so that the flesh is drawn downwards. Meanwhile, you expose the flesh from the place you want to saw so that the saw does not injure the flesh.  Place a piece of wood or a board firmly beneath the bone.	You should place a block of wood or a board firmly beneath the bone; which done, there is no hindrance to the saw's cutting through the diseased bone.	0.6945529
Because if you do this, the saw will not be hindered from cutting the corrupted bone.  The sawing should be slightly above the corrupted area so that there is no corruption within the cavity of the bone which is not apparent on the surface, forcing you to saw it again.	The saw-cut should be made a little above the site of the disease in case there should be disease in the cavity of the bone that is not apparent on the surface, which might compel you to carry out the sawing a second time.	0.7003356
If the bone is corrupted but not protruding, but rather connected together, and the corruption is in its middle or in some part of it, then expose the flesh from all its sides. Then place the wood underneath and saw it from the first side where the corruption is.	If the bone be diseased without any swelling, but it all seems the same from one part to another, and the disease be in the middle or in one segment of it, then expose it on all sides; put the block beneath, and saw it from the first side, where the disease is.	0.8013043
When you have finished sawing it, saw it from the other side, and let the sawing be a little distance from the corruption, as we have said.  If the corruption is in a joint, cut the corrupted joint itself and saw the bone where it connects on the other side.	When you have finished this, saw it from the other side. The saw-cut should be at a little distance from the diseased part, as we have already said. If the disease be in one of the phalanges, amputate the diseased phalanx and saw through the bone where it is continuous on the other (healthy) side.	0.7456331
If the corruption is in the connection of two joints, there is no remedy other than scraping.  If the corruption is in the metacarpus of the hand or the metatarsus of the foot, the matter of its treatment is very difficult, but you should scrape the corruption however it appears to you, and scrape it and clean it in whatever way you can.	If the disease be in the joint between two members, then there is nothing to be done but scraping. If the disease be in the carpus or tarsus it is a very difficult matter treating them; you must peel off the disease in whatever way seems possible, and scrape it away and clean up the part in whatever way you can and by whatever technique is convenient for you, so long as there is no vein or nerve in your way.	0.79303145
And by whatever method works for you, as long as you do not encounter a vein or nerve. Know that the chisels and saws for cutting these bones are many, according to the position of the bones, their placement, their thickness and thinness, their size and smallness, their hardness and porosity. Therefore, it is necessary to prepare for each type of work a tool suitable for that work.	Now you should know that there are a great number of cutting instruments and saws for cutting these bones, varying according to the different sites and arrangements of the bones; their thickness or thinness; their greatness or smallness; their hardness or sponginess; so you should have ready for every sort of operation an instrument suitable for that operation.	0.83208585
And know that the procedures themselves may guide you to the type of instrument that you need if you have long practice and knowledge of the arts of this craft, because whoever has mastered the craft has witnessed various kinds of diseases. So he may devise for himself tools suitable for each disease, and I will depict for you at the end of this chapter a number of instruments.	You should know too that when you have long experience and knowledge of the branches of this art the operations themselves may well indicate the kind of instrument needed; for the man who is skilled in the art and has seen various kinds of disease may think out for himself which instrument is suitable for each disease.	0.8676878
Make them examples to emulate and a standard by which you can measure others, God willing. Image of a saw:	At the end of this chapter I give you illustrations of a number of instruments as types for you to copy and as a pattern upon which you can base others, God willing: Saw.	0.5447689

chapter-2-subchapter-87.txt
Chapter eighty-seven.	CHAPTER EIGHTY-SEVEN.	0.830776
On the amputation of limbs and sawing of bones.	On the amputation of limbs and the sawing-off of bones.	0.9873115
Limbs may become gangrenous, either from an external cause or an internal one. If you have treated this corruption with medicinal treatment, and the treatment has not been successful, and you see the corruption spreading in the limb, nothing stopping it.	Sometimes the extremities become gangrenous, either from an external or an internal cause. Now when you have treated this disease by medical means, ineffectively, and you see that the disease is spreading over the limb and nothing will stop it, you must cut off that limb as far as the disease has spread, so that the patient may escape death or great affliction, greater than the loss of the limb.	0.7361902
Then it is necessary to amputate that limb up to where the corruption has reached, so that the patient may be saved thereby from death, or from a great affliction that is greater than the loss of the limb.  And the sign of what has happened to him is that the limb blackens until you think that fire has burned it.	Now the sign of the victim of this state is that the limb goes black, so that you might think it were burnt with fire, or, after the blackening, it putrefies, and the putrefaction spreads to parts adjacent to that limb and begins to attack the whole body; cut it away as soon as you can.	0.6303442
Or it putrefies after the blackness until that putrefaction spreads to what is next to that limb and takes over the whole body, so hasten to amputate it. Likewise, if the cause of the corruption is from the sting of some venomous creatures, such as a sea scorpion, or a viper, or a tarantula, and the like.	So must you do if the disease is caused by the bite of some dangerous reptile such as the marine scorpion, viper, or venomous spider, and so on.	0.49249238
If the corruption or the sting is at the tip of the finger, then amputate the finger and do not allow the corruption to spread to the hand.  And likewise, if it has taken hold in the hand, then amputate it from the base of the forearm, and do not allow the corruption to spread until it takes hold in the two bones of the arm.	If the disease or bite be at the tip of the finger, cut off the finger, giving the disease no opportunity to spread to the rest of the hand. Similarly, if it attacks the hand, cut if off at the wrist, giving the disease no opportunity to spread and attack the two bones of the forearm.	0.85123867
And likewise, if it has taken hold in the arm, then amputate the arm at the elbow in the joint itself. But if the corruption has spread and you see it has reached towards the shoulder, then do not amputate the shoulder at all, for in that is the death of the patient.  And use other treatment to the extent possible.	Similarly, if it attacks the forearm, cut it off at the elbow through the joint itself. If the disease passes onward and you perceive that it has reached the region of the shoulder, by no means cut the shoulder, for that will be the death of the patient; use any treatment but that, as best you may.	0.8636915
And likewise, you do with the foot: if the corruption has taken hold in the toe, then amputate the toe at one of the phalanges. And if it has taken hold in the metatarsus of the foot, then amputate the entire foot. If it has ascended to the knee, then amputate the leg at the knee joint.	In the same manner act in regard to the foot when the disease attacks a toe; namely, amputate the toe through one of the interphalangeal joints. If the disease attacks the tarsus then amputate the whole foot; and if it ascends toward the knee, amputate the leg at the knee-joint.	0.86483836
And if the corruption has reached above the knee, then there is no recourse but to leave it and surrender the patient to death. The method of amputating the limb or excising it is to tie a ligature below the place you want to amputate and tie another ligature above the place.	If it be that the disease has passed on above the knee, there is nothing of any avail in this case but to leave it, and for the patient to resign himself to death.	0.6602464
And an assistant stretches the one ligature downwards, and another assistant stretches the upper ligature upwards, and you expose the flesh between the two ligatures with a broad scalpel until all the flesh is exposed, then it is amputated or excised. And it is necessary to place linen rags on all sides.	Now the way to amputate or saw off a limb is to bind a ligature round below the site and another above; an assistant draws the one downward and another assistant draws the upper ligature upward; while you dissect away the tissues between the two ligatures with a broad scalpel until it is laid bare of flesh; then it should be cut or sawn.	0.8654867
So that the saw does not touch the healthy area, which would cause the patient additional pain and a hot swelling. If bleeding occurs during your work, cauterize the area quickly or apply some styptic powders, then return to your treatment until you are finished.	You must place linen dressings on every side lest the saw touch a part that is sound and thus cause the patient additional pain and inflammation. If a haemorrhage occurs while you are operating, cauterize the place as quickly as possible, or apply to it one or other of the styptic powders; then continue until finished.	0.79871476
Then bandage the wounded limb with a suitable bandage and treat it until it heals.  I will tell you about an example: this same condition that I am describing to you occurred in a man's leg, namely, blackness appeared in his leg with a burning sensation resembling fire.	Then bind up the mutilated limb with a suitable bandage and dress until healed. Now I shall relate to you an example; what I am going to tell you is exactly what happened to a certain man's foot. He had a blackening of the foot, with a burning like that of fire.	0.8889769
And that corruption first occurred in his toe until it took the entire leg. So the man hastened, on his own, when he saw the corruption spreading in the limb, with the intensity of the pain and burning he was experiencing, to amputate it at the joint and he recovered.	The disease, to begin with, was in one toe, but it went on to involve the whole foot. When the man saw the disease spreading in the limb and felt the violent pain and burning, he hastened of his own accord to amputate it at the joint, and he got better.	0.80024874
Then, after a long time had passed, this same corruption appeared in his index finger, so he came to me. I intended to repel that excess with the medicines that I applied to the hand after cleansing his body, but the excess was not repelled and began to spread to the other finger.	After a long time had passed the very same kind of disease arose in the forefinger of his hand. He came to me, and I attempted to suppress the superfluity with remedies that I applied to the hand, after purging his body; but the superfluity was not to be suppressed and began to spread to the second finger, and eventually the whole hand was involved in the disease.	0.8700839
Until the corruption spread in the hand, he asked me to amputate his hand, but I refused him, hoping that I could repel that excess, and I also feared death for him if his hand were amputated, because the man's strength was failing. So, when he despaired of me, he returned to his town.	He urged me to cut off his hand, but I did not wish to do this, hoping I should be able to overcome the superfluity, and also fearing he would die at the amputation of his hand, for the man's strength was on the decline.	0.7752597
Then I heard about him that he hastened to amputate his entire hand and recovered. I have told this story only so that it may be of help in cases of this kind of disease and so that it may be a guide to be followed and acted upon.	When he despaired of me he went back to his own country, and I then heard that he had gone and cut off his whole hand, and got well. I narrate this story as help against this kind of malady when it occurs; and as guidance for you to take and act upon.	0.80686873

Chapter Eighty-Eight.	CHAPTER EIGHTY-EIGHT.	0.81960535
On the treatment of fistulas and how to inject them with medications.	On the treatment of sinuses and the way to irrigate them.	0.7005313
If a swelling occurs in some fleshy organ and the swelling lasts for a long time until it gathers pus, then bursts open or is lanced, and all the pus that was in it comes out, and the place remains empty as if it were a vessel.	When an abscess occurs in any of the fleshy parts and becomes chronic and eventually collects pus, and then it breaks open or is perforated, and all the contained matter comes out and the site is left hollow, like a vessel, and the overlying skin thinned like a rag, but the suppuration has not gone so far as to involve bone or tendon or ligament—and hence it merits the name of 'sinus' and is not called a fistula.	0.7886405
And the skin over it, like a rag, has thinned and the corruption has not reached the bone, nor the nerve, nor the ligament, and for this reason it deserves to be called a fistula.  It is not called a deep fistula unless its duration is prolonged until the corruption affects one of these organs.	But if it goes on until the disease involves any of these parts it is then called a fistula or defluxion.	0.45437384
Then it is called a deep fistula or an ulcer. Its treatment is to cut all of that skin around it, especially if it has thinned and become like a rag, and you are certain that it will not adhere to the area due to its corruption.	The treatment of it will be to cut away all that skin with a circular incision; specially if it be thinned and has become like a rag, and you are sure that it will not adhere to the place, because of its corruption.	0.6537711
If you hope that the skin will adhere, and the corruption has not reached that extent, and there is thickness of flesh in the skin, then treat it with an injection.  That is, you examine the fistula, and if it is large, and the pus that flows from it has a foul odor, then inject it with the Egyptian medicine.	But if you are in hope of its adhering, and the corruption has not reached that point, and there is in the skin some thickness of flesh, then treat it by irrigation.	0.67284465
Which is vinegar, oil, honey, and verdigris, equal parts, combined in a vessel and cooked over a fire until the medicine thickens and becomes as thick as honey. Then take what you need from it and thin it with water and honey, and inject it into the fistula, and tie its opening, and leave the medicine in it for about two hours.	The procedure is that you examine the sinus, and if it be large and the purulent discharge from it smell bad, then irrigate it with Egyptian medicine, which is vinegar, oil, honey and verdigris, equal parts of each, mixed in a vessel and heated on the fire until the compound thickens and assumes the consistency of honey. Then take as much as you need and dilute it with water and honey, and with this irrigate the sinus and bind up the opening, leaving the compound inside for two hours.	0.8194474
Then expel it by squeezing. Do this for days until the fistula cleanses and the foul odor disappears. It may also be injected with lye water if this medicine is not available, and that is that you take the ash of vine wood or the ash of oak wood and pour water over it.	Then get it out by pressure. Do this for several days until the sinus is clean and the smell disappears. It may be irrigated with water of ashes if the medicine is not at hand. For that, you take ashes of vine or of oak, and put water upon them; then clarify the liquor and with it irrigate the sinus until you are sure it is thoroughly clean.	0.8608488
Then filter it and inject it until you are certain that the fistula has been washed.  If the patient cannot tolerate the Egyptian medicine, nor lye water, then inject him with water and honey mixed with a little powdered verdigris.	But if the patient cannot tolerate the Egyptian medicine nor the water of ashes, then irrigate him with water and honey with which a little pounded verdigris has been mixed; or irrigate with honey and wine mingled; the value of the honey lies in its cleansing and washing, while the wine closes up the sinus, specially if it be a wine which has some dryness and astringency.	0.67972004
Or inject it with honey and wine mixed together, because it is the nature of honey to cleanse and wash, and wine to adhere the fistula, especially if the wine has an excess of astringency and dryness.  So when you have done this several times and are certain that the corruption of the fistula is gone, then inject it with what will generate flesh in it.	When you have done this several times and you are sure that the sinus is clean of diseased matter, then irrigate it with those compounds that will encourage granulation in it.	0.42249447
Such as taking some of the date palm ointment and dissolving it with rose oil and astringent wine, or injecting it with some of the other medicines and ointments whose recipes we have established in the chapter on ointments. If the opening of the fistula is narrow, not wide enough for the injection tube,	For example, you may take a little Palm ointment and dissolve it in oil of roses and some astringent wine; or irrigate it with some of the other ointments and medicines whose prescriptions we have recorded in the treatise on ointments.	0.8337208
then widen it slightly with the iron, or place in it a wick soaked in the Egyptian ointment or the squirting cucumber ointment until it widens.  Likewise, if the opening is too wide, bring its lips together with stitching, and leave an opening just large enough for the injection tube to enter, and no more.	If the opening of the sinus be too narrow for the nozzle of the syringe, open it up slightly with the knife, or put in it a pad steeped in Egyptian ointment or vermilion ointment, until it is dilated. On the other hand, if the opening be wide, bring the edges together with a suture, and leave of it sufficient width that the syringe may be only just introduced.	0.8394916
And similarly, if its mouth from which the pus flows is elevated, then cut it at its lowest point so that the pus will drain downwards, because if pus collects in the depths of the fistula, it will prevent flesh from growing in it.	In the same way, if the opening from which the discharge flows be raised up, then incise it at its lowest part so that the discharge may flow downward out of it; for when the discharge collects at the bottom of the sinus it prevents the formation of flesh in it.	0.8665842
If you cannot cut the fistula downwards as you wish, then you must position the limb in a way that the pus flows easily, as best you can, and be careful that none of the pus is retained at all.	If you cannot open it up as you wish at the lower point, then try to set the part in whatever position you conveniently can to facilitate the discharge of pus, and try to ensure that no pus is held up in it.	0.74661946
several days.  As for the one on the mouth of the fistula, you should remove it frequently to let out the accumulated pus, and to determine whether the discharge flowing from it is copious or scant, mature or immature.	But the dressing over the sinus opening you may constantly remove, so that the pus collected behind it may come out and so that you may know whether there be much or little ichor, and whether digested or not.	0.6083853
In addition to this, also examine the site of the fistula itself: does the patient feel pain there or not, and is there swelling or not?  When your treatment has continued in this way, and you see that the matter exiting the mouth of the fistula is slight,	And at the same time investigate the site of the sinus itself to see whether the patient feels any pain in it or no pain, and whether there be any swelling in it or not. Then when your treatment has reached such a point that you see that there is only a little superficial matter coming out round the mouth of the sinus, you may know that the sinus has closed up or is near to closing up.	0.7653128
know that the fistula has closed, or is about to close. Then undo it the next day, or on the third day. And when you undo the wound, replace the cloths with others, and renew the ointment. If, after a long time, thin pus comes out of the fistula, do not despair of its closing.	Then you may unbandage it the next day or the third day, and when the wound is unbandaged make a change of dressing and ointment. But if, after a long while, the sinus discharges a thin ichor, do not despair of its closing up, for its healing is near.	0.8233153
Its healing is near, because the growth of flesh in some people's wounds is slow, while in others it is the opposite.  If, after many days, immature pus emerges from the fistula, know that the fistula has not closed. If the closing of the fistula is delayed,	For there are some men whose wounds are slow in healing, and some are the opposite. If, after many days, undigested pus is discharged you may know that the sinus has not closed.	0.7529352
and the matter is prolonged, increase the desiccating medications.  Let the medications be moist in consistency, and dry in potency, such as the palm ointment, especially if an extra amount of litharge has been added. Among the most effective treatments is to take the palm ointment	If the closing of the sinus be delayed and it be a long affair, make the medicines dryer; let them be medicines that have some humidity in their substance but dryness in their potency, such as Palm ointment with the addition of excess of rock-alum. A most efficacious treatment is to take Palm ointment and dissolve it in oil of roses and sprinkle over it old wine of even consistency. Then knead together, and use that.	0.7025332
and dissolve it with rose oil, sprinkle it with old, moderately consistent wine, then knead it with it and use it.  You can do the same thing if you don't have palm ointment, by using honey, cooked until it thickens, or take myrrh, aloe, and frankincense, grind them all together, and sprinkle them on the honey while it is on the fire. Then spread it on a cloth and tie it over the fistula, or spread the honey, which you have cooked until thick, sprinkle the medicines on it, place the cloth over it, and tie it.	Then knead together, and use that. The same sort of thing may be done with honey if you have no Palm ointment at hand; if you heat the honey to a thick consistency and use that; or take myrrh and aloes and incense of juniper and beat them all up together and sprinkle on the honey while it is heating on the fire, spread on lint and bind over the sinus; or spread on it honey heated to a thickness, and over that sprinkle powdered aromatic roots, and over these place a dressing that you bandage on.	0.8737248
Aristolochia longa, orris root, garden cress flour, and centaury can be used in similar fashion, either individually or combined. Grind and sift them, sprinkle them on the honey as described, and use it. If the fistula persists and does not heal with this treatment, know that there is deep corruption.	Sometimes also in a case of this sort long birthwort and the root of the blue iris and vetch flour and centaury are usable, either separately or mixed, beaten up together, sifted and scattered into honey as I described; use them thus.	0.6951536
And if it has affected the bones or other hard nerves or ligaments, treat it as a fistula as described above.	But if the sinus be chronic, and it does not heal with this treatment, then you may know that there is corruption at the bottom of it, which has affected the bones or motor nerves or ligaments; the treatment then is that of fistula as already given.	0.63607836

On the treatment of an ingrown nail, a bruised nail, amputating extra fingers, and separating webbed fingers.	On the treatment of paronychia and broken nails; and on the amputation of a superfluous finger; and the separation of webbed fingers.	0.7684421
An ingrown nail is excess flesh that grows under the thumbnail or toenail, and sometimes grows under other nails. If it is neglected and left untreated, it swells into a hot, inflamed lump.	Paronychia is a growth of flesh under the nail of the thumb or big toe; it may also occur in the other fingers and toes.	0.57902145
Or pus develops until it erodes the base of the nail, and sometimes destroys it completely, and sometimes the infection reaches the bone until it has a foul odor, and the tip of the finger becomes wide, and its color becomes livid. If you treat it as described in the chapter on incisions and your treatment is not successful.	When it is chronic and the treatment of it is neglected, it comes up as an abscess, or corrupts and generates pus until it eats away the root of the nail. Often it rots it entirely, and often the disease reaches the bone and gives rise to foetor and broadens the tip of the finger and makes it livid in colour.	0.80437815
Then you should cut away with a knife all the excess that grows from the nail, then cauterize the wound afterwards, for cauterization in this case is very beneficial.  However, if the bone is healthy and the nail is also healthy,	When you have treated it with those means mentioned in their place, and your treatment is ineffective, you must excise all the superfluous growth from the nail and then cauterize the wound, for in this case cauterization is a great help.	0.7495312
and the corner of the nail has pressed the flesh inwards and caused it to be pricked and hurt, then you should place a thin probe under the corner of the nail that is pricking the flesh and lift it up, and gently cut away that flesh.	But if the bone be healthy and the nail also healthy, and the in-turned angle of the nail has pressed the flesh inwards and begun to stab it and injure it, you should pass a thin probe beneath the corner of the nail that presses into the flesh, and raise it up and carefully cut away that flesh and apply caustic to the remainder, until it is all gone; then dress with ointments until cured.	0.7592752
And apply to the remaining flesh some of the caustic burning medications until it is all gone, then treat it with ointments until it heals. But if the infection has affected the bone, then you should cut away that bone and remove it, for it will not heal as long as there is any diseased bone in it at all.	But if it should be that the disease has already begun to involve bone, that bone should be excised and removed; for it will never heal while there remains any diseased bone.	0.67435277
If you see the erosion and infection spreading in the finger, then amputate it at one of the phalanges as previously mentioned, then treat it until it heals.  If the nail receives a blow or crush and severe pain occurs in it, then you should first bleed the patient.	And if you see the corrosion and corruption spreading in the finger, amputate it at one of the joints, as has been previously mentioned; then dress it until it is healed. If a laceration or bruising happen to the nail, with violent pain, you should first bleed the patient and then cut away the nail with a sharp scalpel, a swerving cut from top to bottom.	0.86193645
Then incise the nail with a sharp scalpel, an oblique incision from top to bottom, taking care not to reach the flesh under the nail with the incision, for you will thereby cause the patient severe pain, and it will be a cause for the growth of excess flesh in the area. Then treat the area with what relieves pain.	But be careful not to cut into the nail-bed, for you will give the patient violent pain and it will cause a growth of superfluous flesh at the place. Then dress the part with sedative dressings.	0.6823996
As for the extra finger that develops on some people's hands, it is sometimes entirely fleshy, and sometimes it has bones in it, and sometimes it has a nail, and some of them grow at the base of the joint of some of the fingers.	A superfluous finger growing on the hands of some men sometimes is all flesh, sometimes contains a bone, sometimes has a nail.	0.7607354
Or they may grow on one of the phalanges of the finger, and those that grow on one of the phalanges of the finger do not move, while those that grow at the joint of the finger may move. So what is entirely fleshy, cutting it is easy, and that is that you cut it at its base with a broad scalpel.	Some of them arise at the root of a finger, or on one of the phalanges of a finger, and the latter do not move, while those that arise from the root of a finger do sometimes move. That which is purely fleshy is easily removed; you cut if off at the root with a broad scalpel.	0.83548033
As for those that grow at the base of the joint, their treatment is difficult, so avoid cutting them.  As for those that grow on the finger at one of the phalanges, you should first cut the flesh around it circularly down to the bone, then saw the bone with one of the appropriate saws.	But the treatment of that which arises at the root of a finger is difficult; you should avoid amputating. In the case of one growing from the finger at a phalangeal joint, you should first cut through the flesh down to the bone with a circular incision; then saw the bone through, with one of the saws that suit the purpose; then dress it until it heals.	0.8452167
Then treat it until it heals.  As for the adhesion that occurs between fingers, it often happens, and it can be something a person is born with, or it can happen when a wound or burn heals, and so on. You should incise that adhesion.	As for webbing of the fingers one to another, that occurs very frequently. It may be either congenital or from the healing of a wound or burn or the like.	0.7299472
until the fingers return to their natural state. Then place between them lint or rags soaked in rose oil so that it does not quickly adhere, and separate them, or put a thin lead plate between them until the area heals as it should.	You have to cut the web away until the fingers are brought back to their original form; then interpose between them a pad or piece of material soaked in oil of roses, to prevent them from rapidly joining together and to keep them apart; or you can put between them a thin sheet of lead until the healing takes place as it should.	0.864592
And similarly, if adhesion occurs between some of the fingers and the palm, incise that adhesion according to what is possible and what will restore the proper form of the limb.	Similarly, if one of the fingers becomes joined to the palm of the hand, cut through the adhesion according to the form it takes, and with proper regard for the shape of the member.	0.7313119

On the excision of varicose veins.	On cutting for varices.	0.769034
Varicose veins are twisted, thick veins filled with black morbid matter. They occur in most parts of the body, and most commonly in the legs, especially in porters, bath attendants, and grape harvesters. It is best to first employ strong purges of black bile several times.	Varices are thick twisted veins filled with melancholic superfluities. They occur in most parts of the body, but generally in the legs, particularly in the legs of couriers and ploughmen and porters. First you must purge the body free from black bile, several times, strongly.	0.84869343
Then bleed the patient from the basilic vein. As for treatment with iron, it is of two types: one is to incise and drain the black blood, and the other is to extract the entire vein. As for incising it, it is done in this way: first foment the leg well with hot water.	Then venesect the patient in the basilic vein. The treatment with the knife is of two kinds: one is to incise and bring out all the black blood, the other is to draw out the vein and extract it bodily.	0.87406766
Until the thick, turbid blood dissolves, then tie the patient's leg from above his thigh to below his knee with a turban, then incise the vein in one, two, or three places with a wide incision.	The incision is done thus: the leg is first well fomented with hot water to liquefy the thick foul blood; then bind up the patient's leg well from the upper part of his thigh to below the knee; then make an ample incision into the vein in one, two, or three places.	0.7505466
Then milk out the black blood with your hand from below the leg upwards and from above downwards until you extract the amount of blood that you see is sufficient, or what the patient's strength can bear. Then bandage it and order him to avoid foods that generate black bile, and repeat the purging and bleeding.	Then with your hand press the black blood upward from the lower part and downward from the upper part of the leg and draw off as much blood as you see suffices or as the patient's strength can bear. Then bind up, and bid him abstain from foods that give rise to black bile.	0.933537
When the veins are full and this harms the patient, as for extracting it, it is done in this manner: shave the patient's leg if there is a lot of hair, then have him enter the bath and foment his leg with hot water until it reddens and the vein swells, or have him exercise vigorously.	Extraction is carried out in this way: the patient's leg is shaved if it is very hairy; then bring him to the bath and foment the leg in hot water until it becomes red and the veins are filled.	0.84572816
If a bath is not available, until the limb is warmed, then incise the skin opposite the vein lengthwise, either at its end near the knee or below it near the heel, then open the skin with hooks and peel the vein from all sides until it can be felt.	Or if there be no bath available let him take violent exercise until the limb gets hot. Then make a longitudinal incision in the skin over the vein, either at the upper end of it near the knee or at the lower end near the ankle. Then with hooks open up the skin and dissect away round the vein on each side until it is laid open to view.	0.8476944
And when it appears, you will see it intensely red, and when it is free from the skin, you will also see it as if it were a tendon. Then insert a probe underneath it so that when it rises and emerges from the skin, you can hook it with a smooth, blunt hook. Then make another incision near that incision, about three fingers away.	When it is visible you will see it red almost to the point of blackness; and when it is freed from the skin you will see it look like a cord. Then pass beneath it a probe to lift it up, and when it is clear of the skin hold it with a blunt smooth hook.	0.80827284
Then peel the skin from the vein until it appears, then lift it with the probe as you did before and hook it with another hook as you did initially. Then make another incision, or many incisions, if you need to.	Then make another incision near by, three fingers distant; then dissect away the overlying skin until it comes to view; then raise it with a probe as before and lift it with a second hook as you did at first. Then make yet another incision or several if need be; then draw out the vessel at the lowest incision near the ankle and cut it through.	0.7898104
Then extract it and cut it at the end of the incision near the heel, then pull it and extract it until it comes out of the second incision, then pull it to the incision above it and do this until you pull it from the third incision, the highest of all the incisions, so that when it is all out, cut it.	Then pull it and draw it out until it emerges from the second incision. Then draw it towards the incision above that and so on until you draw it out of the third incision (or) the uppermost, until it is all extracted; then cut it off.	0.8598672
If it does not yield to pulling and extraction, insert a needle with strong, doubled thread, tie it, and pull it. Insert the probe under it and rotate it with your hand in every direction until it comes out. Be careful not to break it, for if it breaks, it will be very difficult for you to extract it.	But if it does not respond to your attempts to draw and extract it, pass in a needle with a strong double thread and ligate it and draw it up; and introduce a probe beneath it, and twist it all round until it comes out; but be careful lest it break; for if it break the total extraction of it will be very difficult for you and harm will thereby come to the patient.	0.8331014
And harm will come to the patient from it. So when you have extracted all of it, place wool soaked in wine and rose oil or oil on the site of the incisions, and treat it until it heals. If the varix is convoluted with twists and turns in different directions.	When you have got it all out, apply to the incisions wool soaked in wine and oil of roses, or olive-oil, and dress it till it be healed. If the varix be contorted, with twists and turns from side to side and not in a straight line, as we said, then you should cut down along both sides of the twisted part and the places where it is tortuous, then catch it up with hooks and extract it whole.	0.8066681
And it is not straight as we have described, it is necessary to incise it at every twist and turn. Then hook it with the hooks until you extract all of it.  Be careful when you incise it not to cut the vein or injure it, for it will be difficult for you to extract it. So be very careful.	Be careful in incising over it that you do not cut into or injure the vein, for this will render the extraction difficult; therefore be most careful.	0.6168326
Image of the lancet with which you incise the varix:	The lancet for cutting upon a varix.	0.54410493
Image of the blunt hook:	The blunt hook.	0.4550342
It should not be curved like other hooks, and it should not be sharp at the tip, lest it injure the vein. It should have a thick bend and be smooth, because if it were thin it would cut the vein with its thinness. Rather, it should have extra thickness, as we have said.	It is not bent like other hooks, and its extremity must be blunt so as to not injure the vein. It should be of a broad curve and smooth, for if it is fine-pointed its fineness may cut the vein; rather it should be quite thick, as we said.	0.93814194

On the Excision of a Varicose Vein.	On the extraction of the Medina vein.	0.63887244
This vein develops in the legs in hot countries like the Hejaz and the lands of the Arabs, and in hot, barren countries of little fertility, and sometimes it develops in other places of the body besides the legs, and it is generated by putrefaction that occurs under the skin.	This kind of vein occurs in the leg in hot countries such as the Hejaz and the lands of the Arabs and in hot arid infertile countries. It also often occurs in other parts of the body beside the legs.	0.87761885
Just as it occurs inside living bodies, worms, pumpkin rot, and worms generated between the skin and flesh. And the sign of the beginning of the occurrence of this vein is that a severe inflammation occurs in the leg, then the place swells up, then the vein begins to emerge from the place of that swelling.	The origin of it is a corruption taking place beneath the skin in the same way that round-worms and worms and gourd-worms arise in the inward parts of the body; also the worms that are generated between the skin and the flesh. The sign of the beginning of the occurrence of this vein is a violent inflammation in the leg; then the place swells up and blisters; then the vein begins to extrude at the blistered place as if it were a plant-stem or an animal.	0.83875924
As if it were the root of a plant or animal, so when its tip appears, it should be wrapped around a small piece of lead weighing from one dirham to two, and tied, and the lead left hanging from the leg.	When its extremity has appeared it should be wound and tied round a little piece of lead, from one to two drachms in weight, which you leave hanging from the leg.	0.7306684
And whenever something comes out of it, you wrap it in the lead and tie it. If it becomes very long, cut off some of it and wrap the rest, and do not cut it off from its root before it all comes out, because if you cut it, it will contract and enter the flesh, so it causes swelling and putrefaction in the place, and a bad ulcer.	Then as fast as any of it issues from the leg, wrap it in the lead, and if there be plenty of it cut off part and tie the rest of it; do not cut it right down until it has all come out; for if you cut it right down it will contract and draw back into the flesh and produce at the place an abscess and suppuration and a bad ulcer.	0.8627767
Therefore, it should be managed and pulled little by little until it comes out completely and nothing of it remains in the body. And from this vein in some people may come out what is five or ten spans in length.	Therefore it should be treated gently, and drawn out slowly until the very extremity of it emerges and not the least bit of it remains in the body. In some cases the vein comes out five or ten spans in length; indeed I have heard of one twenty spans long that came out from a certain man.	0.8619859
And I have heard that it came out of a man twenty spans. If it breaks for you while you are treating it, insert a probe into its hole and pack it with a long packing along with the body until all the matter in it is emptied, and try to purify the place with medications for days.	If it breaks during your treatment of it, then pass a probe into the hole and open it up with a long incision longitudinally, until all the contained matter is evacuated; and try to make the place suppurate with medicines for a few days, then treat as an abscess.	0.72783744
Then treat it with the treatment for swellings. This vein may have many branches, especially if it appears in the joint of the leg or in the leg itself, so it develops many openings, and a branch emerges from each opening, so treat it as we mentioned in the division and with what preceded.	Sometimes also this vein is found branching, especially when it appears at the joint of the foot or on the foot itself; and in this case there are many openings and a branch comes out of each. The treatment is as mentioned above in the section.	0.7933881

On the incision for worms generated under the skin, and it is called the disease of cattle.	On incision for the worm arising beneath the skin, called 'the cattle disease'.	0.882436
This disease is called in some of our countries the disease of cattle because it often happens to cattle, and it is a single small worm that is generated between the skin and the flesh and creeps throughout the whole body, ascending and descending.	This complaint is called by us in some regions 'the cattle disease' since it frequently happens to cattle. It is in fact a small solitary worm generated between the skin and the flesh, that creeps all over the body, both up and down; it can be felt as it creeps from one part to another until it breaks out at a place where it can break through the skin, and out it comes.	0.8574127
It is perceptible to the senses when it creeps from one organ to another until it pierces wherever it pierces a place in the skin and emerges.  Its formation is from the putrefaction of some humors, as happens with worms and snakes and pumpkin seeds in the abdomen.	It arises from the putrefaction of certain humours as do worms, round-worms and gourd-worms in the abdomen.	0.51735306
The harm expected from it is that if it creeps in the body and rises to the head and reaches the eye, it may perhaps open it and come out, thus destroying the eye, and this happens often. So if you want to treat it and remove it, this is only possible when it creeps and its appearance is perceptible to the senses.	Part of the harm that may be expected of it is that when it creeps about the body and goes up to the head and reaches the eye it may make an opening in the eye and come out and destroy the eye; this frequently happens. If you wish to treat this and extract it, it must be done while it is creeping about and can be felt.	0.90269166
It is necessary that you tightly bind above it and below it with a good, tight ligature, then incise upon it and take it out. If it sinks into the flesh and you do not find it, then apply cautery with fire to the place until you burn it.  The greatest harm expected from it is the destruction of the eye, as we have said.	You must tie a tight tourniquet above and below it, then cut down upon it and extract it. But if it burrows into the tissues and you cannot locate it, then apply the actual cautery to the place until you have burnt the worm. The greatest damage to be feared from it is damage to the eye, as we have said.	0.8364621
If you see that it has gone into the head near the eye, then bind tightly below it on the forehead, then incise upon it and take it out.  It is necessary that the patient attends to purifying his body with medications that purge putrid, bad humors and be careful of foods that generate putrefaction.	So if you see that it has entered the head and is near the eye, then bind a strong bandage over the forehead beneath it, then cut down upon it and draw it out. It is important also for the patient to take care to cleanse his body with laxative medicines from all corrupt and evil humours. He should also avoid all foods giving rise to putrefaction.	0.86874783

On Incising the Disease Known as al-Nafir (The Fleeing).	On incision for the disease known as 'flitting disease'.	0.68624294
This disease, which is called al-nafir (the fleeing) in our country, is a pain that occurs in some of the organs, then moves from organ to organ, and I have seen it as I describe it to you.	The disease known in our region as 'the flitting disease' is a pain arising in a limb and then passing from limb to limb.	0.6902013
I was called to a sick woman in a rural area, and she uncovered her arm and showed me a slight swelling in a vein of the arm's tendon. When I remained for an hour, I saw that swelling creeping along the forearm as a worm creeps, rising to her shoulder blade as quickly as could be, like mercury.	I have personally seen it as I shall describe to you: I was called to a woman patient in a country district, who uncovered her arm and showed me a small inflation of the cephalic vein. After I had waited a while I saw the swelling creep like a worm along the forearm, ascending towards her shoulder, with the greatest possible speed, as of quicksilver running from place to place.	0.85873914
If it flowed from one place to another, the pain would disappear from that place and settle in the shoulder blade.  Then I sat for an hour, and it ran throughout her body until it was in the other arm. Then she told me that it circulated throughout her whole body, just as I had witnessed.	Then the pain left that place and settled in the elbow. Then I waited a while and the pain ran through the whole body until it reached the other arm. Then she related to me that it used to pass all round her body as I had seen it.	0.8346202
I marveled at the speed of its transfer from one organ to another, and I had not previously seen this disease with my own eyes in this way, except that I had seen a group of people who found the pain moving from one organ to another, but I had not seen it with my own eyes as I saw it in this woman.	I was amazed at the speed with which it migrated from one part to another, as I had never before seen this disease in this form, though I had seen many who had a pain that passed from limb to limb; but never with my own eyes had I seen anything like what I saw in this woman.	0.90216076
And I did not consider that to be anything other than because the woman was from the rural people, dry of body, with exposed veins, and therefore this moving wind appeared to the senses. And it must be that it does not appear to this degree in people of luxury and moist bodies with hidden veins.	The only opinion I could form of it was that it was due to the woman's being of the dwellers in the wilds, dry of body, with outstanding veins, and hence that moving vapour was perceptible. But it follows then that it does not appear in that manner in people leading a leisured life, with humid bodies and hidden veins.	0.8425552
If you want to treat it, and its possessor feels the pain, then if it appears to you visually, as we mentioned, quickly tie above and below it and incise over it until that trapped wind comes out, and cauterize the place.	When you want to cure this, and the patient feels the pain of it, and if you observe the appearance we have described, then tie a bandage round above and beneath it as quickly as possible and cut down on it so that the vapour enclosed there may come out; and cauterize the place.	0.8690543
But if you do not see it with your own eyes, then treat it by shaking the body and with what expels and dissipates the winds, such as asafoetida, sagapenum, and similar medications.	But if there is nothing visible to you then treat by purging of the body and by medicines dispelling and getting rid of flatus, such as foetid pills and pills of sagapenon and the like.	0.7472141

On Extracting Arrows.	On the extraction of arrows.	0.8906903
Arrows differ according to their types and according to the locations in which they occur in the body. As for their difference according to their types, some of them are large and small, some are hollow glass and solid glass, and some of them have three angles and four angles.	Arrows vary both as to types and as to the different parts of the body pierced by them. They differ thus as to type: some are big and some are small; some with hollow heads and some with solid; some of them have three angles and some four; some have tongues; some have spikes.	0.86571544
And some of them have tongues, and some of them have splinters. As for those that are according to the organs in which they occur, they are of two types: either the organs are among the principal hollow organs such as the brain, heart, liver, lung, kidneys, intestines, bladder, and the like. So when an arrow strikes one of these organs and the signs of death appear to you, which I will describe to you later, then you should avoid removing that arrow from them, because death follows its owner in most cases. And when these bad signs do not appear to you and the arrow has not disappeared into the depths of the organ, then remove it and treat the wound. And among the signs of the brain if an arrow strikes it and pierces the bone and wounds the membrane that is on the brain, a severe headache, torpor, and dizziness occur from that.	The difference due to the part transfixed by the arrow is twofold: for there are either the chief hollow organs such as the brain, the heart, the liver, the lungs, the kidneys, intestine, bladder, and so forth—when one of these arrows transfixes an organ of this kind, and you observe the signs of death which I shall describe to you later, then you must avoid the extraction of the arrow in that case, for death will generally follow; but when you do not see these fatal signs and the arrow is not quite buried in the depths of the organ, then extract it and dress the wound.	0.8675288
And when these bad signs do not appear to you and the arrow has not disappeared into the depths of the organ, then remove it and treat the wound. And among the signs of the brain if an arrow strikes it and pierces the bone and wounds the membrane that is on the brain, a severe headache, torpor, and dizziness occur from that. And redness in the eyes and redness of the tongue, convulsions, confusion of mind, and vomiting bile. And perhaps blood comes out of the nostrils or ears, and perhaps speech is interrupted and the voice is gone, and a white moisture resembling porridge comes out of the place of the wound, and something like the water of meat flows from it.	Now the signs when the arrow has struck the brain, and penetrated the bone and injured the meninges covering the brain, are these: there arise from that a violent headache and vertigo and giddiness and a redness in the eye, and a redness of the tongue, and convulsion and mental confusion and bilious vomit; perhaps also blood comes out of the nose or from the ears; often also the speech is affected and the voice is lost; also there comes out of the site of the wound a white fluid which resembles gruel, from which there flows something like the juice of meat.	0.8515275
If these signs appear to you, then refrain from treating the patient and removing the arrow if it has not come out. As for the signs of the arrow if it strikes the heart and is close to the left breast, it feels as if it has been embedded in something solid, not in something empty.	If you observe these signs, avoid treating the patient and extraction of the arrow if it has not come out.	0.6691002
And perhaps the arrow has a movement similar to the movement of the pulse, and black blood flows from the wound, followed by coldness of the extremities, a cold sweat, and fainting. Know that death is inevitably descending.  And the sign of the arrow if it wounds the lung is the emergence of frothy blood from the wound.	The signs of an arrow in the heart are: nearness to the left breast; the patient feels it as if it were fixed in something solid, not hollow; often also there will be imparted to the arrow a pulsating movement; and black blood will issue from the wound; and after this follow coldness of the extremities and a cold sweat and unconsciousness; then you may know that death is surely on its way.	0.7721076
And the vessels that follow the neck swell, and the patient's color changes, and he breathes heavily and seeks to inhale cool air. If the arrow strikes the diaphragm that is in the chest, it will be close to the small ribs and breathing will be labored with severe pain.	The sign of an arrow that has wounded the lung is the exit of frothy blood from the wound; also the vessels that lie along the neck swell up and the patient changes colour, breathes heavily, and seeks to inhale fresh air very strongly. But if the arrow strike the pleura then it will be close to the small ribs and he will breathe deeply with much pain and heaving of the chest, and all parts of his shoulders will be agitated.	0.8097951
And he sighs and all the members of the shoulders move. And if the arrow strikes the liver, severe pain follows it, and blood resembling the liver in its redness comes out of the wound. And if the arrow strikes the stomach, some undigested food may come out of the wound.	But if the arrow strike the pleura then it will be close to the small ribs and he will breathe deeply with much pain and heaving of the chest, and all parts of his shoulders will be agitated. If the arrow hits the liver, there ensues violent pain, and blood flows from the wound, resembling the liver in its redness. If the arrow strikes the stomach, often undigested food comes out of the wound and renders the case obvious.	0.7655866
And its matter is apparent. And if the arrow strikes the abdomen and sticks in it, and something of the stool comes out of the wound, or the omentum, or an intestine has been perforated, then there is no hope in treating him nor in removing the arrow. If the arrow strikes the bladder, urine comes out.	If the arrow wounds the belly and is fixed in it, and from the wound there comes excrement or omentum or torn bowel, there is no hope in treatment nor in extracting the arrow. If the arrow has hit the urinary bladder, and urine comes out and some of the bladder protrudes and the patient has violent pain, then you may know that the wound is mortal.	0.8109523
And if something protrudes from it to the outside, and the pain intensifies on the patient, know that he is perishing. As for the other organs, such as the face, eye, throat, shoulder, upper arm, spine, clavicle, thigh, leg, and similar organs, they are most often safe.	But as for the other parts, such as the face, eye, throat, shoulder, arm, dorsal vertebrae, collar-bone, hip, leg, and the like, in most cases they will heal if the arrow does not happen to strike an artery or nerve, and if the arrow is not poisoned.	0.72485083
When the arrow does not hit an artery or nerve, and the arrow is not poisoned. And I will tell you some of what I have witnessed regarding these arrows so that you may be guided by it in your treatment. An arrow struck a man in the corner of his eye at the root of his nose.	Now I will relate to you certain cases of arrow wounds that I have seen, so that you may be guided thereby to your own methods of treatment. For example, once an arrow struck a man at the corner of his eye near the root of the nose, and I extracted it from him on the other side beneath the lobe of his ear, and he got well, and his eye was none the worse.	0.69071066
I extracted it for him from the other side, under the earlobe, and he recovered and no harm happened to his eye. I extracted another arrow for a Jew who had been struck in the corner of his eye under the lower eyelid, and the arrow had disappeared, and I could only find its small end that attaches to the shaft.	Also I extracted from a Jew another arrow that had pierced the orbit beneath the lower eyelid; the arrow had sunk out of sight and I could take hold only of the tiny extremity of it which is secured to the shaft; but it was a big arrow from a compound bow, the iron tip four-sided, very smooth without barbs. The Jew recovered, nor did any ill befall his eye.	0.85087025
It was a large arrow from a composite bow, with smooth, square iron, and it had no barbs. The Jew recovered, and no ill befel his eye. I extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian, and the arrow was Arabian.	I also extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian.	0.49089247
It is the one with two barbs. I made an incision for him between the jugular veins, and it had sunk into his throat. I treated him gently until I extracted it, and the Christian survived and recovered. I extracted another arrow for a man who had been struck in his abdomen, and we thought that he would die from it.	It was an Arab arrow, one of those with two barbs; and I cut down upon it between the two jugulars (for it lay deep in the throat), and worked gently at it until I extracted it; and the Christian was saved and recovered. I also extracted another arrow from a man, that had struck him in the abdomen, and our opinion was that he would certainly die from it.	0.89634645
When he remained for a period of thirty days or so, and nothing in his condition changed, I made an incision over the arrow and worked on it carefully, and I extracted it, and he recovered, and no ill befel him. I saw a man who had been struck by an arrow in his back, and the wound closed over it.	But when it had remained in him for the space of thirty days or thereabouts, and his condition was unimpaired, I cut down upon the arrow and manoeuvred it out and extracted it; and he recovered, nor did any harm befall him.	0.8304461
Then, after seven years, the arrow came out at the top of his thigh. I saw a woman who had been struck in her abdomen by an arrow, and the wound closed, and the arrow remained, and nothing in her condition changed, nor did she feel any harm from it in any of her natural functions.	I also saw a man who had been struck in the back by an arrow and the wound had closed over it; and when the space of seven years had elapsed the arrow came out at the root of the hip. And I saw a woman who had been struck in the abdomen by an arrow and the wound healed with the arrow remaining in it, and her condition was unimpaired; she felt no harm from it and her natural functions were not harmed.	0.8540067
And I saw another man who was struck by an arrow in his face, and the wound closed, and it remained without him feeling much pain. And of such cases there are many. I extracted an arrow for a man, one of the sultan's commanders, who had been struck in the middle of his nose; it had deviated slightly to the right side.	And I saw a man who had been struck by an arrow in the face, and it had healed over, and he did not feel much pain from it. And many such have I seen. I once drew out an arrow from one of the officers of the State, that had struck him in the middle of the nose and was inclining a little to the right, and the whole arrow was buried.	0.90166664
And the entire arrow disappeared. I was called to treat him three days after the arrow struck him. I found the arrow's wound very narrow, so I probed it with a thin probe, but I did not feel it.  He felt a prickling and pain under his ear on the right side.	I was called to treat him three days after he had received the arrow wound; and I found the arrow wound very narrow. I explored it with a fine probe but did not find it; but the patient felt a pricking and a pain beneath the right ear, and I hoped that the pricking was due to the arrow.	0.8613266
I hoped that the prickling was from the tip of the arrow.  So I dressed the area with a dressing that had the power to draw and ripen, hoping that the area would swell and a sign of the arrow would appear, so that I could make an incision over it. But nothing happened in the area to indicate that the arrow had reached that spot.	So I applied a poultice to the spot, a poultice with power to draw out and cause suppuration, desiring that the place should swell and that a sign to indicate the arrow should appear so that I could cut down upon it.	0.74259615
So I continued with the dressing on it for many days, but nothing happened. Then during that time the wound closed and the patient remained despairing of its removal for a period, until one day he felt the arrow inside his nose. He told me the news, so I applied the sharp, corrosive medication to the wound for many days.	But nothing happened at that place to indicate that the arrow had come through to there; so I persevered with poulticing it for many days; yet nothing fresh manifested itself and the wound healed up meanwhile, and the patient despaired for a time of its extraction. Then one day he felt the arrow inside his nose, and he told me of this; so for a number of days I applied a caustic medicine to the wound until it opened.	0.8727589
Until it opened and I probed it. I felt the thin tip of the arrow that adheres to the shaft.  Then I continued to open the wound with that sharp medication until the tip of the arrow became clearly visible to us. This took me a period of time, about four months.	I explored it, and felt the slim end of the arrow which is fastened to the shaft; then I enlarged the opening of the wound by the use of the caustic until the tip of the arrow was plainly visible to me. About four months passed.	0.831529
Then when the wound widened and it became possible for me to insert hooks into it, I pulled and moved it, but it would not come out. I continued to coax it and try various instruments on it, until one day I grasped it with well-made hooks, the image of which will come at the end of the chapter.	Then when the wound was enlarged and I was able to introduce forceps into it I pulled on it and moved it, but it would not come out. And I went on skilfully and gently trying for it with various instruments until one day I caught hold of it with a pair of strong forceps (their shape will be described at the end of the chapter) and drew it out; then dressed the wound.	0.90488017
And the physicians were certain that the cartilage of his nose would not heal. But I treated it, and the wound healed, and the patient recovered completely, not harmed at all. I am informing you of the method of extracting some arrows so that you may use that as a standard and a guide for what I have not mentioned.	The medical men judged that the cartilage of the nose would not be restored, but I restored it and the wound healed up and the patient made a complete recovery nor did he suffer any harm. Now I shall tell you the method of extracting certain arrows so that you may take it as a guide and an analogy for others that I have not mentioned; since all parts and details of this art cannot be comprehended in any description, nor can any book include them.	0.86563706
Because the details and particulars of this craft cannot be grasped by description, nor can a book encompass it. Rather, the skilled practitioner extrapolates from the little to the much, and from what is present to what is absent, and devises a new procedure and a new instrument for unusual incidents.	Now I shall tell you the method of extracting certain arrows so that you may take it as a guide and an analogy for others that I have not mentioned; since all parts and details of this art cannot be comprehended in any description, nor can any book include them. A skilful worker will form a judgement on much, from little; and on what is not present from what is before him; and he will think out a new method and a new instrument for an unaccustomed case when it occurs in the practice of this art.	0.75164205
Concerning the extraction of arrows from this profession, I say that arrows are extracted from the organs in which they are lodged in two ways: either by pulling from the place where they entered, or from the opposite side.  Those which are extracted from where they entered...	So I would state that arrows come out from the parts of the body they have transfixed, in two ways: either by drawing out from the site of entry; or from the opposite side. An arrow that comes out by the track of its entry: the arrow may be visible, standing out from a fleshy part, in which case it may be extracted by pulling.	0.7561923
...if the arrow is protruding in a fleshy area, it is pulled and extracted. If it does not yield to extraction at the time it occurred, then you should leave it for several days until the flesh around it putrefies, making it easy to pull and extract. Likewise, if it is lodged in bone.	An arrow that comes out by the track of its entry: the arrow may be visible, standing out from a fleshy part, in which case it may be extracted by pulling. If it does not respond to traction immediately it strikes, you must leave it for a few days until the surrounding tissues have suppurated, when the pulling and extraction of it will be made easy.	0.73888856
And if it does not yield to extraction, also leave it for days and try pulling and moving it every day, for it will come out. If it does not yield to extraction after several days, then you should perforate around the arrow in the bone itself from every side with a fine perforator until you widen [the hole] for the arrow, then pull and extract it.	Similarly if it has stuck fast in a bone and will not come out, leave this also for a few days, repeatedly pulling on it and shifting it day by day, and then it will come out. But if it will not come out after some days, you will have to drill away the bone from all round with a fine drill so as to make room for the arrow; then draw on it and pull it out.	0.84686196
If the arrow is lodged in the bone of the skull and has penetrated deep into one of the ventricles of the brain, and some of the symptoms I have mentioned appear in the patient, refrain from pulling the arrow and leave it until his condition becomes clear after several days.	If the arrow is buried in some part of the body and is quite lost to sight, explore for it with a probe, and if you can feel it then draw it out with any suitable instrument.	0.5371976
then attempt to pull and extract the arrow. If it is firmly lodged and does not yield to pulling, then use the perforators around the arrow as I have described to you, and then treat the area until it heals.  But if the arrow is embedded in some part of the body... and hidden from the senses, then search for it with the probe. If you feel it, pull it with some of the instruments suitable for extracting it. If you cannot do so because of the narrowness of the wound and the depth of the arrow, and there is no bone, nerve, or vessel there...	But if you cannot get at it on account of the narrowness of the wound and the depth at which the arrow is, and there be no bone nor nerve nor blood-vessel, then cut round it until the wound be sufficiently wide to enable you to take hold of it and extract it.	0.6932355
then enlarge the wound by incising it so that you can reach the arrow and extract it. If it has barbs, grasp them and free the flesh embedded in them from every side by whatever means you can. If you are unable to free the flesh, try to break the barbs and twist them until you free them.	And if it have two barbs by which it is held, free them from the adherent flesh all round, in any way you can; or, if you cannot free the tissues, try skilfully to break off the two barbs and twist them about until the arrow comes free.	0.7248684
When you attempt to extract the arrow, wherever it may be, twist your hand with the hooks in all directions until you free it. Be extremely gentle so that the arrow does not break, making it difficult for you to pull and extract it. If you are unable to do so immediately...	Whenever you try to extract an arrow from any part, employ a twisting motion of your hand with the forceps in all directions until you free it; and use the utmost gentleness not to break the arrow and thus make it hard to draw it out and remove it.	0.87144935
then leave it for a few days until the flesh around it putrefies, then try again, for it will then be easier. If you encounter bleeding, use the treatment we mentioned in its chapter. Take great care not to cut a vessel, nerve, or tendon, and use ingenuity.	If you are unable to get it out at once then leave it for some days until the tissues that surround it putrefy, then return to it, for then the extraction will be easy; and if haemorrhage interfere use the remedies prescribed in the chapter dealing with that. Exercise the utmost care not to cut a blood-vessel or nerve or tendon; and employ the greatest skill in freeing the arrow; it should be done gently and unhurriedly and with perseverance, as I have told you.	0.81577516
By whatever means you can, extract the arrow, but do so gently, slowly, and steadily as I have described to you. When you pull the arrow, it is best to position the patient in the same way they were when the arrow struck them.	Exercise the utmost care not to cut a blood-vessel or nerve or tendon; and employ the greatest skill in freeing the arrow; it should be done gently and unhurriedly and with perseverance, as I have told you. When extracting an arrow you should place the patient in the same position he was in when the arrow struck him, for that is more convenient; but if you cannot do this then let him be in whatever position is possible for you.	0.76966834
If you cannot do this, then use whatever position you can. As for the arrow that emerges from the opposite side, either a part of it will have protruded outwards, or you will find the tip of the arrow close to the surface of the skin by feeling it and you will see it bulging.	The arrow that is to be extracted from the opposite side either has some part protruding through or else the tip of the arrow gives rise to a palpable swelling just beneath the skin and you see it sticking out; then cut down upon it; the incision should be wide enough to admit the forceps.	0.69718814
Make an incision over it, just large enough to fit the hooks, then pull it, for it will be easy to extract. If it is stuck in a bone, twist your hand in a circular motion so that the arrow affects the bone and widens the space for itself, then pull it.	Then pull on it, for the extraction of it will be easy. If it is stuck in bone, twist it round with your hand until the arrow makes an impression in the bone and opens up a way for itself; then pull it.	0.8314396
If not, leave it for a few days and then try again until it comes out. If the arrow's shaft is still attached, push on it.  If the shaft has fallen off and you wish to push it, insert the hollow instrument so that its cavity enters the notch of the arrowhead, then push with it.	If it does not come out, let it alone for some days, and repeat until it does come out. If the arrow-shaft be in the wound, then thrust the arrow out with that. But if the shaft has fallen out, and you wish to employ thrusting, introduce down to it the hollow instrument whose cavity will enter upon the ferrule of the arrow, then push it forward with that.	0.8866202
If the arrow is hollow, push it with an instrument that fits into the hollow, as this will make the arrow easier to extract.  If the arrow is poisoned, you should excise all the flesh that the poison has reached, if possible, then treat it appropriately.	If the arrow be hollow, thrust it forward with an instrument that will enter into the cavity, for the exit of the arrow will thereby be made easy. If the arrow be poisoned you must, if you can, cut out in a circle all the flesh into which the poison has entered; then treat it with what is appropriate.	0.92106545
If the arrow is lodged in the chest, abdomen, bladder, or side, and is close enough to be probed and you can make an incision over it, then make an incision, taking care not to cut any vein or nerve, and extract it.	If the arrow that has struck be in the chest or abdomen or in the urinary bladder or in the flank and it be close enough for you to explore it with the probe and you can cut down upon it, then do so, but beware of cutting into a blood-vessel or nerve.	0.8627282
Then suture the wound if it requires stitching, then treat it until it heals.  Image of the hooks with which arrows are extracted:.	Afterwards suture the wound, if suture be necessary, and dress it until it heals. Forceps for extracting arrows.	0.8370453
Their ends are like a bird's beak, made like a file; when they grip the arrow or something, they do not let go.  They are made in large, small, and medium sizes, all according to the size of the arrow, and the width and narrowness of the wound.	The extremities resemble the bill of a bird and are engraved like a file so as not to lose grip when you close them upon an arrow or some other object. They are made in several kinds, large, small, or medium, all according to the bigness or smallness of the arrow and the breadth or narrowness of the wound.	0.8690201

Chapter Ninety-Five.	CHAPTER NINETY-FIVE.	0.8043811
On Phlebotomy.	On venesection.	0.4033652
The veins that are customarily phlebotomized in the body are thirty veins, of which sixteen are in the head: the two pulsating veins behind the ears known as the hissing ones, and the two arteries that are in the temples, the apparent ones, and the two veins that are in the corners of the eyes known as the onlookers.	The blood-vessels in the body which it is customary to open are thirty(two) in number.	0.50015306
And the vein that rises in the middle of the forehead and the vein that is at the tip of the nose and the two jugular veins that are in the neck and the two veins that are in the upper lip of the mouth and the two veins that are in the lower lip, these veins being known as the Jaharik, and the two veins that are under the tongue.	There are sixteen of them in the head, and they are: two pulsating vessels behind the ears that are called the two occipitals; the two external arteries in the temples; and the two veins in the two internal angles of the eyes, called the vessels of sight; and the vein running up the middle of the forehead; and the vein situated at the tip of the nose; and the two jugular veins in the neck; and the two veins in the upper lip and the two in the lower lip; these being the veins known as 'the four vessels'; and two veins beneath the tongue.	0.7699604
And as for the veins that are phlebotomized in the arm and hand, they are five veins, one of which is the Cephalic, which is on the lateral side, and the common people call it the vein of the head, and the Basilic, which is the middle vein, and it is composed of a branch of the Basilic and a branch of the Cephalic, and the common people call it the vein of the body.	As for the veins that are bled in the arm and hand, they are five.	0.51670694
And the Basilic, which is located on the medial side, and is also called the Axillary, and the common people call it the vein of the abdomen, and the ligament of the arm, which is located on the ulna, which is what it adheres to, and it is the one that appears clearly above the thumb, and the Median Cubital.	One is the cephalic, which is on the outer side; popularly they call it the 'headvein'; then there is the 'blue-black', that is, the median vein, which is made up of a branch from the basilic and a branch from the cephalic; popularly they call that the 'body-vein'; then the basilic vein; this is the one situated on the inner side and is termed also the axillary vein, but popularly it is called the 'belly-vein'; and then the cord of the arm; this is situated over the radius and is the one that is contiguous to it; this is the one that is clearly visible on the thumb.	0.7456026
And it is the vein that is between the little finger and the ring finger, it has two branches.  And in the leg and foot are three veins, one of which is that which is below the knee joint on the lateral side, and the second is the Saphenous, and its place is at the heel on the medial side, and the Sciatic vein, and its place is at the heel on the lateral side.	And the salvatella which is the vein between the little and ring fingers; it has two branches. There are also three veins in the leg and foot; one of these is the sciatic vein on the outer aspect; the second is the saphena situated near the heel on the inner aspect; and there is the external saphena situated near the heel on the outer aspect.	0.87801206
And in the other leg are three veins like them. As for the two veins that are behind the ears, the benefit of their phlebotomy is for chronic catarrh, migraine, ringworm, and chronic malignant ulcers of the head.  And the manner of their phlebotomy is as I describe.	And there are three veins, counterparts to these, in the other leg. Venesection of the two veins behind the ears. Bleeding from both of these will give relief in cases of chronic catarrh, migraine and chronic foul pustules, and scabs of the head.	0.7917736
And it is that you shave the head of the sick person and rub the back of it in the area of the two veins with a rough cloth, rubbing it well, then the sick person constricts his neck with a turban until the two veins appear, and their place is behind the ears in the depressed areas of the head.  Then you feel for them with your finger, and where you sense their pulsation under your finger, there you make a mark with ink.	The method of venesecting these two is as I shall now describe: the patient's head should be shaved and the hinder part, in the region of the two veins, should be strongly chafed with a rough cloth; then the patient should bind his neck with his turban until the two veins are visible; their position is behind the ears in the two flattened places of the head; feel for them with your finger and when you feel their pulsation beneath your finger then mark the place with ink.	0.84136724
Then you take a scalpel, which is known as the Nashal, then you insert it under the vein in the skin until the scalpel reaches the bone.  Then you lift your hand with the vein and skin upwards and cut the vein with the skin, a complete cut, and the length of the cut is the extent of two closed fingers.	Then take a knife-scalpel, known as a lancet, and insert it beneath the vessel into the skin until the scalpel reaches the bone; then lifting with your hand both vessel and skin make an incision dividing both skin and vein; the length of the incision should be about two fingers side by side; then draw off the quantity of blood you wish. Then bind them up with dressings and leave it until healed.	0.814034
Or thereabouts, and you let out the amount of blood that you desire.  Then you bandage them with compresses and leave them until they heal.  And it has preceded, in the beginning of the book, their cutting and cauterization.  As for the two arteries that are in the temples, the benefit of their phlebotomy is for chronic migraine and severe headache and persistent ophthalmia and the flow of acute humors pouring into the eyes.	Then bind them up with dressings and leave it until healed. The incision and cauterization of these two vessels has been discussed earlier in the book. The section of the two arteries in the temples gives relief for chronic migraine and severe headache and constant ophthalmia and the flow of acrid superfluities into the eyes.	0.7497379
And the way to phlebotomize them is as I describe to you: the sick person tightens his neck with a turban until the two veins appear clearly to the senses, and their pulse becomes evident under your finger. Then you mark with ink. Then you lift the skin from above the vein upwards with your index finger.	Now the manner of incising them is as I shall describe: the patient should bind his neck with a sash until the vessels stand out clearly to the eye and their pulsation is manifest under your finger; then mark with ink.	0.83166456
And you insert the Nashal scalpel from below and lift the vein upwards and sever it as you did with the other two veins, and you let out blood according to your need. Then you loosen the sick person's constriction and place your finger on the vein for a while.	Then with your forefinger raise the skin over the vessel and introduce a lancet beneath and lift up the vein and divide it as you did the other two; and draw off as much blood as you need.	0.8169558
Then you place cotton and a compress on it and bandage it tightly from above and leave it until it heals. And their mention, cutting, and probing have preceded in the beginning of the book.  As for phlebotomy of the forehead vein, its benefit, after phlebotomy of the cephalic vein, is for chronic ailments of the face, such as ringworm, ulcers, and troublesome redness.	Then loosen the band round the patient's neck and put your finger on the vein for a while; then apply cotton wool and a pad, bandage securely, and leave until it heals. They and their incision and extraction have been mentioned earlier in the book. Venesection of the vein in the forehead is, after venesection of the cephalic, a relief to chronic diseases of the face such as pustules and scabs and erysipelas.	0.81156236
And the way to phlebotomize it is as I describe to you: The sick person constricts his neck with a turban until the vein appears.  Then you take the instrument that is called the "axe," and this is its picture:.	Now I shall relate to you the method of cutting: you bind the patient's neck until the vessel stands out; then you take the instrument called the 'pickaxe'.	0.7521604
You place the projecting thorn that is at the head of the "axe" on the vein itself and strike from above with a comb or something similar to it.  You let the blood flow to the extent that you desire. Then you loosen the sick person's constriction and bandage him until he heals.	The spike in the head of the instrument you place on the vessel itself and then strike with a comb or some similar thing; and let the blood flow to the extent you wish; then loosen the band round the neck and bandage the vein until healed.	0.8428813
It may be opened with a broad scalpel, except that the scalpel should not be sharp-tipped like other scalpels, but rather it should be slightly broad-tipped.  And you phlebotomize it obliquely, because the bone is close, so perhaps the scalpel would break in it if it were thin.	Sometimes it is opened with a broad scalpel; the scalpel, however, should not have a sharp point like other scalpels but should be a little broader at the tip, and the vein is cut obliquely, because the bone is close and the scalpel, if it is too fine, may be broken on it.	0.86062455
As for the two veins that are at the corners of the eyes, their benefit is for ailments of the eye, such as scabies, redness, eyelashes, and diseases of the face.  As for the way to phlebotomize them, it is that the sick person constricts his neck with a turban. Then you phlebotomize them while you are standing at his head. And let the phlebotomy be slightly oblique lengthwise with a small, slightly broad scalpel.	Venesection of the two lachrymal veins gives relief in diseases of the eyes such as granular conjunctiva and inflammation and pannus, and in diseases of the face. Now this is the method of incising: the patient binds a sash round his throat, then you cut open both veins, standing in front of him. The incision should be oblique, slightly longitudinal, with a small, rather broad scalpel, for in this place there is no flesh; so if the knife have too narrow a point it may be broken on the bone.	0.724295
For the place has no flesh in it, so if the scalpel were thin-tipped, it might break. Then you let out the blood you need and place cotton on them and bandage them for one night.  Then you loosen them. As for the phlebotomy of the vein of the nose, it is beneficial for acute fever.	The incision should be oblique, slightly longitudinal, with a small, rather broad scalpel, for in this place there is no flesh; so if the knife have too narrow a point it may be broken on the bone. Then let flow what blood you wish, put cotton wool on both, tie for one night, then loosen.	0.66502327
and severe headache and from diseases of the face, such as the red swelling that occurs in the nose, especially if it is chronic. The way to phlebotomize it is that the sick person constricts his neck. Then you grasp his nose with your left hand and take a thin, long scalpel.	Venesection of the vein of the nose helps in acute fevers, in violent headache, and in diseases of the face such as the red pustules that arise on the nose, especially if they are chronic.	0.53837436
And you insert it in the middle of the tip of the nose itself, between the partition of the nose, directly, because the vein is not perceptible to the touch there. For the blood emerges immediately.  And you should push your hand with the scalpel in a little and let out the amount of blood needed.  Then bandage it for a night, for it heals quickly.	This is how you make the incision: the patient binds his neck and then you hold his nose with your left hand and take a long fine scalpel and stick it in the middle of the very lobule of the nose, perpendicularly in the nasal septum (for the vein is not obvious at that spot) and blood will immediately flow out. You should advance the scalpel a little and cause the blood to flow as required; then bandage for one night, for it will quickly heal.	0.75311255
As for the external jugular veins, the benefit of their phlebotomy is for shortness of breath and the beginning of leprosy and melancholic diseases that occur on the surface of the skin, such as black vitiligo, impetigo, malignant ulcers, and corroding sores. The method of their phlebotomy is that the patient constricts beneath them, on his neck, with a bandage, and the practitioner stands at the patient's head.	Venesection of the jugular veins helps tightness of breath and the early stage of elephantiasis, and the melancholic diseases arising on the surface of the skin, such as the black vitiligo and impetigo and malignant ulcers and cancrum oris. Now the way to venesect them is for the patient to bind his neck below them both with a band; let the operator stand behind the patient and let the patient be seated upon a chair.	0.76703507
The patient is sitting on a chair. Then you phlebotomize the vein lengthwise, a somewhat wide phlebotomy.  Then you draw out a moderate amount of blood or according to what you see is needed.  Then you do the same with the other vein. Then you loosen the bandage.	Then incise the vein longitudinally with a rather wide opening; then let a moderate amount of blood, or according to what you think necessary; then do the same with the other vein.	0.74659574
And you bandage the two veins with a moderate tightness so that the patient does not choke.  And you leave him until the next day, for the wound heals. As for the veins beneath the tongue, the benefit of their phlebotomy after the phlebotomy of the cephalic vein is that it benefits thrush in the mouth, corruption of the gums, malignant ulcers, chapped lips, and malignant sores.	Then loosen the band and tie the veins with a moderate pressure lest the patient be suffocated; leave him until the next day and the wound will be healed. The four veins of the lips: venesection of them is effective, second to section of the cephalic vein, for pustules on the mouth and rotting of the gums and malignant ulcers and fissures of the lips and for malignant ulcer in the nose and round about.	0.80801845
which are in the nose and around it.  And the way to phlebotomize them is that you sit the patient in front of you and tighten his neck with a turban. Then you turn his lips and look at the two veins, one of which you see on the right of the lip and the other on its left, and you distinguish them by their blackness.	The way to venesect is to seat the patient in front of you and bind a sash round his neck, then roll back his lips and look for the two veins, one of which you will see to the left and the other to the right; their dark colour will show them up against the lip and also the fact that round them are fine dark veins; so cut down upon both, dividing them.	0.82262754
And that is also because around them are thin black veins, so you cut them with a blunt cut. If it is difficult for you and you do not know which they are, then aim to cut the largest and most visible of them. And likewise, do the same with the two veins that are in the lower lip.	But if you are in doubt about the matter and are not sure what they are, set about incising the largest and most obvious. Do the same with the two veins in the upper lip.	0.63267803
As for the two veins that are under the tongue, the benefit of their phlebotomy after the phlebotomy of the cephalic vein is for the angina that is in the throat from disease of the uvula and diseases of the mouth.  And the way to phlebotomize them is that you sit the patient between your hands, facing the sun, and you lift his tongue, and you look under the tongue on one side for a vein and on the other side for a vein, and their color is blackish.	The two veins under the tongue: their venesection is, after section of the cephalic, of good effect in the quinsy arising in the throat from disease of the uvula, and diseases of the mouth. The way to venesect them is to seat the patient before you in the sunlight and raise his tongue, and look, and you will see beneath the tongue one vein on each side, blackish in colour.	0.8513082
Then you phlebotomize them, and be careful not to cut them too deeply, for beneath them are arteries, and perhaps bleeding from those arteries may occur. As for the three veins that are phlebotomized in the elbow, they are the ones that it is customary to phlebotomize in all people, and their phlebotomy is in two ways.	Cut them; but be careful not to go too far in your incision, for beneath them lie arteries from which there may be haemorrhage. The three veins that are opened in the elbow are the veins which universal custom has used for bloodletting.	0.7351707
Either by puncturing with a broad myrtle-leaf lancet or an olive-leaf lancet, down to the thin one, or by incising with a scalpel lancet, which is the nashl [and this is its picture]. Picture of the broad myrtle-leaf lancet:	There are two ways of venesecting these: either by piercing with a broad myrtle-leaf scalpel or a rather fine olivary; or by cutting with a knife-edged scalpel, the lancet whose figure follows. The broad myrtle-leaf scalpel.	0.8180224
It is broad, as you see, so that it is suitable for opening hollow, full, prominent, apparent, thick veins that contain thick, turbid blood. And this is a picture of the olive-leaf lancet:	As you see, it should be broad so as to serve for opening hollow, full, outstanding, obvious and thick veins, and those containing turbid blood. The olivary scalpel.	0.8268561
This lancet is less wide and thinner at the tip, suitable for phlebotomizing thin veins which contain thin, choleric blood.  And this is a picture of the nashl lancet:	This scalpel is less broad and finer-pointed. It is suitable for venesecting fine veins that contain thin jaundiced blood. The lancet.	0.87872964
This is the nashl, which is suitable for incising, and there are types of it, broad and thin, according to the width and narrowness of the veins.  And one can infer from this about others, and it is well known among craftsmen.	This is the lancet for making a slit. There are broad and narrow varieties of it according to the breadth or narrowness of the vein. This one indicates what the others are like; it is well known to surgeons.	0.79163194
As for the basilic vein, which is one of these three veins, the benefit of its phlebotomy is that it draws blood from ailments that are below the throat and neck, from the side of the chest and abdomen. And the phlebotomist, when performing phlebotomy, should be cautious of it and take care, for beneath it is an artery. If he errs and inserts the lancet too deeply, he will sever that artery.	The basilic vein, which is one of these three vessels, helps, when cut, by extracting blood from disorders below the throat and neck, in the parts neighbouring the chest and abdomen. When one venesects it one must be careful and wary of it, for beneath the vein is an artery, so that if one is inaccurate and sticks the scalpel in too far one will cut the artery and cause a haemorrhage; therefore venesection of it should not be done with a transfixing scalpel but should be an incision with the lancet.	0.8600211
This will cause bleeding, therefore its phlebotomy should not be with a piercing lancet, but rather it should be incised with the nashl. If the basilic vein is not clearly visible, then it should be avoided and another vein selected or one of its branches sought.	If the basilic vein is not clearly discernible, leave it and turn to another, or look for a branch of it; or venesect the brachial cord instead, for that is evident; incise it with the lancet as we have said.	0.70627123
Or, phlebotomize the cephalic vein in its place, for it is visible, and incise it with the nashl lancet as we have said. If you wish to phlebotomize the basilic vein itself, then, before tying the arm, you should palpate the area until you identify the location of the pulse, then mark it with ink.	But if you wish to open the basilic vein itself you should, before you bandage the arm, palpate the place till the site of pulsation is found; then mark it with ink; then bind the arm and cut the vein obliquely with the lancet as we said, and take care that the stroke fall some way from the artery.	0.8169863
Then tie the arm and incise the vein obliquely with the nashl lancet as we have said, and take care that the incision falls far from the location of the artery.  Whenever, upon tightening the bandage, you see a swelling in the place that you marked with ink, then that swelling is the distension of the artery, so avoid it.	If, when tying the bandage, you see a swelling in the place that you have marked with ink, that swelling is the inflation of the artery, so avoid it.	0.65646577
If you see the blood, upon phlebotomy, spurt like the urine of a child, and the blood is thin and red, know that it is from the artery. Then, immediately place your finger on it for a long time, then remove your finger. If the bleeding stops, as it often does, then bandage the arm.	And if, on section, you see the blood spurt out like a child's urine, and it is clear and red, then you may know that it is arterial blood; so then be quick and put your finger upon it for a long while; then remove your finger and if the bleeding stops, as it often will, then bind up the arm and leave it.	0.85547215
Leave it and warn the patient against neglecting it. Let it be supported and do not move it for days until it heals. If the bleeding does not stop and overpowers you, and you do not have medicine at hand, then cauterize the artery if it is visible to you, for its ends will contract and the bleeding will cease.	Caution the patient against neglecting it; let him be careful and not move it for some days, until it heals. But if the bleeding is not stayed but resists your treatment and you have no medicament there at the time, then cut the vessel through if you can see it; for the two ends will contract and the haemorrhage will stop.	0.8801557
Or take a pistachio shell and split it, take one half, and tie it tightly over the site of the vein with the bandage and dressings until the next day. If the bleeding stops, then good. Otherwise, treat it with what was previously mentioned regarding the placement of styptic powders. Stopping its bleeding is not difficult in most cases.	Or else take a pistachio nut shell and split it and take one half and bind it over the site of the haemorrhage with a pad and bandage until next day. The bleeding may stop; if not, then treat by those means mentioned previously, namely the application of styptic powders. It is not difficult in most cases to stop the bleeding, because the wound is small and it is easy to bandage the arm.	0.92079186
Because of the small size of the wound and the effectiveness of the bandage on the arm, be aware of this. As for the cephalic vein, the benefit of its phlebotomy is that it draws blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body because it is composed of a branch from the basilic vein and a branch from the cephalic vein, as we have said.	So get to know it. Venesection of the median vein results in drawing off blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body; this being due to the fact, as we said, that it is composed of a branch of the cephalic and a branch of the basilic veins.	0.70688164
It is necessary for the phlebotomist to be cautious when bleeding it, for beneath it is a nerve. If he goes too deep with the lancet and hits the nerve, numbness will occur in it, which is difficult to heal, and perhaps it will not heal at all. This nerve is often perceptible to the touch.	The venesector should be very careful in opening it because there is a nerve beneath; and if he takes the scalpel too deep and hits that nerve it will cause stupor, the healing of which will be difficult and perhaps even impossible.	0.7888018
If it is hidden in some people and is thin and not apparent, then you should make your incision lengthwise with the lancet and avoid the nerve as much as possible. If the vein is between two nerves, then incise the vein lengthwise. As for the cephalic vein, the benefit of its phlebotomy is that it draws blood from the head.	Generally this nerve can be felt, but if in some persons it lies hidden and is slender and not discernible, then you should make your venesection an incision with the lancet and diligently avoid the nerve. If the vein lies between two nerves you should cut it longitudinally. The cephalic vein: section of it is effective in drawing blood from the head and in diseases of the eyes.	0.8320867
It is beneficial for diseases of the eyes. For this vein, especially, it is necessary, if you want to bleed it, to bleed it by puncturing with the olive-shaped lancet or with the broad basil-shaped lancet because it is the safest of all the veins because there is no artery or nerve beneath it.	Particularly in this vein you ought, if you wish to incise it, to make your incision by puncturing with the olivary or the broad myrtle-leaf scalpel, for this is the safest of all veins as there is neither artery nor nerve beneath.	0.7653121
Except that you should, when performing phlebotomy, avoid the head of the muscle with the lancet and look for the soft area. It does no harm if you do not hit it on the first attempt to repeat the phlebotomy several times, except that it may swell in some people if it is not bled on the first attempt.	When you are cutting it you have only to avoid with the scalpel the head of the muscle and to look for the soft place. It will not injure it, if at the first cut you miss the vein, to repeat the incision several times; except that in some people it will sometimes swell up if the section is not made at the first stroke; nevertheless that swelling will do him no harm.	0.73730844
Or it is used for illnesses.  The one used for preserving and maintaining health and preventing the occurrence of diseases should be phlebotomy in one of the three veins in the elbow, I mean the cephalic, median cubital, and basilic veins, and the phlebotomy should be at the beginning of spring when signs of fullness appear.	When used for the preservation and maintenance of health and for guarding against the occurrence of disease, the venesection should be in one of the three vessels at the elbow, cephalic, median, or basilic; and it must be performed at the beginning of spring when the signs of repletion appear.	0.7870785
And the phlebotomy should be on Sunday or Tuesday after three hours of the day have passed. As for the phlebotomy that is used for diseases, it has no specific time, but rather whenever the need and necessity for it arises, night or day.	The venesection should be done on a Sunday or Tuesday, after three hours of the day have passed. On the other hand, venesection administered for diseases has no fixed hour but when need and necessity arise, either by night or by day, at any hour, in any season.	0.824095
And at any hour and at any time. Children should not be bled until they reach fourteen years of age, and the elderly who have passed sixty years of age should not be bled.  So, if someone intends to be bled for any reason.	Children should not be venesected until their fourteenth year, nor should you venesect old men of over sixty years.	0.69464135
It is necessary to cleanse his bowels before phlebotomy with a mild enema if there is a lot of retained waste, lest foul superfluities be drawn from the intestines to the veins during the phlebotomy, harming the principal organs. And one should not bleed someone who is suffering from nausea, is drunk, or intoxicated until that has passed.	When anyone has decided to be bled, for whatever reason, first of all his bowels must be purged with a gentle enema if they contain much excrement, lest at the venesection putrid superfluities be drawn from the bowels into the veins, that might harm the chief parts of the body. No one suffering from indigestion or surfeit or drunkenness should be venesected until recovered from these; nor a dropsical patient.	0.81854606
And one should also avoid phlebotomy immediately after dysentery, vomiting, diarrhea, excessive intercourse, fatigue, exercise, staying up late, fasting, and anything that weakens the strength, whether physical or mental. Then consider thinning the humors before that if the blood is thick.	Beware also of venesection after stomach-trouble or vomiting or diarrhoea or much intercourse or fatigue or exercise or sleeplessness or fasting and anything else that diminishes the strength both bodily and spiritual.	0.72674274
With foods and drinks and medicines, if possible. Then he should enter the bath if nothing prevents him, or engage in some exercise to thin the blood, and perform the phlebotomy in the middle of the day, as we have said, and he should aim to clear his mind that day of all bad psychological influences.	Then, beforehand, see to the refining of the humours, if the blood be thick, by means of food and drink and medicines, if that is practicable for him. Then, if there is no contra-indication, let him enter the bath; or let him take a little exercise to make the blood thin. Then perform the venesection in the early part of the day, as we have said.	0.73667455
Such as worries, anger, and fear, and from all physical influences such as excessive fatigue, exhaustion, and intercourse, and so on. And his session should be attended by things that people are accustomed to using, such as various perfumes, fragrant plants, amusements, and so on, each person according to their means.	Let him endeavour on that day to have his mind free from all such evil spiritual affections as anxiety, anger, or fear; and from all bodily affections such as excessive fatigue and weariness and intercourse and the like. There should also be in the place where he is sitting such things as are customary for men to enjoy, such as various perfumes, aromatics, and music, and the like, as each one may.	0.7943293
Then the phlebotomist sits on a cushion that is higher than the cushion on which the person being bled sits. Then he extends his arm and the phlebotomist rubs it with his hand two or three times, then he tightens the bandage with the tie and twists it two or three times, and the tightening should be moderate.	Then the venesector should sit on a cushion raised above the cushion of him whose vein is to be opened. Then let him stretch out his arm, and let the venesector chafe it two or three times with his hand; then he should bind a bandage round it by means of thongs twisted two or three times.	0.8315386
Because when the tightening is not moderate, either by excessive tightening, it prevents the flow of blood, or if it is too loose, it also prevents the flow of blood. Then, after tightening, the person being bled should rub his hands together.	The ligature should be moderately tight, for any other sort of ligature, be it too tight or too loose, will hinder the flow of blood. After putting on the tourniquet the patient about to be venesected should chafe his own hands together until the veins swell up and become obvious.	0.7195876
Until the veins swell and become perceptible to the touch. Then the phlebotomist wipes the lancet with a little old oil, especially, then places his left index finger on the vein itself, below the place where he wants to bleed it slightly, so that the vein does not shift and he can avoid missing the target. Because some veins you find like a tendon that shifts during bleeding, and some are filled with air, so when you place the lancet on them, they sink under the lancet and deceive the phlebotomist, and the lancet does not open the vein. And if it does open it, the opening will be narrow.	After putting on the tourniquet the patient about to be venesected should chafe his own hands together until the veins swell up and become obvious. Then the venesector should wipe over his knife with a little olive-oil, preferably old. Then he should place the forefinger of his left hand on the vessel itself below the place where he wishes to cut, lightly, so that the vein does not slip away and elude the stroke; for there are some veins that you may find like cords slipping away at venesection, while others are filled with flatus and when the knife is applied to them they contract under it and deceive the operator and the knife fails to open the vein or makes only a narrow opening.	0.84701073
Therefore, the phlebotomist should be firm and deliberate in all these matters. Then he lowers the lancet. If it opens the vein on that first attempt, then fine. Otherwise, he tries again a little below that spot or above it quickly, if the area has not swollen.	Wherefore it behoves the venesector to be firm and deliberate in all these cases. Then he should apply the knife and if the vein is opened first time, good; but if not, let him repeat a little lower down or a little above, quickly, if the place does not swell.	0.8397504
If the area swells or the patient becomes distressed, leave him for a day or two and do not tie the bandage, as it may bring on a hot swelling. And he should not enter the bath. Then he resumes bleeding if he wishes. If the lancet pricked the vein and the opening was small and the blood flow was thin.	If it does swell or the patient be anxious, then leave him for a day or two and do not bandage, for that might perhaps provoke an abscess; nor let him go to the bath. Then if he likes, let the venesection be repeated.	0.8341825
And if you fear that the desired amount of blood will not come out, return the lancet to the same hole, gently and straight, and increase the opening slightly. Do this quickly before the area swells, because in many people the area swells with a small opening.	If the knife has made an opening but it is small and the flow of blood is feeble and you fear that the amount of blood you require will not come out, then gently insert the knife again straight into the same opening and widen it a little. Do this speedily before the place swells up; for in many people the place swells up at once from a small opening.	0.77573204
If you see that it has swollen, do not return to it at all, as it will not help you. Place some oil dregs on it, as this facilitates the flow of blood. It is better in this place than the oil itself and other ointments.  And so on.	But if you see it swell up, on no account make another incision for it will be ineffectual; but apply to it a little lees of oil, for that will facilitate the flow of blood; it is superior in this situation to the oil itself and to all other unguents.	0.7913708
So use oil dregs in all your vein bleeding when blood flow is difficult.  Theriac al-Fārūq and saxifrage can also do this if either of them is placed on the area, as the blood thins and dissolves if it is thick.	Therefore use lees of oil in all cases of venesection when the flow of blood is hindered. The great theriac and shakhzanaya both have the same effect, for when the blood is thick it is rendered thin and running.	0.7616199
If a large swelling occurs at the bleeding site, which often happens, especially for those who have not been bled except that once, or if the opening of the vein was small, then hasten to place on the swelling a sponge dipped in slightly warmed water and salt and tie it for an hour, as it will dissolve.	If there occur a big tumour at the site of venesection, as often happens, especially with a man who has not previously undergone venesection or if the opening in the vein be small, then quickly apply to the place a sponge soaked in lukewarm salt and water and bandage it for a while, then it will go down.	0.8498769
And you should do this after the blood has come out of the vein itself completely, or from another vein. If some blackness or greenness remains in the place after a few days, it will not harm. If you like, apply some dissolved aloe and myrrh.	You should do this after the blood has gone out altogether from the same vessel or from another one. If there remain after some days some discoloration or greenness at the site it will not hurt; if you like, apply some solution of myrrh and aloes, or juice of penny-royal or something similar.	0.8836359
Or some germander juice and the like. Often, swelling and flatulence occur when bleeding the basilic vein, so put your hand on it, and if you find it softens when you press on it, then that is bad flatulence, so beware of putting anything we have mentioned on it.	Often in section of the basilic vein there occurs tumour and swelling. Put your hand upon it, and if you find that it sinks when pressed then it is a harmful swelling; be careful not to apply to it any of the things we have told you; for often arterial blood comes from it.	0.77893746
For arterial blood may flow from it, but bandage it with something astringent to harden the area, then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals. And it is necessary to remove from each person blood according to their strength and what appears from the dominant color of the blood.	But apply a poultice with some styptic qualities, to harden the place; then treat in the usual way until healed. Now in each case you should extract blood in proportion to the person's strength and to the prevailing colour of the blood.	0.70593786
If the blood is black, let it flow until it turns red, and likewise, if you see it thick, let it flow until it thins, and likewise, if it is sharp, until its sharpness goes away. And it is necessary for those who are full and strong and need to remove blood all at once.	If the blood be black, let it flow until it becomes red; in the same way, if you see it is thick, let it run until it is thin; and again, if it be sharp, until its sharpness is gone. In the case that is plethoric, robust, and requiring venesection just the once, the incision should be wide and the knife should be broad.	0.89413595
to widen the opening of the vein and the lancet should be wide. And whoever is weak, the opposite of that, and it is necessary to remove it in stages, and the opening should be narrow. The best thing to use in phlebotomy is to be oblique, deviated, and incised, not punctured.	And on the contrary for the debilitated person, in whose case you should venesect several times and the opening should be small. The best method in venesecting is if the incision be at an angle, oblique, cutting, not piercing.	0.6964999
This type of phlebotomy is safe from bleeding and from severing a nerve, and it is better and safer than transverse and longitudinal phlebotomy. And whoever habitually faints during phlebotomy, it is necessary to feed him, before phlebotomy, some bread soaked in pomegranate juice or oxymel.	This manner of venesecting is safe from haemorrhage and from cutting the nerve; it is better and safer than cutting straight across or straight along. To the patient who habitually faints during venesection you should give to eat beforehand a little bread macerated in the juice of unripe pomegranates or oxymel, if he be of a warm temperament; and draw off the blood in three or four instalments.	0.8060585
If he has a hot temperament, let the blood be drawn in three or four stages. If he has a cold temperament, let him take, before phlebotomy, bread soaked in raisin wine or in honey syrup flavored with spices or in fragrant basil wine.	And if he be of a cold temperament let him take beforehand bread macerated in syrup of quinces or in aromatic syrup of honey or in fragrant syrup of basil.	0.7205459
If fainting occurs during phlebotomy and its cause is the exit of much blood, then he should be given meat broth and thin basil drink and apply rosewater perfume, rubbing his chest with it, and use all that we have mentioned in the section on fainting in the chapter on divisions.	If the patient faints during venesection and the cause is great loss of blood, then be should be given to drink meat-juice and thin syrup of basil; and he should perfume himself with galia moschata and anoint his chest with it. And for the rest, use what we have spoken of in its place in the chapter dealing with fainting due to evacuation.	0.76899046
which occurs from excessive bloodletting. As for whoever wants to refresh his arm and release his blood again, it is necessary for someone who has been bled excessively and whose strength is weak to release the blood little by little, according to his strength, on successive days.	As for him who wishes to ease his arm and draw off blood a second time, when he is undergoing the venesection on account of great evacuation and the lowness of his strength, you should let the blood slowly, in proportion to his strength, on successive days.	0.8108047
As for whoever wants to refresh his arm and release his blood again and has a strong body, let him do that seven or nine hours after his first phlebotomy.  As for whoever wants to draw blood from his body to the opposite side to which it has flowed, it is necessary to refresh it for him on the second or third day.	For him who wishes to ease his arm and draw off blood a second time, being of robust body, it must be done seven or nine hours from the first venesection. He who wishes to draw blood from his body to the side opposite to that toward which it tends, should be eased on the second or third day.	0.914603
As for someone whose body has an abundance of blood that has become hot and sharp and caused a fever, it is necessary to remove the blood all at once and remove a large amount and widen the opening until fainting occurs, after having observed all the conditions of phlebotomy. And put your hand on his pulse as the blood flows lest death occur instead of fainting, as this often happens if the bloodletter is ignorant and careless.  And it is not necessary if you want to loosen the arm and release the blood again.	He who has abundant blood that has become hot and sharp and has produced fever should be bled at one time, and a large amount should be taken with a wide opening, until he faints (all the rules of venesection having been observed by you); but you should keep your finger on the pulse while the blood flows lest death take the place of fainting, for that often happens when the venesector is ignorant and there is carelessness.	0.77806103
If the mouth of the vein has closed and the exit of blood has become difficult, do not squeeze it hard or twist it forcefully, for that is very bad. Rather, either leave it until you bleed it again or remove with the blade of the lancet what has congealed of the blood at the mouth of the vein.	If you wish to loosen the arm and let blood a second time and you find that the opening of the vein is now closed up and the outflow of blood is difficult, you should not press hard upon it nor twist the arm violently, for that is very harmful.	0.7558711
Or apply to it some salt dissolved in water or apply to it some of the antidote *al-Fārūq* or *shakhzanaya,* and squeeze it gently until the blood comes out. If the vein has become swollen, leave it.	Either you must leave him a while and then bleed him again; or the clot of blood can be removed from the opening of the vein by using the blade of the scalpel, or by applying some salt dissolved in water; or apply some of the great theriac or shakhzanaya; and put light pressure upon it until the blood comes out.	0.70434487
And do not touch it until the swelling subsides. If necessity calls for releasing blood again and it is unavoidable, then either bleed it above that place or bleed it in the other arm or in the other vein.	But if the vein has begun to swell, leave it and do not touch it until the swelling has subsided. And if you are unavoidably called to let blood again, venesect either above the place or in the other arm or another vessel.	0.8706138
As for phlebotomy of the cephalic vein of the arm, it is bled instead of the median cubital and basilic veins if they are not found or are hidden because it is composed of them.  The manner of its phlebotomy is that the patient puts his hand in hot water until the forearm reddens and the vein appears clearly. Then tie above it with the bandage a slight, moderate tightening.	Section of the cord of the arm: this is cut in place of the median and basilic veins when these are not to be found or are hidden; for this vein is composed of those two. The way to venesect it is for the patient to dip his hand in hot water until the forearm is red from the warmth and the vessel stands out distinctly.	0.7702576
Then bleed the vein at a slight angle, neither transversely nor longitudinally, and let the opening be wide and your bleeding of it be a little above the wrist joint. If the exit of blood is difficult, put the hand back in the vessel with hot water and let the blood flow into the water.	Then bandage a little above it with a moderate pressure, and then cut the vein a little obliquely, neither transversely nor longitudinally. The incision should be broad, and you should make the cut a little above the wrist. If the blood does not flow easily, have the hand again put into the vessel of hot water and let the blood flow into the water until you have extracted what is needed.	0.9011046
Until it reaches your need. If you are in the summer days, you may dispense with putting the hand back in the hot water.  Putting the hand in hot water to make the blood flow is mostly done in winter. Phlebotomy of this vein is safer than all veins. Because there is no pulsating artery or nerve under it. As for the phlebotomy of the cephalic vein from the right hand, it is beneficial for liver ailments.  The way to bleed it is to tie the wrist with a bandage or with your hand after placing it in hot water until the vein swells.	If it be in the summer time you may be able to dispense with putting the hand back into the hot water; it is mainly in winter that you let the blood flow into hot water. Venesection of this vessel is safer than all others for beneath it there is neither artery nor nerve. Section of the salvatella of the right hand is efficacious in case of diseases of the liver.	0.82587194
Because there is no pulsating artery or nerve under it. As for the phlebotomy of the cephalic vein from the right hand, it is beneficial for liver ailments.  The way to bleed it is to tie the wrist with a bandage or with your hand after placing it in hot water until the vein swells. And it becomes very clear to the touch. Then phlebotomize it at a slight angle, and if you completely sever it, it will not harm it at all. Be careful not to go too deep with the lancet, for underneath it is the nerve of the fingers and the area is devoid of flesh. Then return the hand to the hot water.	Venesection of this vessel is safer than all others for beneath it there is neither artery nor nerve. Section of the salvatella of the right hand is efficacious in case of diseases of the liver. The method of venesecting it is to tie a band round the wrist or grip it with your hand, after you have put it in hot water until the vein is swollen up and is plainly to be felt; then cut it somewhat obliquely; if you cut it right through that will not matter at all. But be careful not to go too far with the knife, for underneath there are the tendons of the fingers and the place is bare of flesh.	0.8244362
And leave it to let the blood flow into it. For if you do not return it to the hot water, the blood will clot at the mouth of the vein and will be prevented from flowing. When you have extracted the necessary amount of blood, put fat and salt on the vein so that it does not heal quickly.	Then put the hand again into hot water and let the blood flow; for if you do not put it into hot water again the blood will clot in the opening and will be prevented from flowing. When you have extracted the required quantity of blood, put oil and salt on the vein so that it does not heal too quickly.	0.87045515
And you should do the same with any narrow branch.  As for the benefit of its phlebotomy from the left hand, it is beneficial for ailments of the spleen.  And you do with its phlebotomy just as you did with the other, in the same way.  As for the saphenous phlebotomy, its benefit is for diseases that are in the lower body, such as uterine ailments.	You should act thus with every narrow branch. Incision of the salvatella of the left hand is of value in diseases of the spleen. Venesection of it should be carried out in the same manner as you did in the other. Venesection of the saphena is beneficial in diseases of the lower part of the body, such as afflictions of the uterus and retention of the menses, and for diseases of the kidneys, and for chronic ulcers of the hips and legs, and similar diseases.	0.77364427
And retention of menses and kidney diseases and chronic ulcers of the thighs and legs and similar diseases. The way to phlebotomize it is to put his leg in hot water and massage it until the veins appear. Then tie above the ankle joint with a bandage, and the vein's location is at the heel, apparent towards the big toe.	Now the manner of venesection is for the patient to put his foot in hot water, then friction should be applied to it until the veins fill up; then bind a thong over the joint of the foot; then the site of the vein at the ankle is shown up running toward the big toe and forming many branches on the surface of the foot.	0.6677643
And many branches spread from it on the surface of the leg, so phlebotomize it in its widest branch or at the heel where it converges, for that is best and safest.  If you phlebotomize it on the surface of the leg, beware of the nerves that are underneath it on the surface of the leg.	Then make your incision either in the broadest branch or at the ankle before it ramifies, for that is better and safer. If you venesect it on the surface of the foot, be careful of the tendons that are beneath on the surface of the foot.	0.77570486
And make your incision for it obliquely as if you intend to sever it, and the lancet should be sharp. If the blood flow is difficult, let him put his leg back in the hot water and let the blood flow into it until it is finished. If the phlebotomist misses the vein with the lancet the first time,	Make the incision obliquely as though you were cutting the vein through. The knife should be a lancet. If the flow of blood be impeded, put the foot back again into hot water and let the blood flow out into it until it is evacuated.	0.7924762
let him repeat the phlebotomy a little higher, for the area is safe and there is no fear of a consequence if you are careful of the nerve, as we said. And you do the same with the saphenous vein of the other leg, in the same manner. As for the sciatic vein, its location is, as we said, at the heel on the lateral side.	If the venesector makes a mistake the first time in the vein to be cut, let him repeat the section a little higher up, for the.place is safe; you need fear no mischief as long as you are careful of the tendons, as we said before. In the same way you may deal with the saphena of the other foot. Now the position of the sciatic vein is, as we said, on the outside near the heel.	0.81851625
And the benefit of its phlebotomy is for hip pain if that is due to hot blood. The way to phlebotomize it is to have the patient enter the bath and relax. Then tie his leg from the hip to four fingers above the heel with a thin, long bandage, for it will not appear except by this.	Section of it is effective in pain in the hip when it arises from hot blood. The way to venesect it is to make the patient get into the bath. Then hasten and bandage his leg from the hip to a distance of four fingers above the heel, with a long narrow bandage; for only this will cause it to appear.	0.78624475
When it appears, phlebotomize it in whichever manner works for you: either obliquely, which is best, or sever it completely, or incise it. For its location is safe. It is, in most people, very hidden, so if you do not find it,	When it has appeared then open it in whatever way you can; at an angle, which is best, or right through, or only cut it open, for it is a safe place.	0.7399056
and it does not appear to the senses at all, then phlebotomize some of its branches, which are those that appear on the back of the foot towards the little and ring fingers. Be careful of the nerves, and let the desired amount of blood flow.	But in many people it is very hard to find; and if you do not find it or it is in no way palpable, then venesect one of its branches, which will be seen on the surface of the foot towards the fourth toe and the little toe. Be careful of the tendons, and let the amount of blood you require.	0.58579445
Then loosen the bandage and place cotton on the site of the phlebotomy and bind the area, for it will heal quickly.	Then loosen the bandage and apply cotton wool to the site of the section and bandage the place; it will heal quickly.	0.80244946

Chapter Ninety-Six.	CHAPTER NINETY-SIX.	0.80544806
On Cupping and How to Use It.	On cupping and the manner of employing it.	0.8934512
Cupping vessels may be made of horn, wood, copper, or glass. Cupping is done in two ways: one is cupping with scarification and letting out blood, and the other is cupping without scarification.	Cupping-vessels are made of horn, wood, bronze, or glass. Cupping is carried out in two ways: one with scarification and drawing blood, and the other without scarification.	0.92703974
This cupping without scarification is done in two ways.	The latter, cupping without scarification, may be carried out in two ways: with fire and without fire.	0.6826595
And the cupping of the two akhda'ayn, which are the two sides of the neck, and the cupping of the chin, which is below the lower jaw of the mouth, and the cupping of the shoulders, and the cupping of the coccyx at the base of the tailbone, and the cupping of the two forearms, which are the middle of the arms, and the cupping of the two legs, and the cupping of the two ankles.	The points at which cupping with scarification and extraction of blood is performed are fourteen places in the body: the occiput, which is the back of the head; the interscapular region, which is the middle of the back of the neck; the two sides of the neck, equally on both sides; the chin, that is, beneath the lower jaw; the two shoulders; the coccyx, at the base of the tail; the antibrachium, the middle of the forearms; the two legs; and the two heel-veins.	0.76318705
Cupping only draws blood from the thin veins dispersed in the flesh, and for this reason, it does not cause a drop in strength like phlebotomy.  Cupping, whether with fire or without fire, should not be used in any of the diseases that result from fullness until the whole body is emptied.	What cupping does is to draw blood out of the fine vessels dispersed over the flesh; for this reason it does not cause the strength to decline as does venesection; nor may you use cupping, either with fire or without fire, in any disease due to plethora, until the whole body has been evacuated.	0.80283785
If there is a need for cupping, due to illness or habit, we use it at any time, at the beginning of the month, at the end of it, in the middle of it, and at any time.	If disease or custom prescribe cupping we may apply it at any hour, at the beginning or end or middle of the month, at whatever time it may be.	0.79748577
Some people, when they have an excess of blood to the point that they need to remove it by cupping, feel heaviness and headaches.  Some feel fullness and redness in their face, head, and neck. Others feel itching in their face and temples, darkness and burning in their eyes, and some itch at the site of their cupping.	For there are some people who, when there is an abundance of blood in them, so as to need cupping, feel heaviness and pain in the head. Some find they have a fullness and redness of the face and also of the head and neck; some have an itching in their face and forehead and a dimness and irritation in their eyes.	0.90524286
Some laugh excessively. Some taste blood in their mouths, their gums swell, and they spit blood. Others sleep excessively, and some see blood, redness, the slain, wounds, and similar things in their sleep.  Whenever we see any of this...	There are some who scratch the places where the cupping-vessels are applied; some laugh immoderately; some find a taste of blood in the mouth, and the gums swell up and they spit blood; some sleep overmuch; some frequently dream of seeing blood and redness and murdered men and wounds and the like.	0.84055847
Especially if it is in the middle third of the month, we then order cupping two or three hours after the start of the day. As for the benefit of wet cupping, it benefits heaviness in the head and water pouring into the eyes.	So when we see anything of this kind, and especially if it be in the middle third of the month, we thereupon prescribe cupping after the second or third hour of the day has passed. The effect of cupping the nape of the neck is to help in heaviness of the head and in a fluxion of humours into the eyes; but it should be done after a complete evacuation of the body.	0.7368367
But this should be after purging the whole body. This cupping may be a substitute for cephalic venesection.  One should beware of using it on someone with a cold brain or who has a cold, as it will greatly harm them.	This use of cupping may take the place of venesection of the cephalic vein. But anyone suffering from coldness of the brain or catarrh should beware of using it, for this will cause serious harm.	0.8103226
Therefore, it should not be used on the elderly or those with cold ailments in their heads. Whoever becomes accustomed to it will develop forgetfulness.	So it should not be employed on old men or on anyone suffering from a cold disease of the head. If anyone becomes addicted to it it brings about oblivion.	0.9045156
Therefore, you should instruct the cupper to lower his hand with the cupping glass slightly downwards, for fear of causing forgetfulness. As for cupping the back, it is a substitute for venesection of the brachial and basilic veins.	You should therefore bid the cupper bring the cupping-vessel a little lower down lest oblivion supervene. Now as to the application of cupping-vessels to the interscapular region: it is instead of venesection of the median and basilic veins; so it is effective for asthma and dyspnoea and for rupture of the organ of respiration, and for cough and plethora.	0.66413236
Therefore, it is useful for asthma, shortness of breath, obstruction of the respiratory system, coughing, and fullness.  The cupping on the back should be raised a little because if it is placed too low, it will cause weakness in the heart and stomach.	Now as to the application of cupping-vessels to the interscapular region: it is instead of venesection of the median and basilic veins; so it is effective for asthma and dyspnoea and for rupture of the organ of respiration, and for cough and plethora. The cupping of the interscapular region should be made a little high, for if it is too low it will bring about weakness of the heart and stomach.	0.67120534
Cupping on the two jugular veins is beneficial for headaches, ophthalmia, migraines, sore throat, and pain at the roots of the teeth. It replaces venesection of the basilic vein.  You should instruct the cupper not to go too deep with the incision, lest he sever an artery and cause bleeding.	Cupping the sides of the neck helps in pains occurring in the head, ophthalmia, migraine, and in quinsy and in pain at the roots of the teeth; it replaces venesection of the basilic vein. And you should bid the cupper not to scarify very deeply lest he cut an artery and cause haemorrhage.	0.8642485
Cupping under the chin is beneficial for thrush in the mouth, gum disease, and similar ailments in the mouth, and it can replace venesection of the vein in the lips. Cupping on the shoulders is useful for palpitations resulting from fullness and heat.	The application of cupping under thé chin helps against ulcers in the mouth and corruption of the gums and similar diseases of the mouth ; and may replace venesection of the four labial vessels. The application of cupping to the shoulders helps in palpitation of the heart arising from plethora and heat.	0.841419
Cupping on the bellies of the two forearms is beneficial for the same things as venesection of the three veins: the basilic, the brachial and the cephalic, because it draws blood from all the thin veins in the flesh. These thin veins draw from other, thicker veins until the drawing reaches the three thick veins.	The application of cupping to the inside of the forearms helps in place of venesection of the three veins, namely the basilic, median, and cephalic; for it draws blood from all the capillaries of the flesh. These capillaries draw blood from other larger veins till the drawing reaches those three great veins.	0.86701894
You should instruct the cupper not to make the incision too deep because the area is devoid of flesh and has nerves and arteries underneath.  As for the single cupping applied to the coccyx, it is beneficial for hemorrhoids and ulcers of the anus.	You should bid the person who applies the vessels not to scarify deeply; for the place is bare of flesh and there are tendons and arteries beneath. The application of a single cupping-vessel to the coccyx is effective for haemorrhoids of the anus and ulcers of the lower abdomen.	0.90076005
You should instruct the cupper to use a large cup made of copper, because the area requires strong suction, and a glass cup might break. He should make multiple incisions. Cupping on the legs noticeably reduces fullness.	You must tell the cupper that the cupping-vessel should be large and of bronze, for the place requires strong suction, and a glass cupping-vessel may break; and he should scarify deeply.	0.8227504
Because it draws blood from the entire body, it benefits chronic pains in the kidneys, uterus, and bladder, stimulates menstruation, helps with pimples and boils, and serves as an alternative to venesection of the saphenous and ankle veins. However, it greatly weakens the body and causes fainting in most people. Cupping the ankles has benefits similar to cupping the legs.	Cupping applied to both legs reduces plethora manifestly, because it draws off blood from the whole body, and so is beneficial for chronic pains in the kidneys and uterus and bladder; and brings on the menses. It also serves for pustules and boils; and takes the place of venesection of the saphenous veins and the heel-veins. But it greatly exhausts the body and causes fainting in most people. The advantage of cupping of the heel-veins is much the same as that of the legs.	0.88441
The method of applying cups is as follows: first, place the cup empty and apply moderate suction. Do not leave the cups on for long, but rather apply and remove them quickly so that the humors flow evenly to the area. Continue repeating this process until you see the area has reddened and opened up.	The way to apply the cupping-vessels: the vessel is first put in position empty; then you suck moderately; do not long hold the cupping-vessel in place, but apply it quickly and remove it quickly so that the humours gather evenly at the place; and go on doing it time after time until the place is seen to redden and to swell, and the redness of blood is manifested.	0.85431707
And when the redness of the blood appears, then make an incision and reapply suction gently. Then consider the condition of the bodies. For those with thin flesh and open pores, you should only make one incision, lest the area ulcerate.	Then scarify, and repeat the suction very gently; then consider the bodily condition. The person who is tender of flesh and porous of skin you should scarify once only, not more, lest the place ulcerate.	0.7750696
And instruct the cupper to widen the incision and deepen it slightly, and to apply the suction gently with a gentle movement. If the blood is thick, he should make two incisions. The first time to open a path for the thin, watery blood, and the second time to completely extract the thick blood.	Tell him who applies the cupping-vessels to scarify rather widely and deeply, and to control the suction with gentleness and a delicate motion. If there be a thickness of the blood he should scarify twice; the first time to make a way out for the thinner blood and serum; and the second time to complete the extraction of the thick blood.	0.8276668
If the blood is very turbid, he repeats the incision a third time to achieve the goal. In general, if we want to extract a little blood, we are satisfied with one incision. If we want to extract a lot of blood, we make more incisions, and if we estimate that the blood is thick.	If the blood be very turbid let him scarify a third time for completion. In general, one scarification is enough when we wish to draw a little thick blood; but if we wish to draw much blood we make more scarifications. If we judge that the blood is thick we should scarify deeply.	0.89589924
then it is necessary to make a deep incision, and the moderate limit for the incision is the depth of the skin only.  What oils and waters should be used when applying cups, and what the person being cupped should avoid.  As for someone whose skin is thick, hard, dry, and whose pores are narrow,	A fair depth for the scarification is the thickness of the skin, and no more. The oils and water to be used in applying cupping-vessels, and what he who is to be cupped should avoid.	0.7403214
it is necessary to anoint the places of the cups with opening, softening, resolving oils. If it is summertime, then use oils such as oil of roses, or oil of violets, or oil of sweet almonds, or oil of pumpkin seeds.	He whose skin is thick, solid, desiccated, and narrow of pore: the operator should anoint the place with opening and emollient and resolving oils; if it be in the summer season, with, for example, oil of yellow gilliflower or of violets or of sweet almonds or of pumpkin-seeds.	0.74414843
If it is in the winter, then use oils such as oil of narcissus, or oil of iris, or oil of chamomile, or lily, and the like. If the excess is thick and cold, then let the oil be oil of marjoram, or oil of pennyroyal, or oil of rue, or oil of dill, and the like.	If it be in winter, with narcissus oil or oil of lilies or camomile oil, or of jasmine, or the like. And if the superfluity be thick and cold, then with oil of marjoram or oil of wild thyme or oil of ben or oil of dill.	0.8943819
If the person being cupped has wide pores and soft flesh, then it is necessary to abstain from oil. These people should wash their cupping sites after cupping with rose water or cold water or nightshade water or pumpkin water or purslane water and the like. As for someone whose blood has much moisture,	If he who is to be cupped has wide-open pores and tender flesh, he should be forbidden oil. After cupping, such people should wash the sites with rose-water or cold water or water of black nightshade or of gourds or of garden purslain, or the like. But he whose blood is very humid should wash the sites of his cupping with vinegar or water of myrtle or sumac, and the like.	0.90685856
they should wash their cupping sites with vinegar or with myrtle and sumac water and the like.  As for those whose excesses are thick, they should wash their cupping sites with old wine or with marjoram water or a decoction of dill or chamomile and the like.  It is necessary to avoid cupping in the bath and immediately after the bath.	He that has thick superfluities should wash the sites of his cupping with old wine or water of purslain or decoction of dill or of camomile or the like.	0.76519406
Rather, it should be employed an hour or two after leaving the bath.  No one should sleep after cupping. How the person being cupped or bled should be managed before cupping and after it.	One should beware of cupping in the bath or just after the bath, but should use the vessels one or two hours after leaving the bath. And no one should sleep after cupping. The correct procedure to be observed before and after cupping by him who is to be cupped or venesected.	0.86584496
You must first observe.  If the person being cupped or bled is choleric and his blood is predominantly sharp and inflamed, then he should take cooling things such as pomegranates and chicory with vinegar, and lettuce, and oxymel, and julep and the like. And he should make his foods baby chickens and lamb, vinegar-based stews, and dishes with sour grapes, and the like.	It is necessary for you first to consider, and if he that is to be cupped or venesected be bilious, and bitterness and inflammation prevail in his blood, he should take cooling things such as pomegranates and endive with vinegar and lettuce and oxymel and julep, and the like. His diet should be chicken and mutton made into stews with vinegar, and soups with verjuice, and the like.	0.90577817
Whoever has a cold temperament should be given honeyed drinks and a drink of grape syrup or oxymel with seeds, and should consume fragrant, medium-aged wine that is between old and new. He should be instructed to eat little food, and his food should be baby chickens, partridges, small birds, and young pigeons in white stews. The drink on the day of cupping and bleeding should be more than the food.	The man of frigid constitution should drink syrup of honey or syrup of quince or spiced oxymel; he should also take perfumed raisin wine, not too old and not too new; he should be bidden to be moderate in eating and should make his diet young pullets and larks and sparrows and young pigeons in white stews. And on the day of cupping and venesection he should drink rather than eat.	0.84983957
It may be necessary at times to give some people some of the antidote al-Fārūq or musk medicine or theriac before cupping and before bleeding or after it to strengthen the principal organs and thin the blood.  It should not be given to those with fevers.	It may sometimes be necessary to have some people drink the great theriac or musk-medicine or shllitha before cupping and before or after venesection, to strengthen the chief parts and to render the blood thin; but these draughts should not be given to the feverish.	0.85596085
As for the cups that are applied without scarification, they are the cups that are placed on the liver and spleen and breasts, and on the abdomen and navel and the location of the kidneys and the hip joint, because these organs do not tolerate scarification on them.  Rather, the purpose of them is either to draw blood from one organ to another.	Cupping without scarification is the cupping practised on the liver, the spleen, the breasts, the belly, the umbilicus, the region of the kidneys and the acetabulum of the femur; for these parts do not tolerate scarification.	0.62402403
Like when we place the cup on the breasts in the case of nosebleed, or we use it to dissolve cold wind that has become trapped in the organ, like placing the cup on the abdomen and navel, for it loosens the organ and warms it and removes the pain by dissolving that wind.	Now the purpose of the vessels is either to draw blood from one part to another, as when we apply cups over the breasts in the case of nose-bleed; or to loosen from the part a frigid vapour that has become fixed in it, as when we place cupping-vessels on the abdomen and umbilicus; for they stimulate the part and warm it and remove the pain because they loosen the vapour.	0.77389526
It may also be placed on the kidneys if there is a blockage or stone in them, so by the strength of its suction, it may open the blockage or remove the stone from its place.  And it does likewise when placed on the liver and spleen when wind is trapped in them. These cups may be used empty, by suction only.	Sometimes they are applied over the kidneys when there is an obstruction or stones in them; for often, by virtue of their drawing, the obstruction is opened up or the stones are dislodged from their site. They act in the same way when they are applied over the liver and the spleen when flatus is permeating them. These cupping-vessels may be used empty with suction only; or they may be used with fire.	0.8514787
They may be used with fire, and they may be used filled with lukewarm water in cases of hemorrhoids, and that is that you fill the cupping glass – and let it be large – with hot water alone, or with water in which some of the herbs suitable for that have been cooked.	Sometimes in pleuritic complaints they are applied filled with tepid water. This is done by filling the vessel, which should be large, with plain hot water, or with hot water in which suitable herbs have been boiled.	0.69108546
Then it is placed full on the area, and held and removed and repeated several times as needed. And this is the image of the cupping glass that is used with fire.	Then it is applied to the place, full, and held there, then removed; and the process repeated as often as is necessary. This is the figure of the cupping-vessel for use with fire.	0.87602067
The width of its mouth is two open fingers, as we have depicted, and its depth is about half a span, and there is on its side, about halfway down, a small hole about the size of a needle. It is made of Chinese copper or yellow copper, with a thick rim.	Its mouth should be the width of two opened fingers, as we have illustrated; the depth should be half a span; and in the side about halfway down there should be a small hole of a size to admit a needle. It should be made of Chinese bronze or of brass.	0.86854094
It is smooth, level and polished so that it does not harm the organ when placed on it, and there is in its center a transverse rod of copper or iron where the candle is placed with fire.  And this cupping glass may be made larger than what we have described, and smaller, according to the ailments.	The edge should be thick, smooth, even, and polished, so as not to injure the part to which it is applied. And in the middle there should be a transverse rod of bronze or iron to carry the lighted lamp. You may make this kind of cupping-vessel in a large size, larger than we have described; and in a small size too, to suit various ailments and the age of the user.	0.7886604
Its use is established. Indeed, the cupping glasses for boys and thin people are not the same as the cupping glasses for men and thick-bodied people. As for how to place this cupping glass with fire on the organ, it is that you prepare a wick with fire from well-twisted flax or a small candle of tar, and you place it on the center of the fixed rod that is in the center of the cupping glass.	For the cupping-vessels for boys and thin persons differ from those for men and stout persons. Now this is the manner of applying this cupping-vessel with fire to a part of the body. You set light to a strongly twisted wick of linen or a small wax candle, and you set it on the middle of the cross-piece in the middle of the vessel so that the flame be directed toward the lower part of the cupping vessel and not burn the patient's body.	0.78302354
So that the ascent of the fire upwards is towards the bottom of the cupping glass, so that the patient's body does not burn.  Then it is placed on the organ, and the finger is on the hole that we mentioned, so that if we hold the cupping glass as long as we need, we remove the finger.	Then the vessel should be placed on the part with the finger kept over the above-mentioned hole; then when we have held the vessel sufficiently long there the finger is taken away, the vapour will come out through the hole, and the vessel will become loosened at once.	0.6804426
And the vapor comes out through that hole and the cupping glass loosens on the spot. Then you prepare the wick in the manner described and repeat it if you need to. As for the cupping glass that is used in the treatment of erysipelas with water, it has neither a fixed rod nor a hole.	Then light the wick as prescribed and repeat if necessary. But the cupping-vessel that is used in pleurisy, with water, has no cross-piece nor hole; it is used by simply filling with water and applying to the part.	0.7665132
It is only used by filling it with water and placing it on the organ only.  And this is its image:	This is the figure of it.	0.4018582
And this cupping glass, the larger it is to hold a lot of water, the better.	Now the larger this cupping-vessel is, to hold much water, the better.	0.83651567

Chapter Ninety-Seven	CHAPTER NINETY-SEVEN.	0.713497
On Applying Leeches	On the application of leeches.	0.7850629
Leeches are only used in most cases on organs where cupping glasses cannot be placed, either because of their small size, such as the lip and gums and the like, or because the organ is devoid of flesh, such as the finger, nose and the like.	Leeches are mostly used on those parts of the body to which application of cupping-vessels is impossible, either because of their smallness, such as the lips, the gums, and so on; or because the part is bare of flesh, like the finger, the nose, and so on.	0.89721805
The way to use them is to select leeches that are in fresh, pure water free from impurities, then leave them for a day and a night in fresh water until they are hungry and there is nothing left in their bellies. Then the body is first evacuated by phlebotomy or cupping, then the diseased organ is wiped.	This is the way to use them: you seek some leeches that are in fresh water free of dirt. Then you leave them in fresh water for a day and a night until they are hungry and nothing is left in their bellies; then you purge the patient's body, either by venesection or by the application of cupping vessels; then you scrub the afflicted part until it is flushed; and then place the leeches on it.	0.7847759
Until it reddens, then it is placed on it, and when it is full it falls off.  If it is possible to suck the area with a cupping glass, it is more effective in benefit, otherwise, wash the area with vinegar, then with plenty of water, and massage it and squeeze it.  If the flow of blood continues after the leech falls off and it is oozing, then soak a linen cloth in cold water.	When they are full they will fall off. If it is possible to make suction with a cupping vessel, the effect will be greater. But if not, wash the part with vinegar followed by much water; then rub and put pressure on it. If the blood continues to run after the leeches have fallen off, and becomes an ooze, let linen dressings be wetted with cold water and apply them over the place until the oozing stops.	0.88634926
And place it on top until the oozing stops. If the bleeding is profuse, sprinkle on it powdered vitriol or gallnut or similar astringents until the bleeding stops, or place peeled halves of fava beans on the area.	But if the bleeding be serious then sprinkle upon the place powdered vitriol or gall or similar styptics, until the haemorrhage is stopped.	0.73274934
And leave it until the fava beans stick to the area, then the bleeding will stop. And if there is a need to reapply leeches, do not reapply those leeches if others are available. If the leeches refuse to attach, then wipe the area with fresh blood.	Or let split shelled beans be applied to the place and left until they stick there, and then the bleeding will stop. If it is necessary to repeat the application, the same leech should not be applied but another one if you possibly can.	0.7663395
Or prick the area with a needle until some blood comes out, then place them; for when they sense some blood they will stick to the spot. When you want them to fall off, sprinkle on them some aloe, salt, or ash, and they will immediately fall off.	If the leeches fail to stick on, the place should be wiped over with fresh blood or pricked with a needle to bring out a little blood; then apply them, for if they smell any blood they will immediately adhere. When you wish to remove them, sprinkle over them a little powdered aloes or salt or ashes, then they will at once fall away.	0.8104831

On Bone-Setting.	ON BONE-SETTING	0.5723529
This chapter is also among the most essential things needed in the practice of medicine, and it is the setting of fractures and dislocations occurring in the bones.	This third part of the book, too, is an essential necessity in the practice of medicine; it concerns the setting of the fracture or dislocation occurring in bones.	0.79160285
Know, my sons, that this chapter is also claimed by the ignorant among physicians and the common people, and by those who have never perused a book of the ancients on it, nor read a word of it.	You should know, my sons, that ignorant practitioners and laymen and those who have never turned the pages of a single book of the Ancients about it, nor studied a single letter of it, arrogate this part of the art to themselves.	0.76922
For this reason, this art of science has become extinct in our country, and I have never met anyone at all who is proficient in it. I have only learned from it what I have learned through long reading of the books of the ancients and my eagerness to understand them until I extracted knowledge of it from them, then I adhered to experience and practice throughout my life.	For this reason this section of the science has died out in our parts; I have myself found no one competent in it; and whatever skill I have, I have derived for myself by my long reading of the books of the Ancients and my thirst to understand them until I extracted the knowledge of it from them. Then through the whole of my life I have adhered to experience and practice.	0.88473356
And I have depicted for you in this chapter all that my knowledge encompasses. And my experience with it has passed, after I have brought it closer to you and purified it from the branches of prolixity, and abbreviated it to the utmost brevity, and clarified it to the utmost clarity, and depicted for you in it many images of the instruments that are used in it.	So now I have described for you in this book all that my knowledge has encompassed on the subject and that my experience has encountered; I have made it accessible for you and rescued it from the abyss of prolixity; I have reduced it to a brief outline; and have explained it most clearly. I have made for you many drawings of the instruments that are used in it, which is an adjunct to explanation, as I did in the two previous books.	0.8387916
As it increases clarity, as I did in the two preceding chapters.  And there is no power except in God, the Most High, the Great.	I have made for you many drawings of the instruments that are used in it, which is an adjunct to explanation, as I did in the two previous books. And there is no power save in God the High, the Great.	0.68737996

chapter-3-subchapter-1.txt
Chapter One.	CHAPTER ONE.	0.8394858
In it are comprehensive and summarized points regarding bone fractures that should be presented. And before we begin mentioning the fractured and dislocated limbs one by one, it is necessary that we mention at the beginning of this chapter comprehensive statements and sections. Which will compel you first to understand them and grasp their truth, you and whoever else is eager to learn this noble profession.	In which is given the necessary compendious preliminary information on fractures. Before we begin to speak of the fractures and dislocations of individual members we must, as an introduction to this book, give the general and particular information which compels your understanding and your being versed in it; both you and anyone else beside who is eager to learn this noble art.	0.8350902
So I say that whenever a fracture, dislocation, blow, or fall occurs to someone, it is necessary to hasten first to phlebotomize him, or give him a purgative, or both. Unless something prevents this, such as weakness of strength, or if the one to whom this has happened is a child or an elderly old man, or if the weather is intensely hot or intensely cold.	So I say that when anyone has sustained a fracture or dislocation or luxation or fall, you should first hasten to venesect him, or get his bowel open, or both, if there be nothing to hinder such as physical weakness, or unless it be a small boy or a very old man to whom an accident of this kind has happened; or unless the weather be excessively hot or cold.	0.90014505
Then his diet should be restricted to cold vegetables, the meat of birds and kids, and he should be prevented from drink, rich meats, filling up on food, and any food that fills the veins with blood until the swelling is relieved and you are not expecting a discharge to the site.	Next, let his diet be restricted to cold vegetables and the flesh of fowl and kids; he is to be forbidden wine and rich meat and gluttony and all foods that fill out the blood-vessels, until you are sure that there is no abscess and see no reason to suspect a flux of matter to the place.	0.8720254
Then, at that time, let the patient return to his former regimen, which was his habit. So if the broken bone begins to heal, it is necessary that the patient nourish himself with very nourishing, rich, and firm foods that have a viscous quality, such as porridges, rice, heads, trotters, and cow stomachs. And eggs, soft fish, rich drinks, and the like.  For with this regimen, the consolidation of the fracture will be faster and better.  And know that broken bones, if they are in robust men and old men, can never be joined and healed according to their original nature.	Then let the patient return to his former diet according to his custom. When the broken bone has begun to mend, the patient should be nourished with very nourishing food, fat, strong, having some glutinous property, such as porridge, rice, heads, trotters, the tripe of cows, eggs, fresh fish, heavy wine, and the like; for on this diet the mending of the fracture will be quicker and better.	0.8909808
Because of the dryness and hardness of their bones. And bones that are extremely soft, such as the bones of young children, may join and heal. But nature grows on the broken bone, from all its sides, something resembling thick glue that adheres to it and binds it until some of it sticks to the others.	You should know that fractures occurring in mature and old people cannot join and mend into the original condition, on account of the dryness and hardness of their bones; though any bones that are extremely soft, like those of infants, may make a union and heal.	0.70067394
And it binds some of it to others until it reaches the utmost strength and firmness as it was originally, so that nothing hinders it from its functions.	Yet nature produces around the bone on all sides something like glue, with a certain viscosity, with whose help it joins, and it binds so that one part adheres to the other and they are linked to one another until it be good and firm as it had been before; so that there is no impediment to any of its functions.	0.6046385
For this reason, it is necessary that the patient's food be foods that have firmness, viscosity, and richness, as we have said. And know that the types of fractures vary according to the differences in the organs, because a fracture of the leg bone is different from a fracture of the head bone, and a fracture of the chest bone is different from a fracture of the back bone.	It is on this account that the patient's food should be the sort that has solidity and glueyness and thickness, as we have said. You should know that there are as many different types of fracture as there are members. Thus a fracture of the leg bone differs from a fracture of the cranium; and a fracture of the breast bone differs from a fracture of the bone of the back; and similarly there are differences among the other parts.	0.8949719
And so are all the other organs, each one different from the other. And we will mention each type of fracture, explained in its chapter, detailed separately. And the type of bone fracture may also differ in itself.	We shall give an exposition of each kind of fracture, each in its own chapter and distinguished from the others.	0.6801032
Because it may be fractured into pieces without splinters occurring in it, and it may be fractured along the length of the bone, and its fracture may have splinters and protrusions, separated and not separated, and the fracture may be with a wound and a tear in the skin, and the fracture may be a slight crack.	The fracture of each bone also has its own variations; for the fracture may be a clean break without splintering; or the fracture may be along the bone, with splinters and projections which may be sharp or may not; and the fracture may involve a wound and a laceration of the skin; and the fracture may be a crack.	0.77168643
And each type has a specific method for its repair, as will be mentioned in detail in its place. And among the things by which a bone fracture is recognized are its curvature, its swelling, its perceptible appearance, and its crackling when you press it with your hand.	Each kind has its own special technique of setting which will be mentioned in detail, each in its place. Among the diagnostic signs of a broken bone are: distortion, protrusion, the aspect of it, and the crepitus when you press on it with the hand.	0.7846583
So when there is no apparent curvature in the area, no crackling, and you do not feel any disturbance when you examine the bone, and the patient does not feel much pain, then there is no fracture, but it may be a bruise or a minor fracture or a slight crack. So you should not move it by stretching and pressing at all.	When there is no obvious distortion or crepitus at the site, nor do you feel movement when you manipulate the bone, and the patient does not experience severe pain, there is no fracture there.	0.76148486
Rather, apply to it the medications that will be mentioned later, which are appropriate for the location, then bandage it gently.  And know that when the bone is broken and shattered in two without any splinters occurring in it, each part has become separated from the other.	But it is possible that there is a luxation or a slight fracture or a little crack; so you must not disturb it with any extension or pressure, but apply one of the remedies suitable to the site, such as will be described later; then bind up gently. If the bone is parted and broken in two and there is no fragmentation but a simple separation of one part from its fellow, then you should lose no time in straightening and aligning it before an abscess sets in.	0.630181
Therefore, you should immediately proceed to straighten and align it before a hot swelling occurs. If a hot swelling does occur, leave it for a few days until the hot swelling subsides, then align it in any way you can with gentleness and skill.	If an abscess does set in, then let a few days pass until it has subsided; then gently and skilfully straighten it in whatever way you can.	0.68441975
And know that repairing and aligning it is easier than a bone in which splinters have occurred. Then bandage it as will be mentioned later. If the bone has splinters, it is necessary to stretch the broken limb from both sides, whether it is an arm or a leg.	You should know that the setting or alignment of this is easier than that of a splintered bone. Then bandage as will be prescribed. But if the bone is splintered, extension from either side is necessary, whether it be hand or foot; with your own hands if it be a small member, or with two ropes or with one hand and a rope.	0.7970202
Either with your hands if the limb is small, or with two ropes, or with a rope and your hand. And place the limb on a level surface in its natural form, so that when the broken bone fragments are stretched, then you should return those protrusions to their places by any means you can with skill and gentleness.	You should place the part on a flat surface in its natural attitude so that when both parts of the broken bone have been extended you can try to restore the fragments to their proper place with all the skill and gentleness possible; and do your utmost to ensure that the patient experience no pain or distress as you operate.	0.7209405
Strive as much as possible not to cause the patient any pain or discomfort with your actions.  Strive to join one bone to the other in the best possible manner.  And at that time, you should touch and probe them with your hand.  If you find anything amiss, correct and align it to the best of your ability.	Try diligently to get one part of the bone fitted in the best form to the other. At the same time you should palpate and investigate both of them with your hand, and if you find anything wrong then mend it and straighten it to the best of your ability.	0.81131834
Beware of excessive pulling and forceful squeezing, as many ignorant people do.  They often cause, by their actions, hot swelling or chronic pain in the limb, as I have witnessed many times from their practice.	But avoid violent extension or compression which many ignorant people apply; for by doing so they often cause abscess or crippling in the limb, as I myself have many times seen.	0.80854195
Then, after alignment, precision, and bandaging, ensure that the limb is kept still and at rest. Warn the patient against moving it while awake or asleep, when turning or moving around, when defecating, and in all movements as much as possible. They should ensure the limb is positioned in a way that avoids pain.	Then after you have exactly repositioned it and bandaged it, keep that limb still and quiet, and bid the patient beware of moving it while awake or asleep, and in his shifting and stirring, and in opening the bowel, and in every activity, to the utmost of his capacity; and that he should try to let the position of the limb be such that he is free from pain; when pain or distress is felt in any position in which he has disposed the limb, he should move it to a different position in which he feels no pain.	0.8739052
Whenever they feel pain or discomfort in a particular position, they should change it to one that is painless, while ensuring that this new position is level and straight.	At the same time he should try to make that position even and straight, so that when the limb is mended there be no curvature in it.	0.5977531
This prevents crookedness in the limb when it heals.  As for the method of bandaging the fractured limb, it is as I will describe to you. Know that fractured limbs differ in size, thickness, and form.  Those that are small, such as the arm, finger, forearm, and similar bones...	As to the way to bandage a broken limb, it is as I shall now describe to you. You should know that limbs which may be fractured vary in their size and shape.	0.7178194
...should be wrapped with thin, soft bandages. Those that are thick, such as the thigh, back, and chest, should be wrapped with wide, firm bandages, because a wide bandage holds the large limb and tightens it evenly from all sides, leaving no irregularities.	The strips of bandage for those that are small, such as an arm or finger or forearm or the like, should be soft and fine, while those that are thick, such as the hip, back, or breast, should have broad and strong bandages. For a broad bandage holds fast to a big limb, binding it all round with an even pressure so that no defect may occur.	0.7956687
Then, after you have finished the alignment, you begin to apply the appropriate medication. on soft lint at the site of the fracture. Then begin wrapping the bandage at the fracture site itself, three or four turns, depending on the requirements of the limb. Tighten the bandage slightly with your hand, then bring it to the area above the fracture site.	Then, after you have finished the setting, begin by applying a suitable liniment on soft tow over the site of the fracture, then start to wrap the bandage over the actual site, three or four turns of bandage as the part may require, winding it fairly tight.	0.8852707
with less tension than you applied to the fractured site. Then move the wrapping slightly away from the fracture site and gradually loosen the tension until you reach a suitable portion of the healthy area.  Then take another bandage and wrap it also over the fracture site.	Then carry on the bandage above the site of the fracture, winding it more loosely than on the fractured place, and continue a little with the bandaging beyond the place of fracture, loosening the tension gradually, until you have taken up a good amount of the sound part.	0.7876016
Wrap it a few times, then bring the wrapping to the area below the fracture. Your action in tightening and loosening the wrap should be as described for the first, upper wrapping. Then place soft lint or rags between the wrappings to even out the crookedness of the fracture.	Then take another bandage and wind it several turns over the fracture and then carry it over the part below the fracture, the tightness and looseness being arranged in the same way that we prescribed for the first covering, of the upper part. Then put between the bandages enough soft tow or soft rags to correct the curves of the fracture, if any; otherwise put nothing in.	0.8316226
If there is crookedness, otherwise do not put anything there. Then wrap another bandage over it.  Then apply your well-constructed splints over these bandages immediately if there is no swelling or hot inflammation in the limb.	Then wind over it another bandage and at once lay over it strong splints, if the part be not swollen and effused.	0.6792971
If there is swelling or hot inflammation, apply something that soothes the swelling and removes the inflammation, and leave it for a few days, then apply the splints.  The splints should be made of wide, carved, and skillfully prepared halves of reeds, or the splints can be made from sieve wood.	But if there be swelling or effusion in the part, apply something to allay the swelling and disperse the effusion; leave it on for several days and then bind on the splints.	0.70329994
which are made of pine or palm leaf ribs or heather or Ferula and the like, whatever is available.  The width of each splint should be like this image and this exact shape.	The splints should be made of broad halves of cane, cut and shaped with skill; or the splints may be made of the wood used for sieves, which are made of pine; or of palm branches; or of brier or giant fennel or the like, whatever wood be at hand.	0.61434495
Except that the splint placed directly on the fracture should be slightly thicker and wider than the other splints. As for the length of the splint, it is made according to what is appropriate for the fractured limb, whether large or small. Image of the splint:	The size of each splint should be of this form and shape, except that the splint that is placed on the fracture itself should be a little thicker and broader than the others. As to the length of the splint, it should be greater or less as suits the fractured part. Figure of a splint.	0.8143393
Then tighten another bandage over the splints, just like your first tightening, then tie it from above with tight threads as we mentioned regarding tightening, which is that your tightening should be more at the site of the fracture. And the further away from the fracture, the less the tightening.	Then bind over the splints another bandage just as tightly as you did your first; then over that tie it up with cords arranged in the way we have said, that is, with the pressure greatest over the site of the fracture and lessened as you move away from it.	0.9087076
The threads should be medium in thickness and thinness, and specifically made of damp linen, because if the threads are thick, as I have seen ignorant people do, making their threads from twisted strips of linen, this is a grave mistake.	The cords should be of medium thickness, of linen supple of quality. For if the cords are too thick, such as I have seen ignorant people use who made their cords of twisted bands of linen, that will be a grave error, for moderate tension with these is impossible.	0.84712607
Because the tightening with them becomes excessive, and thin threads are also not suitable because you will not achieve the desired tightening with them. There should not be less than a finger's width between one splint and another.	Nor are fine threads suitable either, for with these you cannot achieve sufficient tension. Between splints there should be a space of not less than a finger's breadth.	0.808993
If the patient is bothered by the edges of the splints after tightening in the correct places, then place soft rags or fluffed wool underneath them so that they do not cause any harm. As for when the fracture is accompanied by a wound and a tear in the skin, we will discuss that separately.	If, after bandaging, the patient is hurt in the sound parts by the ends of the splints, then put a little soft tow or carded wool under them until they no longer hurt him thus. As for the case of a fracture accompanied by an open wound, it will be mentioned in a special section on its own.	0.82599247
Know that not every fractured limb should be tightened with splints from the first day.  If the limb is large, splints should not be placed on it until after five days, or seven, or more, depending on your confidence regarding the occurrence of hot swelling.	You should know that not every fracture should be bound up with splints on the first day; that is, when the part is big you should not apply splints until five or seven days after, or more, depending on when you are satisfied that there is no effusion.	0.8916038
This is the description of the bandages that the ancients used to treat fractures, dislocations, and sprains. It is a description of a general, simplified bandage that treats fractures and is suitable for most temperaments, especially children and women, because it is neither excessively hot nor cold.	This is a description of the plasters that the Ancients used for repair, applied to a fracture, dislocation, or sprain. Description of a common simple plaster for the repair of fractures, suited to most constitutions, particularly for women and children, because in it there predominates neither hot nor cold.	0.88125455
It is that you take mill dust, which is the fine flour that clings to the walls of the millstone when the mill is operating, and knead it, as is, without sifting, with egg white. Make the dough neither thick nor thin, then spread it.	Take mill-dust, that is, the fine flour that sticks to the walls of a mill as the grindstone moves. Pound it as it is without sieving, with egg-white, to a medium consistency; then use.	0.87034285
The description of another bandage that treats fractures, dislocations, and sprains: Take ten dirhams each of mastich, labdanum, acacia, frankincense, storax, and gum Arabic; five dirhams each of myrrh and aloe; twenty dirhams of tamarisk; and twenty dirhams of Armenian or Greek clay. Grind everything and mix it with tamarisk water or egg white if the patient's temperament is hot. Then use this bandage, for it is well-composed, quickly heals broken bones, and is suitable for most people due to its balanced nature.	Description of another plaster for the repair of a fracture, luxation, or dislocation: take ten drachms each of pulse, gum-mastic, acacia, elecampane, mughath, and sukk; five drachms each of myrrh and aloes; twenty drachms of tamarisk and twenty drachms of clay of Armenia or Asia Minor; all should be pounded fine and mixed with water of tamarisk, or with eggwhite if the patient be of a warm constitution; then use this plaster, which is excellent for uniting, quickly repairing broken bones, and suits most people because of its mildness.	0.9229939
The description of another bandage that is also useful for fractures and sprains:  Take ten dirhams each of storax, mastic, and white marshmallow; five dirhams each of myrrh and aloe; six dirhams of acacia; twenty dirhams of Armenian clay. Grind everything finely, sift it, and knead it with water or egg white, then use it.	Description of another plaster valuable for a fracture or sprain: let there be taken ten drachms each of mughath, pulse, and white marsh mallows, five drachms each of myrrh and aloes, six drachms of acacia, and twenty drachms of Armenian clay. Let them all be well beaten up and passed through a sieve and made into a paste with water or egg-white and used.	0.903116
The description of a bandage for joints and bones displaced from their positions, and it relieves the pain that affects them, and for bone fissures and fractures: Take degreased wool, soak it in vinegar and boiled oil, and place it on the affected area.  This bandage does not have the strength to set bones.	Description of a plaster for dislocated joints or bones, soothing the accompanying pain, and for a crack or fissure of bone: let unwashed wool be taken and soaked in a decoction of oil and vinegar and applied to the place.	0.8534304
But it is excellent in relieving hot swelling and particularly in repelling pain.  The description of another bandage that sets broken bones:  Take leaves of the mute fig and leaves of wild poppy, grind them together, and apply them moist as a bandage.  The description of another abbreviated bandage used when a bone fracture has set.	Now this plaster has no power of repair but it is outstanding for reducing effusion and dispersing pain. Description of another plaster for the repair of a broken bone: let there be taken the leaves of the hard fig and of the wild poppy and both be beaten up together and a plaster made of them while still fresh and damp.	0.7842256
And you want to resolve the remaining swelling: Take equal parts of marshmallow root, chamomile, violet flowers, and fenugreek flour. Grind everything and knead it with honey if the limb is not inflamed. If it is inflamed, knead it with coriander water or plain water, and use it.	Description of another simple plaster used when a fracture is mending and you wish to disperse residual swellings: take one part each of marsh mallow root, chamomile, violet flowers, and flour of vetch; pound it all and make a paste with decoction of wine, if the part be not inflamed. But if it be inflamed make it up with water of fresh coriander or plain water, and use.	0.8160642
The description of another bandage, stronger in resolving than this first one, used when a hard swelling occurs when a bone has set: Take equal parts of marshmallow root, flax seed, fenugreek, melilot, marjoram, violet flowers, and chamomile.	Description of another plaster stronger than the former for resolving, used if a hard swelling arises as the bone sets: let there be taken equal parts of each of marsh mallow roots, linseed, fenugreek, melilot, sweet marjoram, violet flowers, and chamomile; they should all be beaten up together and made into a paste with willow infusion or sweet water or wine, according to whether the part is inflamed or its heat has subsided.	0.7937811
Grind everything and knead it with salt water or fresh water or honey, all depending on the heat of the limb and the subsiding of its heat.  As for Hippocrates, he did not mention in his book that anything should be placed on a broken limb when setting it.	Now Hippocrates in his book did not mention any application for the repair of a fractured part except a wax plaster made of wax and oil, nothing else.	0.5185357
Except for the cerate made from wax and oil, nothing else.  And he described that it should be of medium consistency, between thick and thin.  As for Galen, he considered that things with drying properties and some heat, such as myrrh, aloe, and frankincense, and things like those we mentioned, should be placed on a broken limb when setting it.	He prescribed that it be of a consistency midway between thick and thin. Galen, on the other hand, thought it good to apply to the broken limb, when it is mending, things which have a certain power of drying, with some heat, such as myrrh, aloes, olibanum, and the sort of thing we have mentioned.	0.82578754
The description of a bandage useful for weakness and pain: Take equal parts of litharge, chickpeas, chopped human hair or bird feathers, marshmallow root, and salt. Grind, sift, knead, and bandage with it.  As for the amount of time the bandage should remain...	Description of a plaster valuable for debility and pain: let equal parts of each be taken of mughath, chickpease, minced human hair or birds' feathers, marsh mallows and salt; grind it up and pass through a sieve and make into a paste and use as a plaster.	0.830089
Then it is loosened. Thus, observe: if no pain, itching, or movement of the broken bone from its place occurs in the patient, do not loosen it for many days. If, however, intense itching, disturbing pain, or swelling occurs in the area...	As to the length of time the bandages should remain on before being loosened: you should keep an eye on the patient and if he suffers no pain or itching or any shifting of the broken bone, then they should not be loosened for a number of days; but if he experiences at the place a violent itching or a disturbing pain or swelling, then hasten to loosen them and make no delay; and remove the plaster.	0.75433755
Then quickly loosen it immediately, and do not delay this at all. Remove the bandage from it. Then take a soft cloth or a wet sea sponge, dip it in lukewarm water, and wash the area with it until the itching and pain subside. Then leave the limb to rest for an hour.	Then you must take a soft cloth or a soft marine sponge and dip it in tepid water and bathe the place until the itching subsides and the pain settles; then let the limb rest for an hour; then apply to it raw wool soaked in oil and vinegar or oil of roses, and bandage it on for one night until you are sure there is no effusion and the swelling of the limb has subsided and the pain has gone.	0.8039546
Then apply teased wool soaked in vinegar and oil or rose oil, and bandage it on overnight, until you prevent hot swelling, and the swelling of the limb subsides, and its pain disappears. Then return it to gentle tightening and light bandaging. Do not tighten it as tightly as the first time.	Then put the bandage on again gently, and a light plaster; do not bind it up as you did at the first but go gently with it until it heal.	0.5897647
And be gentle with it until it heals. If you see that the swelling, redness, pain, inflammation, and all the symptoms are completely gone, and you need bandaging and tightening, then replace it as you did the first time, in the same manner. If none of what we have mentioned occurs in the limb...	If you see that the effusion, inflammation, pain, swelling, and other symptoms are totally gone, and you need to plaster and bandage it, then repeat just as you did at first.	0.7100948
...do not loosen it except after three or four or five or seven days. It may be left for twenty days.  All of this depends on what you observe of the condition of the limb, as we have said, until the fracture sets and the flesh around it is nearly healed.	But if none of these things that we have mentioned occur, then do not loosen it until after three, four, or five days or a week; sometimes it may be left up to twenty days, depending on how the limb appears to you, as we said, until the fracture be united and the flesh over it be near to joining.	0.78946805
Then, at that time, increase the tightening more than your initial tightening, and also increase the richness of the patient's diet, as mentioned previously. If you see that the fracture site has dried and become thinner than it should be, then know that nourishment is being prevented from reaching it.	Then bandage more tightly than before, and increase the heaviness of the patient's food as has been mentioned.	0.6841187
So, bathe it with lukewarm water every time you loosen it, and let this be every three days, and slightly loosen the tightening. For by this action, nourishment flows to the limb, and it heals quickly. As for what the ignorant bone-setters do, breaking the limb again...	If you see the place of the fracture getting more dry and thin than it should, you may know that nourishment is being prevented from reaching it; so foment it with tepid water each time you loosen it; do this every three days, and ease the bandaging somewhat. This action makes nourishment flow to the limb and it will quickly heal.	0.7851216
...because it did not set properly the first time and healed crookedly, this is a mistake in their practice and a great deception. Had it been correct, the ancients would have mentioned it in their books and practiced it, and I have not seen any trace of it among them whatsoever. The correct thing is not to do it.	What some ignorant bone-setters do is to break the bone again if at first the repair is not as it should be and has mended crookedly. This operation of theirs is mistaken and dangerous; if it were right the Ancients would undoubtedly have spoken of it in their books and would have used it. But I have not found a trace of it in a single one of them; and the right course is not to use it.	0.71673465

Chapter Two.	CHAPTER TWO.	0.8483499
On fractures occurring in the head.	On a fracture occurring in the head.	0.93672884
The types of fractures occurring in the head are many, their forms are varied, and their causes are diverse. Among fractures, some are caused by a sword blow, which may either shave off the entire bone until it reaches the membrane beneath the bone... As an adze does with wood.	The kinds of fracture occurring in the head are many, of various forms and differing causes. Some fractures are due to a sword-stroke which may cut right through the bone and reach the membrane beneath the bone, like an adze-cut in wood, for which reason this kind of cut is called 'ascial'.	0.8607739
This type of fracture is therefore called adze-like.  Or, the sword stroke may cut part of the bone and shave only its surface, without penetrating through it completely; this type of fracture is called a simple avulsion. The wound of these two types of fractures can be either large or small.	Or the sword may cut through part of the bone, only slicing through the surface and not reaching the depth; this kind is called an absolute avulsion. The wounds in these two fractures can be either big or small.	0.8687395
And among fractures, there are those that are comminuted or crushed, caused by a blow from a stone, or a fall onto a stone or something similar. This fracture may be penetrating, approaching the membrane beneath the bone, or it may be on the surface of the bone.	There are also some fractures accompanied by smashing or crushing; such as by a blow from a stone or by falling on a stone, and the like. A fracture of this kind will be either penetrating, reaching the membrane beneath the bone; or superficial; the wound in these two fractures may be either big or small.	0.879271
The wound of these two types of fractures can also be either large or small.  And among fractures are those that are hidden in the bone, as fine as a hair; this is a minor fissure.	Then there is a type of fracture that is hidden in the bone, as fine as a hair, a thin crack; therefore this kind of fracture is called 'capillary'.	0.55904686
This type of fracture is therefore called hair-like. And there are fractures that result from a fall or a blow from a stone or similar object, which pushes part of the bone inward, creating a depression, just as happens to a copper pot when struck—a part of it is pushed inward.	There is a fracture due to a fall or a blow from a stone and the like, making a dent in the surface of the bone and a hollow at the site as occurs in a bronze bowl when a blow falls on it and a portion of it is pushed in.	0.774966
This occurs most often in heads with soft bone, such as the heads of children.  All these types of fractures may have loose fragments or fragments that are not loose; we will discuss the treatment of all of these in their proper place. We recognize all of these types of fractures by examining them.	This mostly occurs in heads whose bones are soft, as those of children. Any of these kinds of fracture may also have splinters, jagged or otherwise; we shall deal with the treatment of all these in their place. All these kinds of fracture are diagnosed by laying them bare and investigating them with probes and removing all the lacerated tissues over them.	0.87687147
And by probing them and removing the corrupted flesh from them.  As for the hair-like type, it is recognized by examining the bone, wiping it, and applying ink to it; the fracture will then appear black.  As for the treatment of the fracture, first consider the patient's symptoms.	The 'capillary' kind is diagnosed by laying bare the bone, wiping it clean, and rubbing ink on it, when the fracture will appear black. As to the treatment of the fracture: begin by paying attention to the patient's symptoms.	0.6955912
If you see symptoms clearly indicating danger, such as vomiting bile, stretching, loss of consciousness, loss of voice, fainting, acute fever, bulging and redness of the eyes, and similar symptoms, do not approach the patient or treat him, for death is inevitable in most cases with these symptoms.	If you observe any symptom clearly indicating something dangerous, such as bilious vomit, convulsion, mental derangement, loss of voice, fainting, high fever, protrusion and inflammation of the eyes, and similar symptoms, then leave the patient alone and do not treat him; for in the majority of cases these symptoms undoubtedly indicate the approach of death.	0.90185463
If you see symptoms that do not alarm you, and you hope for his recovery, then proceed with his treatment.  If the injured person comes to you immediately after being injured, and it is during the winter,	But if you find symptoms that do not alarm you and you see hope of recovery for him, then begin treatment as follows.	0.718839
you should strive to remove the bone before the fourteenth day in any case. If it is during the summer, you should hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, before the membrane under the bone becomes corrupted, causing the symptoms we described to appear.	If he be brought to you immediately after his injury and it be the season of winter, you should try to remove the bone, at all events before the fourteenth day. If it be summer you must hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, before the covering membrane beneath the bone and over the brain be infected, and before the above-mentioned symptoms occur.	0.84467983
If the bone fracture has reached the membrane covering the brain, and there is shattering and bruising, you should cut away the shattered, bruised part as I will describe to you.  This involves shaving the head of the injured patient.	If the fracture has already reached the cerebral membrane with fragmentation of the bone and depression, then you must cut out the splintered and broken part as I shall now describe to you.	0.82066643
Expose the bone in any way possible, depending on the shape of the wound and what is easiest for the patient. If you encounter bleeding or a hot swelling when exposing the bone, address it as appropriate.	Shave the head of the injured patient and lay the bone bare in any way you can, following the course of the injury and in the manner least grievous to the injured man.	0.6637776
This is done by packing the area with rags soaked in rose syrup and oil, and cleaning the wound until the swelling subsides and the bleeding stops. Then proceed to trepan the bone and extract it, which can be done in one of two ways.	If, when you lay the bone bare, you encounter a haemorrhage or abscess, meet the case with suitable remedies; that is, pack the place with dressings soaked in wine and oil of roses, and cleanse the wound until the swelling subsides and you are safe from haemorrhage; then begin the trepanning and removal of the bone. This may be done in one of two ways.	0.7535422
One way is to cut the bone with a fine, narrow-bladed saw, and this is its picture:	One way is to cut the bone with a fine-bladed chisel, this being the figure of it.	0.8440693
Then use another saw after this one, a little wider, and this is its picture:	Then after this one employ another chisel, a little broader. It is figured here.	0.80423903
Then also use another saw, wider than the second.  You should have a set of various saws, some wider than others and some shorter than others, and they should be extremely sharp. Let them be made of Indian iron or good steel.	Then use yet another chisel still broader than the second. You should have by you a number of different chisels, some broader than others and some shorter than others; their tips should be exquisitely sharp; and they should be made of Indian iron or best steel.	0.9557004
Use gentle strokes on the saw so as not to shake the head and cause harm.  If the bone is strong and hard, it should be perforated around it with drills, which they call non-penetrating drills, before using the saws.  They are called non-penetrating drills.	Let the strokes upon the chisel be gentle lest the head be shocked or injured. If the bone be strong and hard you should, before you use the chisel, make perforations round about it with drills called 'non-sinking' drills.	0.9101112
Because they do not go beyond the skull bone to what is behind it, since the drill has a rounded edge below its sharp head, similar to a collar or small circle, which prevents it from sinking and exceeding the thickness of the bone.	Their name of non-sinking drills is due to their not piercing the cranial bone through to what is beneath, because the drill has a circular margin beneath its sharp head like a small collar or wheel, that prevents it from sinking in and going beyond the thickness of the bone.	0.849899
You should have many of these drills, each suitable for the thickness of the bone, so that you have for each skull a drill whose sharp tip, in length and shortness, corresponds to the thickness of that skull. This is a picture of three types. of drills: large, medium, and small.	You must obtain a large number of these drills each of which will suit a certain thickness of bone; so that for each skull you have a drill whose pointed extremity is of a length to suit the thickness of that skull. Here are figured three kinds of drill, large, medium, and small.	0.9254638
As for the method of drilling around the fractured bone, it is that you place the drill on the bone and turn it with your fingers until you know that the bone has been penetrated, then move the drill to another place, making the distance between each hole about the thickness of the probe or similar.	As to the manner of perforation round the fractured bone, you apply the drill to the bone and revolve it with your fingers until you know that the bone is pierced, then you transfer the drill to another place, making the distance between the perforations about the thickness of a probe.	0.9253155
Then you cut with the cutters between every two holes and do that with the utmost gentleness you can, as we have said, until you remove the bone either with your hand or with some other of the instruments that have been prepared for that.	Then with the chisels cut out the bone between the perforations, using the utmost delicacy, as we have said. Then take out the bone, either with your hand or with some other instrument you have ready for the purpose, such as forceps or fine tongs.	0.82877374
Such as forceps and delicate hooks.  You should be very careful that the drill or the cutter does not touch any of the meninges. When you have hollowed out the bone and cleared it from the meninges, if it was adhering to it, and removed it, you should scrape.	You will have to observe the utmost caution that neither drill nor chisel touch any part of the membrane.	0.5449221
And smooth the roughness of what remains on the bone with another instrument resembling the cutter, except that it should be thinner and finer than the other cutters. If any small bones and fragments remain, you take them gently with the instruments you have.	When you have cut the bone circularly, free from the membrane if adherent to it, and have removed it, then you will have to scrape away and smooth out all the roughness in the remaining bone with another instrument, resembling a chisel, except that it must be finer and slenderer than any of them. If there are any little bits or spicules of bone left, pick them out with whatever instrument you can, gently; and then treat the wound with dressings and ointments as we shall describe.	0.78918
Then you treat the wound after that with bandages and ointments which will be mentioned. As for the other way of operating, it is certainly an easy way, far from danger, Galen mentioned it and praised it greatly, and this is what he said. You should first begin by exposing the part of the bone from the place where the fracture is most severe and most obvious, so that when you have exposed that part, you place under it the edge of this lenticular cutter, and this is its form:.	The other way of operating is altogether easy and free from danger; Galen mentioned it and greatly praised it; these are his words: You should begin by laying bare that part of the bone where the fracture is severest and most obvious; when you have done so, place under it the tip of this lenticular chisel figured here.	0.870381
The lenticular part of it should be smooth, not cutting anything, and the sharp part of it should be on its sides going lengthwise, as you see, so that the lenticular part rests on the meninges and the sharp face of the cutter is on the bone, then you strike the cutter from one side.	The lenticular part of it should be smooth and not for cutting, the sharp part of it being on both sides longitudinally, as you see; so that the lenticular part is resting upon the meninges while the cutting surface is on the bone.	0.87344027
With a small hammer until you cut all the bone gently as it rotates, and you are safe from the membrane, no fearful accident will occur at all, even if the practitioner is the most ignorant and cowardly of people, yes, even if he is sleepy.	Then with a small hammer strike the tool on one side until you gently cut through the bone in a circle, in the confident knowledge that nothing untoward can happen to the membrane even though the operator be the most ignorant and cowardly of men; yes, even if he be sleepy.	0.73586285
If any part of the membrane remains attached to the bone in some places on the bone, scrape it off with the edge of the lenticular cutter itself and remove it gently, for it will be removed without harm or fear.	If any membrane stick to any part of the bone, strip it off with the lenticular tip of the chisel and free it gently from it, for it will come away without harm or danger.	0.89839274
But if the bone fracture has not penetrated to the membrane and what has broken from the bone is its surface and there remains in it roughness and fine splinters, then you should smooth out that roughness and remove those splinters with fine rasps which you have made in several different sizes so that you can use the most suitable and appropriate one for each location depending on what the work leads you to.	If it be a fracture of the bone not reaching to the meninges, only the surface of the bone being separated, and there remain some roughness and fine splinters, you should smooth down the roughness and remove the splinters with fine scrapers, of which you should have a number, of varying sizes so that you can use the one best fitted and most suitable, in the light of what is suggested by your operative method and the broken bone itself and its shape.	0.8433219
and the fractured bone itself and its shape, and you should use for your smoothing, first, the widest of those rasps, then use after it a finer one, and continue to do so in succession until you come to using the finest and thinnest of them all.	When you smooth the bone you must first use the broadest of the scrapers and then a finer one, and so on until you come to use the finest and slenderest of all.	0.74986756
As for the other small, hair-like cracks and fine fractures, it is necessary to apply a treatment to each one according to what leads to its healing, and it is something that is not hidden from anyone who has the slightest training in this craft and has studied what we have written and explained about major fractures.	As to the rest, the little capillary fractures and fine fissures, you will have to apply to each of them that treatment that will bring about a perfect repair. This is obvious to anyone who has the least practice in this art and is acquainted with what we have written in explanation of the big fractures.	0.83336866
If the membrane remains exposed when you remove the bone, then you should take a linen cloth the size of the wound and dip it in rose oil and place it on the mouth of the wound, then take another folded or triangular cloth. And dip it in wine and rose oil and place it on the first cloth and do this as gently as you can so that you do not weigh down the peritoneum then use a wide bandage over it and do not tighten it except enough to hold the wound only.	If the meninges are left bare when you remove the bone, you should take a linen dressing measured to the wound, soak it in oil of roses, and apply it to the opening of the wound; then take another dressing, folded in two or three, soak it in wine and oil of roses and apply it over the first with the utmost gentleness so as not to press upon the meninges; then employ a broad bandage on top, but tighten it only enough to keep the wound covered.	0.88448703
And leave it with this treatment for a day or two until you are safe from hot swelling, then loosen it and use after that the medications that have an excess of dryness, such as orris root, and thistle flour, and frankincense powder, and zedoary, and the like, which is that you make a powder from these medications.	Leave it with this dressing on for a day or two until you are sure there is no abscess; then loosen it and apply desiccant remedies such as lily roots, vetch-flour, powdered frankincense, birthwort, and the like.	0.7181126
And sprinkle it on the wound as it is dry, and in general, use in that a medication that cleanses and does not sting, and take great care while treating the wound that it be clean, free from the harm of oil and dirt, and do not allow pus to collect in it at all.	The method is that you make a powder of these drugs and sprinkle it, dry as it is, upon the wound; in short, in these cases use drugs whose nature is cleansing and not irritating.	0.6158551
Because if pus collects on the membrane of the brain, it corrupts it and putrefies it, and this causes a great affliction to the patient, and it may happen in the peritoneum of the head when the bone is exposed from it, especially if its treatment is neglected.	In this be most diligent, that the wound, while you are treating it, be clean; nor let there be any dirty vestiges of ointment in it or any filth; and let no pus collect in it; for when pus collects on the meninges it corrupts them and renders them necrotic, which causes great harm to the patient.	0.5542279
Blackness on its surface, consider. If the symptoms that we mentioned appear to the patient, then know that he is inevitably doomed. However, if the blackness only occurred from a medication placed on it, and the strength of that medication was such that it caused that blackness.	Sometimes the surface meninges go black when the bone is removed, especially when the treatment of them is neglected; so observe, and if the patient exhibit any of the symptoms that we have mentioned you may know that he is undoubtedly doomed.	0.5890201
Then you should take one part of honey and three parts of rose oil and beat them well and smear a cloth with them, then place it on the peritoneum, then treat it with the types of treatment that are necessary until it heals.	But if the blackness be due to some medicament applied to it, which has the power to produce blackness of that kind, then you should take one part of honey and three parts of oil of roses, beat them well up together, spread on a cloth and apply it to the membrane; then treat as necessary until cured.	0.73319435

On the repair of the nose if it is broken.	On the repair of a broken nose.	0.848862
Know that nothing of the nose is broken except its two upper bones together or one of them, because they are bone, because what is below it is cartilaginous and is not broken, but it is subject to bruising, bending, and flattening.	You should know that the only portion of the nose that can break is the upper portion in its entirety or in one of its two parts; for it consists of two bones. The lower portion is cartilaginous and unbreakable; what can happen to it is contusion, twisting, or flattening.	0.8223374
If one of its two bones is broken, it is necessary to insert the little finger into the nostril and straighten that fracture from the inside with your index finger and thumb from the outside until you restore the nose to its natural shape, and let this be done gently and carefully so that no pain is caused to the patient by your action.	If one of the two (upper) parts be broken you should pass your little finger into the nostril and straighten out the fracture from inside, with your index and thumb outside, until you reduce the nose to its natural shape; do it gently, and take care that you do not cause the patient pain in doing it.	0.870455
If the fracture is at the top of the nose and the finger does not reach it, it should be straightened with the tip of a slightly thick probe. If the fracture is on both sides, do the same, and hasten to repair it on the first day of the fracture.	If the fracture be in the upper part of the nose and your finger does not reach it, it should be evened by means of a probe with some thickness to it. If the break be on both sides, follow the same course.	0.82101583
If possible, otherwise after the seventh or tenth day when the hot swelling has subsided, then insert a wick of linen cloth into the nostril if the fracture is on one side, or insert two wicks if the fracture is on both sides.	Haste must be made to set it on the first day if possible; but if not, after the seventh or tenth day when the effusion has subsided. Then introduce into the nasal foramen a linen pad, if it be a unilateral fracture, or two pads if it be bilateral; the pads should be thick enough to fill the nasal foramen.	0.8194308
Let the wicks be thick enough to fill the nostril. Some of the early bone-setters mentioned that the wicks should be moistened with fat and changed every day, but I do not see that; rather, the wicks should be moistened with egg white kneaded with mill dust.	Certain of the ancient bone-setters suggest that you should soak the pads in butter and change them daily, but I do not think so; you should rather soak them in egg-white made up into a paste with mill-dust; then leave the pads in until the bone is firm and the cartilage hardens.	0.7634553
Then leave the wicks until the bone is fixed and the cartilage is hardened.  You can also insert goose feather tubes into the nose in place of the wicks, after wrapping soft rags around them, so that their retention of the nasal fracture is stronger and so that the patient is not prevented from breathing.	Sometimes, instead of pads, the stems of goose-quills are introduced into the nose after being wound round with a piece of soft cloth, so as to make a stronger support for the fracture of the nose and not to hinder the patient's breathing.	0.68264496
This is not necessary; if you wish, do it, and if you wish, make the wicks.  If a hot swelling appears on the nose during your work, dress the nose with cerate or with cotton dipped in vinegar and rose oil or some diachylon ointment.	This is not absolutely necessary; do it if you prefer; or, if you prefer, put in pads. If during your operation an abscess occurs, apply to the nose a wax plaster or cotton wool soaked in vinegar and oil of roses or a little diachylon ointment.	0.8972734
If a hot swelling does not appear, you should dress it from the outside with semolina flour and fine frankincense kneaded with egg white, then place a soft compress on it and do not tie the nose with anything at all, if the nasal bones are fractured into small pieces.	If no abscess occurs you should apply externally a plaster of white flour and frankincense made into a paste with egg-white; then put on top some soft tow, but do not bind up the nose at all.	0.83497906
Or if they are fragmented, then you should incise over them and extract them with the appropriate instrument, then sew the incision and treat it with what heals and closes it from the appropriate ointments.  If a wound occurs inside the nose, then you should treat it with wicks and use lead tubes. until it heals.	If the nasal bones are broken into small pieces or crushed, you should cut down upon them, remove them with a suitable instrument, and then suture the incision and dress with suitable ointments which encourage granulation and scarring. If there occur an internal wound of the nose, you should dress it with pads and employ leaden tubes until it heals.	0.83154446

On the reduction of the lower jaw if it is fractured.	On the repair of a broken lower jaw.	0.7235916
If the lower jaw is fractured and its fracture is not with a wound, observe: if its fracture is only from the outside and it is not fractured in two and is depressed inwards, then recognizing it is easy.	When the lower jaw is broken and it is a fracture without an open wound, examine it.	0.53969353
It is appropriate that if the fracture is in the right fissure, you insert the index finger of the left hand into the patient's mouth, and likewise, if the fracture is in the left fissure, you insert the index finger of the right hand and gently lift the hump of the fracture from inside to outside.	If it is merely an external fracture, not broken in two but sunken inwards, which is easily recognized, you should introduce the index of your left hand into the patient's mouth if it be a right-hand fracture; but your right index if it be a left-sided fracture; and with this, from within, push the concavity of the fracture gently outwards, with the other hand outside, regulating the correction.	0.8152276
With your other hand from outside the bone, you control its straightening. If the fracture of the jaw is broken in two, it is appropriate to apply extension from both sides in a straight line until you can straighten it. If chattering has occurred in the teeth.	If the break in the jaw be total, into two, traction must be employed, in a straight line on both sides, until it can be set.	0.6347448
Or they separate, then tie those you hope will remain with a gold or silver thread or silk. Then place the qayruti on the broken jaw, then place a folded rag on it, and place on the rag a large, well-fitted splint or a piece of shoe leather equal to the length of the jaw. Then tie it from above according to what you can tie and what is appropriate to join it so that it does not become dislodged. And you instruct the patient to be gentle and still, and make his food soft broths. If you think that something has changed in the shape in any way, then hasten to loosen it on the third day.	If any of the teeth be loosened or broken away, bind those that you hope may be preserved with a gold or silver or silken ligature; then put wax upon the fractured mandible, and upon that a doubled dressing, and upon the dressing a large and strong splint or a piece of shoe-sole leather, the length of the jaw; then over that bandage in such wise as you conveniently can and as will conduce to drawing it together so as not to loosen. Bid the patient hold himself quiet and still, and let his food be soft broths.	0.8411264
Then tie it from above according to what you can tie and what is appropriate to join it so that it does not become dislodged. And you instruct the patient to be gentle and still, and make his food soft broths. If you think that something has changed in the shape in any way, then hasten to loosen it on the third day. Then repair what you bandage with mill dust with egg white or with semolina flour after removing the qayruti from it, and put a soft compress on the bandage. As long as that bandage adheres to it and the condition of the bone has not changed, leave it.	Bid the patient hold himself quiet and still, and let his food be soft broths. If you think there is any change of form at all, hasten to loosen it on the third day; then correct the change and apply a plaster of mill-dust and egg-white, or of white flour, after you have removed the wax from it, applying soft tow over the plaster.	0.8165256
Do not loosen it until it heals and the fracture strengthens. Often this fracture strengthens in three weeks. If during that time a hot swelling appears, use what we have repeatedly mentioned in soothing it until that swelling disappears.	So long as the plaster sticks on it and the bone undergoes no change of state, let it be and do not loosen until it heals and the fracture mends, for often a fracture of this kind mends in three weeks. If during that time an effusion occurs, employ those means of allaying this that we have often mentioned, until the swelling subsides.	0.8480668
And if the fracture is with a wound, observe. If a fragment or fragments have separated from the bone, be gentle in extracting those fragments with whatever instrument is appropriate for extracting them. If the mouth of the wound is narrow, widen it with the scalpel as much as you need.	If the fracture be with an open wound, examine it, and if one or more splinters have been detached from the bone, gently remove the pieces of splinter with any suitable instrument. If the opening of the wound be narrow, open it up with a scalpel as much as you need.	0.8391602
Then when you have extracted those fragments, and nothing remains of them, stitch the edges of the wound if it is wide, otherwise apply one of the ointments that are suitable for it. And bring the wound together until it heals.	When you have removed these pieces, letting no trace of them remain, suture the opening of the wound if it is wide; otherwise apply one of the ointments that are suitable for that purpose and will encourage the growth of flesh over the wound, until it heals.	0.8653797

On the treatment of the clavicle when it is fractured.	On the repair of a broken collar-bone.	0.62276244
The clavicle is most often fractured from the front at the end of the shoulder, and its fracture occurs in one of three ways: either it breaks and splits in two without producing fragments, which is the easiest type to treat;	The collar-bone is very often broken from the end of the humerus anteriorly, and the fracture of it may be in one of three ways. It may be broken and separated into two without splintering; this is the easiest to repair.	0.7950604
or fragments occur at the fracture, which is more difficult to treat; or the fracture is accompanied by a wound.  The procedure, if the fracture is without a wound, is to have two assistants, one of whom steadies the upper arm next to the fractured clavicle, and the other extends the neck toward the opposite side.	Or else splintering occurs, which is most difficult to repair. Or it is a compound fracture. When it is a simple fracture the operation involves having two assistants present; one of them to hold steady the arm adjacent to the fractured clavicle, and the other to stretch the neck in the opposite direction.	0.8640937
Then straighten the fracture with your fingers until it takes the proper shape, without any protrusion or indentation. If you need more extension, you should place a ball of rags or wool under the patient's armpit.	Then level the fracture with your fingers until it is reduced to its proper form and there is neither prominence nor concavity. If there is need of still greater extension, place in the armpit of the patient a ball of cloth or wool made to a suitable size; and stretch and lift up the clavicle and squeeze the roll with your hand until the fracture is set in the proper way.	0.81557924
The bone should be the size you need. Extend and raise the clavicle and press the ball with your hand until the fracture is straightened as it should be.  If you cannot pull the end of the clavicle outward because it has gone deep, the patient should lie on his back.	If you are unable to draw the extremity of the clavicle outwards on account of its being depressed, the patient will have to lie on his back and there must be put under his shoulder a medium-sized bolster.	0.6684345
A medium-sized pillow should be placed under his shoulder and the assistant should press his shoulder down so that the clavicle bone, which is deep, rises up. Then repair the fracture and straighten it with your fingers.	The assistant is to press the shoulder down until the depressed collar bone is elevated, and then you can set the fracture and even it out with your fingers.	0.68222743
If you feel that a fragment of the clavicle has broken and is moving, you should make an incision over it and gently remove that fragment. If the fragment is trapped in the bone, be ingenious in cutting it with one of the cutters that I have prepared for that purpose. After placing under the clavicle the instrument that protects the peritoneum, which is an instrument of wood or iron, and this is its picture:.	If you feel a splinter separated from the clavicle and movable, you must cut down upon the splinter and gently remove it. If the splinter sticks to the bone, you must contrive to cut it with one of the chisels you have prepared for that, having first put beneath the clavicle the instrument to protect the membrane; an instrument made of wood or iron, of which this is the figure.	0.8958201
It resembles a spoon without a curvature, and its width is according to what you need for the size of the bone, large or small.  As for its length, it is also according to what enables you to work. And let it have two ends, as you see, one end wider and the other narrower.	It resembles a spoon but without a hollow. It should be as broad as you need, having regard to the size of the bone, and as long as you can use at operation. As you see, it should be provided with one wide and one narrow extremity.	0.8333981
If the laceration of the wound that you made when extracting the bone fragment is wide and you are safe from a hot swelling, join the edges of the wound with sutures. If the laceration is small or you fear a hot swelling, then pack the wound with lint and bandages according to the extent of the wound opening.	If the opening you made when you extracted the splinter of bone be wide and you feel safe against an abscess, suture the edges together. But if the opening be small or you fear an abscess, pack the wound with material and pads proportional to the opening.	0.86986196
If a hot swelling develops, moisten the lint in rose oil and vinegar or wine and apply it to the swelling. As for splinting the bone when it is without a wound or incision, it is that you apply to the bone a dressing made from mill dust with egg white.	If an abscess occur, soak the dressing with oil of roses and vinegar or wine and apply.	0.69358516
And the main concern is that the splint does not move from the fractured bone. Therefore, you should check the patient every day, so whenever the bandage loosens and you see that the splint has moved, fix it and tighten the bandage, then have the patient sleep on his back and place a small pillow under his armpit when he sleeps at night.	The whole point is that the splint should not slip from over the fracture; so you should examine the patient every day, and whenever the bandage has loosened and you see the splint has shifted, then put it right and tighten the bandage. Make the patient sleep lying on his back, and at night when he is asleep place a small bolster under the axilla so as to raise his arm from his side, for with the raising of the humerus the fracture of the clavicle will be elevated.	0.8732735
So that his arm is raised from his side, thus the fractured clavicle is raised by raising the shoulder, or tie his arm to his neck, and do not loosen the bandage unless something happens in the area, such as itching or swelling, for twelve days.	Or bind his arm to his neck. Do not loosen the bandage for twelve days unless there arise at the place any pruritus or swelling.	0.75317156
Then renew the dressing if you see a reason to. And repeat the tightening, and leave it until the fractured clavicle heals and sets, and it becomes stronger in twenty-eight days. And it may be in some people in less than that.	Then renew the plaster if you think it necessary, and bandage again and leave until the fracture of the collar-bone is set and knits. The majority of these cases are firm and strong in twenty-eight days, though in some people it takes less.	0.80363506

So, whenever a place in it breaks, or it breaks in its middle, and that is known by touch, then reduce it according to the shape of the fracture.	On the repair of a fracture of the scapula. The scapula is rarely fractured in the broad part but it does break at its margins. When any part of it is broken or it breaks in the middle (which is recognized by palpation) you should attempt the correction of the fracture according to the shape it takes, and its restoration to its natural form, by whatever means you can.	0.7905817
Straighten it and return it to its natural shape by any means you can, then apply to the area mill dust with egg white and soft mashaq, and place over it padding made of folded cloth, then place on it a wide splint made of wood.	Then apply over the place mill-dust with eggwhite, and soft tow; and over that a dressing made of a folded cloth; and over that a broad splint made of thin board to the size of the whole scapula or a little wider.	0.71318793
Thin, according to the size of the entire shoulder, or slightly wider. If there is a curvature under the splint in any of the areas of the shoulder, then straighten that curvature with soft mashaq until the splint sits flat, then tie it from above with a long turban.	If there be beneath the splint a hollow in any part of the scapula, level it with soft tow so that the splint rests evenly.	0.5872945
Tie it tightly and secure the splint so that it does not move from its place, and check the bandage every day. Whenever the bandage loosens, tighten it and adjust the splint if it has moved from its place.  Let the patient lie on his healthy side, and the shoulder heals in twenty days.	Then bind tightly over it a long sling and make sure that the splint does not slip out of place. Examine the bandage daily; and whenever it gets loose tighten it and adjust the splint if it has shifted. The patient should lie on his sound side.	0.84641576
Days or twenty-five days. When this period is completed, loosen the bandage and you are safe, for it is one of the bones that one does not fear will shatter or break. If a splinter protrudes from the bone and it pricks under the skin, then cut over it and extract it. And do what I mentioned in the fracture of the clavicle regarding soothing the hot swelling, if something like that occurs.	The scapula mends in twenty or twenty-five days. When this time has elapsed you may safely loosen the bandaging, for this is one of the bones in which there is no danger of fragmentation or cracking. If a splinter of bone protrudes and starts to prick under the skin, cut down upon it and remove it, and do as I said under fracture of the collar-bone, to allay the effusion, if anything of that kind happen.	0.90926045

On the treatment of a fractured sternum.	On the repair of a fracture of the breast.	0.7081175
The sternum may be fractured in its middle, and this rarely happens. As for its edges, they are most often fractured and fragmented. Among its symptoms, if its middle is fractured, it inclines downwards, and severe pain, difficulty breathing, and coughing occur.	The breast is sometimes fractured in the middle but this happens rarely; more often it is the extremities of it that are broken and comminuted. The symptoms that occur when it is broken in the middle are that he bows downwards and suffers violent pain, difficulty in breathing, and coughing, and sometimes he vomits blood; and there is an obvious and palpable concavity in the bone.	0.83325475
And perhaps he coughs up blood, and the depression in the fractured bone becomes apparent and is not hidden from feeling. Its treatment is that the patient lies on his back, with a pillow placed between his shoulders, then his shoulders are pressed, and the ribs are brought together by hands from both sides, gently straightening it in every possible way.	Now the way to mend it is for the patient to lie on his back, and you place a pillow between his shoulders; then his shoulders are squeezed, and with your hands you press together his ribs from both sides and skilfully try to equalize them in any way you conveniently can, until the bone is reduced to its proper form.	0.71871614
And continue until the shape of the bone returns as it should be, then apply the bandage and the dressing, and place over it a splint from a thin board of willow or heather or similar in lightness, after wrapping it in a cloth. Then gently tie it over the fractured bone so that it does not move, and pass the bandage around to the back several times and tighten it firmly, then check the bandage at all times, and whenever it loosens, tighten it.	Then apply over it a plaster and a pad and place over that a splint of thin willow board or brier or similar light wood, first wrapping it in cloth; then gently bind this upon the fractured bone so that it does not slip; and carry your bandage round about the back several times, tying it firmly; then inspect it constantly, and whenever it loosens tighten it.	0.8555141
And if it becomes necessary to untie it due to itching, pain, or swelling that occurs in the area, then quickly untie it and remove the dressing and treat what has occurred with its appropriate treatment, then replace the dressing if you see fit. and stick to tightening it until it heals.	If you are compelled to loosen it on account of itching at the place, or pain or swelling, loosen it quickly and remove the plaster and correct whatever has occurred with the appropriate treatment.

On the reduction of ribs when fractured. Know that rib fractures occur only in the thick areas near the back, while their front ends are subject to contusion because they are cartilaginous, and knowing this is not hidden from the senses when examining with the fingers.	On the repair of ribs when they are fractured. You should know that fracture of the ribs occurs only at the thick parts bordering on the vertebrae, whereas the anterior extremities are only contused, because they are cartilaginous; this is easily diagnosed on examination with the fingers.	0.8897979
Their reduction is by straightening the fracture with the fingers in a secure manner until the shape is as it should be, then bandage and splint the broken bone if needed. If the rib fracture is angled inward, it causes severe pain to the patient.	They should be set by levelling out the fracture with the fingers in any manner you can so that the form is as it should be; then apply the plaster and bind the broken bone with a splint, if necessary.	0.7807557
And a pricking like the pricking that occurs to someone with pleurisy, because the bone pricks the diaphragm, and also causes him difficulty breathing, coughing, and expulsion of much blood, and this is difficult to treat. The ancients devised many tricks for it.	If it be a depressed fracture of the ribs, then the patient will have a vehement pain and a piercing sensation like that of pleurisy, since the bone is piercing the pleura; in addition he will have difficulty in breathing and will cough, and vomit much blood; the treatment of this is difficult. In this the Ancients practised many devices.	0.8020699
Some of them said that the patient's food should be such as generates flatulence and wind, so that the abdomen swells and expands, and the fracture is pushed outward. We dislike this, lest it be a confirmation of the occurrence of a hot swelling if it has not occurred, and if it has occurred, it increases and confirms it.	Some said that the patient should have food of such a kind as to generate wind and inflation to blow out and stretch the belly and so push out the fracture. We, however, reject this, since it will excite an effusion if one has not already arisen; and if one has arisen it will increase and confirm it.	0.90356946
Some of them said that a cupping glass should be placed on the area and then sucked strongly, which is more like the standard, except that it is feared that the cupping glass will attract excess to the area because of its weakness.  Some of them said that the area should be covered with wool dipped in hot oil.	Some of them said a cupping-vessel should be applied to the place and strong suction be made; this seems more reasonable except that there is a risk of the vessel's drawing superfluities to the place on account of his weak state. Some of them said that the place should be covered with wool soaked in warm oil and that a pad should be placed in the intercostal space to fill it up so as to make the bandaging level when you wind it round.	0.83351386
And padding is placed between the ribs until they are filled, so that the bandaging is even when you wrap it around the circumference. Then the patient is treated with the treatment of pleurisy, with regard to food and medicine. If the patient is afflicted with a severe matter that he cannot bear… And the bone was piercing the diaphragm with a harmful piercing, and we feared for the patient, so it is necessary to make an incision over the area and expose the broken rib. Then we place under it the instrument that protects the peritoneum, which has been described previously, and we cut the bone gently and remove it.	Then treat the patient with diet and medicines as for pleurisy. If the patient is in such a bad way that he cannot bear it, the bone painfully piercing the pleura, and we are afraid for him, then we shall have to cut down upon the place and lay bare the broken rib; then we place under it the instrument to protect the membrane, which has been described, and gently cut out the bone and remove it.	0.8396478
Then we bring together the edges of the wound, if it is large, with sutures, and treat it with ointments until it heals. If a hot swelling occurs during that time, then quickly soak compresses in rose oil and place them on the area, and also treat the patient internally with that which soothes the swelling.	Then the edges of the wound should be joined, with a suture if large, and dressed with ointments until healed. If meanwhile there arise an abscess, quickly soak pads in oil of roses and apply them to the place and treat the patient with internal remedies against abscess too.	0.909294

On the repair of the vertebrae of the back and neck.	On setting the vertebrae of the back and neck.	0.8447751
As for the bones of the neck, if a fracture occurs in them - and this rarely happens to them, what happens most often is a contusion - and likewise also the vertebrae of the back, so if this happens to someone and you want to know whether he will recover or not. Then look, and if you see that his hands have become limp and numb and dead, and he is unable to move them, neither extend them nor clench them, and if you pinch them or prick them with a needle he does not feel that and does not find pain in them, then know that he will not recover in most cases, and he is doomed.	When a fracture occurs in the bones of the neck, which is rare, as mostly they suffer contusion, as do the spinal vertebrae—when it happens to anyone and you want to know whether it will heal or not, then look and if you see both his hands relaxed and numb and dead and he has no power to move or stretch or close them, and when you pinch them or prick them with a needle he does not notice it or feel any pain in them, you may know, as a general rule, that it will not mend, for he is doomed.	0.92828774
And if he moves them and feels the pinching and pricking in them, then know that the spinal cord is intact and that the patient will recover with treatment. If the vertebrae of the back suffer the same, and you want to know whether he will recover or not.	But if he moves them both and feels in them the pinching and pricking, you may know that the spinal medulla is still intact and that under treatment the patient will recover. If anything of this nature happens to the vertebrae of the back and you wish to know if he will recover or not, then pay attention to his feet.	0.85848033
Then look at his legs. If you see that they have become limp, and what happened to the hands has happened to them, and then, if he lies on his back, wind and feces come out involuntarily, and if he lies on his stomach, urine comes out involuntarily, and if he lies on his back and wants to urinate, he is unable to do so, then know that he is doomed, so do not bother treating him. If none of this happens to him, the matter is less serious. The treatment for what has occurred is that you try to soothe the hot swelling.	If you see them relaxed and in the situation we described in the case of the hands, and when he lies on his back he passes flatus and faeces involuntarily, and lying prone he passes water involuntarily and lying on his back he cannot pass water if he wishes, then you may know his case is hopeless, so do not concern yourself with his treatment. But if nothing of this kind occur then the case is easier.	0.76944834
By placing on the bruised vertebra rose oil alone or with roasted egg whites. Apply this three times a day, until the hot swelling subsides. Then apply to the area one of the strengthening, drying dressings and bandage it tightly. Order him to rest and remain still.	The way to treat this latter kind of case is to try to reduce the swelling by applying over the injured vertebra oil of roses, alone, or with roasted yolks of egg; apply three times a day until the swelling has gone down. Then apply to the place one of the strengthening and absorbent plasters and bind it on; bid him keep quiet and still and sleep only in the attitude in which he has no pain, until he is well.	0.82506824
And he should not sleep except on the side that does not cause him pain until he recovers. If a splinter or something has occurred in the bone at the time of the injury, from which he has recovered, then it is necessary to incise the skin over it and extract that bone. Then bring the edges of the wound together, if it is large, with sutures, then treat with healing ointments until it heals. If the last bone of the coccyx, which is the tailbone, is broken, then it is necessary to insert the thumb of the left hand into the anus.	If the injury is accompanied by fragmentation or a separation of part of the bone, you must cut down on it and remove the bone; then bring together the edges of the opening, by suture if it be wide; then treat with granulating ointments until it heals.	0.6416043
And straighten the broken bone with the other hand as much as possible and straightening is achieved. Then apply a dressing and a splint if needed, then tighten it.	If the last bone of the coccyx, which is the sacrum of the tail, breaks, introduce the thumb of your left hand into his anus and reset the bone with the other hand in whatever way is possible and affords the best setting; then apply over it a plaster, and a splint if necessary, and bind it up.	0.6415112
If you feel a broken fragment in it, then incise over it and extract it, and treat the wound with the aforementioned treatment until it heals.	And if you perceive a fragment in the fracture, cut down upon it, remove it, and dress the wound as before said, until it heals.	0.81159055

Chapter Ten.	CHAPTER TEN.	0.85489607
On the reduction of hip fracture.	On setting a fractured hip.	0.6898624
Hip bones rarely break. If they do break, the break is usually a fragmentation at the ends and a longitudinal split, and it tilts inward. The patient experiences pain in the area, throbbing, and numbness in the leg on the side of the fracture.	It is rare indeed that hip-bones are fractured, and if they are fractured the fracture consists of a comminution of the extremities of them and a longitudinal splitting and a bending inward; and the patient feels a pain and a piercing at the site, and the leg on the fractured side is benumbed.	0.8949082
Its reduction is by passing your hand over it until you determine the shape of the fracture. If the fracture is only at the ends, then reduce that fracture as best you can until its shape resembles its natural shape.	To set it, you pass your hand over it and ascertain what the shape of the fracture is. If it is a fracture of the extremity only, set that fracture in whatever manner is convenient for you until it answers to its proper shape.	0.7828859
If the fracture is longitudinal or if it has tilted inward, then lay the patient on his stomach so that you can reduce that fracture. Once you have reduced it, apply the dressing, then place a splint of wood or leather on it and bandage it tightly.	But if it be a longitudinal fracture or it has bent inwards, have the patient lie on his stomach so as to make it convenient for setting the fracture; and when you have set it apply over it a plaster and over that a splint of wood or leather, and bandage it in such wise that you have no fear that the fracture may extend or the splint slip.	0.82076985
Do not fear displacement of the fracture or loosening of the splint. Level the hollows at the flanks with whatever fills them so that the bandaging is even. Instruct the patient to lie on his back or on his healthy side. If a hot swelling appears...	Level out the cavity of the lumbar region with some filling so that it may take the bandage evenly, and bid the patient sleep on his back or on his sound side.	0.607762
stop extending it and reducing it until the hot swelling subsides. Apply what will soothe it as described previously, then return to its reduction and bandage it as appropriate.  If fragments appear in the bone, or something crumbles from its ends, it should not be removed.	If there occur an effusion, then refrain from bandaging or setting it until the effusion subsides; and apply to it something to allay it as before said; then return to setting it and bandaging it as it should be.	0.8020685
It should not be touched, but leveled from the outside, as we have said, and the bandaging should be left until it heals.	If there be any splinters in the bone or anything crumbles away from the extremities, it must not be pulled out or touched, but set externally as we have said, and the bandaging should be left until it heals.	0.6900853

On the reduction of a fractured humerus.	On setting a fracture of the humerus.	0.7857107
The humerus is what is between the elbow and the head of the shoulder. If it is fractured, reduce it in one of two ways. One of these is to take a curved, smooth stick of medium thickness, like this image:.	The humerus is what lies between the elbow and the head of the scapula. If it is fractured it may be set in one of two ways. One is to take a smooth bow-shaped piece of wood of medium thickness, like this.	0.8856935
And tie two straps to its ends, then suspend it from a high place. Have the patient sit on a chair, then place his broken arm on the stick so that his armpit is affixed to the middle of the curve of the stick. Then suspend something heavy above it.	You tie two bands at the two ends and then it is hung from above. The patient is to sit on a seat; then his broken arm is folded upon the piece of wood in such a way that his axilla fits into the middle of the curve of the piece of wood.	0.8327032
Or a servant stretches it downwards, then the physician sets the fracture with both his hands until the fracture is returned to how it should be. The other way is for the patient to lie on his back and his hand is suspended from his neck by a strap.	Then hang a heavy weight from the arm, or have an assistant pull it downwards; then the doctor should straighten out the fracture with both hands together until it is properly reduced. The other way is to make the patient lie back and to suspend his hand from his neck by a band, then you instruct two assistants.	0.81656003
Then you order two assistants, one of them to stabilize what is above the fracture with his hands, and the other to stabilize below it, and each of them extends it in his direction. And if you want the extension to be stronger, tie a strap below the fracture and a strap above it, and each of the assistants extends them in their direction.	One is to grasp with both hands the arm above the fracture, and the other the arm below the fracture; and each should make extension toward himself. And if you wish to extend more strongly, tie a band below the fracture and another above, and let each assistant pull toward himself.	0.86584425
If the fracture is near the end of the shoulder, then the middle of the strap should be under the armpit and the other below the fracture towards the elbow. Likewise, if the fracture is near the elbow, it is necessary for the strap to be placed at that location and on the elbow itself.	If the fracture is near the extremity of the shoulder you will have to put one band beneath the axilla and the other below the fracture near the elbow. Similarly, if the fracture be near the elbow you will have to put a band over the place and over the elbow itself.	0.906361
Then you set the fracture gently, without violence, until the fracture is set as it should be and joined well. Then bind it if no hot swelling appears. But if a hot swelling appears, leave the binding until the seventh day and put on it oiled wool soaked in vinegar and rose oil.	Then gently and without violence straighten out the fracture until it is restored to its proper shape and fits together well, and then tighten it if no abscess occur. But if an abscess occur, leave the bandaging until the seventh day and apply raw wool soaked in vinegar and oil of roses until the abscess subsides; then bind it up.	0.92188287
So when the swelling subsides, then bind it. The method of binding is to apply the dressing to the fracture, then apply a roll of new cloth over the dressing, then bring the forearm onto the upper arm itself, and place his hand, open, on his shoulder.	The method of binding it is to apply a plaster to the fracture; then wind round the plaster a bandage of new material; then bind the forearm to the humerus, placing his hand open on his shoulder.	0.75996304
And apply the cloth and the binding on the upper arm and forearm so that the forearm acts as the splints, if there is no obstacle preventing you from doing so and nothing has shifted in the broken bone. If you fear that something will shift, then use splints.	Then apply pads and bandages to the arm and forearm so that the forearm serves instead of splints, if there is no contra-indication and you see no pathological change in the broken bone. But should you fear any such change then use splints.	0.80034477
That is, you place on the fracture itself a splint that is wider and stronger than all the other splints, and let there be a finger's width between each splint. And let the length of the splints be according to the fracture, extending three fingers beyond it on each side.	The way to use these is to place over the fracture itself a splint that is broader and stronger than the rest; and leave a space of a finger's breadth between splints; the splint should be of a length to suit the fracture with the addition of three fingers' breadth all round.	0.86142135
Then you bind the splints with the binding mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.	Then bandage over the splints in the manner mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.	0.8614864
That is, your binding should be tighter at the site of the fracture.	That is, you should bandage more tightly over the fracture itself and more lightly as you get away from the fracture.	0.63225454
And the farther from the fracture, the looser the binding. If you find that applying the splints and binding, as we have said, at the time of your setting the limb from the first hour is suitable, then do so.	If you decide to put on splints and bandage, as we have said, at the time you set the limb, do so.	0.6482216
And if you fear hot swelling, leave the binding and splints until the seventh day, as we have said. Then inspect the bandage every three days, lest itching or swelling occur in the area, or nourishment be prevented from reaching the limb due to excessive tightening, and correct all of that as we have mentioned.	But if you fear an abscess, leave the splinting and bandaging until the seventh day as we have said. Then examine the bandaging every third day lest there be itching or swelling at the place; or nourishment be prevented from reaching the limb on account of excessively tight bandaging; treat all these in the proper manner according to our prescriptions.	0.91983664
But if you are confident that none of this will occur, do not loosen the bandage except after many days. The patient should lie on his back with his hand on his stomach, and a cushion filled with wool should be placed moderately under the upper arm.	But if you are confident that nothing of this sort is happening then do not loosen the bandaging until after many days. The patient should be made to sleep on his back with his hand on his stomach, and under the humerus there should be placed a cushion evenly filled with wool.	0.9544015
And check at all times, day or night, lest the shape of the fractured limb be distorted or the bandage loosened, and correct all of that with your best effort. And make the patient's diet according to the order we presented, that the food be light at first, until the bone begins to strengthen.	And examine it at all times of the day and night lest the shape of the broken limb suffer any deformity or the binding loosen; do your utmost to put any such thing right. You should also direct the patient's diet along the line that we have given earlier; namely, at first the food should be light until the bone has begun to knit; then you should order heavier food.	0.89315253
Then you should increase his food. For it is usual for the upper arm and leg to strengthen in forty days. Then it should be unbound, and he should use the bath and be treated with suitable ointments.  If the fracture is severe and comminuted,	Now it is the nature of the humerus and of the leg to knit in forty days; then they should be loosened and the patient should go to the bath and be treated with suitable ointments.	0.64367104
do not remove the bandage from it until fifty days or two months.	If the fracture be ugly and contused, do not unfasten it for fifty days or even two months.	0.6926609

On the reduction of a fracture of the forearm.	On setting a fracture of the forearm.	0.81597006
The forearm is composed of two bones, called the two ulnas. One of them is small, and it is the one next to the thumb, and the other is large, and it is placed under the small one from below. Sometimes the larger ulna breaks alone, or the small one alone, and sometimes they break together.	The forearm consists of two bones and is sometimes called 'the two firesticks'. One of these bones is small and is in line with the thumb, the other is large; this is the one placed lower, under the smaller one. The larger alone may be broken, or the smaller alone, or both broken together.	0.90623045
Whenever the small, upper ulna is broken, its reduction is easy and its healing is faster. When the lower ulna breaks, its fracture is bad and its healing difficult.  And the worst is when the two bones break together. If the bone that is broken is the small, upper ulna.	When the small upper bone (radius) is broken it is easy to set and its mending is rapid. When the lower bone (ulna) breaks it is bad and its mending is difficult. Worst of all is when both bones break together.	0.8937154
The physician, when reducing it, should make the extension gentle and easy until he sets it. If it is the large ulna that is broken, he should make the extension stronger, and if both ulnas are broken, he should make the extension much stronger.	If the broken bone is the radius, the doctor when setting it must use light traction, gently, until he has it straight. If it is the ulna that breaks, he must employ stronger traction on it. If both bones break he must employ very strong traction.	0.79518044
The form of the hand during reduction and extension should be placed extended on a pillow, with the thumb of the hand upwards, higher than all the fingers, and the little finger lower than the other fingers, and the patient sitting cross-legged.	During setting and extension the hand must be disposed on a cushion, spread out with the thumb uppermost, higher than all the fingers, and the little finger downmost, while the patient sits cross-legged upon the floor.	0.900732
And let the pillow be opposite him in height so that the patient is not strained by hardship.	The cushion should be on a level with him so that he does not suffer discomfort.	0.688205
Then an assistant extends the arm from below, either with his hand or with a bandage, and another assistant extends it from above likewise. Then the physician sets the bone until he reduces it in the best possible shape. If there are fragments in the fracture of the bone, then…	Then let an attendant extend the arm from below, either by hand or by means of a band, while another attendant extends it from above similarly. Then the doctor may straighten the bone so as to restore it to the best possible shape. If there be any splinters in the fracture he must do his utmost to restore each splinter to its place.	0.88975805
Reduce each fragment to its place with your best effort. If a separated fragment appears in it and it pierces the skin, and you have no hope of reducing it, then incise over it and extract it in the manner we mentioned previously. If the fracture is with a wound, I have devoted a chapter to it.	If a detached splinter appears there and is piercing the skin and you have no hope of restoring it, cut down upon it and remove it in the manner we have mentioned earlier. If the fracture is accompanied by a wound, we have devoted a separate section to this, so take the treatment of it from there.	0.8620371
So take the treatment for that from there. If a hot swelling appears at the beginning of your reduction, then apply a cloth soaked in cerate made with rose oil and white wax. Let it be medium between thick and thin, and tie the cloth over it gently until the swelling subsides.	If, when you begin to set the bone, an effusion occurs, smear a cloth with the wax made from oil of roses and white wax, of medium thickness, and bind the dressing on gently.	0.71388465
Then remove the cerate and apply the prepared dressing of mill dust with egg white. Then apply the splints, and let the splint that is placed on the fracture itself be a little wider and stronger. Know that the number of splints for the arm is six in most cases.	When the effusion subsides, remove the wax and apply the plaster prepared from mill-dust and egg-white, then apply splints; the splint that goes on the actual fracture should be a little wider and stronger than the rest. You should know that the number of splints for an arm is, as a rule, six, whether the fracture be of one bone or of both together.	0.7418721
Whether the fracture is in one ulna or in both ulnae together, then make your bandaging on the site of the fracture stronger and tighter.  And as you rotate the bandaging upwards or downwards, make the bandaging a little looser, as mentioned previously at the beginning of the chapter.	You should know that the number of splints for an arm is, as a rule, six, whether the fracture be of one bone or of both together. Then bandage more tightly and strongly over the site of the fracture, and, as you wrap the bandage above and below the fracture, bind little by little more loosely according to the instruction given at the beginning of the book.	0.7092229
Let the cloths that are wrapped on the fracture be soft and moist cloths, and do not let them be very hard. And let the thread with which it is tied be specifically linen, medium between thin and thick, as we described. And check the limb and the bandaging after [a few] days.	The dressings wound round the fracture should be gentle and soft, not very hard, while the cord for binding is best made of linen of medium thickness as we have prescribed.	0.6185411
If something happens that needs to be corrected, such as an itch that occurs in the limb, then the limb should be washed with warm water until the itch subsides, and the limb should be left unbandaged for a night so that it can rest, then the bandaging should be resumed.	Some days later, examine the limb and the bandaging and if anything has happened that should be put right, such as pruritus in the limb, the limb should be bathed in warm water until the pruritus has subsided. Let the limb be unbandaged for one night so that he may rest, then put the bandage on again.	0.81318426
If the bandaging has become loose and the bone has shifted or something similar, then correct all of that to the best of your ability.  And also observe, if nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb due to excessive tightening, then you should loosen it a little and leave it for a few days until nourishment flows to it, then tighten it.	If the bandaging has become loose and the bone has shifted or anything of that sort, correct it all diligently. Look also to see if nourishment is being prevented from reaching the part on account of over-bandaging, in which case you will have to loosen it a little and leave it for a few days until nourishment flows to it; then bind it up.	0.92230344
If none of what we have mentioned happens to the patient, it should not be unbandaged until after twenty days or so. Then hang the patient's hand around his neck, and let his arm be straight, and he should carefully avoid sudden movements, and let him sleep on his back.	But if none of those things that we have mentioned happens to the patient, it should not be loosened until after about twenty days. Then the patient's hand is to be suspended from his neck, the arm being level, and he should guard carefully against agitated movements, and should sleep on his back.	0.9316778
And know that this fracture of the arm heals in thirty days, or in thirty-two, and perhaps it heals in twenty-eight days. All of that is according to the states of the humors and the states of strength.	You should know that this fracture of the arm mends in thirty or thirty-two days, and sometimes in twenty-eight, depending on the individual's constitution and the condition of his strength.	0.80471367

On the treatment of fractures of the hand and fingers.	On the repair of fractures of the palm and fingers.	0.88158834
Fractures of the metacarpus and phalanges of the fingers rarely occur, but contusions frequently do. So, whenever a fracture or contusion happens to the hand…	Fractures of the metacarpus and of the small bones of the fingers very rarely occur; the only frequent occurrence is contusion.	0.80345845
The patient should sit cross-legged with a chair of equal height in front of him.	When a fracture or crushing of the palm of the hand occurs the patient should sit cross-legged with a chair of the right height in front of him, on which he should put his outstretched hand.	0.61554766
Then he places his hand on it, extended. Then an assistant extends the broken bones and the physician sets them until they are well aligned.  Then the bandage and the splint should be applied if a hot swelling does not occur. Then a splint is applied over the area, according to the location.	Then an assistant is to extend the broken bones while the doctor straightens them so as to achieve a proper union. Then a plaster and a dressing should be applied, if an effusion do not occur; then a splint over that, measured to the site and wrapped in a soft cloth.	0.8245723
I inserted it into a soft cloth. If the fracture is downwards towards the palm of the hand, make a ball-like shape from a cloth and order the patient to grasp it with his fractured hand. Then it is bandaged with a long cloth.	If the fracture be lower down, near the inner part of the palm of the hand, make a ball of cloth, bid the patient grip on it with the fractured palm of his hand, and then bind it up with a long bandage.	0.7549098
The splint should be made of soft leather so that the leather conforms to the curvature of the entire hand, and you bandage it as needed. If the fracture is outwards, then you should place a splint on top and another splint underneath in the palm so that the hand is open and straight.	The splint should be of leather that is somewhat soft, so as to fit into all the folds of the palm; and bandage it on suitably. But if the fracture be on the outside you will have to put one splint above and another beneath the palm of the hand, to keep the hand opened and straight; then put on the bandage, carrying it round the hand and in and out between the fingers.	0.8734617
Then the bandaging is carried as the hand turns, and it is interlocked between the fingers with the bandage. If the fracture occurs in one of the phalanges of the fingers, if it is the thumb, it should be straightened as needed, then bandaged with the hand.  And if you wish, make a small, straight splint to support the fracture.	The fracture may occur to one of the small bones of the fingers. If it be the thumb, then set it in the proper way and bind it down to the palm of the hand; if you like you can apply a small straight splint to it to keep the fracture straight so that it does not shift.	0.785633
And it should not move. If the fracture is to the other fingers, such as the middle, index, little, or ring finger, straighten them and bandage them with the adjacent healthy finger, or bandage them all together in sequence, which is better, or place a small, straight splint on them.	If the break be in any of the other fingers, such as the middle or index or little finger or the ring finger, straighten it out and bind it to the sound finger next to it; or let them all be bound up one to another, which is better; or apply a small straight splint, as we said for the thumb.	0.85477036
As we said regarding the thumb, monitor during and after your reduction for hot swelling. Address it as needed whenever something like this occurs, as described repeatedly.	While you are setting it, and afterwards, look out for an effusion and counteract it with what is required if anything of this sort occur, according to what has been repeatedly prescribed.	0.66361856

On the reduction of a fractured femur.	On setting a fracture of the femur.	0.78007495
The femur is frequently fractured and is perceptible to the senses because it rotates forward and backward. Its reduction is achieved by tightening a bandage above the fracture and another bandage below the fracture, with the patient lying on his face.	The femur is often broken, and this is readily discernible, for it will rotate forwards or backwards. It is set by binding a bandage above the fracture and another below, while the patient lies flat on his face.	0.89792895
Then, an assistant pulls each bandage in its respective direction evenly. This is if the fracture is in the middle of the bone.  But if it is close to the origin of the femur, a soft bandage, either of wool or similar material, should be tightened.	Then each assistant should make an even extension in his own direction, by the bandage. This is when the fracture is in the middle of the bone. But if the fracture is close to the root of the thigh, you should tie on a soft bandage of wool or something similar, at the root of the thigh toward the groin, so that extension may be applied above, and another bandage below the fracture.	0.86709094
[It should be placed] at the origin of the femur towards the pubis so that the pull is upwards, and the other bandage [should be placed] below the fracture.  Similarly, if the fracture is near the knee, the bandage should be near the knee so that the pull is downwards. Then the physician straightens the bone with both hands until he restores it to its natural form.	Likewise if the fracture is near the knee the bandage should be near the knee, so that extension may be made downwards. Then the doctor should straighten it out with both hands until he has reduced it to the pattern of the natural form and the bone unites neatly.	0.7838974
The bone will unite well. Then it is necessary to apply the dressing and tightening, unless a hot swelling occurs in the limb. If swelling occurs in it, leave it for several days until the hot swelling subsides, then return to its treatment.	Then you will have to apply the plaster and bandage if there is no effusion in the limb, but if there is an effusion leave it for a few days until the swelling has gone down, then resume your treatment.	0.69918746
As for tightening it, a strong, wide turban should be wound around the fracture two or three times, leaving any excess. Then the leg should be bent until the heel is at the origin of the buttock, and a long thread is inserted between the thigh and leg near the knee from below, with the ends of the thread on top from both sides.	As to the bandaging, you should wrap a firm broad sash two or three times round the fracture, leaving some over; then bind the leg up so that the heel is brought to reach the root of the buttock. Then pass a long cord in the space between the thigh and the leg, low down near the knee, and let the ends of the cord come up on either side, then bind the rest of the sash over the leg and the thigh.	0.87478757
Then wind the remaining part of the turban around the leg and thigh. Then place the splints on the thigh at the site of the fracture itself, and place one of them on the leg bone. Then fill the gap between the thigh and leg with soft rags so that the tightening is even.	Then apply splints to the thigh at the very site of the fracture and put one of the splints on the leg-bone. Then pack soft material in the space between the leg and the thigh to make the bandaging even.	0.8774801
Then begin the strong tightening from the middle over the fracture site with three or four turns.  The further the bandage is from the fracture site, the less, gentler, and looser the tightening should be.	Then start with three or four turns of a strong bandage in the middle over the site of the fracture, and as you get away from the site of the fracture bind lighter and softer and looser.	0.9016063
Then take the ends of the thread that you inserted between the thigh and the leg, and tie the adjacent splints from above. Then pass the ends of the thread downwards until you reach the ankle, then tighten the ends of the splints on the other side with them as well.	Then turn to the two ends of the cord which you previously passed between the thigh and the leg, and with the cord bind the adjacent splints above, then carry the ends downward until you end up at the great tendon of the foot and with them bind also the extremities of the splints at the other end so that the bandaging will not shift from its place.	0.85891515
So that the bandage does not shift from its place, leave the tightening in place as long as the limb does not experience burning, swelling, inflammation or anything similar. If any of this occurs, immediately loosen it and correct what has happened, as we have mentioned repeatedly.	Then let the bandaging remain on as long as no pruritus or abscess or effusion or anything of that sort happens to the limb; but if any of these occur loosen it quickly and put right whatever has taken place, in the manner we have often mentioned.	0.8391123
If there is a bone fragment that pierces, you should straighten it if possible. Otherwise, incise over it and extract it and treat the wound as previously described until it heals. This fracture of the femur can also be tightened without the leg being joined to it with splints.	If there be a penetrating fragment of the bone, you must reposition it if you can; but if not then cut down upon it and remove it and treat the wound in the sort of way mentioned previously, until it heals. This fracture of the thigh is sometimes bandaged without bringing the leg alongside with splints, in the way we spoke of for the humerus and the forearm.	0.9006597
As we mentioned regarding the humerus and forearm, except that splinting it in this manner does not cause the patient to limp. But if you splint it alone without joining the leg to it, its owner will inevitably limp permanently.	But setting after the former manner does not cause the patient any lameness; whereas if the femur is set alone without binding the leg to it the patient will inevitably be lame for always.	0.7424437
Know that the femur tightens in fifty days, more or less, all depending on the differences in temperaments and other conditions.	You must know that the femur knits in fifty days or a little more or less, according to the different constitutions and other circumstances.	0.89526266

On the Fracture of the Kneecap.	On setting a fracture of the patella of the knee.	0.6916188
The kneecap rarely experiences a fracture, but it may often suffer a contusion. If it does experience a fracture, it will be either a fissure or fragmentation into pieces.  This may occur with or without a wound.	You should know that the patella is rarely fractured, but crushing often occurs. If a fracture does happen to it, it will be either a splitting or a shattering which may be simple or compound; and all these can be palpated.	0.81287384
You determine all of this by touch, and treat it by aligning any separated fragments with your fingers until they are joined and matched as well as alignment, gentleness, and skill allow. Then apply the bandage and, if necessary, a rounded splint over it.	Now the way to set is for the separated parts of it to be put right with the fingers, so that they unite and join as far as straightening and gentleness and skill can serve. Then apply the plaster and put upon that a circular splint, if need be, and over that a suitable bandage.	0.8348415
Apply appropriate bandaging over it. Then attend to all the conditions we have described for other fractures, such as hot swelling and the like, by addressing each symptom appropriately until it heals.	Then keep an eye on it for all the conditions described for the other fractures, such as an effusion and the like, meeting whatever arises with what is good for it, until it is healed.	0.7830598

On the Treatment of Leg Fractures.	On setting a fracture of the leg.	0.6522112
The leg has two bones, one thick, called the tibia, and the other thin, called the fibula.  They are subject to the same types of fractures as the two bones of the arm.	The leg consists of two bones. One of them is thick and is called 'leg bone' (tibia). The other is slender and is called 'fire-stick' (fibula).	0.8651772
Therefore, its treatment is the same as the treatment of the arm, and the procedure is identical. If both bones are broken, the leg will be twisted in all directions. If the thinner bone is broken, the leg will be twisted forward.  If the thicker bone is broken and this occurs in the lower part, it will be obvious to you.	Both of these are liable to the same kinds of fracture as occur in the two bones of the forearm, therefore the repair of them will be like that of the arm, and the operation is one and the same. If both bones are broken together, the leg will turn in all directions. If the fibula is broken there will be a forward deformity of the leg. If the tibia be broken, and that low down, it will be obvious to you.	0.8358724
So use extension and alignment, and apply splints accordingly in the same manner, except that if the leg fracture is severe with many fragments, the extension should be less and lighter, and you should be very gentle in treating it.	But it will be necessary, if the fracture of the leg be a serious one with much fragmentation, for the extension to be gentler and lighter; and you must employ the utmost gentleness in setting it.	0.70309854
There is one additional procedure for the leg compared to the arm: when you have aligned the splints and finished all your work, take two thin strips of pine wood, the kind used for smoothing the ceilings which are placed between the cracks in the boards, or they can be made of palm leaf ribs or similar material.	The operation on the leg involves one more process than that on the arm, namely, that when you have set the splints and have finished the task, you should take two strips of pine wood such as are used for roofing upstairs rooms, being put in the gaps of the planking, or they may be palm stalks; pick out such as are somewhat thick and not too thin; they should be as long as the leg from the knee down.	0.7666606
Choose those that have a little thickness and are not too thin, and let their length be the length of the leg from the knee down. Then wrap a cloth around each one twice lengthwise and place one on the inner side of the leg and the other on the outer side.	Then wrap each of them in a cloth folded into two longitudinally, and put one on each side of the leg; they should reach from the knee to the extremity of the foot.	0.70986515
Let them extend from the knee to below the foot. Then tie the two strips together in three places: at the two ends and in the middle. By this binding, the leg is prevented from tilting right or left and is well supported.  A wooden trough along the length of the leg may also be used.	Then tie the two strips in three places, namely at the two ends and in the middle; this binding prevents the leg from bending to right or left and it will be held in a good straight position.	0.8326445
The leg is placed in it to keep it from moving, and this is especially necessary if the fracture is accompanied by a wound. Then check the leg every day and take great care of it regarding swelling, inflammation, or any other such issue. Whenever any of these occur, treat them appropriately until healing is complete.  The leg bone heals in thirty days or so.	This is particularly necessary in a compound fracture. Then carefully examine the leg every day and use the utmost care to guard against effusion or swelling or other like things; and when anything of this sort happens employ the means to meet the case until it heals. The bone of the leg mends in thirty days or so.	0.91266304

On fractures of the bones of the foot and toes.	On fracture of bones of the foot and of the toes.	0.9916968
As for the heel, it is not subject to fracture at all. As for the bones of the foot, they may be fractured, and the toes also are rarely fractured, but rather are subject to contusion in most cases.	The heel is never fractured; but the bones of the foot sometimes are. The toes too are rarely fractured; but mostly they get crushed.	0.8271696
If a fracture of the bones of the foot occurs and you see that those bones are overlapping, let the patient place his foot on the ground upright as if walking, then you stand and place your foot on the raised part of those bones, then tread on it and straighten it.	If a fracture occurs to the bones of the foot, and you see the bones riding over one another, let the patient plant his foot flat on the ground as if walking. Then stand and put the sole of your foot on the prominent bones and with your foot put pressure upon them and level them to their proper place.	0.9064626
Until they return to their places, then apply the dressing and the splint from above, and place a small board under the sole of the foot that has two flat ends, then tighten the foot tightly after wrapping it with bandages and everything else you need.	Then apply a bandage and some tow on top, and put under the inner part of the sole of the foot a small board with two flat heads. After you have wrapped them in material and so on, bind them tightly to the sole of the foot.	0.7320105
When three or four days have passed, loosen the bandage, and you will find the bones straightened whether they were fractured or dislocated, so the procedure is as you see.  As for if some of the toes are fractured, set them and straighten them according to what I described to you regarding setting the fingers of the hand.	When three days or four have passed, loosen the binding and you will find the bones in position; whether they have been fractured or dislocated, the operation is (the same,) as you see.	0.856643
Then make a splint for the broken toe the length of the toe and slightly wider than it, then place this board I described to you under the foot and tighten it firmly. If two, three, or more bones are broken,	If one of the toes be broken, reposition and straighten it in the way that I described for the fingers; then apply to the broken toe a splint of a length corresponding to the toe and a little wider than it. Then under the sole of the foot put the board that I have just described, and bandage it on firmly.	0.79944
then put a splint on each toe according to its size, wrapped in a soft cloth, and tighten the board on the bottom of the foot, and let each end of the board rest outside the sole of the foot to secure it well.	If the broken bones number two, three, or more, then apply over each toe a single splint measured to it, wrapped in soft material, and bind the board on the sole and let the flat portion of each of the two heads extend beyond the end of the sole of the foot, so that it may be held firmly.	0.6591139
And you should not forget to attend to all that we have mentioned to you regarding all the other fractures, of the symptoms that we have mentioned, and address each symptom as appropriate.	And you must not forget to pay attention to all those contingencies that we have mentioned to you in other fractures; meet each contingency with the means proper to it.	0.81310946

On the Fracture of the Woman's Vulva, the Pubic Bone, and the Man's Penis.	On fracture of the female pudenda and of the pubic bone and of the male organ.	0.8449183
When a woman's vulva is fractured, have her sit cross-legged, then lean her back little by little, and have her held from behind. Then the midwife should pack her vulva with cotton until it is full and becomes like a ball in her vulva.	When a woman's pudenda are fractured, make her sit cross-legged, then bend her backwards little by little, being supported from behind. Then let a midwife pack the vulva with cotton wool so as to form a kind of spherical packing in the vulva.	0.89769125
Then the woman is shaken and her back is raised little by little, so that the cotton comes out until it is at the opening of the vulva like a ball, and the broken bone is returned to its place. Then a pad is placed on her back, and when she wants to urinate, the cotton is removed gently so she can urinate.	Then shake the woman and by degrees elevate the dorsal spine, for the cotton wool will emerge until it is like a sphere at the opening and the fractured bone will be reduced. Then put a pillow upon her back and when she wants to pass water gently remove the cotton wool so she may do so, then put it back in the same way in which it was put in at the first.	0.84258276
It is returned in the way it was first inserted, then she returns to her original padding. This is done for seven days or so, and it will heal.  And if you wish, take a sheep's bladder, attach a reed tube to its opening, and insert the whole bladder into her vulva.	Then she should return to her pillow as before. She should do this for about seven days, then it will be mended. If you prefer, take a sheep's bladder and bind a hollow reed to the opening of it; introduce the whole bladder into the pudenda and then blow hard into the tube so that the bladder is inflated within the passage and the fracture will then be reduced.	0.85457426
Then blow strongly into the tube until the bladder inflates inside the vulva, and the fracture will return to place. Then pack it with cotton and continue as we have described for several days until it heals.  As for when the pubic bone is fractured in a man or woman, the following is used in its repair.	Then pack with cotton wool and let her wait a few days as we have described, until it be healed. Now when a man or woman has the pubic bone broken you can use for the setting and repair of it the method we gave for a fracture of the hip.	0.7397746
Its reduction and alignment are as we described for the hip bone.  The correct procedure in these unusual fractures, which rarely occur, will not be hidden from you, especially for someone with some experience and who understands this book of mine well, because the fracture itself will guide you in most cases.	The correct practice in these uncommon fractures, which very rarely happen, will be obvious, especially to one who has some experience and understands well this book of mine. For the fracture itself will in most cases indicate the correct way to repair it and bind it up, so use your intelligence.	0.8045176
on the correct way to reduce and bind it, so understand. As for the penis of a man, if it is fractured, take the trachea of a goose, insert the penis into it, then place a bandage of cloth over it, and bind it, and leave it for three days or so until it heals.	When a man's organ is fractured, take a goose's neck and introduce the penis into it; then let it be wrapped and bandaged and left for about three days until it be healed.	0.7349233

On the Reduction of Bone Fractures When Accompanied by a Wound.	On the repair of fractures accompanied by wounding.	0.71694994
It is advisable for anyone who has a fracture with a wound, especially if the bone is large, such as the femur or humerus or similar, that you immediately perform phlebotomy (blood letting) if the conditions for phlebotomy are favorable, as we have explained previously.	When a man has a compound fracture, especially when it is a large bone such as the femur or humerus or the like, you should at once venesect him if the conditions are suitable for venesection as set out above.	0.7553011
If the wound is bleeding, you should immediately stop it by applying powdered vitriol if nothing else is available, then proceed to reduce the fracture on that same day and do not delay.	If there is bleeding from the wound you must hasten to stanch it by sprinkling it with powdered vitriol if you have nothing else at hand. Then begin on the reduction of the fracture the very same day; do not put it off unless an abscess occur.	0.8853779
If a hot swelling does not occur.  If a hot swelling does occur, then leave its reduction until the ninth day, until the hot swelling subsides, and do not touch it on the third and fourth days at all, as it is subject to adverse symptoms.	But if an abscess does occur, leave the reduction until the ninth day so that the abscess may subside, and in no circumstances touch it on the third or fourth day, for you will bring evil consequences on him.	0.7928448
If the broken bone is protruding, exposed through the skin, you should try to reduce and straighten it with your hands gently and with slight extension.  If you are unable to reduce and straighten it with your hands, then reduce it with this instrument, which is an instrument made of iron, its length about seven or eight fingers. And its width according to the size of the wound.	If the fractured bone be overriding the skin you must try to reduce it and to straighten it out by hand, gently and with moderate extension. If reduction and straightening by hand is unsuccessful, then reduce it with this instrument; it is made of iron, seven or eight fingers' breadths long, and wide in proportion to the size of the wound; that is why the doctor should have three or four of them in the sizes he may need for treating every kind of fracture.	0.87594473
Therefore, the physician should make three or four of them, according to what he needs for treatment in each type of fracture, and let them be rounded with some thickness so that they do not bend when pressed upon during the operation.	It should be round and somewhat thick so as not to bend when pressure is put upon it at the time of operating.	0.5304683
And let them be sharp-edged, with a curve at their end, and let the upper part be thick, and from its middle downwards very thin.  And this is its form:	It should be sharp-ended with a bend at the end; the upper part should be of some thickness, but from the middle to the lower part it is a good bit thinner. This is its form.	0.71816933
And it is called in Greek *perion*, meaning small lever. You should place its sharp, curved end on the protruding end of the bone, and push it at once so that when the bone returns and is somewhat straight, then complete the setting of the fracture ends on each other.	It is called in Greek bayram, meaning a small lever. You must place the sharp incurved end of it over the end of the protruding bone, and push it firmly with it. When the bone is repositioned and straightened in some measure, try to straighten the ends of the fracture, one to another.	0.85877824
If its broken end is thin and the instrument does not grip it well, then you should cut the end of that bone until the instrument can grip it. If you are absolutely unable to reduce the bone as we have described, then cut it with a similar one of the bone saws that we have mentioned.	If the fractured end be very thin and the instrument does not grip it firmly you will have to cut off that end so as to give purchase for the instrument. If you cannot reduce the bone at all by the means we have described, cut it off with any of the osteotomes we have mentioned that is suitable, or saw it off with one of the saws as best you may.	0.87966466
Or saw it with one of the saws however you can. Then smooth out what remains on the bone of roughness and thin fragments. If you reduce the bone and the patient finds after its reduction a severe, troublesome pain, then know that the bone has not returned to its natural place.	Then strip away any remaining roughness of the bone and fine pieces of shell. If, when you have reduced the bone, the patient feels severe and troublesome pain, you may know that the bone has not returned to its natural site.	0.8206247
If you are able to return it to its natural place, then do so, for you will benefit the patient greatly. When you have completed your setting of the bone, soak a rag in black astringent wine, especially if it is in summer. Do not place on the wound cerate or anything containing fat.	If you can restore it to its natural site, do so, for you will render the patient a signal service. When your setting of the bone is complete, soak a dressing in dark sharp wine, especially if it be in summer, but do not put wax or anything oily upon the wound lest it cause putrefaction or corruption.	0.84959567
so that putrefaction and corruption do not occur in it. Then apply the splints when you have finished setting the bone, and leave the wound uncovered by cutting a hole the size of the wound in the bandages with scissors.	Then apply splints the moment you have finished setting the bone; and leave the wound open, that is, by making with scissors an opening in the coverings the size of the wound.	0.8138057
Be very careful not to tighten the wound together with the fracture, for ignorant doctors often do that, and they cause their patients either death or gangrene or a foul ulcer. Let your tightening be gentle and loose, different from the tightening of other fractures.	And take the utmost care not to bandage up a wound with a fracture; for many ignorant doctors have done that, thereby causing their patients either death or ulceration or a defluxion; so make your bandage soft and loose, as opposed to that of other fractures.	0.88060516
If the wound is bad, or if it is a large wound and you fear some of the bad symptoms that we have described, and he feels a disturbing pain in the area, then you should not put splints on it, but make bandages of firm rags in the place of the splints and bind it with them.	If the wound be severe or of great size and you fear for it some one of the grave accompaniments such as we have described, and the patient feels a disturbing pain at the place, then you should not put on splints; but instead of splints make wrappings of a stiff material and bind them on.	0.85179687
If, after a day or two, you see that pus has begun to form in the wound, then remove the cloth that you placed on it with the wine, and then use the lint and ointments that we usually use to treat wounds, such as the tetrapharmacon and the like. And you should loosen the bandage.	If, after one or two days have passed, you see that the wound is beginning to suppurate, remove the dressing with wine that you had put on it, and then apply the pads and ointments with which it is our custom to heal wounds, such as Tetrapharmacon ointment and the like.	0.9143203
And check the wound every day, evening and morning, until it heals and recovers. And you should position the limb so that the pus drains downwards easily. If the wound persists for many days and does not heal and the pus does not stop, then know that there are small bone fragments.	Every evening and morning you will have to loosen the bandaging and carefully examine the wound until it knits and is healed. You must also place the limb in such a position as to let the pus flow down easily.	0.74392354
You should probe the wound, and whatever fragments are loose, extract and remove them; and those that are not loose, and are pricking the limb and causing pain, be diligent in cutting and extracting them in any way you can.	If, after many days, the wound is unhealed and it goes on suppurating, you may know that there are some little fragments of bone there; so you will have to examine the wound with a probe; and those fragments that are loose take and extract; and those that are not loose but nevertheless pierce the limb and cause pain, attempt to cut them out and extract them by whatever means you can.	0.72288203
If the wound develops a cold, or erosion, or another type of corruption and putrefaction, then you should treat each symptom with its corresponding treatment, as previously described in its chapter.	If a defluxion or ulceration or other kind of corruption or putrefaction happen to the wound, you must meet all these occurrences with the proper remedy described before in its place.	0.8235619
And it is important to heed my words and bear in mind that if a large bone is broken and protruding from the limb, such as the femur, humerus, or similar large limbs, do not attempt to pull it or remove it. Death often results from this, rather leave it until it rots; perhaps it will fall out on its own after twenty or thirty days.	One thing that is necessary is that you should comply with my words and keep them in mind: when a large bone is broken and protrudes from the limb, such as the femur, the humerus, and the other bones of the long limbs, do not meddle with pulling or extracting it, for this often causes death; but leave it to suppurate. It may come away of itself in twenty or thirty days.	0.92588925
Then treat the wound if you see a need for treatment; otherwise, leave it.	Then dress the wound if you find occasion; if not, let be.	0.7086554

On the treatment of stiffness that occurs after some fractures.	On the treatment of the callus that remains from a fracture.	0.6465069
This stiffness often occurs after the fracture has healed, especially near the joints, which deforms the limb and may prevent it from functioning normally.	This callus often occurs after the healing of a fracture, especially one near a joint, and thereby the shape of the limb is spoilt; and sometimes there is limitation of the natural function of the limb.	0.80839866
Examine it, and if the stiffness is soft, use astringent medications such as aloe, frankincense, myrrh, gentian, acacia, and the like, by taking some or all of these and kneading them with an astringent syrup, egg white, or vinegar.	Examine it, and if the callus be soft, apply astringent remedies to it, such as aloes, olibanum, myrrh, balsam of sarcocol, acacia, and the like. Take some or all of these; beat them up with a dry wine or egg-white or vinegar, apply to the callus on some tow and bind up firmly.	0.82935435
Apply it to the stiffness in a compress and tie it tightly. Leave the bandage undisturbed for many days, then remove it and reapply another until the stiffness is gone, God willing, or apply a tightly fitted lead plate.	Leave the bandaging on for many days; then undo it and repeat until the callus is removed, God willing. Or bind on it a firm sheet of lead; for lead has the property of taking away lumps from limbs.	0.7790102
Lead has a special property that removes any outgrowth on the limbs. If the stiffness has hardened and intensified, and the necessity to remove it is urgent, incise it from above and cut or scrape the protruding excess with a scraper until it is gone, and treat the wound until it heals.	But if the callus is stony hard and its removal is urgent, incise the place and cut away the superfluous prominence, or pare it away with a scraper until it is gone; and dress the wound until it heals.	0.70707893

On the treatment of a fracture if it has healed but the limb remains thinner than its original form.	On the treatment of a fracture when, after repair, the limb remains unnaturally thin.	0.74434626
If a bone fracture has healed but the limb remains thin and weak, it is due to many reasons. One of them is either due to repeated loosening and improper tightening of the bandages, or excessive tightening of the bandages preventing nourishment from reaching the limb, or excessive suspension, or excessive movement at the wrong time, or insufficient blood and weakness in the patient's body.	When a fractured bone has been repaired but the limb remains thin and weak, this may be due to many causes: the bandaging being too often loosened and not properly tightened; or excessive binding-up so that nourishment cannot flow to the limb; or excessive fomenting; or excessive and premature movement; or the thinness and weakness of the patient's blood.	0.8951613
The treatment for this is to nourish the patient and enrich his body until his blood increases, and to use the bath, and to bring him joy and happiness, and so forth. Then, apply tar to the limb so that the tar draws much nourishment to it, or continuously suspend it in lukewarm water. Until nourishment flows into it and it returns to its natural form.	The treatment of this consists in the nourishing and restoring of his body so there be plenty of blood; and the use of the bath; and cheering the patient and making him happy, and so on. Then apply pitch to the limb so that it may draw much nourishment to itself, or continue the massage to the limb with tepid water, so that nourishment flows in the limb and it returns to its normal shape.	0.9219955

On the treatment of fractured bones if they are set crookedly and prevented from functioning properly.	On the treatment of fractured bones when they mend crooked and are inhibited from their proper functioning.	0.9130331
If, after a limb has healed, a crookedness or a protrusion of the fractured bone appears, or a knot, and the form of the limb is therefore ugly. However, if the limb is not prevented from its natural function, you should not accept the opinion of someone who claims to break the limb from the top, as many ignorant doctors and bone-setters do in our country.	When a limb that has been set has some distortion after healing, or the bone that was broken has some prominence or callosity, so that the limb is deformed, but there is nevertheless no limitation of its natural movement, then you should not listen to those who think that the bone should be broken again. In our parts there have been many ignorant doctors and bone-setters who have done this.	0.8234299
This practice is very reprehensible and leads to great dangers, the least of which is permanent damage. However, if the crookedness and knot are soft, it should be poulticed with water in which softening herbs have been cooked, such as marshmallow leaves and root, melilot, and the like.	The operation is most blameworthy and leads to great dangers, death itself not being the worst possibility. But if the distortion and callosity be recent you should massage it with an infusion of the herbs that have an emollient quality, such as leaves and roots of the marsh mallow, and melilot and the like: and apply one of the emollient plasters such as carefully prepared diachylon.	0.77842224
It should be dressed with softening bandages, such as expertly made diachylon, or the mucilage of marshmallow root may be taken and mixed with chicken fat and fresh butter and applied as a dressing, or ripe figs may be pounded with pigeon dung and similar medications that are called resolvents.	Or take mucilage of the root of the marsh mallow and beat it up with chicken fat and oil of sesame, and let a cataplasm of these be applied. Or take a fat fig and beat it up with pigeon's dung; and the like remedies that are termed 'inhibitors of scarring'.	0.67078245
The knot may also be resolved with constant gentle massage with the hands, and the limb should be moved in all directions at all times.  If the crookedness is old and severe, and hardened, and the necessity arises to treat it with iron.	Sometimes also the callosity is resolved by long-continued gentle friction with the hands; and constant movement in every direction should also be applied.	0.7064707
It should be incised above and the connection of the bone released, and the excess knot or bone should be cut with fine cutters, and gentleness should be used in this with great effort and care. Then the wound should be treated as mentioned previously until it heals.	But if the deformity be long-standing and fixed and hardened and you are compelled to treat it operatively, you will have to cut down on it from above, and free the junction of the bone, and with fine chisels cut away the redundant callus or bone; be gentle in this, with diligence and care. Then treat the wound with the means previously described until it heals.	0.7996515

Dislocation of the jaw is a displacement of the joint from its place, which hinders movement, deforms the appearance of the limb, and causes severe aches and pains to the patient.  Whenever someone experiences a jaw dislocation, it should be promptly reduced.	A dislocation is a displacement of any of the joints from its place, whereby the movement of the joint is hindered, the member is deformed, and the patient is caused violent pain and hurt. When anyone sustains a dislocation he should hasten to have it reduced, not delaying it at all.	0.87574947

Therefore, it should not be delayed, nor should it be moved or stretched while swollen, because it often causes convulsions and harmful pains to the patient.	For if it is delayed the place will swell up and the reduction will be thereby made difficult. So it should not be delayed, nor moved or extended during the time it is swollen, for that often leads to spasm and excruciating pain.	0.8721004
But if this happens, it is necessary to immediately bleed the patient, then leave it until the swelling subsides a little, then anoint the limb with hot water and oil, then gently reduce it and treat each limb as will be mentioned in its place.	Instead, when this occurs, you must hasten to venesect the patient, and then let be until the swelling has subsided a little. Then massage the member with hot water and oil and let it be gently reduced. And treat every member with the things that will be mentioned in their place.	0.85546887
I have also arranged the chapters on the jaw according to what preceded in the fracture, from the top of the body to the bottom.	I have disposed the chapters on dislocations in the same order as the foregoing ones on fractures, that is, from the upper part of the body to the lower part.	0.818881

On the treatment of the lower jaw.	On the treatment of a dislocation of the lower jaw.	0.8802133
Rarely do the two jaws dislocate, except in rare cases, and their dislocation is in one of two ways: either they are slightly displaced from their positions so that they relax a little, or they are completely and totally dislocated so that they relax. Toward the chest until the patient's saliva flows and he cannot hold it, nor can he close his jaw, and his tongue stumbles in speech.  But if the dislocation is slight, it often returns by itself with the slightest effort.	It is rare indeed for the jawbones to be dislocated. Their dislocation may be in one of two ways: either they may shift slightly from their place and be a little relaxed; or they may be completely and utterly dislocated so as to be relaxed down toward the breast so that the patient's saliva runs out and he cannot control it; nor is he able to close his mouth, and he stutters in speaking. If it be only a slight displacement it will go back in most cases spontaneously without much trouble.	0.9199999
But if the dislocation is complete and total, you should quickly reduce it and not delay it at all.  This is done by having an assistant hold the patient's head and the physician inserts the thumb of one hand into the base of the jaw inside the mouth, if the jaw is on one side.	But if the dislocation be complete and total it is necessary to set about the reduction of it at once without any delay. This is done thus: an assistant holds the patient's head and the doctor introduces into his mouth the thumb of one hand at the root of the jaw, if it be a dislocation on one side, or both thumbs if it be a bilateral dislocation, with the rest of the fingers outside to keep it straight.	0.8685722
Or he inserts both thumbs if the jaw is on both sides, and the rest of the fingers of his hands from the outside, he adjusts with them, and orders the patient to relax his jaw and release it to go in every direction, and the physician adjusts the jaw and pushes the jaw until it returns to its place.	Then let him bid the patient relax his jaws and allow them to move in any direction; while the doctor sets the dislocation, thrusting the jaw until it return to its proper place.	0.6985792
If it is difficult to reduce it, especially if both jaws are involved, then use a compress with hot water and oil until it is easy to reduce them, and do not delay their reduction at all, as we have said. When they return and are aligned and the patient's mouth is closed and they do not relax, then place bandages of cloth on them with cerate made of wax and rose oil.	If the reduction be difficult, especially if it be a bilateral dislocation, administer a fomentation with hot water and oil, so that the reduction of both sides may be facilitated. And on no account delay the reduction, as we have said. When the reduction and straightening have been done and the patient's mouth closes and is not relaxed, then apply to both sides dressings steeped in wax prepared from wax and oil of roses.	0.8686212
Then tie gently with a loose bandage, and the patient should sleep on his back and his head elevated between two pillows so that he does not move it right or left and does not try to chew anything, but rather makes his food a soft broth.	Then bind it up gently, with a loose bandage. The patient should sleep lying on his back with his head held between two pillows so that he does not move it either to right or to left; nor should he burden himself with chewing but should be on a diet of broth of corn starch until the pain is gone and the jaw is firm; then he may eat whatever he wishes.	0.80764675
So when the pain is gone and the jaw is set, let him eat what he wants, and let him do so gently and not force open his mouth when eating, drinking, and yawning until the jaw is set and healed.	Let him use it gently; let him not work his mouth heavily in eating or drinking or yawning until the jaw is firmly knit and healed.	0.6701234
If the reduction of the jaws is difficult when they are dislocated at some point and do not return to their places, fevers and constant headaches often result from this, and perhaps the patient's bowels will loosen, and perhaps he will vomit pure bile repeatedly. If you see this, know that it is corrupted.	If the reduction of both sides is hard when it is a simultaneous bilateral dislocation, and there is no return to the proper position, then thereby in many cases fevers and perpetual headaches occur; sometimes the patient's belly is loosened and he vomits actual bile.	0.78324616
And often one who experiences this dies within ten days.	When you see this you will know that he is doomed; in most cases in which this happens death follows in ten days.	0.61422205

On the reduction of the clavicle and tip of the shoulder.	On the reduction of a dislocation of the clavicle and of the head of the humerus.	0.82864183
As for the clavicle, it is not dislocated from the inner side because of its connection to the chest, but it may be dislocated outward, and that is apparent to the touch.  Its treatment is that the patient lies on his back and extends his arms.	The clavicle is never dislocated inwards because of its continuity with the breast-bone; but sometimes it is dislocated outwards, and then it is detected by palpation. The replacement is thus: the patient is to lie on his back and stretch out both arms; then with the palm of your hand press heavily upon the place and it will go back.	0.7192215
Then you press the area firmly with your palm, and it will return. Then you apply a bandage and supports and tighten them. As for the end that is next to and connected to the shoulder, it is rarely dislocated. If it is ever dislocated, it should be reduced and straightened as we have described, and as you are able.	Then apply to it the plaster and pads, and bandage it up. As to the extremity of the clavicle, which is close to the shoulder and joined to it, it is only rarely dislocated; but if ever it is dislocated you must reduce it and set it straight as we have mentioned, by any convenient means.	0.8202282
Then you put on it the bandage, supports, and tightening, and order the patient to remain still and at rest until he recovers.  With this same treatment, you reduce the tip of the shoulder if it also shifts from its place.	Then apply the plaster, pads, and bandages, and bid the patient keep quiet and still until it is healed. By this same treatment you may also reduce the head of the humerus when it is displaced.	0.8517086

On the reduction of the shoulder joint.	On the reduction of a dislocation of the humerus.	0.8312141
Know that the shoulder is dislocated in three ways: one is that it is dislocated towards the armpit downwards, the second is that it is dislocated towards the chest, and sometimes it is dislocated above the shoulder, and that is rare.	You should know that there are three ways in which the humerus may be dislocated. One is a dislocation down into the axilla, another is a dislocation toward the breast; it may also be dislocated upward, which is rare.	0.85770136
It does not dislocate backwards because of the scapula, and it does not dislocate forwards because of the nerves. It mostly dislocates and comes out downwards towards the armpit, especially in those whose flesh is little, because it comes out quickly and goes in quickly in them.	It is not dislocated backward, because of the scapula; nor is it dislocated forward, on account of the tendons. Mostly it is dislocated and displaced down into the axilla, and particularly in those of a spare build; in such it quickly comes out and quickly goes back.	0.90740955
As for those whose flesh is abundant, it is the opposite of that, I mean that it comes out with difficulty and goes in with difficulty. Sometimes a person suffers a blow or a fall, and the shoulder swells with a hot swelling, so it is thought that it has been dislocated. It is necessary to examine it until you determine its true condition.	But in those of a fleshy build it is the opposite; it comes out with difficulty and goes back with difficulty. Sometimes a man suffers a blow or a fall, so that the upper arm swells up with an effusion, whence he forms the opinion that there is a dislocation. So you must examine it to make sure of it and then proceed to treat it.	0.8040994
Then you proceed with its treatment.  The dislocation, if it is downwards towards the armpit, is recognized if you compare the dislocated shoulder with the healthy shoulder. You will find a clear difference between them, and you will find the head of the shoulder indented and, when touching under the armpit, the head of the shoulder is like an egg.	So you must examine it to make sure of it and then proceed to treat it. A dislocation down into the axilla may be diagnosed by comparing the sound and the dislocated humerus; for you will find an obvious difference between them; you will find a hollow at the head of the humerus, and in the axilla the head of the humerus may be palpated like an egg, and the patient is unable to lift his hand to his ear, and full movements are restricted.	0.7332945
The patient is unable to raise his hand to his ear or to move it with all movements. Likewise, if it is dislocated towards the chest or upwards, you will find that apparent to the touch, it will not be hidden.	Similarly if it is displaced toward the breast or upward you will find it obvious to the touch and not hidden.	0.65208435
This dislocation can be easily reduced if it is fresh or if the patient is a child. To reduce it, an assistant raises his hand upwards, then you place the thumbs of your hands under his armpit and strongly lift the joint upwards to its place, and the assistant raises his hand and extends it upwards.	The reduction of this dislocation will be quite simple if it be only recent or the patient be a child. To reduce it, his hand should be lifted up by an assistant, then you should put both your thumbs under his axilla and lift the joint up powerfully into its place, while the assistant lifts and stretches his hand upward; then he puts it down and the dislocation will at once go back.	0.91239196
Then he brings it down, and it will return quickly. If it does not return with what we have mentioned, and the dislocation has been present for many days, it is necessary that the patient bathe in hot water and use an emollient that relaxes and softens, such as cooking marshmallow root, fenugreek, and melilot in water and using it.	If it is not reduced by the means we have stated, being a dislocation of many days' standing, the patient should take a hot bath and use relaxing and softening fomentations, such as decoction of marsh mallow root and fenugreek and melilot.	0.79238564
Then the patient lies on his back, and you place under his armpit a ball of wool that is moderately soft and firm. Then the physician places his heel on the ball and grasps the patient's hand with his hand and extends it downwards.	Then the patient should lie on his back and you put under his axilla a ball of wool of moderately hard consistency. Then the doctor should put his heel on the ball and grasp the patient's hand and draw it downward, while pushing the ball with his foot, and it will straightway be reduced.	0.8979461
And he pushes the ball with his foot, and it will return to its place. And if you wish, you reduce it in this way: you bring a man taller than the patient and have him stand at the side and place his shoulder under the patient's armpit and lift his armpit upwards until the patient is suspended in the air. And another assistant pulls the patient's hand down towards his abdomen. If the patient is light, then it is necessary to hang something else on him to weigh him down, and the jaw will return immediately. It can also be reduced in another way.	Or, if you prefer, reduce it in this way: get a man taller than the patient to stand on one side and pass his shoulder under the patient's axilla and lift it up until the patient is suspended in mid-air, while another assistant pulls the patient's hand down towards his lower abdomen (if the patient is light it will be necessary to hang a weight from him); then the dislocation will straightway be reduced. It is also reduced by another method: that is, to fix in.	0.86848134
It is that you fix in the ground a long piece of wood whose top is rounded like the rim of a mortar, neither thick nor thin. Then you place it under the patient's armpit after placing a soft cloth on the top of the wood, the patient standing along the length of the wood.	the ground a long spar of wood; its head should be of a round shape like the pestle of a mortar, neither massive nor slender; then after a soft pad has been put on the head of the spar it should be placed under the axilla of the patient, who should be standing alongside the spar; then let his hand be drawn downward on one side and his body on the other, powerfully.	0.79392445
Then you extend his hand downwards from the other side and also extend his body from the other side with force, and the joint will quickly return to its place. If its reduction is difficult by all that we have mentioned, then use this treatment: take a piece of wood about two cubits long. And its width is about four fingers and its thickness about two fingers, having a rounded head to facilitate its entry deep into the armpit, in this manner:	Then the joint will immediately return to its place. If it proves difficult to reduce it by any of the means we have stated, employ this treatment: take a wooden spar some two cubits in length, two fingers thick, and four wide; it should have a round head to facilitate its introduction into the hollow of the axilla; of this shape.	0.8572018
Then you tie soft cloths on the rounded head so that the wood does not harm the patient, then it is placed under the armpit and the entire hand and forearm are extended down along the wood, and the wood is tied to the upper arm, forearm, and the edge of the hand.	Then you bind on the round head soft rags so that the wood will not hurt the patient. Then it is placed under the patient's axilla, and his whole hand and arm are stretched down over the spar, which is to be bound down to the upper arm, the forearm, and the tip of the hand.	0.9311645
Then the arm is placed on a horizontal beam of a ladder, and the hand is extended downwards and the rest of the body is left hanging from the other side, and the joint will enter immediately. When it has entered by any possible means, then it is necessary to place a moderately sized ball of wool under the armpit.	Then let the arm be placed cross-wise over the rung of a ladder and the hand stretched downward, and let the rest of the body hang down on the other side; then the joint will very quickly go back.	0.80172145
Then the prepared dressing of mill dust with frankincense and egg white is carried over the entire shoulder as it revolves from above, then the ball is tightened firmly from under the armpit and the bandage is wrapped over the dressing from above, and his hand is suspended from his neck.	Once it has gone back properly, in whatever way is possible, there should be put under the axilla a ball of wool of moderate size; then apply the plaster prepared from mill-dust with olibanum and egg-white, all round the shoulder. Then firmly bandage the ball under the axilla and carry the bandaging round over the plaster.	0.65704006
And he is left without moving his hand for seven days, and the patient's food should be made small so that the limb strengthens, for it is faster for his recovery. Then after seven or five days it is loosened and he practices movement, and if it is stable and does not relax, then he has recovered.	Sling his hand from his neck, then let him be left without moving his hand for a week. The patient's diet should be light until the limb gets strong, for that will hasten the cure. After five or seven days it can be unfastened and he can make trial of its movement; if it is firm and not slack then it is healed.	0.86997914
If the joint dislocates frequently due to an acquired moisture or another ailment, then cauterization with the three needles should be used as described previously in the chapter on cauterization. If you do all of this and loosen the bandage after seven days and the joint is not stable.	If the joint is frequently dislocated, on account of a humidity arising in it or some other cause, then use should be made of the cautery with three prongs spoken of earlier, in the book on cauterizations.	0.7565174
And you repeat the dressing and tightening on it several times and it does not stabilize and falls and loosens and you are not able to raise it upward, then know that its nerve which is at the top of the shoulder has been severed or stretched or loosened. Know then that the joint will never be stable in its place.	If you do all this and loosen the bandaging after a week and the joint is still not firm, and you repeatedly plaster it and bandage it, and it is still loose and comes down and dislocates and you are unable to raise it up, then you may know that the tendons at the head of the humerus are either cut through or stretched or loosened; in which case you may know that the joint will never stay firm in its place.	0.8227535
As for the dislocation which is towards the chest and breast and backwards, its reduction is by pushing and extending with the hands until it returns, and all the tightening and treatment are used on it until it heals. If after healing, there occurs heaviness in the limb and slowness in movement,	As to the dislocation toward the chest and breast, and posteriorly, the reduction of this is done by thrusting and extension with both hands until it goes back. And apply the usual bandaging and treatment until it is healed.	0.8891321
then the patient should use the bath frequently until that heaviness softens and it returns to its original state.	If, after it has healed, a callosity arises in it, and it is slow in movement, the patient should take frequent hot baths until that callosity is softened and the member returns to its original condition.	0.629219

On the Treatment of Dislocation of the Elbow.	On the treatment of a dislocation of the elbow.	0.8960525
The elbow joint dislocates with difficulty and also returns with difficulty. It dislocates in all directions, especially forwards or backwards, and its dislocation is not hidden from you, because it occurs under the sight and under the touch, in whatever form it is dislocated.	The elbow is with difficulty dislocated and with difficulty put back. Now dislocation may be in all directions, and particularly forward and backward.	0.79461277
And if you compare the dislocated elbow with the healthy one, it will become clear to you with clear evidence, by the hollowness of the joint, and he cannot bend his arm, nor can he touch his shoulder with it.  And you should hasten and reduce the dislocation immediately, before a hot swelling occurs.	Whatever way it is dislocated it will not be concealed from you, because it is both visible and palpable, and whenever you compare the dislocated elbow with the sound one it is quite openly and plainly manifested; for the elbow joint is hollow and the patient cannot flex the forearm back or touch his shoulder with it. You must hasten and reduce the dislocation as rapidly as possible before an abscess occur.	0.71083224
For if a hot swelling occurs, it is difficult to reduce it, and perhaps it will not heal at all, especially if the dislocation is backwards, for it is the worst of all kinds of dislocations and the most painful, and death often occurs with it.	For if an abscess occur the reduction of it is difficult and maybe it will never be healed; especially when it is a posterior dislocation, for this is the worst and most painful of all the kinds of dislocation, and often it is fatal.	0.881539
Its treatment, if it is of the kind that can be reduced, is that an assistant extends his arm with both his hands, his arm outstretched, and the physician's hands are above the elbow and below it, and he pushes the joint with both his thumbs, or with the base of his hand, until it returns to its place.	Now when it is one of those that can be reduced, the way to reduce it is for an assistant to perform a two-handed extension of the patient's hand, the patient's forearm being opened out, while the doctor's hands are above and below the elbow joint and he thrusts the joint with both thumbs together or with the root of his palm, until it returns to its place.	0.8239573
But if the dislocation is forward, it may be reduced by bending the hand suddenly until it strikes with the base of its palm the shoulder which it faces.  If the dislocation does not respond to reduction, then use very strong, powerful extension, which is that two assistants extend the arm.	If it be an anterior dislocation, it may go back if the hand is bent sharply back until it strikes its own shoulder with the root of the palm. If the dislocation does not respond to reduction, apply very strong and powerful extension.	0.82036746
And two assistants also hold the patient so that he does not move during the extension. Then the arm is rotated in every direction after a folded cloth or wide bandage is wrapped around his hand. And when the physician treats the joint with his hands, he anoints them with oil so that it will help in sliding the joint easily.	For this, let two assistants pull on the arm while two other assistants hold the patient against the extension. Then the arm should be rotated in all directions after the limb has been wrapped in a long folded cloth or a broad wrapper. When the doctor begins manipulating the joint he should anoint his hands with oil so as to assist, by its lubrication, the movement of the joint; then he should thrust the joint powerfully until it goes back.	0.82745004
Then he pushes the joint forcefully until it returns. After its return, it is necessary to apply a bandage which has astringency and desiccation with egg white, and it is tightened firmly, and the arm is suspended from the patient's neck and left for several days.	After its reduction he should apply to it a plaster having some styptic and absorbent qualities, with egg-white; and put on a firm bandage and suspend the patient's arm from his neck and leave it for some days.	0.78365797
Then it is loosened. If the joint is stable in its place, then remove the bandage and leave it. And if you see that the joint has not become firm enough, then replace the bandage and leave it also for several days until it becomes firm, then remove it. If it develops a callosity after the return of the joint and its release,	Then undo it; and if the joint remains fixed in its place, then untie the bandaging and leave it. If you see that the joint is not thoroughly firm, replace the plaster and bandaging and leave it for a few more days until it is firm; then untie it.	0.88131577
and difficulty in movement, then he should use moistening in the bath and gentle massage and kneading until it softens. Or place the omentum of a fat ram on the joint, then bandage it and leave it on him for a day and a night. Then remove it and have him enter the bath, and when he sweats, massage the joint moderately.	If, after the reduction and unbandaging of the joint, it becomes stiff and is difficult to move, soften it in the bath and apply gentle friction and massage until it is softened, or apply to the joint the tail of a fat-tailed sheep; bind it on and leave it on for a day and a night; then remove it and send him to the bath, and when he sweats apply moderate friction to the joint; then replace the tail and again and again, alternating with the bath, until the joint softens.	0.8358941
Then replace the omentum a second and third time, along with entering the bath, until it softens. And if you want to put on it fresh, light cow dung with fat and bandage it on him, do so several times, for it will soften and return to its original state.	If you prefer, apply to it, and bandage on, fresh cow-dung lightened with butter. Do this a number of times and it will soften and return it to its original state.	0.6173224

On the treatment of dislocation of the wrist.	On the treatment of a dislocation of the wrist.	0.9900181
The wrist joint is frequently dislocated.  Its reduction is easier than other joints, except that it should be reduced quickly, at the hour in which it is dislocated, before the place swells or a hot swelling appears in it.	The carpus of the hand is often dislocated. Unlike other joints, the reduction is easy, but there should be haste to reduce it as soon as it is dislocated, before the place swells or an abscess occur.	0.84272045
Its reduction is done by placing the patient's wrist on a board and an assistant extends his hand. The physician puts his palm on the protuberance of the joint and pushes it until it returns. However, it should be observed whether the dislocation has moved towards the inside of the hand.	The way of reducing the dislocation is to place the patient's wrist upon a board while an assistant stretches the hand, and the doctor puts the palm of his hand upon the prominence of the joint and applies pressure on it until it goes back.	0.8567311
So let the patient place the back of his hand on the board when extending and reducing. And if the dislocation protrudes towards the back of the hand, let him place the palm of his hand on the board so that the physician's hand falls on the protuberance of the joint itself.  If it returns immediately, good. Otherwise, bandage it with a dressing that reduces swelling.	But he should examine: if it is a displacement toward the ventral aspect of the hand, the patient should place the back of his hand upon the board for extension and reduction; but if it be a luxation toward the dorsum of the hand, then the inner part of the hand should be laid upon the board so that the doctor's hand may come upon the prominence of the joint itself. If it go back at once, good; but if not, bandage it with a plaster that settles swelling and let it be.	0.83536917
And leave it; do not try again, for it will not bear it, and you will not be able to reduce it after a few days have passed, except that the joint will remain crooked.  And it will not harm the patient at all, unless the hand is weakened and unable to grasp anything.	Do not revert to it, for it will not tolerate that, and you will not be able to effect its reduction after some days have passed. But the joint will retain its deformity; and the patient will in no wise be harmed except if his hand is slackened so that he be unable to grip anything; then you may know that the tendons are either severed or bruised.	0.87324095
Then you will know that the nerve has been severed or bruised, and there is no remedy for it except to cauterize it. Perhaps this will be beneficial, and perhaps it will be of no use.  When the wrist reduction is complete, apply the dressing that we described, then bandage it and leave it for five days.	In this situation there is no method but to strengthen it by cauterization; this sometimes helps but sometimes is of no use at all. When the reduction of the joint is complete, apply to it the plaster we have described, then bandage it and leave it for five days; then loosen it and try out the hand.	0.72647184
Then untie it and exercise the hand. If its movement is difficult and some stiffness occurs in it, soften it with warm water and massage it repeatedly until it softens.	If movement be hampered and any hardness occur in it, soften it repeatedly with hot water and sweating until it be softened.	0.7618679

Fingers may be dislocated in any direction.  When a finger is dislocated towards the back or the palm of the hand, extend the finger and push the dislocation with your thumb until it returns (to its place). Then bind the tip of the finger and suspend it towards the side to which it was dislocated.	The fingers may be dislocated in any direction. When one of the fingers is dislocated dorsally or ventrally, then extend the finger and thrust the dislocation with your thumb until it goes back.	0.89989126
Leave it for two days then release it and extend it so that it becomes straight during that day. If it is nighttime, bind it in the same manner.

When a complete dislocation of one of the vertebrae of the back or neck occurs, or if many vertebrae are displaced from their positions, there is no treatment for it, because death comes quickly to the ill person.	When any of the vertebrae of the back or the neck are completely dislocated or a number of vertebrae are displaced, there is no treatment in this case for death is hastening toward the patient.	0.8898426
And the sign of this is that the patient's feces come out involuntarily, he cannot hold it, and often some of his limbs become relaxed, either his legs, his arms, or one of them.  However, if a single vertebra is displaced from its position, it can often be corrected.	The sign of this is that the injured man passes a motion involuntarily, being unable to hold it back; often too some of his limbs go limp, either both legs or both arms or one of them. If, as often happens, a single vertebra is displaced, the displacement may be in any of four directions.	0.8224586
Its displacement can be in four directions. The one that dislocates posteriorly is called a hump. As for its treatment, you should observe: if the hump has occurred from childhood, there is no treatment for it, nor is there any cure at all. However, for one that occurred due to a fall, a blow, or something similar...	When there is a displacement backwards it is called 'curvature of the spine'. As to its treatment: examine it; if the curvature dates from childhood then there is no treatment or cure at all for it.	0.7085803
The ancients have mentioned it with various kinds of treatment in lengthy discussions, most of which are not beneficial. I have summarized from that what little suffices instead of much of what they have presented, by my approaching the meaning and explaining it. I have also depicted the instrument differently from what they have illustrated and explained.	As for the sort that occurs from a fall or a blow or the like, the Ancients indulged in lengthy dissertations thereon, giving many kinds of treatment, the greater part of which is of no use. But I have abbreviated from it, making a little which will serve in place of their much, consisting in my clarification and exposition of the sense. I have also depicted the instrument differently from their account and their explanation.	0.83015275
So I say that the hump which occurs from the front in the chest has no remedy and no cure from it, and likewise the ones to the two sides also. Only the one which occurs in the back is specifically treated by what I will describe, which is to lay the patient on his face.	I say then, that in a curvature occurring forward there is no technique or cure for it. And likewise in a curvature laterally. The only curvature that can be treated is that of the dorsal spine exclusively, by the means I now describe.	0.7525078
On a level bench near a wall, and spread a damp cloth underneath him so that his chest will not be hurt. Then place a vertical wooden plank, fixed in a hole in the ground, at the edge of the bench toward his head and another wooden plank toward his feet at the other edge of the bench.	The patient should be stretched prone upon a level bench near a wall, and a soft palliasse should be spread under him so that his chest may not be hurt. Then put a straight spar, set in a hole in the ground at the end of the bench where his head is, and another spar where his feet are at the other end of the bench.	0.85148865
An assistant holds the plank – let it not be fixed in the hole – and another assistant holds the other one in the same manner. Then, wrap around the patient's chest and under his armpits with a soft, tight bandage and extend the end of the bandage to the plank which is at his head and tie it there.	Let an assistant hold this spar, which is not to be firmly fixed in the hole, while another assistant holds the other in the same way. Then wind round the patient's chest and beneath his axillae a soft strong wrapper, and stretch one end of the wrapper to the spar at his head, and tie it to it.	0.9215908
Then tighten with another bandage above his thighs, above his knees, and at his ankles. Then gather all the bandages together and tie them to the other plank which is at his feet. Then each assistant pulls the plank in his direction with the bandage, and the two planks do not move from their fixed positions.	Then bind other wrappers: over his hips, his knees, and by both tendons of Achilles; then bring the wrappers together and tie them to the other spar at his feet. Then each assistant extends the spar with the tie towards himself; the two spars will not shift from their places in which they are planted, but, as we have said, they are not to be fixed.	0.8662164
Except that they are not fixed, as we said. And the physician places his palms on the vertebra with force until it returns, or he places a board on it, then leans on the board with his feet until it returns. If it does not return with this treatment, then take a board which is about three cubits long.	Meanwhile the doctor is to press hard with both his palms upon the spine until it goes back; or he may place a board upon it and apply pressure to the board with his feet until it goes back.	0.6538035
And dig in the wall, which we said should be near the patient, a place to insert the end of the board. Then you place the middle of the board on the hump and the physician places his feet on the other end and pulls well until the vertebra is pressed.	But if it does not go back under this treatment then let a board be taken, about three cubits long, and let a place be hollowed out in the wall, which, as we said, should be near the patient, into which you put the end of the board; then place the mid-point of the board upon the hump, and he—the doctor—should place both his feet on the other end and strongly thrust upon the spine until it is forced back into position.	0.74474376
And it returns to its place. And if you want to do it with the screw that is turned by hand, that is, you fix in the ground at the patient's head, at the end of the bench, two planks, the length of which is a cubit, and at his feet, at the end of the bench as well, two planks.	If you wish you may operate by means of a winch turned by hand; thus: you fix in the ground at the head of the patient, at one end of the bench, two wooden spars each one cubit long; and the same at the lower end, at his feet; there should be the distance of a span between the spars (of each pair).	0.7493758
And let the distance between each plank be a span, and in each plank a hole is made through which the screw runs. And all the planks are firmly fixed in the ground so that they do not move at all. And you insert a rounded rod, which is the screw in which the bandage is twisted, into the holes of the two planks.	In each spar there should be a hole in which the shaft may run, and each spar should be firmly fixed in the ground so as not to move at all. Then you introduce a round piece of wood, the shaft on which the rope is wound, into the two openings of the two wooden spars.	0.86018056
And at its end is a hole in which a rod a span long is fixed with which it is twisted, and in the other two planks, the same. Then you tighten the bandage that you tightened on the patient's chest in the screw that is at his head, and the bandages that you tightened on his legs in the screw that is at his feet.	At one end of each shaft is a hole into which is firmly fixed a piece of wood a span long by which it is wound. Likewise with the other two spars. Then bind the wrapper that you have bound round his chest to the shaft at the patient's head, and those bound round his legs to the shaft at his feet.	0.8658717
Then a servant stands at each screw, turning his hand with the turner with which the screw is turned, and the physician straightens the hump as we have described. And this is a picture of the screw, the bench, and the patient:	Then have an assistant standing at each shaft to turn with his hand the handle by which the shaft is revolved, while the doctor straightens out the curvature in the way we have described. This is the figure of the winch, the bench and the patient.	0.8896934
Then, after the vertebra returns and the place becomes straight, it is necessary to apply the desiccative dressing with egg white, then the splint, then you place on top of the dressing a splint made of a board whose width is three fingers or so, and whose length is enough to cover the hump.	After the spine has been restored and the place has been straightened it will be necessary for you to apply an absorbent plaster with egg-white, then packing, then over the plaster apply a flat splint about three fingers wide and long enough to cover the site of the curvature and several sound vertebrae on either side.	0.80702615
And on some healthy beads, then it is tied with the appropriate bandage, and the patient uses light food until he recovers. If some protrusion remains in the place at the end of the healing, it is necessary to use the medications that relax and soften with the use of the board that we described for a long time.	Then let it be bandaged as is needful and let the patient follow a mild diet until he is cured. If after he is healed there still remains some prominence at the site, it will be necessary to employ remedies to relax and soften the parts, together with the use for a long time of the flat splint we described; in this case a leaden plate may be employed.	0.7575313
And a lead plate may be used for that. A protrusion may appear at the end of the vertebrae of the back, and it may be thought to be a dislocation, but it is an extra bone that has grown, so do not treat it with this treatment, as death may occur.	Sometimes there occurs a prominence at the end of the dorsal vertebrae, from which one may form the opinion that there is a dislocation, whereas it will be a superfluous bone that has become prominent; do not interfere with it by this treatment, for death may result.	0.7545443

On the treatment of dislocated hip.	On the treatment of a dislocated hip.	0.9908918
Know that the hip joint and the shoulder joint are only subject to dislocation and are not subject to what happens to other joints, such as slight displacement and depression. The hip joint is dislocated in four ways.	You should know that a complete dislocation alone is sustained by the hip and shoulder joints; they do not sustain the lesser displacements, with concavity, as do the other joints. Now the hip joint is dislocated in four directions, interior, exterior, posterior, and anterior.	0.7531549
That is, it dislocates inward, outward, forward, and backward. Most often it dislocates inward, and rarely forward or backward. The sign of its inward dislocation is that if you compare the patient's healthy leg to the diseased one, it is longer.	Now the hip joint is dislocated in four directions, interior, exterior, posterior, and anterior. Most commonly it is dislocated interiorly; and rarely is it dislocated anteriorly or posteriorly.	0.69527745
And the knee protrudes more than the healthy one, and the patient is unable to bend his leg at the groin, and the place next to the groin is swollen and the swelling is apparent because the head of the femur has moved there.	The indication of an internal dislocation is that when you compare the patient's sound leg with the injured leg it will be longer and the knee will be prominent as compared with that of the sound leg; nor will it be possible for the patient to flex the foot back on the groin; and there will be an obvious swelling near the groin because the head of the femur has moved there.	0.6980923
The signs of outward dislocation are opposite to these symptoms. The sign of forward dislocation is that he extends his leg completely, but he cannot bend it without pain in the knee, and if he tries to walk, he cannot do so forward.	The sign of the occurrence of an external dislocation: the symptoms will be the exact contrary to these. The sign of an anterior dislocation is that the patient can stretch his leg out fully but cannot flex it without feeling pain in the knee; and if he tries to walk he will be unable to walk forward; and he has retention of the urine and his groin swells, and in walking he hobbles upon his heel.	0.8630718
And his urine is retained, and his groin swells, and when walking, he steps on his heel. The sign of backward dislocation is that he does not extend the knee and cannot bend it before bending at the groin, and his leg is also shorter than the other.	The sign of a posterior dislocation is that he cannot extend the knee, nor can he flex it before flexing the hip; also the leg will be shorter than the other, the groin will be relaxed, and the head of the femur will be evident at the lumbar region.	0.75223935
And the groin is relaxed, and the head of the femur is apparent at the location of the hip.  As for the reduction of these types of dislocation, you should observe: if the dislocation is old, long-standing with the patient, and no attempt has been made to reduce it, and it has remained in its state, then there is absolutely no treatment for it.	As to the reduction of the various forms of this dislocation, you must examine the case and if it be an old dislocation which the patient has suffered from for a long time and the reduction of which has not been contrived and which remains as it was, there is no treatment for it at all, nor should any be attempted.	0.62393105
So, you should not attempt to treat it.  However, if the dislocation is recent, whichever of the four directions it may be, hasten to twist the joint and extend it inward and outward, and move it right and left, perhaps...	But in that case whose dislocation is recent, whichever of the four kinds of dislocation it be, hasten to rotate the joint and extend it internally and externally and move it to the right and the left; for often it will return and no further treatment will be needed.	0.81328845
it will return and not need any other treatment.  If it does not return in this way, then it is necessary to prepare a strong, robust assistant to extend his leg from below, either with his hands or with a bandage tied on his leg above the knee, and another assistant to extend it from above.	But if it does not go back thus, you must have ready a sturdy and powerful assistant to extend the leg from below, either with both his hands or with a wrapper bound upon the leg above the knee; while another assistant pulls from above by putting his hands under the patient's axillae; then you should bind a soft wrapper upon the root of the thigh, with a third assistant to hold the end of the bandage.	0.75779736
by putting his hands under his armpits, then tightening a soft bandage on the base of the thigh. Another, third assistant should hold the end of the bandage and extend it either from the front, from the area of the groin towards the clavicle, or from behind towards the back.	Then extension should be made either anteriorly from the direction of the groin to the direction of the clavicle, or posteriorly toward the dorsal spine.	0.4859418
And they should all extend at once, so that the patient is raised by his body off the ground and remains suspended. This type of extension is common to the four types. If the dislocation is reduced by what we have said, then fine, otherwise each type will require the specific treatment that I will describe.	Let them all make their extension simultaneously so the patient is lifted up bodily and remains suspended. This kind of extension is common to all four kinds of dislocation. If the dislocation goes back by the way we have said, good. Otherwise, each kind must have the special treatment I shall describe.	0.91907656
As for the specific reduction if the dislocation is inwards, the patient should lie on his healthy side, then you place a bandage at the base of the thigh between the head of the femur and the area below the groin.	When it is an internal dislocation then the special reduction is for the patient to lie upon his sound side; then apply a wrapper to the root of the hip in the space between the head of the femur and the part below the groin; then carry the bandage upward from the groin toward the upper part of the body, in the direction of the clavicle.	0.8032337
Then extend the bandage upwards from the area of the groin to the upper body, towards the clavicle. Then another strong assistant takes hold with his arms and grasps the thick part of the affected thigh and extends it outwards with strong extension, and it will return to its place.	Then another powerful and sturdy assistant is to take hold of his arms while the thick part of the afflicted thigh is clasped and strongly extended outward; then it will return to its place.	0.78576213
This type is easier than all other types of treatment that reduce this limb. If you find it difficult and it does not respond to entering with this type of treatment at all, then you should tie both of the patient's legs together with a strong, soft bandage on the heels and on the knees.	This kind of treatment is easier than the others for the reduction of this limb. But if you find it refractory and it does not answer to this method of treatment, then the patient's two feet will have to be bound together with a strong soft bandage round his two ankles and his two knees.	0.8322582
And it should be after each of them from its companion the length of four fingers, and the affected leg should be extended more than the other by the length of two fingers.  Then the patient is suspended by the head from a beam that is in the house, and his distance from the ground should be about two cubits.	The distance from each to the next should be four fingers, and the injured leg should be stretched two fingers beyond the other. Then the patient is to reach upward and grasp any beam that may be in the house; he should be about two cubits from the floor.	0.8900051
Then you order a strong young man to grasp the head of the femur, and another young man hangs onto the patient, and the other young man grasping the femur pushes strongly, and the joint will quickly return to its place.  As for its specific reduction if the jaw is dislocated outwards...	Then tell a powerful servant to clasp the head of the hip and another servant to hang from the patient; and the other servant, the one who is clasping the hip, should thrust powerfully; then the hip will speedily go back.	0.80709934
The patient should lie down on the bench as we described for the patient with a hump, and the bandage should be tightened on his affected leg in particular and on his chest. Then the two pieces of wood are placed, one at his feet and the other at his head. Then an additional piece of wood is placed in the middle of the bench, very securely fastened.	The special method of reduction in the case of an external dislocation: it will be necessary for the patient to be lying on a bench after the manner described for the one with a curvature of the spine; but wrappers are to be tied only on the injured leg and the chest.	0.6145601
It should be wrapped with damp rags so that it does not harm the patient, so that the wood is between his thighs, so that he is not pulled downwards during the extension.  Then each assistant extends to his side, and the physician adjusts the hip with his hands. If it responds to the reduction...	Then the two spars are to be set in position, one at his feet and another at his head; and have an additional spar firmly fixed in the middle of the bench and wrapped in soft cloth so as not to injure the patient; this spar is to be between his thighs so that he will not be dragged down during extension. Then each assistant is to pull in his own direction while the doctor sets the hip with his hands. And if it goes back, good.	0.7587757
If not, then place the board on it and compress it as we mentioned for the hump, except that the patient should lie on his healthy side. And if the dislocation is forward, then the patient's leg should be extended at once while he is in this exact same position on the bench.	Then each assistant is to pull in his own direction while the doctor sets the hip with his hands. And if it goes back, good. But if not, place the board upon it and put pressure upon it just as we prescribed for curvature, except that the patient will have to lie upon his sound side.	0.7864157
The physician places the palm of his right hand on the affected groin, then presses it with the other hand, and with that, the pressure should be directed downwards towards the knee.  And if the dislocation is backwards, it is not necessary to extend the patient downwards.	When it is an anterior dislocation, extension will have to be applied forcefully to the patient's leg, on the bench, exactly as described; the doctor should place the palm of his right hand upon the injured groin and then apply pressure with the other hand, directing the pressure so as to make extension downward toward the knee.	0.8510736
He should be raised above the ground, rather he should be placed on something solid, as should also be the case for one whose hip has been dislocated outwards, according to what we mentioned regarding his lying on the bench on his face, with the bandages tightened.	If it is a posterior dislocation the patient must not be raised above the ground and extended downward; rather must he be placed upon something hard, in the manner that we prescribed for an external displacement of the hip: he is to lie prone on the bench with the bands tied as we said before.	0.78795373
as we said before. And compression with the board should also be used on the area where the joint has dislocated. When the return of the hip joint is complete as it should be, and the sign of its return is not hidden from you – which is that you extend the patient's legs.	It will also be necessary to apply pressure with the board to the site to which the joint has been displaced.	0.47024468
And if you see them level, and the patient flexes and extends the leg without difficulty, then know that the limb has returned as it should. Then, bring the thighs together, apply the bandage, and tie it with a turban, tying it so that the hip does not move in any direction.	When the proper reduction of the joint is completed—the signs of reduction will be plain to you; namely, that you extend both the patient's legs, and when you see that both legs are of equal length and the patient can draw up and stretch out the leg without difficulty, then you may know that the limb has gone back as it should—then bring both thighs together, apply the plaster and bind with a sash so that the hip does not move in any direction; and the patient is to keep perfectly quiet for three or four days. Then loosen the bandage and the plaster, and compare the leg with the other.	0.70953023
The patient should remain still for three or four days, then loosen the bandage and dressing and compare the leg with the other.  If you see them equal in length, know that the dislocation has been stabilized.  Then allow the patient to walk.  But if you see any looseness in it,	Then loosen the bandage and the plaster, and compare the leg with the other. If you see that they are both the same size you may know that the dislocation is cured and you can allow the patient to walk freely. But if you see any slackening then repeat: replaster and rebandage as you did at first, and leave for another three days. Then unfasten.	0.7735289
return and bandage it and tighten it as you did the first time, and leave it for three days, then loosen it. He should walk on it slowly for several days until it strengthens, God willing.	Then unfasten. He should be cautious about walking on it for some days, until it is thoroughly strong, God willing.	0.66836584

On the Treatment of Knee Dislocation.	On dislocation of the knee.	0.7306715
The knee dislocates in three ways: it dislocates inwards, outwards, and downwards—I mean backwards—and it does not dislocate forwards at all. The sign of its dislocation is that you order the patient to press his leg against his thigh.	The knee is dislocated in three ways; it is dislocated interiorly and exteriorly and inferiorly, that is, posteriorly. It is never dislocated anteriorly.	0.82174116
If it does not stick to the thigh, then know that the knee is dislocated. The treatment for all its dislocations is to have the patient sit down with his legs extended, if he is able to do so, and have an assistant sit behind him to hold his waist and bend it back a little, then you sit on his thighs.	The sign of dislocation is to bid the patient flex his leg on his thigh, and if it does not reach the thigh you may know the knee is dislocated. The way of setting all the types of dislocation is to make the patient sit down with both legs extended, if he can, with an assistant sitting behind him to hold him by the middle and incline him slightly backward.	0.8343426
Place your back against his face and put his leg between your legs, then grasp his knee with your palms, interlocking your fingers over his knee. Then squeeze the sides of his knee firmly with your palms, while another assistant extends his leg until the knee returns to its place.	Then do you yourself sit on his thighs with your back to his front, and put his leg between yours; then the palms of your hands should be applied to his knee, and join them together by twining the fingers; then with the palms put strong pressure on both sides of his knee while another assistant extends his foot until the knee goes back to its place.	0.9258228
The sign of its return is that the leg adheres to the thigh smoothly and without force. Then bandage it and press the leg against the thigh, then bind them together with a bandage for three or four days, then release them.  He should only undertake a little walking for several days until it strengthens.	The sign of its return is that the leg can be flexed back easily and without hindrance upon the thigh. Then apply a plaster and flex the leg on to the thigh and bandage them together for three or four days; then loosen them. He should do little walking for some days until it gains strength.	0.9408904
If its return is difficult for you using what we have described, then use strong traction with the bandages that we described previously in the treatment of the hip, until it returns.	But if you cannot effect reduction by this method, apply powerful extension by bandages as we have described above for the treatment of the hip, until it goes back.	0.78492975

On the treatment of dislocation of the heel.	On the treatment of dislocation of the ankle.	0.98337567
The heel may be slightly displaced or completely dislocated. Its dislocation can be either inward or outward. The sign of its dislocation is that you see the heel swollen, protruding to the side to which it is dislocated.	The ankle is sometimes slightly displaced, sometimes fully dislocated, the dislocation being either internal or external. The sign of its dislocation is that you will see the ankle swollen, and projecting on the side to which it is dislocated.	0.9169065
As for the treatment of its slight displacement, it is easy to reduce it. It is to be extended gently with the hands and straightened until it returns. As for its treatment when it is completely dislocated, the patient should sit down and be held by a strong assistant, supported from behind his back at his waist.	As to the treatment of its displacement, the reduction of it is easy: if it is gently extended with the hands and straightened, it will go back. As to treatment when it is dislocated completely, you should make the patient sit upright with a strong and sturdy assistant holding him about the middle from behind.	0.892711
Then you take his foot with your right hand from above and with your left hand from below his foot at the place of the Achilles tendon. Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand, then with your left twice, then extend it with the left and push the instep with the right towards the leg without violence.	Then hold the dorsum of the foot with your right hand, and with the left grasp the foot from below about the heel. Then draw the foot toward you with your right hand, then with the left, twice. Then extend it with the left hand and thrust the metatarsus with the right hand without violence toward the leg.	0.79549974
Do this twice as described, then push the instep to the leg the third time while you pull the Achilles tendon. If it returns in one or two times in this manner and you see the foot is straight, then stop.  Otherwise, repeat the procedure, for it will return.	Do this as we have described, twice. Then thrust the metatarsus toward the leg a third time while exerting traction at the heel. If it goes back in one or two attempts thus, and you see the foot is straightened, well and good. If not, repeat the operation and it will go back.	0.844398
If its reduction is difficult for you by what we have described, then lay the patient on his back on the ground and firmly fix a strong stake in the ground to be placed between his thighs, having wrapped rags around it so that it does not harm the patient. Then an assistant should hold his thigh.	If you find it impossible to reduce it by what we have said, make the patient lie on his back on the ground and firmly fix in the ground between his thighs a stake wrapped in material so as not to hurt him.	0.8447847
Then another assistant extends the leg, either with his hands or with a strap that he ties around the ankle of the leg. Then each assistant pulls in the opposite direction of his companion, and the stake stands between the patient's thighs, holding him so that his body is not pulled downwards during the extension. Then the physician sets the dislocation with his hands.	Then an assistant should grasp his thigh and another assistant should extend the foot, either manually or with a cord tied round the narrow part of it; the assistants should pull one against another, with the stake upright between the patient's thighs holding him so that his body will not be dragged down with the extension.	0.8912031
And another assistant holds the healthy leg downwards, for the dislocation will return quickly. When the dislocation has returned and you are sure of its proper reduction, apply the dressing and the splint and tighten it with firm bandages and tie the foot downwards with the bandage. You should be wary of the nerve that is above the heel from behind.	Then the doctor should straighten out the dislocation with both hands, while another assistant holds down the sound leg; then the dislocation will speedily go back. Then when the dislocation is reduced and the soundness of the reduction is manifested to you, apply a plaster and packing, bandage firmly and bind the foot downwards. You will have to be careful of the tendon above the ankle at the back, not to bandage tightly over it so as to injure it.	0.8410438
So that the bandaging is not too tight on it and harms it. Then leave it for two or three days. If the bandaging loosens, tighten it, then remove it on the third or fourth day. And the patient should refrain from walking for forty days.	Then leave him for two or three days; and if the binding works loose, tighten it up. Then on the third or fourth day loosen it, but the patient is to abstain from walking for forty days, for if he tries to walk before this lapse of time you cannot be sure that the dislocation will not collapse and corruption set in and thereafter be incurable.	0.86397195
If he attempts to walk before this period, you cannot be sure that the dislocation will not recur and be ruined and will not thereafter accept treatment.  If a hot swelling occurs to him, then you should use to soothe it what we have described previously in other places of treatment and poulticing until it goes away.	If an abscess occur you must allay it by the application of such dressings and embrocations as we have already described more than once, until it is gone.	0.5475395

You should straighten what has dislocated from it by gentle extension without force, and that is not difficult, rather it is easy. If the dislocation is in some of the joints of the dorsum of the foot, then the patient should place his foot on a level place on the ground.	Any that are dislocated must be straightened by means of gentle extension, without violence; that is not hard but positively easy. If the dislocation be in one of the joints of the dorsum of the foot, the patient must set his foot on level ground or upon a board, standing as though walking.	0.8528737
Or on a board while he is standing like one walking, then you stand and place your foot on whatever protrudes from those joints, then press it down with your foot forcefully until it returns and you see that it is straightened and no protrusion appears in the place.	Then you must stand and put your foot on what protrudes of those joints, and put strong pressure upon it with your foot until it goes back and you see that it is evened out and there is no prominence at the place.	0.79251343
Then place under the sole of his foot a board that takes the entire foot, which has two ends, then tighten it firmly and securely for three days, then loosen it and protect it from walking for many days until it strengthens and you are safe from recurrence, God willing.
