Chapter Thirteen.
On the treatment of ectropion that occurs in the upper eyelid.
The condition that causes this ectropion is called "hare eye." This ectropion can be either congenital or acquired. The acquired type results from the healing of a wound, tear, cauterization, or something similar.
The way to treat it is to incise the scar tissue, separate its edges, insert a linen wick between them, and tie it until it heals.  Things that dry and constrict should not be used in its treatment.
If you do that, the ectropion will return worse than it was. Rather, use things that soften, such as fenugreek, and fomentation with water in which marshmallow root and flaxseed have been steeped, and diachylon ointment melted with some oil, and smear it on the wick and treat it with it.
The key to its treatment is to strive by every means that it does not heal in the way it was originally. This procedure that we have mentioned is only a partial correction of the ectropion, not that the appearance of the area will return to exactly how it was.
