Chapter Thirty-Nine.
On Cauterizing the Uterus.
If matter arises in the uterus from cold and humidity, so that it is prevented from conception, and its menstrual flow is corrupted and its discharge is difficult or it causes pain when it comes, then it should be cauterized with three cauteries around the navel, as we mentioned in cauterizing the bladder.
And a cautery on the coccyx at the bottom of the back, or two cauteries, and the cautery iron should be nail-shaped.
