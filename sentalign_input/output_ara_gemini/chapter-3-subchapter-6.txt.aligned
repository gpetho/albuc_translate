Chapter Six on the reduction of shoulder fractures.	CHAPTER six. On the repair of a fracture of the scapula.	0.80308473
The shoulder blade rarely breaks in its wide part. Rather, it breaks at its edges.	The scapula is rarely fractured in the broad part but it does break at its margins.	0.8820052
Whenever a place in it breaks, or it breaks in its middle, which is known by touch, depending on the shape of the fracture, you must straighten it and return it to its natural shape by any means possible.	When any part of it is broken or it breaks in the middle (which is recognized by palpation) you should attempt the correction of the fracture according to the shape it takes, and its restoration to its natural form, by whatever means you can.	0.7830802
Then apply to the area mill dust with egg white and soft mashaqa (a type of plaster). And place on top a pad of folded cloth. Then place on it a wide splint of thin wood, the size of the entire shoulder or slightly wider.	Then apply over the place mill-dust with eggwhite, and soft tow; and over that a dressing made of a folded cloth; and over that a broad splint made of thin board to the size of the whole scapula or a little wider.	0.8063779
If there is a curvature under the splint in any place of the shoulder, correct that curvature with soft mashaqa until the splint sits evenly.	If there be beneath the splint a hollow in any part of the scapula, level it with soft tow so that the splint rests evenly.	0.8350445
Then tighten it from above with a long turban, tightly and firmly, and secure the splint so that it does not move from its place.	Then bind tightly over it a long sling and make sure that the splint does not slip out of place.	0.7984587
Check the bandage every day; whenever the bandage loosens, tighten it and adjust the splint if it has moved from its place.	Examine the bandage daily; and whenever it gets loose tighten it and adjust the splint if it has shifted.	0.94376016
The patient should lie on his healthy side.	The patient should lie on his sound side.	0.9213785
The shoulder heals in twenty or twenty-five days.	The scapula mends in twenty or twenty-five days.	0.9604447
When this period is complete, untie the bandage and you will be safe, for it is among the bones that are not feared to shatter or deteriorate.	When this time has elapsed you may safely loosen the bandaging, for this is one of the bones in which there is no danger of fragmentation or cracking.	0.8870763
If a splinter of bone protrudes and it pricks under the skin, incise it and extract it, and do what I mentioned in the fracture of the clavicle about soothing the hot swelling if any of that occurs.	If a splinter of bone protrudes and starts to prick under the skin, cut down upon it and remove it, and do as I said under fracture of the collar-bone, to allay the effusion, if anything of that kind happen.	0.90450764
