About the flesh on the nose
Sometimes diverse types of flesh grow on the nose, some resembling scorpions with many legs; and some with flesh that is encrusted in a dark color, and some with soft flesh of good color. In those cases of flesh that are soft and not encrusted, you must make the patient sit between your hands facing the sun; and open his nostrils, and throw the hook at that flesh, and pull it out; then cut what you can sustain with a delicate sharp spatula on one side, until you know that all the flesh is removed.
And if anything remains that cannot be cut, then open it with a delicate instrument lightly, so that nothing remains; and if blood overflows, or a hot abscess appears, treat it as necessary; and if it is a malignant abscess, quickly cauterize it until the blood is staunched and all the flesh is removed, then throw vinegar and water or wine into the nose.
If the nose works and moisture comes down to the palate, know that it is healed; and if the moisture does not penetrate as it should, know that there is flesh grown in the bone above, which the instruments cannot reach to cut: then you must place a slightly thick linen thread, tied with many knots, with a space of a finger or less between each knot; and let the patient put the head of the thread in his nose as much as he can, and draw it by smelling until it comes through the nose into the mouth; and children in schools often do this, and it is an easy thing for one who wants to do it; then hold the head that comes through the nose in one hand, and the other head that comes through the mouth in the other hand, and pull one after the other by the knots on the thread. Do this until you know that the knots have corrupted that flesh, then pull the thread, wipe the blood, and moisten the thread with Egyptian ointment, and replace it in the nose as before; do this for three days or more, until the ointment corrodes all that remains of the flesh; then place a lead tube in the nose for some days until it is healed, and if it needs drying medicines, use them; and this is the form of the instrument for purging the head, into which the oils and medicines are distilled in the nose:
And let it be made of silver or brass, resembling an open lamp, like a tube, and the same conduits; and if you wish, make a closed tube, and let the instrument be used for purging the head; and have a handle on the head for holding it when heating the oil or any liquid.
