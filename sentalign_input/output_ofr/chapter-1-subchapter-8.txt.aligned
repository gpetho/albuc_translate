of lethargy	On cauterization for lethargy due to phlegm.	0.40648583
For this illness it is necessary to give the patient strong herbs and pills cleansing the brain; afterward shave the patient's entire head, and apply to the occiput a mustard plaster, which is described in the treatise on plasters; and this is the method of cauterization: apply it as I have said.	First, great electuaries should be given to the patient to drink; and pills to clear the head. Then let his whole head be shaved and apply a mustard plaster to the hinder part as described in the treatise on plasters. That should be applied several times as it is a kind of cauterization; do it in the very way described there.	0.79500353
If he is healed thus, good; and if not, then make three cauteries from the middle of the head descending down to the neck, and have a space between each cautery of one finger's width; and treat it like the others, and if you wish to add to it, and the patient is tolerant, make a cautery in the middle; and if necessary, two others on the two temples, and treat it until he is healed; and let the cautery be the one called "olive-shaped", as I have said before.	That should be applied several times as it is a kind of cauterization; do it in the very way described there. If he is cured, well and good; but if not, burn him with three cauterizations on the back of the head, arranging them in a row downward from the upper part of the head to the base of the neck; and make an interval between each pair of one finger's breadth. Then treat as aforesaid. If you wish to add to these cauterizations and the patient be fit to bear it, give him a burn in the middle; and if still more, then burn him on the two frontal prominences.	0.88005686
