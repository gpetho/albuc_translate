On the cutting of the epiglottis from an abscess occurring within the throat.
Chapter 43.
The ancients mentioned this incision in the epiglottis, and I have not seen anyone in our land who has done it: and this is the written account of their discourse.
In those with quinsy, the cutting of the epiglottis should be avoided: since no benefit comes from it, because all the veins and the lung are weak.
In those, however, who have a hot abscess in the mouth, or throat, or on both tonsils, when there is no disease in the channel, the cutting of the epiglottis should be used to avoid the harm that results from choking.
Therefore, when we wish to perform this, we should cut the epiglottis under three or four circles of the epiglottis, making a small transverse cut in the area between two circles, so that the cut is in the membrane, not in the cartilage: and indeed this place is suitable for cutting, since it is devoid of flesh, and the blood vessels are distant from it.
If the physician is fearful, then the skin of the throat should be stretched with a hook.
Then let him split the skin until he reaches the channel: avoid any blood vessels if any are seen.
Then let him cut the membrane as we described: and over the cut of the channel there appears phlegm that comes out from it, along with its rupture, and loss of voice.
And leave the wound open for a time.
Then, when the time of feared choking has passed, join the two lips of the skin wound and sew it alone without the cartilage.
Then administer medicines that help flesh to grow, until it heals.
Albucasis says.
The essence of this discourse which we have narrated is not intended, except when they see that one of these abscesses has already blocked the throat of the patient, and the patient is elevated near death, and desires for his breath to be interrupted: they proceed to cut the epiglottis, so that the patient may breathe over the site of the wound with a certain respiration, and be saved from death: and for this reason, they ordered to leave the wound open until the evil of the illness is consumed, which takes three days, approximately: then they ordered to sew the wound, and treat it, until it heals.
And what I myself saw is that a servant girl took a knife and put it in her throat, and cut with it part of her lungâ€™s channel.
I was called to her treatment, and I found her groaning, like the groaning of the dying.
Therefore, I examined the wound, and I found little blood that had come out from the wound.
I was confident, therefore, that she had not cut a vein, nor harmed herself seriously: and air was coming out from the wound.
I hurried, therefore, and sewed the wound, and treated it until it healed: and nothing happened to the servant girl except hoarseness in her voice: and after some days she returned to a better state of health.
Hence, I say that in the cutting of the epiglottis there is no fear.
