Thus begins the prologue of the third part: on restoration. This chapter is often necessary in the art of medicine; it is the restoration of fracture and dislocation incidents in the bones.	This third part of the book, too, is an essential necessity in the practice of medicine; it concerns the setting of the fracture or dislocation occurring in bones.	0.75015324
Oh, son, know that foolish doctors and laypeople boast of this chapter and those who have never regarded the books of the Ancients nor read a single letter of them.	You should know, my sons, that ignorant practitioners and laymen and those who have never turned the pages of a single book of the Ancients about it, nor studied a single letter of it, arrogate this part of the art to themselves.	0.82045686
And for this reason, this manner of the learned in our land is private; and I have not forgotten this at any time; and I have not adopted this except through long study of the books of the Ancients and study on the understanding of them, until I extracted the knowledge from them.	For this reason this section of the science has died out in our parts; I have myself found no one competent in it; and whatever skill I have, I have derived for myself by my long reading of the books of the Ancients and my thirst to understand them until I extracted the knowledge of it from them.	0.7503935
And then I applied it to experiment and study throughout my life.	Then through the whole of my life I have adhered to experience and practice.	0.84093726
And I have already described in this chapter all that my knowledge contains and on which my experiment is based; as I have abbreviated this for you and freed it from lengthy occupation; and I have abbreviated this to the end of abbreviation; and I have shown this at the end of clarification; and I have formed in this many forms of the instruments that are administered in it, as it is done by adding clarification, as I have done in the previous two chapters.	So now I have described for you in this book all that my knowledge has encompassed on the subject and that my experience has encountered; I have made it accessible for you and rescued it from the abyss of prolixity; I have reduced it to a brief outline; and have explained it most clearly. I have made for you many drawings of the instruments that are used in it, which is an adjunct to explanation, as I did in the two previous books.	0.8751466
