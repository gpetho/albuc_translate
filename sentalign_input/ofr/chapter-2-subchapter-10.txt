of the fat of the eyes (or: about the fat of the eyes)
Exinach is a fat that is generated in the tissues of the upper eyelids, and this happens more to children than to any other people, and it greatly bothers their eyes, and rheum comes to them in the mornings, and they cannot look at the light of the sun because tears hurry to their eyes; and because of this they constantly lie on their faces, and sleep like that, and their eyelids under their eyebrows are moist, which the swelling and appearance have covered with the exinach that appears in the eye.
And when you press the place with your fingers and feel the exinach between them.
And the way of the work is that the patient puts his head on your lap; and then take a linen cloth, and prepare a tent in the manner of a circle according to the quantity of exinach contained on each side, then put it on him; and press with your fingers on one side and the other, so that the exinach is gathered in the middle of the circle; then cut into the middle of the moisture with a scalpel, making a slit of this width, and let it not be larger than the wound that is made in bloodletting a vein; and cut the skin deeply until you come to the exinach; and in several instances exinach comes out of the slit, in the form of a piece of white fat. 
Then extract it all in one piece with a cloth grasped between your fingers next to the fire, and turn your hand to the right and to the left until it is removed; and be careful not to insert anything into the slit, that you do not go all the way with the scalpel down to the eye, that you do not injure it.
And if the exinach does not appear at the beginning of the slit, then enlarge the slit slightly until it appears; then extract it as we have said, then moisten cloths in vinegar and water, and put them on the area, and bind with bandages.
And there are some men who grind salt and put it on to dissolve the moisture that remains.
Then treat it until it is healed.
And if a hot abscess forms in the area, treat it with soothing plasters until it is healed.
