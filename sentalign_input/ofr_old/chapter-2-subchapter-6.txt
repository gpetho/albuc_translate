About the blockage of the ears
Everything that falls into the ears is one of four things: either grains, or an insect, or a stone from a mine or similar thing like iron; or seeds, like barley, beans, peas; or flowing substances like water and vinegar and similar things.
When a stone or other type of thing falls into the ear that does not adhere to the ear and does not grow in the ear, place the ear in the sun. If you see the stone, then distill a little violet oil or sesame oil, then administer extraction; and make the person sneeze with pepper, and plug the nostrils when the sneezing comes, and place pieces of cloth or wool around the ear; and hold the ear upwards. Often it comes out by this treatment; and if it does not come out, then administer extraction with delicate pincers, which have this form:
If it jumps out with pincers, that is good; if not, then administer extraction with a delicate hook of small size; and if it does not come out by this, then make a bronze tube and place the end of the tube in the ear hole tightly, and seal what is around the tube with soft wax so that air cannot enter with the tube; then pull it out strongly, for often it comes out as we have said; and if it does not come out in this manner, then take glue used for catching birds, and place it on an instrument that is suitable for this purpose, and put a little cotton around it; then press the glue onto the stone or whatever it is, and pull it out.
And if it does not come out by all these means that we have mentioned, then hurry to cut the ear before a hot abscess comes, and spasms; and the manner of the cut is that you first bleed the patient from the cephalic vein, and draw blood according to his strength, then have the patient sit between your hands and turn his ear upwards, and make a small cut at the root of the ear in the soft part at the dependent place; and let the cut be like a crescent, until you reach the stone, then remove it as best you can, and suck it quickly with your mouth; and treat it until it is healed.
And if it is a grain that is inside and it swells, then administer extraction; and if it cannot come out, then administer a thin, delicate spatula in this form:
and administer incision of the grain. But do not do this when you think that the grain is moist from the moisture of the ear, until you have made many pieces of it; then extract it with delicate pincers and by suction, as we have said, so that the extraction is eased.
In the case of water that falls into the ear, the patient must first sneeze with pepper, and fill the ear with old cotton. And let him lie on that ear where the water is. If it comes out by this, that is good. If not, then take many small, thin, and light stones, and heat them a little in the fire; and the patient should place one in the hole of his ear, and jump on one of his feet on the other side, and strike another stone on the stone that is in the ear; and do not stop doing this stone by stone until the water comes out completely, and in this way it will all come out; and if you wish, then take a rush, and put one end in the ear, and light the other end with fire until most of the rush is burnt; then do the same with other rushes until the water comes out completely, as we have said about the stone.
In the extraction of an insect, if it is small-bodied, like a flea and similar things, treat it as we have said in the division; but if it is large-bodied and can be felt, then administer extraction with pincers; and this is the easiest thing to remove that is in the ear.
In the extraction of worms bred in the ears, when you treat it as we have said in the division and in the treatment of distillations, and the treatment does not help, then you must look at the ear in the sunlight: if any worms appear, then extract them with delicate pincers, and if they do not appear, then take a tube of which this is the form:
And let it be narrow below and wide above. And place the more delicate end in the ear according to the tolerance of the patient, then suck strongly on the tube; do this often until all the worms come out. And if they do not obey to come out, then seal around the tube with cotton as I have said about the stone; and if they do not come out as we have said, then administer distillations that the ancients have proven for killing worms, and you will find them in the treatment of distillations; and distill your oils and medicines into the ear with this instrument, of which this is the form as you see:
And let it be of silver or bronze, narrow below with small holes, and open above for distillation; and to press the distillation inside, use a well-made bronze instrument for this, and if you wish, take a razor and wrap it suitably with cotton; then pour your oil or juice, and whatever you want of your medicines into the tube, and let the tube be in the ear; then place the razor with the cotton inside, and press your hand moderately until the oil is distilled to the bottom of the ear; and let the patient feel it inside, and let the distillation be a little warmed by fire before it is distilled into the ear; and make sure it is not too cold, for the medicine would not be as good.
