The third chapter on cauterizing non-chronic migraine.	CHAPTER THREE. On the cauterization of non-chronic migraine.	0.91819143
If pain occurs in the fissure of the head along with a headache, and the pain extends to the eye, then induce vomiting in the patient with medicines that purify the head, and employ all the other treatments that I mentioned in the classification of diseases. If that is not effective, then cauterization is done in two ways.	When there occurs pain with headache in one side of the head and the pain extends to the eye; and the patient has cleared his head with purging drugs and there has been applied the other treatment that I have mentioned in the sections on diseases, but to no avail; in this disorder cauterization is of two sorts, either with caustic or with the actual cautery.	0.83796227
As for cauterization with a burning medication, it is that you take one clove of garlic, peel it, and cut off its ends from both sides. Then incise the place of the pain on the temple with a wide scalpel until there is a space under the skin that can accommodate the clove, so it enters under the skin until it disappears.	This is the manner of cauterization with caustic: take one clove of garlic; peel it and cut both ends off; then cut open the site of the pain in the temple with a broad scalpel till there is room to contain the clove under the skin; then introduce it under the skin till it lies completely hidden.	0.8095845
Then tighten it with a bandage, tightly, and leave it for about fifteen hours. Then untie it and take out the garlic and leave the wound for two or three days. Then apply cotton dipped in ghee to it until the place suppurates.	Then bind up the wound tightly over it with pads and leave for fifteen hours; then unbind it, remove the garlic, and leave the wound open for two or three days; then apply cotton wool soaked in butter till it suppurates.	0.94686127
Then treat it with the ointment until it heals, God willing.	Then dress with ointment till it heals.	0.7515054
And if you wish, you can do this with some of the burning medications that I provided in the eighteenth article on burning medications.	If you would rather, you may carry it out with one of the caustic drugs that I have included in the eighteenth treatise, on caustics.	0.7616179
And as for cauterizing it with iron, it is in this manner: you heat the cautery iron, which is of this form:	The actual cauterization with iron should be done in this way: heat a cautery of this shape.	0.6968454
And it is called the nail-shaped cautery because its head is like the shape of a nail, with some curvature and a small protrusion in its middle.	It is called the claviform; the head is nailshaped in that there is a slight curvature with a small protuberance in the middle.	0.7338214
Then you place it on the painful area and hold your hand while you rotate the iron little by little.	Apply it then to the site of the pain, hold your hand steady and revolve it little by little.	0.80803454
And the amount you burn of the skin's thickness should be like half of it, and you lift your hand so as not to burn the artery that is underneath, causing bleeding.	Let the thickness of skin burnt be about half; then remove your hand so as not to burn a subjacent artery, for thus a haemorrhage arises.	0.811127
Then you soak cotton in salt water and place it on the area and leave it for three days, then you load the cotton with ghee, then you treat it with the ointment until it heals, God willing.	Then soak some cotton wool in saline, apply to the place, and leave three days; then apply cotton wool with butter; then treat with ointment till it heals.	0.8775761
And if you wish, cauterize this migraine with the knife-like edge coming from the cautery, and be careful of cutting the artery in this migraine, especially if it's not chronic.	Or if you prefer you can cauterize this migraine with the knife-edge that juts out from the cautery; but be careful not to cut an artery, specially in this kind of migraine that is non-chronic.	0.8710358
