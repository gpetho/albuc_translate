Leeches are used only on limbs where one cannot place cupping glasses due to their small size, such as lips and gums, and similar places;
and in places devoid of flesh, such as fingers or nose, and other similar places;
and the method of use is that when you find leeches that are in clean fresh water without filth, take them;
and put them in fresh water for a night, so that they become hungry, and have nothing in their bellies;
and then be bled by vein or cupping glass, then rub the limb until it is red, and place the leeches on it;
and when they are full, and fall off, if it is a place where one can apply a cupping glass, apply it, for this is very beneficial afterwards.
If not, then wash the area well, first with vinegar, and then with water, and then wipe it; 
and if the area bleeds too much after the leeches are removed, wet a linen cloth in cold water, and place it on, until the bleeding has stopped;
and if the blood flow is excessive, apply crushed vitriol, or gallnuts, and similar things, until it is stopped;
or you can put on the area half of peeled beans, and leave them until they dry on the spot, this will stop it immediately; 
and if you need more, then take other leeches.
And if the leeches do not want to attach, rub the area with fresh blood, or prick it with a needle until the blood comes out, and then put them on, and as soon as they sense the blood, they will attach;
and when you see that they are falling off, sprinkle on a little aloe and crushed salt, or ash, and they will fall off immediately.
