Of the abscess of the testicles
This is an abscess enveloped in a covering resembling a bud, with the softening of the testicles,
And the patient moves painfully when he walks;
And the treatment of this disease is almost as fearful as the one mentioned before,
And yet we will tell you the work of it, according to what the ancients did.
You should make the patient sit on a raised seat, then push the suspensory of the testicles down with your fingers,
With all the vessels that are near the penis, and the master holds them, and extends them firmly;
Then cut with the broad sharp spatula across the vessels, until they are uncovered,
And then strip on each side, as we have said in the extraction of the arteries that are in the temples;
Then stick a needle with a double thread, and tie it at the first place where the infection has come, and tie it again at the other end;
Then cut them in the middle straightly, according to the length of the body, and draw out the corrupted moisture;
Then treat the wound as with others where pus forms, so that some vessels fall that nourish one of the testicles;
For from this comes no harm, and if infection comes to all the vessels, it is necessary to extract the testicles with all the vessels;
So that the organ does not lose its nourishment due to the cutting of the vessels, and they dry out and cannot be helped.
