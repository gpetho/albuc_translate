Â¶ On the restoration of a shoulder blade fracture.
Chapter VII.
The shoulder blade rarely fractures, and in its broad part: and only its edges break.
Therefore, when a part of it is broken, and it breaks in the middle, and it is only recognized by touch: then attempt its preparation according to the shape of the fracture.
And restore it to its natural shape by every skillful means possible for you.
Then place mill dust with egg white on the spot, with soft wool, and place a cushion made of folded cloth over it.
Then place over it a broad splint from a thin board according to the size of the entire shoulder blade, or slightly larger.
But if there is a hollow under the splint in any part of the shoulder blade, then equalize that hollow with soft wool, until the splint aligns evenly.
Then bind it above with a long binding, with decent compression and firmness of the splint, until it does not move from its place.
And inspect the binding every day.
Therefore, whenever the binding loosens, tighten it, and align the splint if it has moved from its place: and let the patient lie on his healthy side.
And the shoulder blade indeed heals in twenty days, or in twenty-five days.
When this number is complete, then loosen the binding: and you may be at ease.
For it is one of the bones whose healing is not feared, nor its breaking apart.
But if a piece protrudes from the bone and pierces under the skin: then cut above it and remove it.
And do what we said for the fracture of the collarbone regarding the calming of a hot swelling, if anything arises from it.
