Chapter 20:	CHAPTER TWENTY.	0.5619583
On the treatment of swelling that occurs at the site of a fracture.	On the treatment of the callus that remains from a fracture.	0.7001833
Many times this swelling occurs at the site of a healed fracture, especially if it is near the joints, and it deforms the shape of the limb; and it often prevents the limb from performing its natural function.	This callus often occurs after the healing of a fracture, especially one near a joint, and thereby the shape of the limb is spoilt; and sometimes there is limitation of the natural function of the limb.	0.87498987
Then consider if the swelling is recent and apply astringent medicines such as aloe, incense, myrrh, Serapias, and aristolochia, or similar; so take some or all of these and mix them with astringent wine, or egg white, or sour wine, and apply it to the swelling with tow, and compress it well.	Examine it, and if the callus be soft, apply astringent remedies to it, such as aloes, olibanum, myrrh, balsam of sarcocol, acacia, and the like. Take some or all of these; beat them up with a dry wine or egg-white or vinegar, apply to the callus on some tow and bind up firmly.	0.8190261
And leave the bandage in place without loosening it for many days; then loosen it and reapply another until the swelling is reduced; or compress it with a lead plate, because lead has the property of removing all swelling from limbs.	Leave the bandaging on for many days; then undo it and repeat until the callus is removed, God willing. Or bind on it a firm sheet of lead; for lead has the property of taking away lumps from limbs.	0.82461035
But if the swelling has already hardened and is tight, and it is necessary to remove it quickly, then cut it at the uppermost part, and incise the excess and prominent parts, or scrape it with some rasp until it is reduced; and treat it until it is healed.	But if the callus is stony hard and its removal is urgent, incise the place and cut away the superfluous prominence, or pare it away with a scraper until it is gone; and dress the wound until it heals.	0.80456865
