of the head full of water
Know that this illness often occurs in children at birth, and when the midwife squeezes the child's head too hard;
and sometimes it comes from a hidden cause that is unknown.
And I have never seen this illness except in children, and in all those I have seen, death came quickly;
and therefore it seems to me that it is better to abandon the work in such treatments.
And I saw a child whose head was full of water, and the head grew every day so much that he could not support it;
and the fluid grew so much that he died, and this fluid collected beneath the bone above the meninges, between the brain and the bone; 
and the procedure is as follows if the fluid is between the brain and the bone, and the abscess is small, that you make a wide incision in the middle of the head;
and it should be as long as two nuts, so that the fluid can flow;
and here is the shape of the spatula:
If the fluid has grown more, and the abscess is larger, then make two incisions in the shape of a cross, like this:
And if the fluid is under the bone, and the signs that you see are the sutures of the head open on each side, and the water spurts out when you press it inside with your hand, and this is not resolved for you:
then you must make three incisions in the middle of the head like this:
And after the incision, extract all the fluid out.
Afterwards, bind the incisions with bandages and powders, and apply wine and oil, and leave it like this until the fifth day;
then unbind it, and treat the wound with tents and ointments, and keep the head evenly bandaged, and give the patient dry food with little moisture until the limb is strengthened and healed.
And another method of incision is that you observe or perceive the size of the abscess, and the collection of fluid;
for sometimes it is in front;
sometimes behind;
sometimes on the right;
and sometimes on the left.
Therefore cut where the abscess appears, and the accumulation of fluid, and split it open as much as you can;
and be careful not to cut the artery;
and if a flow of blood comes, so that the patient dies from the loss of blood and the evacuation of fluid.
