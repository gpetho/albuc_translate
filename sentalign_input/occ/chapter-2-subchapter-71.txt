Chapter 71.
On lentigo and protruding flesh from causes in women.
Lentigo is often joined to natural causes when it is stressed and made the target of attention; and sometimes it is enlarged in some women to the extent that it spreads like in men and becomes involved in intercourse.
Then you need to hold the excess of lentigo with your hand or with a hook and cut it.
And do not delay in cutting, especially at the base of the root, so that it does not cause a flow of blood.
Then treat it with wound care until it is healed.
But new flesh is flesh that grows in the orifice of the mother until it fills it, and often it is expelled to the outside in the form of a tail (and for this reason some first called it "tailed disease"); so we need to cut it as we cut lentigo, and treat it until it is healed.
