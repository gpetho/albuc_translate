Chapter seventy-two on the treatment of atresia.
Atresia is when a woman's vulva is not perforated, or the opening is small, and it is either congenital, in which she is born with it, or acquired.
So, the acquired type results from a preceding ailment, and it is either from excess protruding flesh, or a thin or thick membrane, and it is either in the depth of the uterus, or on its sides, or in its upper or lower part, and it prevents intercourse, pregnancy, and childbirth, and sometimes menstruation.
Knowing this is by the midwife's inspection, if the blockage is apparent and close, but if it is not apparent, she examines it with her fingers or a probe.
So, if the blockage is from a thin membrane and it is close to the labia, then immediately perforate it, which is that you place something like padding on the labia, then put both your thumbs from both hands, and the woman is on her back with her legs spread apart, then stretch the labia with force until you perforate the thin membrane and the blockage opens.
Then take wool, soak it in oil, and place it on the area, and have intercourse with the woman every day so that the area does not rejoin again.
But if the membrane is thick and dense, it should be incised with a wide scalpel, resembling a myrtle leaf.
And if the obstruction is from protruding flesh, hang it with hooks and cut it, and have with you medications that stop bleeding without stinging, such as acacia, chebulic myrobalan, and frankincense, mixed with egg white.
Then use a wide lead tube so that the wound does not heal quickly.
Keep it for some days, and use a wick of dry linen, then treat it with the rest of the healing treatment until it is cured.
And other fleshy growths may occur in the uterus, so they should be cut in this manner, unless it is a cancerous tumor, for a cancerous tumor that is in the uterus should not be touched with iron at all.
