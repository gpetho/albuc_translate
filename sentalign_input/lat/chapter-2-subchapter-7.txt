On the treatment of blockage occurring in the ear.
Chapter VII.
Sometimes certain infants come forth from the wombs of their mothers without having open ear canals.
And it also happens that some people develop a blockage in the ear canal from a wound or flesh that grows there.
And this blockage sometimes occurs deep in the ear canal, which cannot be seen; and sometimes it happens near the outer opening, and it can be seen.
Thus, the one that occurs deep in the ear and cannot be reached by sight is, in most cases, difficult to cure.
And in the one that can be seen, you should place the patientâ€™s ear in the sunlight, and examine it: then if you see an apparent blockage, open it with a fine spatula, whose form is as follows, with an end that has a slight width, one part of which is sharp: and let the rest of the spatula have two smooth sides, so as not to harm the ear.
If the blockage is from flesh that has grown in the ear canal, then hold it with a fine hook, and cut it carefully but forcefully, until all the flesh is removed.
But if the blockage is deep in the ear, then take a fine, smooth rod, and heat it briefly with fire; then insert it into the ear canal.
If you then feel the blockage with it, and the patient experiences impaired hearing, attempt to open it gently; and be careful not to injure the ear nerves.
Then place a small wick in the ear, according to the width of the opening, which you have wrapped in Egyptian ointment: do this for several days until you are sure of the wound's healing.
Or take a wick, soak it in rose water, sprinkle finely ground sage on it, and use it.
If you see the ear beginning to abscess, then you must remove the wick and replace it with another wick, which you wrap in a poultice made with rose oil, until the warm abscess subsides: then treat it until it heals.
If bleeding occurs, then soak a sponge or cloths in cold water, and place it over the ear: and use the other treatments mentioned in the section on distillations to stop the bleeding.
