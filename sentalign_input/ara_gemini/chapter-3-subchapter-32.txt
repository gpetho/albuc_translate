Chapter thirty-two on the treatment of knee dislocation.
The knee dislocates in three directions: it dislocates inwards, outwards, and downwards, I mean backwards, and it does not dislocate forwards at all.
And the sign of its dislocation is that you order the patient to bring his leg to his thigh, and if it does not stick to the thigh, then know that the knee is dislocated.
And the treatment of all its dislocations is that you sit the patient down, having extended his legs, if he is able to do that, and you sit a servant behind him to hold his waist and twist it backwards a little, then you sit on his thighs, putting your back to his face, and you put his leg between your legs, then you grasp his knee with your palms, interlocking them between your fingers on his knee, then you squeeze both sides of his knee with your palms strongly, and another servant extends his leg until the knee returns to its place.
And the sign of its return is that the leg sticks to the thigh softly, without force.
Then bandage it, and stick the leg to the thigh, then bind them both with a bandage for three or four days, then release them.
And he should not engage in anything except a little walking for some days, until it strengthens.
If its return is difficult for you with what we described, otherwise, use strong extension with the bandages that I previously described for the treatment of the hip, until it returns.
