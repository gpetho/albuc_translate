On Types of Dislocation with Wounds or Fractures.
Chapter 36.
When such an injury occurs, and one attempts to treat and restore it, often death results. Thus, only those who are wise in the art, experienced, compassionate, patient, cautious, not reckless nor presumptuous, should undertake such a treatment. They should begin with medicines that reduce hot abscesses alone and leave the patient to divine judgment.
Unless you see or hope for relief from suffering with mild symptoms and a sign of possible recovery.
Attempt the reduction immediately at the onset, before a hot abscess forms.
If the limb returns as desired, then apply treatment to calm the abscess, and treat the wound with suitable drying ointments.
If the dislocation includes a fracture and small fragments of bone have separated, attempt to remove these fragments, and follow the previously stated instructions for simple ailments as discussed in their respective places.
Exercise caution according to your ability, and guard yourself from entering the path of fear, as my previous counsel advised.
For this will be better for you before your Creator, more enduring to your honor, and safer for your body among your peers in your time.
