On the treatment of men's nipples that resemble women's breasts.	On the treatment of the male breast when it resembles the female.	0.861179
Sometimes the nipples of certain men become swollen at the end of sleep (that is, when they begin to be affected in sleep), until they resemble women's breasts, and they remain disgustingly infected.	The breasts of some males may swell on attaining puberty so as to resemble the female breast, and they remain permanently swollen and ugly.	0.61252445
Therefore, he who detests this must cut over the nipples with a crescent-shaped incision, in the form from line b. to line g. Then scrape off all the fat. Next, fill the wound with healing medication. Then bring together the two edges of the wound with a suture, and care for it until it heals.	If this is abhorrent, a semicircular incision should be made on the breast, like this figure, from b to g. Then dissect away all the fatty tissue and pack the wound with a cicatrizing compound and sew the lips together and dress until healed.	0.7605611
If, however, the nipple sags downward and becomes softened due to its size, as happens to women: then it must be split on its two upper sides with two incisions similar in shape to a crescent, each one connected to the other at their ends, until the larger line contains the smaller, in the form from line b. to line g. Then, scrape off the skin between the two edges, remove the fat, and apply what we have mentioned about suturing and powders, as necessary for healing, until it recovers.	But if the breast is pendulous and flabby on account of its size, as happens with women, you should make two semicircular incisions on the upper side, the ends joining one another, in such wise that the longer incision encircles the other like this, from b to g. Then dissect away the skin between the two incisions and remove the fat and sew up as we have described; and apply styptic powder and the necessary dressings until healed.	0.87971485
If, however, you do not complete the incision as needed due to the patientâ€™s restlessness or excessive blood flow: then you must fill the wound with cotton soaked in corrosive ointment, and leave it until it eats away the remaining fat. Then care for it until it heals.	But if you cannot make the incision as full and perfect as it ought to have been, because the patient is restless, or because haemorrhage arises, you should pack the wound with cotton wool soaked in corrosive ointment and leave till it eats away the remainder of the fat; then dress until healed.	0.8920717
