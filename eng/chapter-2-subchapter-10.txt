 CHAPTER TEN.
On the treatment of hydatid in the upper lid.
 Hydatid is fat which arises in the folds of the upper lid.
It is a disease chiefly occurring in children, irritating their eyes, giving them morning catarrh; they are unable to look full into the light of the sun, since they get an immediate secretion of tears.
And for that reason you will find them lying always on their faces, and they also sleep on their faces; and the eyelids below the eyebrows are moist and covered with swellings, while the hydatid stands out prominently; and when you press upon the place with your finger you can feel the fat beneath it.
The manner of operating is for the patient to let his head rest in your lap.
Then you take a scrap of linen and prepare a pad of it.
Make it into a circle of sufficient size to enclose the whole of the hydatid on all sides, then place it on it and squeeze with your fingers on all sides, so as to gather up the hydatid in the centre of the circle.
Then in the middle of this humidity make a crosswise incision with a lancet, but do not let the incision be larger than that made for a venesection.
As to the depth, the skin should be incised right through till you come to the hydatid, which in most cases will come out from the incision, in the shape of a white piece of fat.
Draw it out with a cloth rolled between your fingers, turning your hand to right and to left till it is separated.
Be careful not to go so deep with your scalpel that it sticks in the eye and injures it.
If you do not see the hydatid at the first incision, you must gently cut a little deeper till it comes forth, then draw it out as described.
Then dip some cloth in vinegar and water, apply to the place and bind it up with pads.
 There are some who grind up salt and put it in the hollow of the incision to liquefy thereby the remains of the humidity.
Then dress till healed.
If an effusion occur in the place, treat with sedative plasters till healed.
