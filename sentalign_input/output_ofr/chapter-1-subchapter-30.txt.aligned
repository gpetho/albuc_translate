When you treat the lamprey disease using what we have mentioned in the divisions of treatments, and it does not help, then there are three appropriate types of cautery that are all good.

Then put the two heated prongs in until the skin is pierced on the other side, and then pull out the cautery, and thus there will be four. And if you want, cauterize using the three-pronged cautery.	Then push in the two prongs, well heated, till you have pierced the skin from side to side. Then take out the cautery; and there are four cauterizations. Or if you prefer you can burn with the other cautery, of three prongs.	0.8725893
