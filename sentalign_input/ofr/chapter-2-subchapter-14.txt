of the flesh that grows in the eye
This disease, which is below, is truly called "axacrati", and is both natural and accidental. 
The accidental type comes from wounds and cracks and cauterization and similar things;
and the way to operate on it is that you take a needle, in which there is a double thread, and stick it in the flesh, and make it pierce from the left tear duct to the right, so that the thread comes out at both ends of the flesh;
then stretch the flesh above with the needle, and cut it with a spatula one finger wide.
And if the form of the eyelid returns as it should, it is good;
if not, then take a razor and put it in the crack, and turn the eyelid, and make two incisions on the side inside the eyelid;
and let the ends of the two incisions be at the two angles of the incision that you cut, and make an angle so that when they are assembled, the shape is like the shape of a letter called "Greek I"; (or "Y")
then remove that flesh, according to how much its sides are sharp underneath, from what is attached to the eyelid, then join the two separated parts, and sew them with a woolen thread;
then treat it with what we have said about softening medicines, and with tents, until it is healed.
And if the illness comes from a crack or a seam or a cautery, then you must make a full incision under the hairs of the eyelids, and according to what is described above;
then separate between the two edges with a tent, as I have said;
and the work must be done according to the form of the illness, for it is very diverse in form, and the wise master devises with all his power how he can return the appearance to its natural form;
and the patient himself, according to what is required in terms of work and instruments in various arrangements.
