Praefatio.	Preface.
Postquam compleui uobis o Filii, librum hunc, qui est postremus scientiae in medicina cum complemento ipsius, et consecutus sum finem in eo, ex expositionibus eius, et ipsius declarationibus, uisum est mihi, ut compleam ipsum uobis cum hoc Tractatu qui est pars operationis, id est, chirurgiae cum manu.	After I have completed for you, my son, this book, which is the last of the science of medicine with its supplement, and I have ended in it from its expositions and its declarations, it has seemed good to me that I complete it for you with this treatise which is a part of operation, that is, surgery by hand.
Quoniam operatio cum manu prostrata est in regione nostra, et tempore nostro priuata omnino: donec fortasse periit scientia eius, et abscissum est uestigium eius: et non remanserunt ex ea, nisi descriptiones paruae in libris antiquorum, quas mutauerunt manus: et accidit eis error et haesitatio, donec clausae sunt intentiones eius, et elongata est uis ipsius: Visum est mihi, ut uiuificem eam cum ordinatione huius Tractatus in ea secundum uiam ex positionis, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et ut ueniam cum formis ferramentorum Cauterii, et reliquorum instrumentorum operis: cum fit ex declarationis additione, et ex properatione eius quod est necesse.	Since operation by hand is laid out in our region and in our time entirely private: until perhaps the science of it has perished, and its track has been lost: and what remained of it are a few descriptions in ancient books, which hands have altered: and it happened to them error and hesitation, until their intentions were closed and their essence was prolonged: It seemed good to me that I would make it clear with this arrangement of this treatise according to its exposition and declaration and abbreviation: and that I would bring it into being with the forms of tools Cauterizing, and the rest of the instruments of operation: since it is necessary from its addition and its properation.
Caussa autem propter quam non inuenitur bonus artifex eius cum manu sua in hoc nostro tempore, est: quia ars medicinae est longa, et oportet auctorem eius exercitari ante illud in scientia anatomiae, quam narrauit Galenus, donec sciat iuuamenta membrorum, et ipsorum formas, et eorum coniunctionem, et separationem, et habeat cognitionem ossium, et neruorum, et lacertorum, et numerum ipsorum, et eorum egressionem, et uenarum pulsatilium, et quietarum, et locorum exitus earum.	Since the cause for which a good artisan of his own hand is not found in our time: that the art of medicine is long, and it is necessary for its author to exercise himself in the science of anatomy which Galen tells, until he knows the joints of the limbs, and their forms, and their connection, and separation, and has knowledge of bones, and nerves, and ligaments, and their number, and their exit, and their pulsation, and calmness, and places of their exit: it seemed good to me that I would bring him to light with this arrangement of this treatise according to its exposition and declaration and abbreviation: and that I would provide him with the forms of tools Cauterizing, and the rest of the instruments of operation: since it is necessary from its addition and its properation.
Et propter illud dixit Hippocrates, quod nomen cum nomine est multum, et cum opere est paucum, et praecipue in arte manus.	And therefore Hippocrates said, that the name with the name is much, and with the work is little, especially in the art of hand.
Nos uero iam diximus de illo in introitu huius libri.	We have said before at the beginning of this book.
Quoniam qui non est sciens, quod diximus de anatomia, non euacuatur, quin iam cadat in errorem, quo interficiuntur homines: sicut ego uidi multos ex illis, qui formantur de hac scientia, et iactant se de ea absque scientia, et sine experimento.	Since he who does not know that we have said about anatomy will fall into error, in which men are formed from the science: as I saw many of them, who form themselves out of this science and boast of it without knowledge and without experience.
Quod est, quia uidi medicum stolidum secuisse apostema scrophulosum in collo mulieris, et incidit quasdam arterias in collo: quare fluxit sanguis mulieris, donec cecidit mortua inter manus eius.	What is more, I saw a doctor strike an aposteme scrofulous sore on the neck of a woman, and cut some of the arteries in her neck. Wherefore the blood of the woman flowed until she died between her hands.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui praesumpsit ut extraheret lapidem uiro, qui processerat in aetate, et lapis erat magnus.	And I saw another doctor who took out a large stone from the entrails of a man, who had been troubled by it for a long time, and the stone was great.
Peruenit ergo ad eum, et extraxit ipsum cum frusto uesicae.	So he came to him, and took it out with the hook of a probe.
Quare mortuus est uir in tertio die.	Wherefore the man died on the third day.
Et ego quidem iam uocatus fueram ad extrahendum ipsum: et uidi ex magnitudine lapidis, et dispositione infirmi, quod moriretur.	And I had already been called to take it out: and I saw from the great size of the stone, and the care of the nurse, that he should die.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui accipiebat stipem apud quendam Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicinam: et accidit eunucho nigro, qui erat apud ipsum, fractura in crure eius prope calcaneum: et properauit medicus cum ignorantia sua, et strinxit fracturam super uulnus cum puluinaribus, et astellis strictura forti, et non dimisit uulneri expirationem.	And I saw another doctor take a fee from our Duke's land for medicine: and there happened to be a black eunuch with him, who was standing by his heel, and the doctor, through his ignorance, bound the fracture on his thigh with narrow bands and strong sutures, and did not desist from the wound's issue.
Deinde absoluit eum secundum desyderia sua.	Then he dismissed him according to his desire.
Postea dimisit eum diebus aliquot, et praecepit ei, ne solueret ligamentum: et stetit sic donec apostematum est crus eius, et ipsius pes, et peruenit ad perditionem.	Later on he dismissed him after a few days, and commanded him not to loosen the ligatures: and so he stood until the sore in his leg, and his weight, were loosed, and came to ruin.
Vocatus sum ergo ad eum: et properaui ad soluendum ligamentum: et consecuta est tranquillitas, et euasit a doloribus suis.	So I was called to him: and I did what I could to loose the ligatures: and subsequently there was quietness, and his pain was eased.
Verumtamen corruptio iam confirmata erat in membro: et non potui refraenare ipsam.	However the corruption had already taken root in the member: and I could not restrain it.
Pon ergo cessauit corruptio perambulare in membro, donec periit.	So the corruption ceased to wander in the member, until he died.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui perforauit apostema cancerosum: et ulceratum est post dies, donec magnificata est malicia eius cum domino ipsius.	And I saw another doctor who pierced an aposteme cancerous sore: and it was ulcerated for several days, until the malice of it came out with its lord.
Quod est, quia quando est cancer purus ex humore melancholico, tunc non oportet ut perueniatur ad eum cum ferro omnino, nisi sit in membro quod toleret, ut abscindatur totum eius.	Which is as much as to say, that when the cancer is pure from the melancholic humors, then it should not be cut out with a hot iron at all, unless it lies in a member which it bears, so that it may be cut off all at once.
Et propter illud o Filii, necesse est uobis, ut sciatis, quod operatio cum manu diuiditur in duas diuisiones: scilicet, operationem cui associatur salus: et operationem, cum qua est periculum in pluribus dispositionibus.	And for that reason, you sons, it is necessary that you know that the operation with the hand is divided into two: namely, the operation which is associated with health and the operation with which there is danger in many dispositions.
Et ego iam excitaui in omni loco huius libri, in quo uenit operatio, in qua est terror et timor.	And I have already excited in all places of this book, where the operation has come, in which there is terror and fear.
Quare necesse est uobis, ut caueatis illud, et dimitatis ipsum: ut non inueniant stolidi uiam ad loquendum, et dehonestandum.	Why it is necessary for you to beware of that, and to refuse it: so that they do not find the bones broken, and the words useless.
Accipite ergo mensuram cum sollicitudine et protectione, et infirmos uestros cum facilitate et firmitudine, et utimini uia meliore perducente gratia Dei ad salutem et successionem laudabilem: et dimittite aegritudines terribiles difficilis sanationis: et tollite animas uestras ab eo quod facit uos timere, ut ingrediatur super uos haesitatio in fide uestra et commodo uestro.	So receive with solicitude and protection, and bring your patients with ease and strength, and let them go through the door of grace of God to salvation and a glorious succession: and remove from you the souls who make you afraid, so that they come upon you a hesitation in your faith and comfort.
Est enim magis remanens ad gloriam uestram, et sublimius in mundo isto, et postremo ad quantitates uestras.	For it remains more for our glory, and more gloriously in the world, and finally to your numbers.
Galenus enim iam dixit in quibusdam suis admonitionibus.	Because Galenus has already said in some of his advices:
Non medicetis aegritudinem malam: ne nominemini medici mali.	Do not treat disease with medicine: do not call yourself a doctor.
Iam autem diuisi hunc Tractatum secundum tria Capitula. Â¶	But I have already divided this treatise into three chapters.
Capitulum primum.	Chapter one: On the nature and definition of surgery.
De Cauterio cum igne, et Cauterio cum medicina acuta, capitulatum, et ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum, et ferramentis Cauterii: et omni quod necessarium est in operatione. Â¶	On the cauterization with fire, and cauterization with acute medicine, on the bed, and on the form of instruments, and tools used for cauterization: and all that is necessary in the operation.
Capitulum secundum.	Chapter two: On the preparation of patients for surgery.
De sectione et perforatione, phlebotomia et uentosis, et uulneribus: et extractione sagittarum, et similibus illius: et totum capitulatum, ordinatum formis instrumentorum. Â¶	On section and piercing, phlebotomy and sanguinology, and wounds: and extraction of arrows, and similar things: and all that is contained in this chapter, ordered according to the forms of instruments.
Capitulum tertium.	Chapter three: On the different types of surgical instruments and tools used for surgery.
De restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus illius: capitulatum, ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum.	On restoration, dislocation, and cure of torsion, and similar things: ordered from the head to the feet, and on the form of instruments.
Soli Deo Gloria.	To God alone be glory.

Pars I.	Part I.
Â¶ De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.	Â§ On cauterization and non-injury; with what kinds of faces it is appropriate to work, and at what time; and if with iron or gold.
Caput I.	Chapter I.
Sed Ante Quidem Quam rememorer operationis cum eo, oportet ut dicam qualitatem Iuuamentorum eius, et Nocumentorum ipsius: et in qua complexione exhibeatur.	But before I recall the operation with him, I should tell you about the qualities of his cauterization and non-injury, and in what kind of face it should be performed.
Dico ergo, quod sermo de qualitate iuuamenti Cauterii, et nocumenti eius, est sermo prolixus, et subtilis, scientia, et secretum occultum.	I therefore say that the speech about the quality of cauterization and non-injury is a long, subtle, learned, and secretive speech.
Etiam locuta fuit in eo multitudo sapientum, et dissenserunt in eo: et mihi quidem sufficit parum ex sermonibus eorum, timens prolongationem.	Moreover, many wise men spoke in it, and they disagreed with each other; and enough for me of their speeches, fearing a protraction of the discussion.
Dico ergo, quod Cauterium confert uniuersaliter omni complexioni, quae est cum materia, et absque materia: excaeptis duabus complexionibus, quae sunt complexio calida absque materia, et complexio sicca absque materia.	I therefore say that cauterization is suitable for all kinds of faces, whether with matter or without matter: excepting two kinds of faces, which are a warm face without matter and a dry face without matter.
In complexione autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.	In a warm or dry face with matter, they disagreed.
Quidam enim dixerunt, quod Cauterium iuuatiuum est in ea.	Some said that cauterization is appropriate in that case.
Et dixerunt alii contrarium illius, scilicet quod Cauterium non est conueniens in aegritudine, quae est ex caliditate et siccitate: quoniam natura ignis est caliditas: et inconueniens est, ut sanetur ex agritudine calida et sicca, cum calido et sicco.	And others said the opposite, that cauterization is not suitable in such a disease, which is of heat and dryness: for fire's nature is to be hot; and it is unsuitable, so that it should heal from a hot and dry sickness with hot and dry.
Et dixit ille qui dicit contrarium illius: quod per Cauterium fit iuuamentum in omni aegritudine calida et sicca, quae accidit in corporibus hominum: quoniam quando tu comparas corpus hominis, et humiditates eius, ad complexionem ignis, inuenis corpus hominis frigidum.	And he who said the opposite added: "But with cauterization, an injury is made in any hot or dry sickness that occurs in human bodies; for when you compare a human body and its humidities to the complexion of fire, you cool down a cold body.
Et ego quidem dico per sermonem eius: quia ex perimentum iam detexit mihi illud aliquotiens.	And I too say by my own experience: for by experiment I have discovered that this is true sometimes.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in se ipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.	However, it is not necessary to press on that point, unless he who has already been tried and exercised in the exercise of the chapter of cauterization knows the difference between human complexions, and the disposition of sicknesses in themselves, and their causes, and the accidents of them, and the space of time.
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis.	Do not fear the remnants of the plasters; and especially in cases of cold and wet sickness.
Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.	For all doctors agree on them, and there is no difference between them and the cautery in their treatment.
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterisatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.	And know, sons, that the secret of curing with fire and the goodness of the cautery when it is burned with medicine together is simple: for the action of fire does not reach unless to the member that is cauterized; and it does not harm another member connected to it except by little injury.
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.	For the action of medicine burned together reaches to that which is prolonged from the members; and perhaps it causes a difficult sickness of curing in the member, and perhaps it destroys it.
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.	But fire, because of its subtlety and goodness of its substance, does not do that, unless it runs short.
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super ueritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.	Now this has been known to us by experimentation because of the length of practice and study with art, and standing on veracity of things: and by that excuse I have taken up the length of speech.
Et si non esset, quia non licet huic libro meo, afferrem uobis secretum occultum in igne, et qualitatem operationis eius in corporibus expulsionis suae, qua expellit aegritudines sermone philosophico demonstratiuo, qui acueretur a mentibus uestris.	And if it is not, because it is not allowed to this my book, I would give you the secret and mystery of fire, and the quality of its operation in bodies by its expulsion, which expels sickness with philosophical demonstration, which is achieved from the minds of your sons.
Et scitote filii, quod ipsi dissentiunt in tempore, in quo conuenit fieri cauterium, et ponunt melius tempus ueris.	And know, sons, that they disagree at the time when the cautery is to be made, and put forward a better time for the wound.
Et ego dico, quod cauterium conuenit in omni tempore: propterea, quod nocumentum accidens propter tempus submergitur in iuuamento, quod attrahitur cum cauterio.	And I say, that the cautery is to be made at any time; because, the accident that happens through time is hidden in cure, which is drawn to the cautery.
Et praecipue si cauterium est propter dolores ex doloribus necessariis, fortibus, festinis, qui non tolerant tarditatem: propterea quod timetur ex eis, quod accidat malicia quae est maior, quam paruum nocumentum intrans propter tempus.	And especially if the cautery is because of the necessary pains, the stronger, the feasts, which do not bear tardiness: for they are afraid from them, that the evil which is greater than a little injury happens to one who does not stand through time.
Et non cadat in mentibus uestris o filii illud, quod non extimant, nisi uulgus et stolidi medici, scilicet quod illi aegritudini quae sanatur per cauterium, non est reditio semper: et ponunt illud consequens, et res non est sicut putant: propterea quod cauterium non est, nisi loco medicinae, quae alterat complexionem, et exiccat humiditates quae sunt caussae, quare accidunt dolores.	And let not that son of theirs fall in the minds of the common people and the foolish doctors, that is to say, that health which he gains through cauterization is not always restored: they set down as a consequence, and it is not so as they think; for cauterization is not unless in the art of medicine, which changes the complexion and dries up the humors which are the cause of pains, whereby those pains occur.
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.	However, cauterization is superfluous on medicine by virtue of its speed in healing, and the power of its operation, and the keenness of its lordship: and it is possible that he recover health at some time during his illness according to the complexion and location of his disease, and the power of it: and that it was prepared in his body from an accumulation of superfluous things in him; and that it came to itself through acquisition from food, and similar causes from within, unless there is a disease in which cauterization is administered.
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor.	A subtle disease in a small member that has an excess of things and moisture, such as the pain of a tooth, because of a pain and its like; it is possible, indeed, that he not recover that pain in him.
Sed illud fit in paucis.	But that happens in a few things.
At uero sermo uulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.	But the saying of the common people, that cauterization is the last resort of medicine, is true: it does not regard what they intend in him; for they believe that it is not a healing that brings with it medicine, nor anything else after the occasion of a cautery.
Res autem est econtrario illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinum, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum mediciuae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt uulgus et multistolidorum medicorum.	But the opposite of this is true, and the intention, that cauterization is the last resort of medicine, is not unless when we administer means of cure in some disease, and they do not bring those medicines: then we administer at the end of things a cautery, and it brings it; then from this it falls, that cauterization is the last resort of medicine, not according to the intention which the common people and many stupids of doctors understand.
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.	Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.
Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probaui illud, et inueni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.	Indeed, that is not absolutely true: for I have already proven that and found that it does not do so in certain bodies without others.
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt.	And the cautery with itself is good, and better than with iron, as they said.
Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.	But when you ignite the cautery in fire from gold, it is not revealed to you when it ignites according to the quantity that you use, because of the redness of gold: and when it approaches to itself the cold, and if you add ignition on it, it melts in the fire and turns into leaves.
Quare cadit artifex ex illo in occupationem: et propter illud fit Cauterium cum ferro apud nos uelocius et propinquius, ex rectitudine ad operationem.	Why does the craftsman fall from that in his work: and because of that it is made The cautery with iron with us faster and closer, out of rectitude to the work.
Et ego quidem iam ordinaui hoc Capitulum in Cauterio, secundum capitula: et ordinaui ea a capite usque ad pedes: ut alleuient quaerenti illud quod uult ex eo.	And I too have already arranged this Chapter on the cautery, according to the chapters: and I arranged it from the head until the feet: that you may find what you want from it.
Â¶ De modo cauterizandi Caput in commissura coronali.	About the way of cauterizing The skull at the base of the nose.
Caput II.	The skull
Confert hic cauterizatio ad dominium humiditatis et frigiditatis super cerebrum: quae duae sunt caussae sodae, et multitudinis fluxus humorum ex capite ad partes oculorum et aurium, et multitudinis somni, et doloris dentium, et doloris gutturis: et uniuersaliter omnis aegritudinis, quae accidit ex frigiditate, sicut paralisis, et sodae, epilepsiae, et apoplexiae, et similia illis ex aegritudinibus.	Confirm here the cauterization to the lord of humidity and coldness over the brain: which are two causes of salt, and multitude of flow of humors from the head to the parts of the eyes and ears, and multitude of sleep, and pain of teeth, and pain of throat: and universally all sicknesses that happen from coldness, such as paralysis, and salt, and epilepsies, and apoplexies, and similar things from those illnesses.
Modus cauterizationis est, ut praecipias infirmo: ut euacuetur in primis cum medicina solutiua mundificante caput tribus noctibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod exigit uirtus infirmi, et eius aetas, et consuetudo eius.	The way of cauterization is, that you instruct the sick: that he be drained out in the first place with solute and purifying medicine the head three nights, or four, according to what the strength of the nurse requires, and his age, and his custom.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radi faciat caput suum cum nouacula.	Then order him to shave his head with a razor.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas quadratum, ita quod iam posuit manus suas super pectus suum.	Then have him sit between your hands, square-shaped, so that he has placed his hands on his chest.
Deinde pone radicem palmae tuae super radicem nasi sui inter oculos suos.	Then place the root of your palm on the root of his nose between his eyes.
Vbicumque ergo peruenerit digitus tuus medius, signa locum illum cum incausto.	So wherever your middle finger comes to rest, mark that spot with a wisp of stubble.
Deinde igni Cauterium Oliuare: cuius haec est forma.	Then light the cautery with olive oil: this is its form.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum signatum cum incausto, descensione, qua constringatur manus tua paulatim, et tu reuolues ipsum.	Then place the patient on the marked spot with the fire, descending, so that your hand squeezes his hand little by little, and you rotate it.
Deinde leua manum tuam uelociter, et aspicias locum.	Then quickly wipe your hand, and examine the spot.
Quod si uides iam detegi ex osse quantitatem capitis alkiel, aut quantitatem zeuherbi, tunc eleua manum tuam.	If you see a quantity of hair come off with the bone, or a quantity of oil, then quickly wipe your hand.
Et si non, itera manum tuam ferro ipso, aut cum alio ab ipso si infrigidatur: donec uideantur ossa, quae dixi tibi.	And if not, repeat the rubbing with the iron, or with something else if it becomes cold: until you see the bones that I told you about.
Deinde sume aliquid ex sale, et solue illud in aqua, et imbibe in ipso cotum, et pone super locum: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then take some salt, and dissolve it in water, and soak it in the solution, and place it on the spot: and let go for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, et dimitte illum super locum, donec destruatur eschara ignis.	Then place on the spot the soaked fabric in butter, and leave it on the spot until the fire has completely consumed it.
Deinde cura illud cum unguento tetrapharmacon, usquequo sanetur.	Then take care of that with the tetrapharmacon ointment until it heals.
Iam dixerunt, quod quanto uulnus plus remanet apertum, emittit pus: quare est melius et magis iuuatiuum.	They have already said that as long as a scar remains open, it will emit pus: why is this better and more beneficial?
Et dixerunt quidam eorum, ut cauterizetur cutis usque ad os: et teneatur Cauterium, donec aduratur quiddam spissitudinis ossis.	And some of them said, let the skin be cauterized all the way down to the bone: and hold the cautery until a certain amount of bone is burned up.
Deinde radatur post illud quod adustum est ex osse, deinde curetur.	Then shave after that which has been burned from the bone, then apply ointment.
Et dicunt alii, quod oportet ut cum cauterio perueniatur ad ultimum, donec imprimat in os impressionem for tem, ita quod cadat os, quod fit sicut forma kirate: aut instrumentum quod mulieres ponunt infuso alphabeti parui: et extimant, quod exspirantur ex hoc loco uapores capitis, et dimittatur uulnus apertum tempore longo.	And others say that it should be done with the cautery to impress on the bone an impression like a mold, so that it falls out, which is as it should be: or an instrument that women put in infusions of alphabet: and they estimate, that from this place there are discharged the vapors of the hair of the head, and the open wound closes after a long time.
Deinde curetur, donec consolidetur.	And then heal, until it hardens.
Mihi autem non uidentur hae duae species Cauterii omnino nisi in quibusdam hominibus secundum uiam timoris.	But which of these two types of cauterization do not exist at all unless in some men after the first time of fear.
Et dimittere ipsum, apud me est melius cum salute ipsius.	And dismiss him, for me it is better with his health.
Debilitatur enim caput ex solutione continuitatis ipsius naturalis: sicut testificati sumus in reliquis membris: et praecipue quando caput infirmi debile est natura: et species quidem Cauterii prima est magis salua et melior apud me, et ea utor: operare ergo cum ea in salute.	For the head is weakened by the solution of its natural continuity; as we have testified in the other members; and especially when the head is weak from nature: and the species of cauterization is first healthier and better with me; and I use that one: so operate when he is healthy.
Â¶ De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.	The way to cauterize the head when it hurts throughout the head.
Caput III.	Chapter III.
Quando in toto Capite accidit dolor chronicus: et prolongatur illud in infirmo, et utitur hyeris, et cochiis, et caputpurgiis, et oleis, et empleumatis.	When chronic pain occurs throughout the head and is prolonged in the sick person, and he uses oil, and poultices, and ointments, and baths.
Et praecipue si iam cauterizatum est cauterio uno, quod narrauimus, et non confert ei aliquid ex illis: tunc considera.	And especially if it has already been cauterized with one kind of cauterization which we have described, and does not give anything to it from those: then observe.
Nam si caput infirmi est fortis creationis natura, et non est debile, et inuenit frigus uehemens: tunc cauteriza cum cauterio alio sub illo parum.	For if the head is sick with the strength of nature and is not weak, and cold is felt strongly: then cauterize under it a little with another kind of cauterization.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio, do nec pertranseat cutis, et discooperiatur ex osse quantitas, quam narrauimus.	Then cauterize the head itself over all the branches of its own cauterization, not passing through the skin, and taking off a quantity from the bone, which we have described.
Et cauteriza ipsum cauterio uno in occipitio capitis sui, in loco qui nominatur uas: et est locus in quo ponitur uentosa: et eleua matum tuam in hoc, et non discooperias os.	And cauterize the head itself with one kind of cauterization in the back of the head, in a place that is called a vein; and it is a place where there is a flowing wind; and wash your forehead in this, and you will not see bone.
Infirmus enim inuenit propter illud dolorem uehementem, et diuersum a dolore reliquorum cauteriorum capitis omnium.	The sick person will have great pain because of that sharp cold: and is far from the pain of all the other types of head cauterization.
Et ego dicam hoc Cauterium in loco suo: et oportet quod sit cauterium, quo cauterizantur cornua capitis, et occiput eius subtilius cauterio, quo cauterizatur medium capitis.	And I will call this type of cauterization in its place; and it must be that it is a cauterization with which the branches of the head are cauterized, and the back of the head is cauterized more finely with cauterization, which cauterizes the middle of the head.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is his shape.
Â¶ De modo cauterizandi in hemicrania, tam cum medicina adustiua, quam cum ferro.	In regard to the method for cauterizing a headache, whether with medication or with iron.
Caput IIII.	Chapter IV. On the Treatment of Headaches.
Quando accidit in parte capitis dolor et soda, aut extenditur dolor usque ad oculum, et euacuatur cum medicinis mundificantibus caput, et administratur reliqua curatio, quam dixi in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert illud totum: tunc cauterizatio in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterizatio cum medicina acuta comburente: aut cum ferro.	When there is pain on one side of the head and soda water, or the pain extends to the eye, and the head is washed with cleaning medicines, and the remaining treatment is given as I have described in the division of illnesses, and does not completely provide for it: then cauterization is to be done according to two methods: either cauterization with sharp-burning medicine: or with iron.
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus.	The cauterization with sharp-burning medicine is, that you take a tooth of fennel, and peel it, and cut off its ends from the two sides.
Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.	Then cut the area of pain at the same time with a phlebotomy blade on one side, until a spot is made under the skin where the pain is taken.
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso sub cute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitteuulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Then introduce it into that place under the skin, until it is concealed: then tie it tightly with a little bandage that descends, and leave it for fifteen hours, and then remove it, and extract it, and leave it alone for two days, or three: then put a cotton swab on the place submerged in butter, until a boil occurs: then care for the place with ointment until it heals.
Et si uis fac illud cum quibusdam medicinis comburentibus, quas ego scripsi in tractatu duodecimo, de Medieinis adurentibus.	And if you want to make the wound heal faster with some burning medicines which I wrote about in the 12th chapter of The Surgery Book.
Cauterizatio uero eius cum ferro, est secundum hunc modum.	But cauterization with iron is to be done in this way.
Igni Cauterium, cuius forma haec est.	The fire for cauterization, whose shape is:
Et nominatur Clauilis: quoniam forma capitis eius est sicut forma claui, in quo est quiddam curuitatis, et in medio eius est quaedam eminentia parua.	And it is called the "Claw," because the shape of the head is like the shape of a claw, and there is some small eminence in the middle of it.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum, et retine manum tuam: et tu reuolue ferrum paulatim cum uelocitate: et sit quantitas quae aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, sicut medietas eius.	Then place the claw on that spot and keep your hand: and you will gently turn the iron around with speed: and the amount that is burned should be according to the thickness of the skin, such as a half of it.
Et eleua manum tuam, ut non aduratur arteria, quae est inferius, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And I pray for your hand, that no artery may be cut and there may not be a flow of blood.
Deinde imbibe cotum in aqua salis, et pone super locum, et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus: deinde pone cotum cum butyro: postea cura cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	And then dip the bandage in salt water and put it on the place and leave it for three days: and then dip it with butter: afterwards treat it with ointment until it heals.
Et si uis, cauteriza hanc hemicraniam cum extremitate cultellari secunda Cauterii.	And if you see, cauterize this headache with a sharp knife second time of cauterization.
Et caue ab incisione arteriae in hac hemicrania, non antiqua proprie.	And do not cut the artery for this headache, but use your own blood.
Â¶ De modo cauteriezandi in hemicrania antiqua.	The way to cauterize in a headache of old age.
Caput V.	Head.
Quando curas hemicraniam, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione praecedente, et quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio: et uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei quod diximus ex cauterio primo cum medicina, aut cum cauterio cum igne, tunc oportet ut ignias Cauterium cultellare, donec albificetur postquam signas super locum doloris cum linea, cuius longitudo sit medietas digiti, aut quasi illud: et depone manum tuam uice una, et stringe eam donec incidas arteriam, et peruenias usque ad os.	When you treat a headache, with what we have said before about the cure of the division of ailments, and that the cure is not sufficient: and you see from the disease, that it does not suffice to it what we have said about the first cauterization with medicine, or with fire, then it is necessary that you use fire of cauterization, until it turns white after the marks on the place of pain with a line, whose length is half a finger, or almost like that: and put your hand by force until you touch the artery, and reach to the mouth.
Verumtamen necesse est tibi, ut caueas a continuatione mandibulae, quae mouetur apud masticationem, ne aduratur latus, aut neruus qui mouet ipsam, unde accidat spasmus.	However, it is necessary that you cauterize the continued mandible which moves during chewing, so that no nerve which moves it may be cut, from which accident a spasm may happen.
Et esto super custotiam, et cautelam de fluxu sanguinis arteriae, quae abscisa est.	And be on guard and take care of the flow of blood of the artery which has been separated.
In abscisione enim eius est timor, et praecipue ei qui ignorat illud quod facit, et non est studiosus, nec expertus: et dimittit operationem cum eo in primis.	For in the dissection there is a danger, and above all to him who does not know what he is doing, and is not studious or expert: and he dismisses the operation with those first.
Et ego ueniam cum rememoratione regiminis fluxus sanguinis accidentis ex arteria secundum modum suum, et in loco suo huius libri.	And I come with a reminder of the treatment of blood flow from the artery in its own way, and in its own place in this book.
Quod si uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei hoc Cauterium, et uides corpus infirmi tolerans cauterium in medio capitis, sicut narrauimus, cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	That if you see from the disease that this cauterization is not sufficient for him, and you see a body which bears the cauterization in the middle of the head, as we have narrated, treat a wound, until it heals.
Et si uis, administra Cauterium, quod diximus in capitulo extractionis arteriae cum Cauterio habente duos cultellos.	And if you see, apply cauterization, which we have said in the chapter on extracting an artery with a cautery having two tweezers.
Est enim cauterizatio melior hac et magis conferens.	For cauterization is better and provides more security.
Â¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Aurium.	(On the method of cauterizing in ear pain.)
Caput VI.	ChAPTER VI.
Quando accidit in Aure dolor a frigore, et curatur cum solutiuis, et reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione, et non remouetur dolor, tunc igni Cauterium: et est illud quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma est haec.	When pain occurs in the ear from cold, and healing with hot solutions, and the remainder of the cure as we have said in the division, and the pain does not disappear, then apply fire cauterization: and that is what is called a dot, whose shape is this.
Deinde puncta cum eo post eius ignitionem in circumitu auris totius, sicut reuoluitur: aut in circumitu utriusque, si simul dolor est in utrisque.	Then the dots with it after its ignition in the circumference of the whole ear, as it heals: or in the circumference of either, if pain is simultaneous in both.
Et elonga te cum Cauterio a radice auris parumper, postquam signaueris loca cum encaustro: et sit cauterii quantitas decem punctorum in omni aure, et quasi illa.	And lengthen it with the cautery from the root of the ear slightly, after you have marked the places with caustic: and let the quantity of cautery be ten points throughout the ear, and almost so.
Deinde cura loca, donec sanentur.	Then care for the place until it is healed.
Â¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tortura.	(On the method of cauterizing in torture.)
Caput VII.	Chapter VII.
Tortura quae curatur cum cauterizatione, non est nisi ex speciebus, quae accidunt ex phlegmate, secundum quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum.	Torcura which is cured with cauterization, is not except from the species which occur from phlegm, according to what we have said in the divisions of diseases.
Et deuita cauterizationem speciei, quae accidit ex exiccatione, et spasmo nerui.	And distant cauterization of a species which occurs from drying, and from spasm of a nerve.
Quando curas hanc speciem torturae cum hyeris, et caputpurgiis, et gargarismis, et non confert curatio tua, tunc oportet ut cauterizes infirmum tribus Cauteriis: uno apud radicem auris, et secundo parum inferius a timpore suo, et tertio apud coniunctionem duorum labiorum.	When you cure this species of torture with oil, and with the headpurging, and with gargarisms, and your cure does not provide security, then it is necessary that you cauterize the sick three times: one near the root of the ear, and a second slightly below its place, and a third at the conjunction of the two lips.
Et pone Cauterium tuum ex contrario partis infirmae.	And put your cautery on the opposite side of the weak part.
Quoniam mollificatio non accidit, nisi in parte quae apparet sana.	For softening does not occur unless in the part which seems healthy.
Et forma cauterizationis est, ut cauterizes ipsum Cauterio in directo extremitatis auris superioris sub cornu capitis parum: et alio in timpore: cuius longitudo sit secundum longitudinem pollicis.	And the shape of cauterization is so that it cauterizes itself at the direct extremity of the upper ear near the head's corner, slightly: and a second in the time: whose length is according to the length of the thumb.
Et depone manum tuam cum cauterio, donec comburatur quantitas medietatis spissitudinis cutis.	And lay your hand upon the wound with the cautery, until the quantity of half the thickness of the skin is burned up.
Et haec est forma Cauterii, et est species ex cultellari, cuius forma praemissa est: uerumtamen non est subtilior ea parum, sicut uides: et oportet ut sit cultellus in eo superfluae grossitudinis parum.	And this is the form of cautery, and its kind from a scalpel, whose form has been mentioned above: but it is not so fine as you see; and it should be that the scalpel have a little bit of surplus roughness.
Deinde cura loca, cum eo quod praecessit: donec sanetur.	Then take care of the place with what preceded it: until it heals.

Si ergo sanatur per illud, bonum est.	But if he heals by that, then it is good.

Cauterium in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum igne: aut cauterium cum medicina comburente.	The cauterium is second to two ways: either a cauterium with fire: or a cauterium with burning medicine.
In cauterio autem cum igne, praecipe infirmo ante illud, ut dimittat pilos suos, si est ex illis qui mundant eos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	In the cauterium with fire, however, you should instruct the sick person beforehand, so that he does not have his hair on him, if it is from those who clean them, until they grow out and become smooth.
Si autem pungunt eum apud ortum suum: tunc constringe oculos eius cum uitta, ut non moueantur, donec nascantur.	But if it stings him at the edge of his eye: then squeeze his eyes with viscous fluid so that they do not blink until they are grown.
Cum ergo nascuntur et aequantur, tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo: deinde signa super Palpebram oculorum eius cum encaustro, signo quod sit secundum figuram folii myrti: et sit principium signi prope pilos.	When they are grown and become smooth, then place the head of the patient in your lap: and then mark on the eyelids of his eyes with a brand, a mark that is according to the shape of the leaf of myrtle: and let the beginning of the mark be near the hair.
Deinde pone cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum.	Then place a moistened cloth made of wool on his eye: or a cloth dipped in psylli mud over the eye.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then the fire cautery, whose form is this.
Deinde cauteriza super figuram, quam signasti paulatim in uicibus multis, donec comburatur superficies cutis, quae est sicut figura folii myrti, totam apparentem proprie.	Then cauterize over the figure, which you have indicated gradually on many pieces, until it is burnt to the skin surface, which is like the shape of a myrtle leaf, all apparently itself.
Et signum sanitatis operis tui est: ut si uideas Palpebram oculi iam contrahi, et pilos eleuari apud puncturam oculi.	And the sign of the work of your skill is: if you squeeze the eyelids of the eye already shut, and take off the hair near the eye.
Eleua ergo manum tuam tunc: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	So then bless your hand: and dismiss these tribes after a few days.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur eschara.	Then put on the patch with butter over it until the eschar is removed.

Â¶ De modo cauterizandi apostemata Epatis.	The method for cauterizing liver abscesses.
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.
Quando accidit exitura, et uis scire, si illud apostema est in carne Epatis, aut in tunica eius: tunc si est in carne Epatis, inuadit infirmum dolor, et grauitas absque acuitate: et si est in tunica Epatis, cum dolore est acuitas uehemens: et uides iam, quia fatigauit medicos eius curatio.	When an abscess has formed and you need to know if it is in the liver or in the lining of the liver (the peritoneum): then if it is in the liver, you will observe a pain that is dull and without acute symptoms: and if it is in the lining of the liver, you will notice a very painful pain: and you will now see that the treatment of these by doctors is useless.
Oportet ergo ut resupinet infirmus super ceruicem suam.	It is necessary that the sick one lie on his back.
Deinde figura locum apostematis cum encaustro: deinde ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	Then, with a mirror, determine the location of the abscess: then, with fire, cauterize so that it is absorbed by radiation.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et cauteriza cum eo cauterium unum, donec comburatur cutis tota, et perueniat ad siphac, donec egrediatur sanies tota: deinde cura ipsum curatione exiturarum, donec sanetur.	And cauterize with it once, until the whole skin is burned, and comes to the siphum, until it discharges all the pus: then take care of the cure of these abscesses, until it heals.
Et non oportet ut hac cauterii specie utatur, nisi cuius studium in arte medicinae prolongatur: et per cuius manus concurrunt aegritudines istae cum experimento aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super huiusmodi operationem.	And it is not necessary that this cautery be used except for the purpose of those who have studied medicine in depth: and by whose hands such ailments are sometimes treated with experiment: then, indeed, dare thought to such an operation.
At uero dimittere ipsam, apud me est melius.	But if you wish to give it up, it is better with me.
Â¶ De modo cauterizandi in Pleuresi.	The method for cauterizing pleurisy.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 31.
Dixerunt antiqui, cauterium cum radicibus aristolochiae ad Pleuresim frigidam secundum hunc modum.	The ancients said: the cautery with roots of aristaochia is used for pleurisy in this way.
Et est, ut recipias ex radicibus aristolochiae siccae longae, radicem unam longiorem, quae ex ea inuenitur, et sit sicut grossitudo digiti.	And it is: to receive the roots of aristaochia dry, a long one, which is found in it, and make it as thick as the thickness of a finger.
Deinde submerge eam in oleo: et accende ipsam in igne.	Then immerse it in oil: and set fire to it on a fire.
Deinde cauteriza cauterio uno in eo quod est inter continuationem furculae cum collo, et duobus cauteriis paruis sub guidezi parum decliuibus ad partem, quae est sub barba.	Then cauterize with one cautery in him who is between the furrow of the fork and the neck, and two small cauteries under the chin a little inclined to the side which is under the beard.
Et duobus cauteriis etiam in eo, quod est inter costam quintam et sextam decliuibus ad posteriora parumper: et cauterio alio in medio pectoris, et alio supra stomachum.	And two cauteries also in him who is between the fifth and sixth ribs inclined to the rear a little: and one cautery also in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach.
Et tribus cauteriis a posterioribus: uno in eo quod est inter duas spatulas: et duobus cauteriis a duobus lateribus pectoris, inferius cauterio quod est inter duas spatulas.	And three cauteries from behind: one in him who is between the two claws; and two cauteries from the sides of the chest, lower cautery which is between the two claws.
Et non oportet ut comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit in manifesto cutis odorando.	And it is not necessary that you should compress your hand with the cautery, but rather let it be in plain sight on the skin smelling.
Et iam dixerunt quidam antiqui, quod ex hominibus sunt qui utuntur cauterio ex ferro simili radio: et igniunt, et intus mittunt ipsum in eo quod est inter costas, donec perueniatur cum eo ad ipsum apostema, et egrediatur sanies: sicut diximus in apostemate Epatis.	And some ancient ones have said that from men who use a cautery made of iron of similar length: and they light it, and put it inside him who is between the ribs until it reaches to the pustule, and the pus comes out: as we have said in the pustule of the liver.
Sed in hac perforatione cum cauterio est ex timore, quod aut moritur infirmus statim, aut accidit in loco fistula, cui non est sanatio.	But in this piercing with the cautery there is fear that either the weak man dies immediately or a fistula occurs in the place which does not heal.
Â¶ De modo cauterizandi Splenem Caput XXXII.	Regarding the method of cauterizing the spleen - Chapter III.
Quando tu curas aegritudinem splenis, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua, tunc cauterium in ea est secundum tres modos, qui omnes sunt recti.	When you are curing the sickness of the spleen - as we have said above in the division of the diseases - and your treatment does not help, then there are three ways of cauterizing it, all of which are correct.
Quorum unus est, ut facias tria cauteria, aut quatuor lineando secundum longitudinem splenis secundum figuram cauteriorum Epatis, quorum praecessit figura.	Of which one is that you should make three cauteries or four in a line according to the length of the spleen according to the figure of the cauteries of the liver, whose predecessor was the figure.
Et sit inter omne cauterium quantitas grossitudinis digiti, aut plus parum.	And between all the cauteries should be there an amount of gruel of a finger, or a little less.
Et sit modus cauterii, quem diximus in cauterio epatis aequaliter.	And there should be a mode of cautery  - which we have said above in the cautery of the liver  - equal.
Et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio: et sit infirmus resupinus super dorsum suum.	Do not compress your hand with the cautery  - let the sick man lie on his back.
Et modus alius de cauterizatione est: ut ignias cauterium habens duo uerua, quod diximus in capitulo dislocationis humeri: et eleua cutem, quae est in directo splenis, ubi peruenit cubitus infirmi sinister: et sit eleuatio tua qua eleuas cutem secundum latitudinem corporis, ut cadant cauteria secundum longitudinem corporis.	And another mode of cauterization is: so that the fire of the cautery has two sides, which we said in the chapter on shoulder dislocation: and dry up the skin, which is in the direct splenus, where it reaches the bed of the sick on the left: and make your elevation sit, as you dry up the skin according to the width of the body, so that the cauterization falls according to the length of the body.
Deinde intromitte duo uerua ignita ualde, donec cum eis penetres cutem a parte altera: deinde extrahe cauterium: fiunt ergo cauteria quatuor.	Then introduce two hot wands so that they penetrate the skin on both sides: then remove the fire: so that there are four cauterized places.
Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.	And if you want to cauterize with another fire having three wands.
Deinde cura cauterium postquam dimittis ipsum emittere pus diebus multis: est enim magis conferens quamque reliqua quae praecesserunt ex curatione.	Then, after you have removed the fire, if the pus is not expelled in many days: for what remains of the cure is more effective than what has gone before from the treatment.
Â¶ De modo cauterizandi in Hydropisi.	The way to cauterize in the Hydropsis.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33.
Cauterium non cadit in Hydropisi, nisi ascliti proprie.	The fire does not fall in Hydropsis unless it is raised properly.
Quando tu curas Hydropicum cum modis curationis, quos diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, et cauterio uno super stomachum, et cauterio alio super epar, et cauterio super splenem, et cauteriis duobus post dorsum inter spondiles, et uno in directo pectoris, et alio in directo stomachi: et sit quantitas profunditatis cauterii propinqua spissitudini cutis.	When you treat the Hydropsis with the methods of treatment which we have described in the division, and there is no effect from the cure, then you should cauterize four times around the navel, and once on the stomach, and once on the liver, and once on the spleen, and twice behind the vertebrae, and one on the front of the stomach, and another on the back: and make the depth of the fire approximate to the thickness of the skin.
Deinde dimitte cauterium apertum, ut emittat pus tempore longo.	Then remove the fire, so that it emits pus after a long time.
Et non euacues infirmum a curatione post cauterium cum eo: quod oportet ut aggregentur ei duae intentiones: et festinabit ad ipsum sanatio cum auxilio Dei.	And do not drink any water in which there is an infusion from the cure after cauterization with it: for two intentions should be united to it, and it will hasten to recovery with the help of God.
Forma uero cauterii cum quo cauterizatur uenter, sit clauilis: secundum quod praecessit forma eius: et illius cum quo cauterizatur dorsum, sit oliuaris secundum quod praecessit eius forma.	The form of the fire when the abdomen is cauterized, should be open: following the form which has gone before: and its form when the back is cauterized, should be round, following the form which has gone before.
Â¶ De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et Crura.	To cauterize the feet and thighs.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter 34.
Quando apostemantur in Hydropico, et replentur aqua citrina: oportet ut cauterizes super dorsum Pedis in nocrati, quae est inter auricularem et anularem: et eleua manum tuam cum cauterio, et non torqueas ipsum: deinde eleua manum tuam: et non iteres ipsum omnino.	When they are put out in the hydroptic, and become filled with yellow water; it is necessary that you should cauterize over the back of the foot in the nocrati, which is between the auricular and the ring: and wash your hand with the cautery, and do not turn it: then wash your hand: and do not return it at all.
Resudet enim aqua citrina, et sit cauterium secundum hanc formam.	For if the water becomes yellow, and the place is cauterized in this way, let the cautery be held according to this form.
Deinde fac super duo crura duo cauteria in omni crure, et fiat cauterium cum extremitate cultellari cauterii: et fiat cauterium secundum longitudinem cruris, unum sub genu, et alterum inferius eo, circiter medium cruris: et super omnem coxam cauteria duo: et dimitte cauterium apertum absque curatione tempore longo: ut resudet ex eo aliquod aquae: deinde cura ipsum cum reliquis quae diximus.	Then let two cauteries be made on the two thighs, and let the cautery be held with the edge of the knife-point of the cautery: and let the cautery be made according to the length of the leg, one under the knee, and the other below that by about a third of the way down: and let two cauteries be made on all the back; and let the cautery be left open for a long time without cura: so that it may be cured from it some water: then care for the wound with the rest that we have said.
Â¶ De modo cauterizandi in solutione Ventris.	The way to cauterize in the solution of the belly.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter 35.
Quando est solutio uentris ex frigore et humiditatibus, donec debilitet uirtutes retentiuam et digestiuam, quae sunt in stomacho et intestinis: et curatur illud cum modis curationis, et non sanatur: et uides infirmum tolerantem cauterium exuberantis uirtutis, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio magno super stomachum suum, secundum quod praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi cum cauterio circuli, et quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici subtilibus, cum cauterio clauili subtili: et cauterio super alcatin supra alhosos magno, aut duobus cauteriis.	When the belly is resolved from cold and moisture, until the virtues of retention and digestion fail, which are in the stomach and intestines: and cure it with the mode of curing, and does not heal: and you shall see a weak bearing up the exuberant power of the cure, then cauterize him with a large cautery over his stomach, according to that which preceded in the cauterization of the stomach with a circular cautery, and four small cauteries around the navel, with a sharp-edged cautery: and a large cautery over the alcatins, or two cauteries.
Et si uides humiditates exuberantes, et infirmum tolerantem illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio super pectinem, et cauterio super omne ilium: et fortasse addes duo cauteria parua super stomachum prope magnum.	And if you see the moisture exuberant, and a weak bearing that thing, then cauterize him with a cautery over the pelvis, and a cautery over all the loins: and perhaps you shall add two small cauteries next to the large one in the stomach.
Est enim curatio proficiens, cuius iuuamentum non errat.	For cure is perfect to one whose art is not at fault.
Â¶ De modo cauterizandi Hemorroidas.	The mode of cauterizing hemorrhoids.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter 36.
Quando in ano sunt Hemorroides antiquae multae, aut una, et sunt ex humoribus grossis, frigidis, aut humiditatibus corruptis, et curantur cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: tunc cauteriza tribus cauteriis super inferiorem spondilem dorsi sub almeidati parumper triangulatim, et cauterio sub umbilico quasi duobus digitis.	When there are many old hemorrhoids, or one, and they are of gross humor, cold, or corrupt humors, and they are treated with that which we have said in the division, and the cure does not take place: then cauterize three cauterizations on the lower spine of the back under an amiodia somewhat triangular, and a cauterization under the navel almost two fingers.
Et si cogitas, quod stomachus eius infrigidatus sit, et cibus eius non digeratur, et faciem eius uides apostemari, tunc cauteriza eum super stomachum cauterio magno, secundum quod praecessit: et cauterio super Epar eius, et alio super Splenem ipsius, cum cauterio clauili: et dimitte cauterium apertum tempore aliquo: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if you consider that his stomach is cold, and his food is not digested, and you see that his face is drawn, then cauterize him on the stomach with a large cautery, according to what has preceded: and cauterize on his spleen, and another on his liver, with a clove cautery: and leave the cautery open for some time: then take care of him, until he is healed.
Â¶ De modo cauterizandi althelul post abscisionem eorum.	The mode of cauterizing the arterioles after their separation.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter 37.
Quando tu abscindis althelul, tunc ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	When you separate the arterioles, then set fire to the cautery that is absorbed by radiation.
Deinde intromittite ipsum ignitum in ipsum althelul abscisum: et ultima manum tuam, donec perueniat cauterium ad orificium uenae, ex qua currit sanguis: fac illud semel, aut bis.	Then introduce the fire into the arterioles that have been separated: and with your last hand, until the cautery reaches the opening of the anus, from which runs blood: do it once, or twice.
Si ergo althelul fuerint multa, tunc cauteriza unumquodque cauterio secundum quod narrauimus.	If then there are many arterioles, then cauterize each one with a cautery, according to what we have said.
Deinde cura ea, cum eo quod confert eis ex unguentis, donec sanentur.	Then take care of them, with the ointment that is given to them, until they are healed.
Et si cauterizas eum cauterio magno super alcatin, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if you cauterize him with a large cautery on the inner side of the thigh, it is more final in its effect.
Â¶ De modo cauterizandi Fistulam in ano.	The mode of cauterizing the fistula in the anus.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter 38.
Quando non obedit infirmus sectioni et operi quod narrauimus in loco suo, et terretur ab illo, fortasse sanatur cum cauterio.	When the sick person does not submit to the section and to the operation that we have described in its place, and shudders at it, perhaps he will be healed with a cautery.
Cum ergo accidit alicui Fistula, et antiquatur, currit pus ex ea, et humiditates corruptae.	So then when anyone has a fistula, and it is old, pus runs out of it, and there are corrupted wetnesses.
Dignius ergo quod oportet est, ut probes eam cum tenta subtili.	It is worthy that you should probe it with great caution, when you try it out.
Deinde cognosce quantitatem profunditatis eius cum tenta.	Then recognize the depth of its quantity, when you try it out.
Deinde ignias cauterium, quod est simile radio.	Then set a fire as a caustic that is similar to the ray.
Deinde intromit te ipsum ignitum in ipsam Fistulam et quantitatem in qua intrauit clauus.	Then introduce yourself with fire into the fistula itself and recognize the quantity in which it enters.
Et itera super eam cauterium, donec comburantur illa omnia corpora corrupta, semel, aut bis, aut ter, secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	And repeatedly apply the caustic to her, until all those corrupt bodies are burned out, once, or twice, or three times, according to the quantity of your need.
Et custodi te ab adustione nerui, si est illic, aut uenae magnae: aut si Fistula uadit ad corpus uesicae, aut ad corpus intestini, tunc custodi te ab istis locis omnibus.	And beware of any burning of the nerve, if it is there, or of great veins: or if the fistula leads to the womb, or to the intestine, then beware of all these places.
Et non facias illud, nisi quando fistula est in loco carnoso: et cogitas, quia non est penetrans.	And do not make this unless the fistula is in a fleshy place: and think that it does not penetrate.
Deinde cura locum usquequo sanetur.	Then take care of the place until it heals.
Si autem sigillatur locus, et abscinduntur ab eo materiae, et remanet sic tempore longo: tunc scias, quia iam sanatus est integre.	But if that place is sealed, and materials are cut off from it, and remains so for a long time: then know that he has now been completely healed.
Et si non abscindunt ab eo materiae, tunc scias quia est penetrans, aut in profundo eius est os corruptum, aut quasi illud ex illis: quorum rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And if they do not cut off the materials from it, then know that it is penetrating, or that there is a corrupted opening into its depths, or something like it: whose recollection will remain in its place.
Â¶ De modo cauterizandi Renes.	The way to apply the caustic to the renal region.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter 39.
Quando accidit in Renibus dolor ex frigore, aut ex uentositate grossa, et minuitur propter illud coius infirmi, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum super almethenem super ipsos renes, cauterio super omnem renem cum cauterio clauili, cuius praecessit rememoratio.	When pain from cold or gross wind has occurred in the kidneys, and has been alleviated by lying down, then it is necessary to apply the caustic to the back above the kidneys, applying the caustic to each kidney with a claudent, whose recollection came first.
Et fortasse cauterizamus ipsum secundo in ipso almeidatu.	And perhaps we have cauterized that one again in the same place.
Quare uenient tria lineata.	Why would three lined marks be seen?
Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento.	So then they will be last in healing.
Â¶ De modo cauteritzandi Vesicam.	To cauterize the vesica.
Caput XL.	Chapter 40.
Quando accidunt in Vesica debilitas, et mollificatio a frigo re et humiditatibus, donec non retineat infirmus urinam, tunc cauteriza ipsum in inferiori parte suminis super Vesicam, ubi incipiunt pili pectinis, et cauterio a dextra suminis, et alio a sinistra illius: et sit longitudo illius cauterizationis lateris secundum quantitatem nodi pollicis: et cauteriza ipsum cauterio inferiori dorsi, aut duobus cauteriis, si indiges illo: et sit secundum quod praecessit cauterium clauile.	When weakness and softenings occur in the bladder from cold and moisture, so that the patient does not retain urine, then cauterize the affected area at the bottom of the scrotum above the bladder, where the hair begins to form a tuft, and cauterize with one instrument on the right side and another on the left: and let the length of the cauterization correspond to the length of the thumb nail: and cauterize below with two instruments if you can bear it: and let the cautery be placed according to that which came before.
Â¶ De modo cauterizandi Matricem.	The way to cauterize the uterus.
Caput XLI.	Chapter 41.
Quando accidunt in Matrice frigus et humiditates, et prohibetur per illud ab impregnatione, et corrumpuntur menstrua eius, et tardatur prouocatio eorum, et accidit ei apud aduentum eorum dolor, tunc oportet ut cauterizetur tribus cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, sicut diximus in cauterizatione uesicae, et cauterio super alcatim inferius dorso, aut duobus cauteriis: et sit cauterium clauile.	When cold and moisture occur in the uterus, and it is prevented from becoming pregnant, and her menstrual periods are interrupted, and there is a delay in the appearance of her symptoms, and pain occurs for her during intercourse, then three cauterizations should be applied around the navel as we have said in the cauterization of the bladder, and one cauterization above the hernia on the lower back, or two cauterizations: and let the cautery be placed with the claw.
Â¶ De modo cauterizandi Ancham in dislocatione.	The way to cauterize the anus in a dislocation.
Caput XLII.	Chapter 42.
Quando effunduntur humiditates mucosae ad pixidem Anchae, et fiunt caussa exitus eius a loco suo: et signum illius est, quod prolongatur crus super alterum, quando comparantur adinuicem: et inuenitur locus dislocationis in eo uacuus.	When moist secretions flow from the anus, and there is a cause for its exit at its place: its sign is that the crusts last longer on one side when they are face to face; and the site of the dislocation is found to be empty.
Oportet ergo ut cauterizes infirmum super pixidem Anchae ipsius cauterio simili circulo: postquam tu signas cum encaustro in circumitu pixidis, sicut reuoluitur: et ut cadat ipsa pixis in medio circuli.	Then let the sick person be cauterized over the anus with a similar circle of cautery: after you have noted the signs with the cauterization around the anus as it moves away: and let it fall into the middle of the circle.
Et sit cauterium cuius forma praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi.	And let the cautery, the shape of which precedes that of the cauterization of the stomach, remain.
Quod si tibi non est praesens hoc cauterium, tunc cauteriza ipsum tribus cauteriis, cum cauterio oliuari magno: et fiat cauterio profunditas secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis totius.	If this cautery is not present with you, then cauterize the person with three cauterings, with a large olive cautery: and let the depth of the cauterization correspond to the thickness of the skin all over.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then the care for him, until he is healed.
Â¶ De modo cauterizandi in Sciatica.	The way to cauterize in sciatic nerve.
Caput XLIII.	Head XXIII.
Quando accidit dolor in pixide anchae, et sunt caussa illius frigus et humiditates: et curatur infirmus cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, et antiquatur illud: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum ab humoribus grossis cum pillulis foetidis, aut cum pillulis artificialibus, et similibus.	When it happens that there is pain in the foot of the leg, and there are causes for its coldness and moisture: the sick person should be treated with him, which we have said in division, and there is no cure, and it becomes old: then it is necessary that you free the sick from gross humors with bitter pills or with artificial pills and others.
Deinde cauteriza eum.	Then cauterize him.
Et modus cauterii in ea est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, aut cauterium cum igne.	And the way of cauterization in it is according to two ways: either with cauterizing with burning medicines, or with fire.
Cauterium cum igne, est secundum multos modos.	Cauterizing with fire, is according to many ways.
Quorum unus est, ut cauterizes super pixidem anchae ipsius tribus cauteriis triangulatis, secundum hanc formam.	Of which one is, that he cauterizes over the sciatic nerve of himself three triangular cauteries, according to this form.
Et fac eis profunditatem bonam, uel malam.	And make them a good depth, or bad.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium quantitatis grossitudinis digiti: sitque cauterium oliuare.	And there should be space that is between every cautery of quantity of the finger: and there should be a cautery of olive oil.
Quandoque autem fit cauterium in medio super caput anchae ipsius.	When then it is made cautery in the middle on top of the sciatic nerve of himself.
Quare sunt quatuor cauteria.	Why are there four cauteries?
Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.	And if you want to cauterize with a circle, of which the shape that precedes in cauterizing dislocation of the sciatic nerve, one: so that it is a circle containing all the sciatica.
Et combure spissitudinem cutis totius.	And burn the spiciness of skin of the whole.
Iste est modus cauterii in Sciatica, quando dolor est adhaerens anchae ipsi, et non extenditur usque ad coxam et crus.	This is the way of cauterization in the sciatic, when the pain clings to the sciatic itself, and does not extend up to the hip and the thigh.
Si autem extenditur usque ad coxam et crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis super coxam, super locum ad quem innuit illic infirmus, in quo est dolor, et cauterio tuo super cauillam quatuor digitis ad partem syluestrem parumper: et sit cauterium cultellare.	But if it extends up to the hip and the thigh, then cauterize him with two cauteries on top of the hip, on the place where the pain is, and cauterize your own with a knife four-finger wide towards the back side slightly: and let the cautery be a scalpel.
Et sit profunditas cauterii secundum profunditatem spissitudinis cutis.	And let the depth of the cautery be according to the depth of spiciness of skin.
Quod si infirmus innuit quod dolor extenditur usque prope digitos pedis, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic ubi innuit cum cauterio puncti, tribus, aut quatuor, aut pluribus, si indiget illo.	If the patient complains that the pain extends to near the toes, then cauterize him at that place with the cautery of a point, triangle, or square, or more, if he needs it.
Et si innuit dolorem esse sub genu uersus crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic cauterio uno cultellari.	And if he complains of pain under the knee towards the thigh, then cauterize him there with one knife cut.
Et caue tibi in omni cauterizatione tua, ut non ultimes cum cauterio ad hoc ut comburas neruum, aut arteriam magnam, et attrahas per illud super infirmum nocumentum malum, aut contractionem.	And let your cautery be so that you do not end up with the cautery on this [part of the body] so that it burns nerves, or a large artery, and does not pull [the flesh] out through it for a bad injury, or contraction.
Et ego quidem iam uidi unum et alium, ex eis qui cauterizauerunt supra cauillam, et ultimauerunt in cauterizatione, et inflatum est crus, donec tumor consecutus est pedem, et perforatus est totus, et corruptus est totus pes: deinde accidit solutio uentris, et mors post illud.	And I have seen one and the other who cauterized above the knee, and finished the cautery, and the thigh blew up until the tumor was joined to the foot, and it waså¨é¨ç©¿å­ï¼åå®å¨èçï¼ç¶ååçè§£è±é£ï¼ç¶åæ¯æ­»äº¡ã
Quod si dolor est in duabus partibus simul, cauteriza utramque secundum hunc modum.	If the pain is in two parts at the same time, cauterize each one according to this way.
Et sapientes quidam dixerunt in cauterizatione anchae, cuius cauterii iste est modus.	And some wise men said about this method of cautery:
Fac simile samio ex ferro, cuius diametrus sit medietas palmi: et sit apud orificium suum secundum grossitudinem nuclei dactyli, aut minus parumper: et intra illud samium sit samium tertium.	Make a similar cut from iron, whose diameter is half of the palm's diameter: and it should be at the opening of its finger according to the size of the finger nail, or less [than that]: and inside this small one there should be another small one.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne samium per quantitatem nodi pollicis: et sint samia aperta a duabus partibus: et sit altitudo eorum quasi nodus, aut duo nodi: et fac eis manubrium ex ferro decenter aptatum in samiis.	And there should be a space between each small one according to the quantity of the thumb nail: and the slits on both sides should be: and their height should be almost like a knot, or two knots: and let them make handgrips out of iron that is off-center in the slits.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is his form.
Deinde igniatur in igne, donec rubeat, et proiiciat scintillas: deinde ponatur super pixidem anchae infirmo accubitato super latus sanum.	Then let it be ignited in fire until it turns red and drops sparks: then let it be placed on a plate of paste over the patient lying down on the sound side.
Cauteriza ergo eum tribus cauteriis rotundis in uice una.	Then cauterize him with three round cauteries in one line.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then let go of him after three days.
Postea emplastra cum butyro: et dimitte uulnus apertum diebus multis.	Then paste with butter: and leave the broken bone open for many days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for himself with ointment, until he is healed.
Inquit Albucasis, hac specie cauterii o filii, parum usi sumus, propter terrorem aspectus eius: et propterea, quod paucos inuenimus qui expectent super ipsum.	Says Albucasis, with this species of cautery on his son, we little use, because of the terror of the appearance: and therefore, since we have few who wait on him.
Verumtamen est ex bonis cauteriis ei qui suffert, et inuenit cum eo locum eius.	Indeed it is from good cauterizations that he suffers, and remains with him at his place.
Cauterium autem cum medicinis adurentibus est, ut tu facias duo samia habentia perforatam armillam, in quam descendit cardo portae eius ex aere, aut ferro, longitudo parietis: quorum in altitudinem eorum sint duo nodi, aut quasi ipsi.	But the cautery when they have the doctors present, so that you make two holes in which comes down the pin of his door from bronze, or iron, the length of his walls: whose height are the two knots, or almost themselves.
Et sit spacium quod est inter utraque quantitas grossitudinis digiti, et sint aperta inferius et superius: et sit quod contineant se adinuicem, secundum hanc formam.	And let there be a space that is between each the quantity of grossness of a finger, and may be open lower and upper: and may contain itself on both sides, according to this form.
Deinde depone eam super pixidem anchae, infirmo iacente super latus sanum.	Then put it on top of a pan of clay, the sick lying on the sound side.
Et comprime manum tuam super pixidem anchae multum.	And compress your hand over the pan of clay much.
Deinde funde inter duos circulos ex aqua calida, quae sit calefacta cum igne parumper, et tene eam quantitate horae temporalis: et toleret infirmus mordicationem eius, et ipsius adustionem, nam ipse inuenit mordicationem sicut ignis, donec quiescat mordicatio.	Then pour between the two circles of hot water, which is warmed with fire just a little, and hold it for a quantity of time: and may the sick bear the mordication, and his own burning, because he finds the mordication like fire, until he is quiet.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento, et absterge aquam calidam ab ancha tota cum aqua dulci: deinde dimitte illud tribus diebus.	Then wash your hand with an instrument, and wipe off the hot water from all entirely with sweet water: then leave it for three days.
Et pone super illud butyrum, donec remoueatur nigredo adustionis: et dimitte illud diebus aliquot, et curret ex eo pus.	And put on top of it butter, until the blackness of burning moves away: and leave it for a few days, and let run out from it pus.
Est enim ultimum in iuuamento.	It is indeed the latest in healing.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for that with ointment, until he is healed.
Quod si extendatur dolor usque ad coxam, aut crus: fac ei statuam in eo quod continet aquam, secundum quod fecisti in ancha aequaliter.	That if the pain extends to the hip, or leg: let him have a standing in it that holds water, according to what you did on the broad one.
Et iste est modus aquae calidae: et ego iam scripsi eam in tractatu rectificationis medicinarum.	And this is the method for hot and cold water: I have already written about it in my treatise on rectifying medicines.
Sume alcali, et calcis non extinctae amborum ana partem unam: tere utraque, et pone ea in ollam nouam, cuius inferior pars sit perforata foramine uno paruo, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum radius: et pone sub fundo ollae ollam aliam uitreatam: et proiice super alcali et calcem ex aqua dulci, quod submergat utraque per digitum: post quam tu comprimas ea manu tua compressione bona: et dimite ollam, donec descendat aqua acuta inferiori parte ollae uitreatae.	Take the alkaline and put a part of it with the unextinguished calceum together in one half of a new jar whose lower part has a small hole; add the quantity needed for the medicine to the other half: then put the second half under the bottom of the jar; pour clean water on the alkaline and calceum, which should submerge both by finger depth; after that, compress them with your hand well; then set aside the jar until the sharp water in the lower part of the jar has dropped.
Deinde aggrega illam aquam totam, et proiice eam super aliam calcem: et cola, donec renouetur.	Then mix all together, and pour it over the other calceum; and set aside, until it has congealed again.
Ipsa enim erit tunc fortis acuitatis ualde, quae administratur in multis operationibus medicinae, et in cauterizatione reliquorum membrorum.	For this will then be very strong in sharpness, which is given to it in many medicinal operations, and in the cauterization of the remaining members.
Quoniam efficit operationem ignis ipsius.	Since it makes an effective operation through its own fire.
Et ex medicinis sunt, cum quibus cauterizantur ancha, etiam sicut tesisie, et mel anacardi, et calx cum sapone, ita quod utraque sint permixta. Â¶	And from the medicines are, with which they cauterize wide areas, also like thalidomyne, and honey of oak, and calcine mixed with soap, so that both are mixed together.
Et Galenus quidem narrando retulit, cuiusdam uiri ex antiquis curationem, qua curatus est dolor anchae et uenae sciaticae: et magnificauit esse eius ualde.	And Galen himself has told us that a certain man from ancient times, who was cured of the pain of the ankle and sciatica, said that it was very effective.
Et dixit, quia non indiguit alia curatione, et quia sanatus est ex uice una, donec retulit, quia ipse fortasse intrauit balneum delatus, et exiuit ex eo iam sanus.	And he said that he did not prefer any other cure, and that he was cured from one joint only, until he told us, that perhaps he entered a relaxing bath and came out already well.
Et est, ut accipiatur ex seitaragi uiridi: et si non inuenitur uiride, sumatur siccum, recens: et teratur multum cum aliquanto adipe, et ponatur super ancham, ubi est dolor, aut crus, aut in coxa: et ligetur, et dimittatur quantitate trium horarum, aut per quantitatem quod sentiat infirmus sedationem adustionis.	And this is how to take the oil from the seed of the wild carrot; and if it cannot be found, it is collected like this: with a little fat, and put on the ankle where there is pain, or in the groin, or in the thigh: bind it, and leave it for a few hours, or as much as the sick person feels tired from the heat.
Deinde intromitte eum in balneum.	Then introduce him to the bath.
Cum ergo roridum fit corpus eius, intromitte ipsum in solium.	When his body therefore begins to feel hot, introduce him into the bath.
Nam dolor recedit, et sanatur.	For the pain has subsided and he is healed.
Et scias, quia non oportet ut utatur aliquis cauterio cum istis medicinis, nisi post euacuationem corporis.	And you should know that it is not necessary to use any medicine on these patients unless after they have been evacuated.
Et Dioscorides qui dem dixit, quod stercus caprarum, quando cum eo cauterizatur uena sciatica, confert ei: et fit cauterium secundum hunc modum.	And Dioscurides, who said that when cow dung is applied as a lotion to the sciatic pain it will heal: and it becomes a lotion in this way.
Sumatur lana, et imbibatur oleo antiquo, et ponatur super locum profundum, qui est inter pollicem pedis, et inter focile, et est propinquior focili.	The wool is dried, and old oil is absorbed, and it is placed on a deep place, which is between the thumb of the foot and the heel, and it is closer to the heel.
Deinde accipe stercus caprarum siccum, et inflamma ipsum in igne, donec fiat carbo.	Then take cow dung dried up, and add old oil, and set it on fire, until it becomes a coal.
Deinde pone ipsum super lanam, et dimitte ipsum, donec extinguatur.	Then put the coal on the wool and leave it, until it is extinguished.
Deinde itera illud.	Then repeat this.
Non cesses ergo facere illud, usquequo perueniat sensus super mediatione usque ad ancham, et quiescat dolor.	Do not therefore cease to do this, until the sense of touch reaches up to the middle, and the pain rests.
Et iste modus cauterii nominatur cauterium Vaccinum.	And this method of cauterization is called Vaccine Cautery.
Â¶ De cauterizatione doloris Dorsi.	Â§ On the cauterization of back pain.
Caput XLIIII.	Head 44.
Quandoque accidit dolor in Dorso ex caussis multis, aut a casu, aut a percussione, aut euacuatione superflua, et illis similibus, ex infusione materiei frigidae, et humidae: et cauterium quidem non cadit, nisi in hac specie sola, quae fit ex infusione materiei frigidae.	When back pain occurs for various reasons, or from a cause, or from a blow, or from excessive discharge (of the fluid), and such like; but the cauterization is not performed unless it is done in this way alone, which is made by an infusion of cold material.
Oportet ergo post euacuationem infirmi cum pillulis foetidis, et eis similibus, ut fiant super Dorsum, ubi est dolor, tres lineae secundum latitudinem almeidati ipsius, postquam signas cum encaustro in omni linea quinque cauteria, aut plura secundum quantitatem quae uenit ex tolerantia infirmi uirtute eius: et fiat cauterizatio cum cauteriopuncti.	Therefore after the discharge of nurses with feeble pills, and such like, that they may be placed on the back, where there is pain, three lines are drawn in the width of the alme (the spine), and then, having marked the line with caustice, five cauterizations or more are made according to the quantity which comes from the power of the nurse: and let the cauterization be made with a cautery-é.
Et si uis, cauteriza tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor, cum cauterio clauili mediali, secundum hanc formam.	And if you want, make three cauterizations or four with the cautery-é, following this form.
Â¶ De modo cauterizandi in incaeptine Gibbositatis.	To cauterize in incised wound of gibbosity.
Caput XLV.	Chapter LXV.
Multotiens accidit haec aegritudo infantibus paruis.	This disease frequently occurs in infants.
Et signum incaeptionis eius in pueris est: quod accidit super eum strictura in anhelitu apud eleuationem, et motum: et inuenis in ultima spondilium Dorsi et nodorum eius, quod iam incaepit eminere super reliquos spondiles.	And the sign of its incipient beginning in boys is this: for it comes upon him a stricture in the loins during defecation, and movement, and swelling at the last spine of the back and the knotted joints, which have already begun to protrude above the other spines.
Cum ergo uides illud, et uis facere illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio quod sit circulus secundum hanc formam.	So when you see this, and if you are able to do so, then cauterize it with a cauldron, since it is in the form of a circle.
Et capiat cauterium super omnem partem spondilis aequaliter: et si uis cauteriza in circumitu spondilis cum cauterio puncti duas lineas, aut tres: et sint puncta propinqua adinuicem.	And he takes the cauldron over all the spine equally: and if you wish to cauterize around the spine with a cauldron of two or three dots: and the dots are close to one another.
Deinde cura locum, donec sanetur cum eo quod diximus.	Then care for the place, until it heals well with him that we have said.
Et caue, ne administres cauterium in gibbositate, quae fit in spasmo nerui.	And do not administer the cauldron to gibbosity, which occurs in a spasm of a nerve.
Â¶ De modo cauterizandi in Podagra, et doloribus iuncturarum.	The way to cauterize for gout, and joint pains.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter LXVI.
Quando dolores iuncturarum sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, quae effunduntur ad cuiuslibet membra corporis, tunc quando accidunt dolores in pedibus, de consuetudine medicorum est, ut nominent illud Podagram proprie.	When the pains of joint-trouble are due to cold moistures that spread to any member of the body, then when pains occur in the feet, it is the custom of physicians to call it "Podagra" properly.
Cum ergo curatur Podagra frigidae caussae cum modis curationis, et non remouentur dolores, tune cauterium remouet eos.	So when this "Podagra" due to cold is cured by the usual methods of treatment, and the pains do not recur, then remove them with the cauldron.
Et est, ut cauterizes eum post euacuationem in circumitu iuncturae pedum, cauteriis multis: et sit cauterium Oliuare.	And it is as though it cauterized him after evacuation around the joint of the feet with many caulers: and let the cauler be Oleum.
Cuius haec est forma.	This is its form.
Et si indiges ut punctes super faciem pedis, tunc fac cum cauterio puncti.	And if you can tolerate it so that the dots on the face of the foot do not bother you, then let them be with a dot of cauldron.
Quod si ascendunt dolores usque ad genua, aut reliquas iuncturas, et multotiens accidit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super omne genu tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor ab omni parte, cum hoc eodem cauterio Clauili.	That if they ascend to the knees or other joints and often occur: then cauterize him over all the knees with three caulers, or four from every part, with this same cauldron of Clavius.
Si autem necessaria sunt tibi plura hoc cauterio, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	But if you need more of this medicine, then cauterize him.
Et non submergas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit circiter spissitudinem cutis tantum.	And don't submerge your hand with the cauterizing fluid, but rather let it be surrounded by the thickness of the skin alone.
Si autem ascendunt dolores ad genua, et dorsum: tunc administra quod diximus ex cauterio in capitulo suo.	But if the pains rise to the knees and back: then administer what we said about the cauterizing fluid in its own chapter.
Quod si dolores sunt in manibus tantum, tunc puncta in circumitu focilium, sicut reuoluuntur duae lineae.	That if the pains are only in the hands, then prick around the joints with fire, as they run in two lines.
Si autem remanet ex doloribus in digitis, tunc puncta eos, super omnem nodum punctum, et super pectinem manus.	But if the remaining pain is in the fingers, then prick them, over every knot a dot, and over the palm of the hand.
Si autem ascendunt dolores post dies ad cubitos, aut ad humeros, tunc cauteriza utrosque ab omni parte.	But if the pains rise after days to the elbows, or to the shoulders, then cauterize both from every part.
Et non euacues infirmum ex regimine bono, ex recaeptione medicinarum.	And don't let a sick person recover from good treatment, or receive medicine again.
Nam si bonum fiat regimen, et euacuetur phlegma, sanabitur auxilio Dei cum isto cauterio.	For if the regimen is made good, and the phlegm is drained, it will be healed with the help of God by this cauterizing fluid.
Â¶ De modo cauterizandi in Rupturis.	On the Mode of Cauterizing in Ruptures.
Caput XLVII.	Head 57.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, et descendit intestinum, aut zirbum ad testiculum, et est illud incipiens propinquum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo dimittere comestionem in die suo.	When a rupture occurs in the groin, and descends the intestines, or touches the testicle, and it begins to come near: then you should order the sick person to dismiss his food on that day of its own accord.
Et utatur ex lenientibus, quo descendat stercus a uentre suo.	And let him use laxatives, so that the feces may descend from his bowels.
Deinde sedeat inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et praecipe ei, ut teneat anhelitum suum, donec egrediatur, uel appareat zirbum, aut intestinum.	Then have him sit between your hands on his back: and order him to hold his breath, until he emerges, or shows the testicle, or the intestines.
Deinde reduc ipsum digitis tuis, et signa cum encaustro sub Ruptura super os pectinis, cum signo cuius extremitas sit similis medietati circuli ad superiora corporis.	Then reduce him with your fingers, and mark with a caustice under the rupture over the top of the spine, with a mark whose extremity is like the middle of a circle to the upper part of the body.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma, donec ueniat album, et proiiciat seintillas.	Then set fire to the cauterizing fluid, whose form this is, until it becomes white, and let it spurt drops.
Deinde reduc intestinum, aut zirbum ad concauitatem suam.	Then reduce the intestines, or the testicle to its concavity.
Deinde ponat minister manum suam super locum, ut non exeat intestinum: et tu iam aperuisti inter crura infirmi, et posuisti sub eo puluinar, et seruiens alius super crura eius, et alius super pectus eius qui tenet manus.	Then let the assistant place his hand on the spot so that it does not move out of the intestine: and you have already opened between the ribs of the patient, and placed underneath him a towel, and one servant serves behind his ribs, and another over his chest who holds the hands.
Deinde depone cauterium super ipsum signum, manu tua cum cauterio stante recta.	Then put the caustic on the spot with your hand holding it steady.
Et tene ipsum, donec cum eo consequaris os: aut itera cum eo uice alia, si non consecutus fueris cum eo in prima usque ad os.	And hold him, until you make him follow with his jaw: or else repeat with him a different push, if you do not succeed with him in the first place up to the mouth.
Et prudenter obserua ab exitu intestini in hora cauterizationis tuae, ne comburas ipsum, et eueniat per illud super infirmum aut mors, aut malicia magna.	And carefully observe that at the time of your caustic there is no exit of the intestine, so that you do not burn it and it comes out through it onto the sick or a great disease.
Et scias, quod quando tu non consequeris cum cauterio os, non confert operatio tua.	And know that when you do not succeed with your caustic in making a hole in the mouth, your operation is of no avail.
Et oportet ut sit cauterium infantium subtile, secundum mensuram eorum.	And it should be that the caustic for infants is subtle, according to their measure.
Deinde cura cum reliquis unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care with the rest of the ointment, until he heals.
Et sit infirmus iacens super dorsum suum quadraginta diebus, donec sigilletur uulnus.	And let the sick person lie on his back for forty days, until the wound is closed.
Et oportet, ut ponas nutrimentum eius longitudine temporis curationis eius, quod leniat uentrem eius: ut non exeat intestinum apud conamen et egestionem.	And it should be that you put for him food according to the length of his cure, which relaxes his stomach: so that he does not lose the intestine by straining and vomiting.
Deinde quando uult surgere post quadraginta dies, tunc administra ligamentum decenter factum, et teneat ipsum quadraginta diebus aliis.	And when he wants to get up after forty days, then give him a loosely made bandage, and let him wear it for another forty days.
Et minoretur a labore, et repletione cibi et potus, et uocibus uehementibus.	And let him rest from work, and be filled with food and drink, and loud speeches.
Nam quando utitur hoc regimine, ita sanatur sanatione integra.	For when he uses this regimen, he heals by a whole healing.
Et ego dicam curationem Rupturarum cum incisione in capitulo suo.	And I will tell you the cure of ruptures with an incision in its chapter.
Quando autem Rupturae accidunt in reliquo uentre, et sunt incipientes, et uis ut non addantur, tunc cauteriza Rupturam eius cauterio rotundo secundum quantitatem eius: et sit illud quod aduritur ex tunc sicut tertia eius.	When, however, ruptures occur in the rest of the udder, and they are beginning to develop, and do not add to them, then cauterize the rupture of his caustic round according to its quantity: and let it be as if it were burnt from then on like the third one.
Deinde cura ipsum, cum eo quod diximus: et non addetur.	Then care for himself, as we have said: and do not add to it.
Et iam dixerunt quidam primi: ut cauterizetur Ruptura cum cauterio triangulato, secundum hanc formam.	And others first said: that it be cauterized with a triangular cautery, according to this form.
Postquam signatur cum encaustro, et ponitur linea quae est per latitudinem in latere superiori Rupturae, et linea altera ad inferius.	Afterwards sign it withencaustum, and place a line which is of the width of a finger on the back upper part of the Ruptura, and another line to the lower side.
Et depone manum tuam in medio cum cauterio clauili.	And place your hand in the middle with the cautery clØ§ÙÛ.
Sed cauterium primum est facilius et melius.	But the cautery first is easier and better.
Â¶ De modo cauterizandi in doloribus propter casum, aut percussionem.	The way of cauterizing in pains because of a fall, or a blow.
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter LVIII.
Quando accidit in quibusdam membris a casu, aut percussione dolor: et perseuerat ille dolor tempore longo, et non confert in eo curatio cum medicinis: tunc oportet ut cauterizetur cum cauterio Puncti.	When it happens in some member with a fall, or a blow; and that pain persiste for a long time, and does not respond to treatment with medicines: then it should be cauterized with a Pointed cautery.
Et sit cauterium omnis membri cauterium secundum magnitudinem eius, et ipsius paruitatem, et debilitatem eius, et ipsius uirtutem, et locationem torsionis, et doloris ex eo.	And let the cautery be of the size of the member, and its health, and its weakness, and its strength, and its location, and the pain from it.
Si ergo sanatur ex cauterio primo, est bene.	But if he is healed with the first cauterization, then it is good.
Si non: tunc itera super ipsum cauterium.	If not: then repeat on top of the same cautery.
Quoniam de consuetudine horum dolorum est, ut permutentur ex membro ad illud quod appropinquat ei.	For the custom of these pains is that they should change from one member to another as it approaches that which it affects.
Quare oportet ut consequaris eos cum cauterio, donec sanetur infirmus.	Why it should be necessary to make them follow those with a cautery, until the sick is healed.
Â¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lepra.	The way of cauterizing in leprosy:
Caput XLIX.	Chapter LIX.
Leprosi autem quandoque iuuantur cauterio iuuamento maximo.	But the leprous ones are to be cauterized with a big cautery.
Et praecipue species Leprae, quae fit propter putrefactionem phlegmatis et melancholiae: cum ergo uis cauterizare ipsam considera.	And especially the type of leprosy which is due to putrefaction of phlegmas and melancholy; when then you consider the skin as it concerns the cauterization.
Si ergo Lepra est ineipiciens, et curasti eam cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non descendit, neque stat: et times super infirmum, quod comprehendat corruptio super totam complexionem eius: tunc cauteriza eum super caput quinque cauteriis: uno in medio capitis noto, et secundo inferius eo uersus frontem apud finem capillorum, et duobus super duo cornua, et uno posterius super nucea ceruicis.	If then leprosy is not resistant to the treatment which we have said in the division, and has not descended, nor stayed in place: and if it times on the sick part, which comprehends corruption all over its complexion: then cauterize him over the head with five cauteries: one on the middle of the hairline, and a second lower towards the front at the end of the hair, and two on either side, and one behind the ear on the cheek.
Et ultima manum tuam cum cauterio parumper, donec imprimat in os impressionem paruam, et dislocentur ex eo cortices: ut alleuietur expiratio uaporum grossorum ex eo, et cauteriza cauterio etiam super ipsum splenem, secundum quod praecessit.	And last, with your hand and cautery, until it has impressed in the nose a purple mark, and the membranes are dislocated from it; so that the expiration of the steam of the great lungs may be relieved, and the cautery also on the spleen, as it had preceded.
Sin autem Lepra iam sparsa est super infirmum, et apparet manifeste: tunc oportet ut cauterizes cum istis cauteriis, quae diximus in capite, et cauterio super extremitatem nasi, et duobus cauteriis super duas maxillas, et duobus cauteriis super spondiles colli, et sex super spondiles dorsi, et uno magno super alhahosos apud gran caudae et uno supra ipsum, in ipso almeidati: et duobus super anchas: scilicet super omnem ancham uno, et duobus super genua: uno super omne genu, et duobus super humeros, et duobus super cubitos, et duobus super teneritudines pectoris sui: et cauteriza ipsum super omnem iuncturam, ex iuncturis digitorum manuum suarum, et pedum suorum: et cauteriza super omnem calcaneum pedum suorum, et focilia manuum suarum.	But if the leprosy has already spread over the sick person and appears clearly; then it is necessary to make the following cautery with these very cauteries which we have said in the head, and a cautery on the tip of the nose, and two cauteries on the two cheeks, and two cauteries on the two neck joints, and six on the spine of the back, and one large one at the base of the tail and one above it: and two on the shoulders, and two on the elbows, and two on the breasts, and a cautery on the whole body from the joints of the fingers of his hands and feet: and a cautery on each heel of his feet, and tiny pieces of flesh from the knuckles of his hands and feet: and a cautery on each heel of his feet, and small pieces of flesh from the knuckles of his hands and feet: and a cautery on each elbow joint, and two cauteries on each shoulder, and two cauteries on the two breasts, and one large cautery on the spleen.
Et caue tibi a neruis qui sunt super postremum calcanei, ut non comburas eos.	And let there be a nervy thread over the very heel of your foot, so that you do not burn them.
Et quandoque cauterizatur cauterio super os pectinis, et alio super os stomachi, et alio super epar.	And when one is cauterized with a cautery on the top of the chest bone, and another on the stomach bone, and another on the liver.
Et scias, quod quanto plus addis cauterium, est magis iuuamentum, et magis conferens.	And you must know that whatever amount of cautery you use, it is more helpful, and gives greater relief.
Et scias, quod infirmus non inuenit in cauterio dolorem, sicut inueniunt ipsum sani: propterea, quod corpus eius iam stupefactum est.	And you must know that the sick person does not feel pain in the cautery, as he feels it when he is healthy: for this reason his body has already become numb.
Et oportet ut sint cauteria ex magnitudine, et paruitate secundum membra et iuncturas: secundum quod praecessit ex speciebus ferramentorum.	And let the cauteries be of the same size and shape as the joints and members: since it has preceded in the appearance of the instruments.
Deinde cura cauterium ex farina herbi cum melle, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for the cauteries with flour of herbs mixed with honey, and with other cure; until he is healed.
Â¶ De modo cauterizandi in Stupore.	To cauterize while unconscious.
Caput L.	Head.
Quando stupet aliquod membrum, et curatur cum medicinis, et oleis, et emplastris, et non sanatur, tunc cauteriza ipsum membrum stupefactum cauteriis, secundum quod meretur magnitudo membri, aut paruitas eius.	When a limb is numb and does not respond to medicines, oils, plasters, or poultices, then cauterize the limb with cautery, according as the magnitude of the limb is great, or its smallness.
Et sit cauterium tuum intrans in spissitudinem cutis parumper.	And place your cautery instrument a little way into the depth of the skin.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for the limb with ointment until it heals.
Et quandoque cauterizatur ad quiddam stuporis, qui accidit manui, et pedi, in spondilibus dorsi apud exitum neruorum, qui mouent illud membrum: et remouetur stupor.	And sometimes cauterization is done to a certain numbness that occurs in the hand or foot, at the exit of nerves that move that limb: and the numbness disappears.
Verum non praesumat super illud, nisi qui est sapiens in anatomia membrorum, et egressione neruorum mouentium corpus.	But do not do it too much, unless one is knowledgeable in the anatomy of limbs, and knows that the nerves that move the body depart from its members.
Â¶ De modo cauterizandi in Albaras.	The method of cauterizing while unconscious.
Caput LI.	Head.
Quando antiquatur Albaras, et non confert in eo aliquid ex ingeniis medicinae: tunc cauteriza super ipsam cauterio profundo parumper, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis, donec remoueatur albedo, et mutetur color eius.	When Albucasis is burned and does not respond to any of the medical techniques: then place a little deep cautery on top of it, according to the thickness of the skin, until the complexion changes and its color is changed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum farina herbi, et lentis cum oleo rosa, et foliis arnoglossae, et sanguine columbae, et sanguine hyrundinis: de unoquoque sit pars una: misceantur haec omnia, et liniantur super pannum, et adhaereant loco, donec sanetur.	Then care for the limb with herb flour, and oil of roses, and leaves of argloche, and pigeon blood, and duck blood: make a part of each one: mix these all together, and spread them on a cloth, and let them stick to a place until they heal.
Â¶ De modo cauterizandi in Cancro.	The method of cauterizing while unconscious in the case of cancer.
Caput LII.	Head.De modo si qua est, quod non praesumat
Quando Cancer est incipiens, et uis ipsum sistere: tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio circuli in circuitu eius, sicuti reuoluitur.	When the cancer is beginning and the eye must be removed: then cauterize the eye with a circle of cautery around it, as it turns.
Sapientes autem dixerunt, ut cauterizetur cauterio ultimo in medio.	But the wise have said that the last cautery in the middle should be used.
Mihi autem non uidetur illud: quoniam timeo quod ulceretur: et ego iam uidi illud aliquotiens.	But for me, I do not see this: because I am afraid that it will ulcerate: and indeed, I have seen it a few times.
Et rectius est, ut cauterizetur in circumitu eius cum circulo, sicut diximus: aut cauteriis multis.	And it is better to cauterize around it with a circle, as we have said: or to use multiple cauterizations.
Â¶ De modo cauterizandi in Adubelati.	The way to cauterize in Adubelati.
Caput LIII.	Chapter LIII. On the way to cauterize in Adubel
Quando aliquis habet Adubelati, et tardatur in maturatione, aut propter superfluitatem facientem eam, aut propter aetatem infirmi, quando est decrepitus pauci sanguinis, aut propter tempus, et uis festinare in maturatione Adubelati, tunc cauteriza in circumitu eius cum cauteriis paruis multis punctando.	When anyone has Adubelati and is delayed in maturation, or does it for the sake of superfluous doing, or because of old age, when he is feeble with little blood, or because of time, and the vein festers in maturation of Adubelati, then cauterize around it with small cautery punctures.
Deinde dimitte eam.	Then let go of it.
Nam ipsa festinabit cum maturatione.	For it will hurry with its maturation.
Si autem uis perforationem eius cum cauterio, tunc igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma.	But if you pierce its vein with a cautery, then take this form of fire.
Et depone ipsum in medio Adubelati, donec penetret cutem: et sit cauterium ab eo quod sequitur infirmus, ut alleuietur cursus puris.	And place it in the middle of Adubelati until it penetrates the skin: and let the cautery follow it, so that the course of the blood may be eased.
Deinde cura ipsum donec sanetur.	Then care for the person until he is healed.
Â¶ De modo cauterizandi in malo corrodente.	The way to cauterize in a badè
Caput LIIII.	Chapter LIIIII. On the way to cauterize in a badè
Corrodens non est nisi corruptio in membro ambulans, et corrodit ipsum: sicut ignis comedit ligna sicca.	Which is not but corruption in a walking member, and corrupts itself: as fire devours dry wood.
Si ergo uides corrodentem in loco qui toleret cauterium cum igne, tunc igni cauteria multa, clauilia parua et magna, secundum quod conueniet illi loco in quo est corrodens.	But if you see corrosion in a place that accepts cautery with fire, then take many small and large fire cautery tools, according to what suits it in the place where the corrosion is.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum ab omni parte donec eradices corruptionem totam, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid penitus.	Then cauterize the person from all parts until you eradicate the whole corruption, and do not leave anything of it within.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio.	Then let go of the person for three days, and place sulfur powder with oil on the cauterized places, until all the escharas are eradicated, and all corruption.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis generantibus carnem.	Then care for the person with poultices generating flesh.
Si ergo uides, quod post tres dies caro nascitur natiuitate sana, in qua non est corruptio, est bonum.	But if you see that after three days the flesh is born healthy, and there is no corruption, it is good.
Et si non: tunc itera cauterium super illud quod remansit ex locis corruptis.	Then repeat the cautery on the remaining corrupted places.
Et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.	And the corrosion is healed when it is treated with sharp medicine.
Ipsa namque surgit loco cauterii.	She herself rises up at the place of cauterization.
Verumtamen cauterium cum igne est uelocioris iuuamenti: et ego quidem iam dixi cauterizationem eius cum medicina acuta in diuisione: accipe ergo eam illic quando ea indiges.	Indeed, the cauterization is faster with fire: and I myself have already said that the cauterization of her with sharp medicine is in division: so accept it there when she is hungry.
Â¶ De modo cauterizandi in Clauis, et Verucis.	On the Mode of Causing a Wound to Heal Faster
Caput LV.	Head L.V.
Multotiens accidit in inferioribus partibus pedum haec aegritudo: et est res grossa, filtrata, quae laedit pedem.	This illness often occurs in the lower parts of the legs: and it is a coarse, filtered, which hurts the leg.
Et cauterium quidem in eis est secundum duos modos: cauterium cum igne, et cauterium cum aqua calida.	And there are two ways of cauterizing them: cauterizing with fire, and cauterizing with hot water.
Quantum autem cum igne est, ut ignias cauterium concauum simile pennae uulturis: quod fiat ex ferro, secundum quantitatem quod contineat clauum ab omni parte: et sit subtilium marginum.	How much, then, is it with fire, so that the flames of the cauterization are similar to the feathers of a torch: which is to be made from iron, according to the quantity that it contains a seam from all parts: and let the margin be subtle.
Deinde depone ipsum ignitum super clauum.	Then, place the burned thing on the seam.
Deinde reuolue manum cum cauterio in circumitu claui, donec perueniat cauterium ad profunditatem claui: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, donec incipiat emittere pus.	Then, rotate the hand with the cauterization around the seam, until the cauterization reaches the depth of the seam: and leave it for three days, until the discharge of pus begins.
Deinde emplastra ipsum cum maluis syluestribus, contritis cum sale: et dimitte emplastrum super ipsum in nocte.	Then, wrap the burned thing with silk threads, crumpled up with salt: and leave the emplastrum on the burned thing during the night.
Ipse enim eradicabitur ex radicibus suis.	For it will itself be rooted out from its roots.
Deinde cura locum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then, care for the place with a generation of flesh ointment, until it heals.
Quod si sunt non conuersi, et multotiens accidunt in superficie corporis, praecipue in manibus et pedibus: tunc administres in eis cauterium cum aqua calida: et est, ut accipias cannulam ex aere, aut ferro, aut ex penna uulturis: et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul.	If they are not turned around, and often happen on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet: then administer to them cauterization with hot water: and it is as if you receive a tube from iron, or steel, or a torch feather: and place it on the seam, or let it run.
Deinde proiice in cannulam ex aqua calida quantitatem paucam: retine manum tuam, et tu reuolue eam cum compressione manus tuae parumper, ut imprimatur margo cannulae in radice claui, et inueniat aqua calida uiam ad profundum, ad radicem claui: et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una.	Then, pour into the tube a little hot water: hold your hand, and rotate it gently so that the margin of the tube is imprinted on the base of the seam, and there is hot water in sight to the depth, to the root: and let the sick person wait a little while during the tickle of the hot water.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, nam clauus eradicatur cum radicibus suis.	Then let go of him, for the clavicle is cut off with its roots.
Ita fac cum eis uno post unum, donec uenias super omnes qui ex eis sunt in corpore.	So do unto them as you would have them do unto you; for that is the law and the prophets.
Deinde cura eos postquam eradicantur, cum eo quod generat carnem ex unguentis.	Then be mindful of them after they are cut off, with those who go out from among them in the body.
Â¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tremore.	Â§ On the mode of cauterizing in tremor.
Caput LVI.	Chapter LVI.
Quando accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in neruo, aut ex febre quartana, aut alio: tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis, aut quinque super spondiles dorsi, et inter omnem spondilem cauterio, et in pectore eius cauterio, et super stomachum eius cauterio.	When it happens to someone that there is tremor due to cold in a nerve, or due to quartan fever, or from another cause: then one should cauterize the part four times, or five on top of the spine on the back, and between every spine cauterization, and in the middle of the spine cauterization, and in the stomach cauterization.
Tremor enim quiescit cum cauterio oliuari, et festinat sanitas aegritudinis frigidae.	For tremor ceases with the olive oil cauterization, and quickens the health of disease due to cold.
Â¶ De modo cauterizandi Albathir.	Â§ On the mode of cauterizing with alum.
Caput LVII.	Chapter LVII.Ex quibusdam febribus, et ex mor
Quandoque expelluntur in corpore Albathir foedae, id est, pustulae, quae fiunt a materiis grossis corruptis.	When some fevers are expelled from the body with alum, that is, pustules which arise from coarse corroding material.
Oportet ergo in primis cum apparent, ut cauterizentur super omne caput pustulae cauterio subtili cum ligno myrti, cuius extremitas accensa est cum igne.	Then one should cauterize it on the head first, with a fine-tipped cauldron of Myrrh, whose tip is heated with fire.
Aut cum radice aristolochiae longae.	Or with the root of long Aristolochia.
Aut cum cauterio lenticulari.	Or with a lenticular cauterizer.
Et quandoque cauterizantur ademenul, in principio expulsionis suae secundum hunc modum: et non augentur: et disrumpitur superfluitas faciens eos, et sanatur ex eis.	And when they are cauterized with the semen, at first in accordance with this manner: they do not increase; and they break up the excess, healing them from within.
Verumtamen oportet ut fiat illud post euacuationem cum phlebotomia.	However, one should make it after evacuation with phlebotomy.
Â¶ De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arteria in uulnere.	Â§ On the mode of cauterizing in a stream of blood from an artery in the ulna.
Caput LVIII.	Chapter LVIII.De optimo modico cauterizandi in
Multotiens accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, quae incisa est apud uulnus, quod accidit extrinsecus, aut apud incisionem apostematis, aut cauterium membri, et similia eis: et fit difficile abscindere eum.	This often happens with blood flowing from an artery cut into the ulna, which is due to something external, or at the site of a pimple, or at the member's cauterization, and similar things: and it is difficult to remove it.
Cum ergo accidit alicui illud, tunc propera cum manu tua ad orificium arteriae, et pone super ipsum digitum tuum indicem: et stringe eum multum, donec obsessus sit sanguis sub digito tuo, et non egrediatur ex eo aliquid.	So when this happens to someone, then put your thumb properly on the opening of the artery and place your index finger over it: and tighten it very much until the blood is completely stopped under your thumb and nothing comes out of it.
Deinde pone in ignem cauteria oliuaria parua, et magna numero plura: et suffla super ea, donec fiant ignita ualde.	Then put on a small oiled fire, with many more: and blow over them until they are very hot.
Deinde accipe ex eis unum, aut paruum, aut magnum, secundum uulnus et locum, in quo disrupta est arteria, et depone cauterium super ipsam uenam, post quam tu remoues digitum tuum festinanter: et tene cauterium, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then take from them one, or small, or great, according to the wound and the place where the artery is broken, and put the fire on it; then remove your thumb quickly: and hold the fire until the blood comes off.
Quod si expellatur cum eleuas digitum ab orificio arteriae, et extinguis cauterium, tunc accipe cauterium aliud festinanter, ex cauteriis quae in igne sunt praeparata.	If it is expelled with your thumb from the opening of the artery and you put out the fire, then take another fire quickly from those that are prepared in the fire;
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum uno post aliud, donec abscindatur sanguis.	So do not stop doing this with one after another until the blood comes off.
Et caue, ne comburas neruum qui est illic, et accidat super infirmum malicia alia.	And be careful, so that you don't burn up the fire that is there, and something bad happens to the patient.
Et scias, quod quando ex arteria fluit sanguis, tunc non est possibile abscindere ipsum: praecipue quaudo arteria est magna, nisi cum uno quatuor modorum.	And know, that when blood flows from an artery, then it is not possible to stop it; especially if the artery is large, unless with four.
Aut cum cauterio, sicut diximus.	Or with fire, as we have said.
Aut cum extractione, quando non est extracta.	Or with extraction, when it has not been extracted.
Nam quando extrahitur, contrahuntur extremitates eius, et abscinditur sanguis.	For when it is extracted, its ends are drawn back and the blood comes off.
Aut ligetur cum filo ligatione forti.	Or is bound with a strong ligament.
Aut ponantur super ipsum medicinae de proprietate, quarum est abscindere sanguinem, et stringatur cum puluinari constrictione decenti.	Or are laid on top of the medicine by its property, which stops the blood from flowing, and is held with a little pressure.
Qui autem administrat abscisionem eius cum ligamento, et strictura cum panno, aut positione rerum comburentium, et similium, non confert ei penitus, nisi raro.	Whoever does this to him with a ligament and constriction with cloth, or with the placement of burning things and others nearby, does not give him relief unless it is rare.
Si autem accidat alicui illud, et non sit ei praesens medicus, neque medicina: tunc incipiat cum positione digiti indicis super orificium uenae ipsius, sicut narrauimus, et constrictione eius ualde, donec obsessus sit sanguis a superiori parte uulneris, et super arteriam.	But if this happens to someone, and there is no present doctor or medicine: then let the thumb of the right hand begin to be placed on the opening of his wound as we have described, and constriction let it be very tight, until the blood from the upper part of the wound is completely stopped, and put on the artery.
Et digitus non remoueatur, desuper ipsum cum aqua frigida uehementis frigoris semper, donec congeletur sanguis, et ingrossetur, et abscindatur.	And let the finger not be moved, on top of it with cold water always whet with the cold, until the blood is congealed, and thickens, and is cut off.
Et interim consideret in eo, quid indiget ex cauterio, aut ex medicina.	And in the meantime consider in him, what does he need from the poultice, or from the medicine.

Â¶ De Incisione, Perforatione, et Phlebotomia in uulneribus, et his similibus.	On Incision, Puncture, and Bloodletting on wounds and similar things.
Iam Diximus in Capitulo Primo, omnem aegritudinem in qua conueniens est cum igne cauterium et medicina comburente, et occasiones eius, ipsius caussas, et instrumenta eius, et formas cauteriorum.	We have already spoken in the first chapter of all disease, and of the ways in which fire can be used as a cauterizer and medicine combined with it, and of the causes of such diseases, and of the instruments for them, and of the shapes of the cauterization.
Et posui illic capitula a uertice usque ad pedem.	And I placed there from the top to the bottom chapters.
Et ego procedam in hoc capitulo illa eadem uia: ut alleuietur super quaerentem quaesitum eius.	And I will proceed in this chapter in the same way: so that he may find what he is looking for easily.
Et antequam incipiam illud, oportet ut addiscatis o filii, quod in hoc capitulo est ex terrore illud quod est in capitulo primo de cauterizatione.	And before I begin that, it is necessary for you to learn, O son, that the fear that is in the first chapter on cauterization,
Et propter illud oportet, ut sit cautela in eo uehementior, quoniam in operatione quae est in hoc capitulo, multotiens cadit euacuatio cum sanguine, cum quo stat uita apud apertionem uenae, aut incisionem super apostema, aut apertionem exiturae, aut curationem uulneris, aut extractionem sagittae, aut incisionem super lapidem, et illis similia: ex quibus omnibus associatur tremor, et timor, et cadit in pluribus eorum mors.	And for that, it is necessary to be careful in it, since the fall often of the vibration with blood, which falls on opening the vein, or incision on a bruise, or opening of the exit of urine, or cure of a wound, or extraction of an arrow, or incision on a stone, and those similar: from all of which is associated tremor, and fear, and falls in many of them death.
Et ego moneo uos, ne cadat super uos illud in quo est haesitatio, nam quandoque cadunt ad uos in hac arte modi hominum cum modis infirmitatum.	And I warn you, so that it does not fall on you that hesitation, for sometimes those who are fallen to you, in this art of men with ways of sickness.
Ex eis enim est qui irascitur cum aegritudine sua, et est leuis apud eum mors: propter uehementiam eius quod inuenit ex infirmitate sua et longitudine eius maliciei.	For from them is one who becomes angry with his illness, and is weak before him, on account of the severity that he finds from his illness and the length of his evil.
Et cum aegritudine est ex timore quod significat mortem.	And when disease comes from fear that means death.
Et ex eis est, qui dat tibicensum suum, et ditat te cum eo, sperans sanitatem, et aegritudo eius est perniciosa.	And from these is he who gives you his knife, and tells you with them, hoping for health, but his sickness is destructive.
Non ergo oportet ut consentiatis ei qui uenit ad uos ex eis, cuius modus est talis.	Therefore it is not necessary that you should consent to him who comes to you from among them, whose way is such.
Et sit cautela uestra uehementior, quam cupiditas et uestra rapacitas.	And be your caution greater than your avarice and your greediness.
Et non praesumatis super aliquid ex illo, nisi post scientiam certam, quae uerificat apud uos illud ad quod peruenit successio laudabilis.	And do not presume about anything from him unless after a certain knowledge that justifies it with you what comes to that worthy succession of praise.
Et utimini in curatione omnium infirmorum uestrorum, prognosticatione et indicatione de eo ad quod conuenienter sit salus.	And so you take care of all your sick people, prognosis and indication of him as to where the healing is appropriate.
In illo namque est uobis adiutorium super acquisitionem famae et gloriae, et memoriae et laudis.	For in that is for you an aid in acquiring fame and glory, and memory and praise.
Inspiret uobis Deus o filii, intellectum suum, et non auferat uobis directionem et inspirationem: quoniam illud est in manu eius.	May God inspire you, O son, with his understanding, and may he not take away from you his guidance and inspiration: for that is in his hands.
Et ego quidem ordinaui hoc Capitulum distinguendo per capitula, secundum quod praecessit in capitulo Cauterii, a ceruice usque ad pedes: ut alleuietur uobis quaesitum quod uultis ex eo, et quo indigetis.	And I have arranged this chapter distinguishing it by chapters, according to which I preceded in the chapter of Cautery, from the cheek down to the feet: that you may be eased in what you ask for from him, and what you need.
Â¶ De curatione Aquae quae aggregatur in capitibus puerorum.	About the cure of water which is added to the heads of boys.
Caput I.	Chapter I.
Scias, quod haec infirmitas multotiens accidit pueris apud partum: aut quando stringit obstetrix caput pueri absque leuitate.	You should know that this disease often happens to boys at the time of birth: or when the midwife presses the boy's head without lightness.
Et quandeque accidit etiam ex caussa occulta quae non scitur.	And whenever it also happens for an unknown cause which is not known.
Et ego quidem non uidi hanc aegritudinem in aliis quam in pueris: et ad omnem quem ex eis uidi properauit mors: propter illud ergo uisum est mihi dimittere operationem in ea.	And I have not seen this disease in any other but in boys; and I would like to see all of them die: for that reason, then, I have abandoned the practice of using it on them.
Et ego quidem uidi ex eis puerum, cuius caput impletum erat aqua, et caput magnificabatur in omni die, donec non poterat sedere super seipsum, propter magnitudinem capitis sui: et humiditas augmentata fuit, donec mortuus est.	And I have seen from among them a boy whose head was swelled with water, and whose head increased in size every day until he could not sit on himself; and the moisture increased until he died.
Et haec quidem humiditas, aut aggregatur inter cutem et os: aut aggregatur sub osse super sifac.	And this moisture, or collect between skin and bone: or collected under bone over the side.
Et operatio in illo, si est humiditas inter cutem et os, et apostema est paruum, tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis fissura una in latitudine: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo nodi, donec currat humiditas.	And the operation in that, if there is moisture between skin and bone, and the pussing is small, then you should find a small crack in the middle of the head in width: and its length is almost two knots, until the moisture runs out.
Et haec est forma spatumilis.	And this is the shape of the needle.
Si ergo humiditas est magis augmentata, et apostema est maius, tunc pone eas duas fissuras, secundum formam hanc.	If then the moisture is more increased, and the pussing is larger, then put them two cracks, according to this form.
Et si humiditas est sub osse, et signum eius est, quod uides commissuras capitis apertas ab omni parte: et aqua deprimitur quando comprimis eam manu tua ad interiora, et non occultatur tibi illud: tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis tribus fissuris, secundum hunc modum.	And if the moisture is under bone, and its sign is that you see the scalp openings from all sides: and water is lowered when you compress it with your hand towards the inside, and it does not hide itself from you: then you should find in the middle of the head three cracks, according to this way.
Et post incisionem extrahe humiditatem totam.	And after the incision has been made, remove all the moisture.
Deinde stringe fissuras cum pannis et puluillis.	Then tighten the cracks with rags and powder.
Deinde embroca illud desuper cum uino et oleo usque ad diem quintum.	Then dip it in wine and oil until the fifth day.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et cura uulnus cum tentis, et unguentis.	Then loosen the ligaments, and take care of the wounds with linen bandages, and ointment.
Et non dimittas stringere caput cum aequalitate.	And do not stop tightening the head with equality.
Et ciba infirmum omni cibo sicco paucae humiditatis, usquequo confortetur membrum, et sanetur.	And feed the sick with dry food of little moisture, until their members are comfortable and healed.
Et modus alius incisionis est, ut consideres ubi apparet magnitudo apostematis, et collectio aquae.	And another method of incision is that you should consider where the pussing appears large, and the collection of water.
Quoniam quandoque est in occipitio plus, aut in sincipite, aut in dextra, aut in sinistra.	Because when it is more in the back, or in the front, or on the right, or on the left.
Ascende ergo cum incisione ubi apparet tibi apostema et impletio aquae: et scinde illud secundum quod tibi possibile est.	So climb up with the incision where you see the pussing and the collection of water: and tear it according to what is possible for you.
Et obserua, ne incidas arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis, et moriatur infirmus ex illo fluxu cum euacuatione humiditatis.	And observe, so that you do not hit an artery, and does not happen a flow of blood, and the sick person dies from that flow with the evacuation of moisture.
Â¶ De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.	Of the arteries which are behind the ears.
Caput II.	Head II.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri ad oculos, aut ad pectus, et antiquatur illud, et non confert curatio medicinarum: tunc magis ultima curatio est in illo, incisio harum duarum arteriarum.	When there occurs to anyone a cataract on the eyes, or on the chest, and it is old, and there is no treatment for it by medicines: then more is the last treatment in him, to make an incision of these two arteries.
Oportet ergo quando uis incidere eas, ut radat infirmus caput suum.	Therefore, when you cut off their sight, let the sick person pull his head out.
Deinde frica locum cum panno aspero, ut appareant arteriae.	Then put a rough cloth over the place so that the arteries appear.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum, cum quolibet panno suo.	Then the sick person should tighten his neck with whatever cloth he has.
Deinde considera, ubi pulset uena.	Then look where the pulse beats.
Et loca utriusque sunt loca quae sunt post aures depressa: et raro occultatur, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	And these places are those which are behind the ears that are depressed; and rarely is it hidden unless in some men.
Deinde signa cum encaustro super utraque: et incide utramque cum spatumili utrimque acuro, incisione perueniente ad os: et fiat illud per latitudinem capitis.	Then signs with wax on both: and cut each with a chisel sharp on both sides, cutting towards the nose: and let it be done according to the breadth of the head.
Et si uis, intromitte spatumile sub arteria, et incide eam ad superiora cum incisione.	And if you see, insert the chisel under the artery, and cut it towards the top with an incision.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quasi duo digiti iuncti.	And let the length of the incision be as two fingers joined together.
Nam quando inciditur uena, egreditur sanguis egressione pulsatili, qui salit ad interiora saltu frequenti.	For when the vein is cut, blood flows out with a pulsating movement that rises to the inside at a regular interval.
Si autem arteria non apparet sensui, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aure quantitatem spacii trium digitorum.	But if the artery does not appear to the touch, then you must measure from the ear the length of three fingers.
Deinde signa cum encaustro, et finde usque ad os.	Then signs with wax and find up to the nose.
Et illud quod oportet emittere ex sanguine, est VI uncia et fortasse emittis ex eo plus, aut minus.	And that which must be emitted from the blood, is six inches and perhaps you emit more or less of it.
Totum illud secundum quantitatem quae apparet tibi ex uirute infirmi et repletione arteriae eius.	All this depends on the quantity that appears to you from the vein and the filling of the artery.
Deinde considera ad uulnus.	Then look at the nipple.
Tunc si remanet ad os ex sifac aliquid, tunc incide illud, ut non accidat apostema calidum: tunc stringe uulnus cum liciniis ex panno lini.	If anything remains in the mouth from spitting, then cut it so that there does not remain an open wound: and tighten the nipple with a thread from a linen cloth.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then take care of himself with ointment, until he is healed.
Â¶ De extractione arteriarum, quae sunt in timporibus.	On the extraction of arteries which are in the temples.
Caput III.	Chapter III.
Quando accidit homini hemicranea antiqua, aut catarri acuti propter humiditates acrimoniales, et caliditate in lacertis timporum, aut soda antiqua, uehemens, et similia illis: et medicatur cum modis curationis medicinae, et non confert illud: tunc experti sumus in his aegritudinibus extractionem arteriarum ex timporibus, aut cauterizationem earum, sicut narrauimus.	When it happens to a man that he has an old headache, or acute catarrh through acrimonious humors, and heat in the nares of the ears, or old soda, sharp, and similar things: and is treated with the methods of medical cure, and does not give that treatment: then we are experienced in these diseases to extract the arteries from the nares of the ears, or to cauterize them, as we have related.
Et modus operationis in extractione earum, est, ut radat infirmus pilos qui sunt in timporibus, et intendat ad arteriam apparentem in timpore.	And the method of operation in extracting the ears is, that the sick man who are in the nares of the ears should be shaved, and turned towards the appearing artery in the ear.
Ipsa namque ostenditur tibi ex pulsu suo, et raro occultatur nisi in paucis hominibus, aut uehementia frigoris.	And this is shown to you from its pulse, and rarely hides itself except in a few men, or through sharp coldness.
Quod si occultatur tibi, tunc stringat infirmus caput suum cum quolibet panno suo: deinde frica locum cum panno aspero.	If it hides itself from you, then the sick man should tie his head with any of his clothes: and then he should cover the place where he feels the cold with a rough cloth.
Aut uapora locum cum aqua calida, donec appareat tibi apparitione manifesta.	Or he should heat the place with hot water until you see a clear appearance to you.
Deinde accipe spatumile, quod paulo ante formaui.	Then take a spikelet, which I have just made.
Deinde excoria cum eo cutem cum facilitate, donec peruenias ad arteriam.	Then scrape with it the skin, with ease, until you reach the artery.
Deinde proiice in eam uncinum, et extrahe eam ad superiora, donec extrahas eam ex cute, et facias eam euadere ex tunicis quae sunt sub ea ab omni parte.	Then throw it into her and extract it upward, until you extract it from the skin, and make it bleed from the tunics that are under it from all sides.
Si autem arteria est subtilis: tunc inuolue eam cum extremitate uncini.	If, however, the artery is thin: then turn the end of the spikelet towards it.
Deinde incide ex ea partem secundum quantitatem qua elongentur extremitates eius, et contrahantur, et non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Then cut from that side according to the quantity by which its ends are elongated, and turn back, so that blood does not flow.
Nam si non inciditur, et si non abscinditur, non ascendit sanguis penitus.	For if it is not cut, and if it is not severed, the blood will not rise.
Deinde euacua ex sanguine ana VI unci, usque ad .III.	Then make bleed from its blood an amount of six drachms, until III.
Quod si arteria est magna: tunc oportet ut liges eam in duobus locis ex filo duplo, forti, ex serico: aut ex chordis alhohod, ut non properet ad ipsam putrefactio ante consolidationem uulneris, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If the artery is large: then it should be bound to two places with a double thread, strong, made of silk: or from an alohoid string, so that it does not happen to it putrefaction before the consolidation of the wound, and blood flows out.
Deinde incide superfluitatem, quae est inter duo ligamenta.	Then make an incision in the superfluous part, which is between two ligaments.
Fac illud in illa hora, aut post horam aliam.	Do it at that time, or after another hour.
Et si uis, cauteriza eam cauterio usque ad os, cum cauterio cultellari: donec incidantur extremitates eius, et stabit loco eiusdem operis.	And if you wish, cauterize it with the cauldron up to the nose, with a knife: until the extremities are cut, and remain in place of that work.
Et est melius opus, nisi si infirmus habet febrem, autest calefactae complexionis.	And this work is better if he has no fever, or if his body is hot.
Quoniam cauterium est ex eis, quae iuuant ad finiendas humiditates.	For the cauldron is of those that remain to finish the moisture.
Ergo est melius iuuamentum.	Therefore it is better to bandage.
Et oportet post extractionem arteriarum, ut impleatur locus cotto antiquo: et ponantur super ipsum puluilli decenter facti.	And it should be after the extraction of the arteries, so that the place is filled with old cooked: and let them be placed over him feathers made up.
Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.	And after the solution of the medicine dry, which makes the birth of flesh, and with liniments, until it heals.
Quod si interim dum operaris accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, tunc propera ad abscindendum eum cum cauterio, aut ut impleas locum cum zegi: et stringe manum tuam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Which if while you are working a flow of blood comes out from an artery, then go quickly to cut it with the cauldron, or as if you fill up the place with a bandage: and tighten your hand, until the blood is cut off.
Quod si nihil ex illis est tibi praesens, tunc pone super locum digitum tuum, donec congeletur sanguis.	Which if there is nothing present for you, then place your finger on the place, until the blood is frozen.
Et embroca locum cum aqua uehementis frigoris, donec quiescat acuitas, et stringatur secundum quod oportet.	And dip the place with water of cold water, until the sharpness is calm, and tighten it according to what is needed.
Et ex eo quod est leuius et facilius extractione arteriae, est, ut cauterizes uenam cum hoc cauterio habente duos cultellos: sitque acuitas duorum cultellorum similis almagdatem.	And from that which is lighter and easier to extract the artery, it is, as if a knife with this cauldron having two knives: and the sharpness of the two knives is like an almond.
Verumtamen sunt multo minoris acuitatis, quam duo cultelli.	However, they are much less sharp than the two knives.
Quoniam si sunt acutae, sicut duo cultelli, properat utrisque frigus: et non incidunt carnem cum uelocitate.	For if they are sharp, like the two knives, it is appropriate for both to have cold: and do not incise the flesh with speed.
Cum ergo in eis est aliquantulum grossitudinis, tenetur in eis calor ignis, et abscinditur caro uelociter: cum hoc ergo opus est melius omni opere, et leuius, et facilius.	So if there is a little crudeness in them, heat is held in them, and the flesh is cut quickly: so with this work it is better for all works, lighter, and easier to do.
Et sit spacium quod est inter duos cultellos quantitas grossitudinis digiti, postquam tu signas duo loca cum encaustro: et depone utrosque ignitos ualde, donec perueniant ad os, et incidant uenam in duobus locis: ut elongetur quod est inter extremitates eius.	And let there be a space that is the thickness of a finger between the two blades, after you have marked the two places with the caustics; and place both of them burning well, until they come to the mouth, and fall in two places: so that what is between their extremities may lengthen.
Nam non consolidantur cum hoc cauterio penitus.	For with this caustic they do not solidify deeply.
Et haec est forma cauterii.	And this is the form of the caustic.
Â¶ De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.	De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.
Caput IIII.	CHAPTER IV.
Quando sunt lachrymae assiduae, et est cursus earum ex uenis, quae sunt super craneum capitis exterius: et non confert in eis aliquid curationis medicinae cum medicinis, et uides faciem infirmi iam rubere, et sentit in fronte sua deambulationem, sicut est deambulatio formicarum: et oculi eius sunt extenuati, humidi, ita quod iam corrosi sunt pili eorum cum corrosione: et calefactae sunt palpebrae eius ex acuitate lachrymarum: tunc antiqui indiguerunt in curatione earum hac operatione, et denominauerunt eam curationem, cum Ense.	When there are constant tears and there is a course of tears from the springs on top of the head away from the eyes: and he has no remedy with the doctors' medicines, and his face becomes red, and he feels a trembling in his forehead, as if it were a trembling of ants: and his eyes are dried up, and sore, so that his hairs are corroded by the corrosion: and his eyelids are warmed by the acuteness of the tears: then the old used to apply this cure with the Ense, and they called it The Ense.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere pilos qui sunt in fronte sua.	And it is, that you order the sick to shave the hair on their forehead.
Deinde incide in fronte tres fissuras aequedistantes secundum longitudinem frontis: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo digiti, et fissura una sit aequedistans longitudini nasi in medio frontis, et secunda secundum longitudinem parumper a motu lacertorum, et tertia a parte altera: et caue ab incisione arteriarum quae sunt in duobus lateribus: et elonga manum tuam a continuatione duarum mandibularum, et sit spacium omnis incisionis quantitas trium digitorum coniunctorum: et sit tibi frustum spongiae praeparatum, aut panni siccati multi, cum quibus exsicces sanguinem.	Then cut in the forehead three slits equal distant according to the length of the forehead: and let the length of the slit be nearly as long as two fingers, and one slit be equal in length to the nose at mid-forehead, and the second slits be about even with the motion of the nostrils, and the third be from the side of the other: and cut away the arteries that are on both sides: and extend your hand from the junction of the two jawbones, and let there be a space between each incision equal to the thickness of three fingers joined together: and let you have a prepared sponge fragment, or many dry rags, with which to absorb the blood.
Deinde intromitte spatumile duarum acutarum extremitatum, cuius mox sequens est forma.	Then introduce a spatula made of two acute ends, whose following form is:
Ab incisione quae est a parte timporis, usque ad incisionem secundam: et excoria cum eo totam cutem, quae est inter duas incisiones, cum sifac, quod est super os.	From the incision which is from the temporal part, to the second incision: and scrub all the skin between the two incisions withà¤¸à¤«à¤¼à¤¾à¤à¤¼, which is on top of the bone.
Deinde fac illud etiam ab incisione media usque ad incisionem secundam.	Then also cut this from the middle to the second incision.
Deinde extrahe hoc spatumile, et intromitte in incisionem primam iterum instrumentum aliud, quod nominatur cultellare acutum, ab una parte lene, non acutum ab altera parte.	Then also remove this bone with a chisel and insert into the first incision another tool called a sharp chisel, soft on one side, not sharp on the other.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et pone latus eius acutum uersus carnem annexam cum cute, et latus eius lene uersus os: et impelle ipsum, donec perueniat ad fissuram mediam: et abscinde cum eo omnia uasa, quae descendunt a capite ad oculos: praeter quod continuetur incisio usque ad illud quod apparet de cute.	And place the sharp side of it against the flesh annexed to the bone, and the soft side against the jaw; and press it on until it reaches the middle fissure: and cut away with it all the tissue that descends from the head to the eyes: except that which continues in the incision to that which appears out of the skin.
Deinde fac illud in fissura media usque ad fissuram aliam.	Then also make this in the middle fissure until another fissure.
Et postquam currit ex sanguine quantitas aequalis, exprime loca ex frustis sanguinis coagulati.	And when an equal quantity of blood has run out, express the places from the clotted blood.
Deinde pone in omnem fissuram licinium ex cotto ueteri, et pone super eos puluillos imbibitos in uino, et oleo, aut aceto.	Then also put into each fissure a piece of burnt iron, and put on them wool wetted with wine, oil, or vinegar.
Et uide ut non accidat apostema calidum.	And see that no pus becomes hot.
Et in die tertia solue ligamentum, et administra infusionem multam cum aqua tepida.	And on the third day loosen the ligaments, and administer a strong infusion with warm water.
Deinde cura illud ex unguento basilicon, et reliquis quibus curantur uulnera: usquequo sanetur.	Then care for this with basilic ointment, and with other ointments that are used to heal wounds: until it has healed.
Â¶ De cura lachrymarum acutarum et catarrorum ad oculos ex interioribus capitis.	Â§ On the care of acute tears and cataracts in the eyes from within the head.
Caput V.	Head
Quando accidunt alicui catarri acuti, acres, assidui: et uides oculos eius extenuatos, paruos, et iam debilitatus est aspectus eorum: et palpebrae ulceratae, et cadunt pili ex eis, et in profundo capitis est dolor acutus, laedens, et sternutatio consequens: tunc sume ex istis accidentibus, quod illae materiae, et catarri non ueniunt, nisi ex uenis multis.	When there occur acute, bitter, and persistent cataracts in the eyes; and the eyes appear weak, dull, and their appearance is already impaired: and the eyelids are ulcerated, and hairs fall out from them, and there is a sharp pain in the deep part of the head, causing sneezing: then do away with these accidents, so that those materials do not come, unless they are removed with many tools.
Et melior curatio in eis est haec.	And the best treatment for them is this.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere frontem suam.	And it is as you order to the sick man to shave his forehead.
Deinde incide in eam fissuram unam in medio frontis, aut alterius parumper per latitudinem, et incipe cum fissura a timpore sinistro ad timpus dextrum: et sit incisio usque ad os: et elonga manum tuam a lacertis timporum, qui mouentur apud masticationem: donec quando detegitur os: et exsiccabis totum sanguinem cum spongia.	Then also cut in that fissure one in the middle of the forehead, or a little more in width, and begin with the incision from the left ear to the right: and extend it until you reach the jaw: and stretch out your hand from the temporals that move when chewing: until such time as it has touched the jaw: and dry off all the blood with a sponge.
Tunc separa inter duo labia fissurae cum cotto ueteri, aut cum liciniis ex lino.	Then separate between the two lips of the fissure with a hot wax, or with liniments from linen.
Deinde stringe desuper cum puluillis: et imbibe puluillos cum uino et oleo, ut non accidat apostema calidum.	Then tighten from above with powder: and immerse the powders in wine and oil, so that hot poultices do not cause a swelling.
Et quando soluis illud, et uides quod apostema calidum iam imminuitur: tunc oportet ut frices os, donec incipiat in eo nasci caro.	And when you dissolve this, and you see that the hot poultice is about to erupt: then it is necessary to close the mouth, until it begins to grow hair inside of it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum regimine exiccatiuo quod facit nasci carnem: sicut si accipias ex farina tritici partes duas, et ex colophonia quatuor partes: et praepares ex eis emplastrum, et administretur ad natiuitatem carnis in istis uulneribus.	Then take care of the patient with the dry treatment that makes the flesh grow: just as if you were to take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony: and prepare a plaster from it, and administer it for the birth of flesh within these wounds.
Â¶ De cura eius quod cadit in Aurem.	This is a treatment that affects the golden part.
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Omne Quod in Aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.	All that falls into the golden part is of four kinds: or stone, or a similar rock, such as iron, and rust: or from a plant, such as chickpeas, and beans: or a fluid thing, such as water, and vinegar, and things like them: or some kind of creature.
Quando ergo cadit in aurem lapis, aut genus lapidis ex eis quae non adduntur, neque crescunt in aure, expone Aurem soli: si ergo uides lapidem, tunc distilla in Aurem aliquid ex oleo uiolato, aut sisamino.	When therefore something falls into the gold, or a kind of rock that does not contribute to, or grow in, the gold, expose the gold to the sun alone: but if you see a rock, then distill in the gold some of the oil of olive nuts, or sesame seed.
Deinde administra extractionem eius, et fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares apud aduentum sternutationis, postquam tu ponis in circumitu auris frusta ex pannis, aut lana, et extendis aurem ad superiora.	Then administer the extraction, and make it snort with oil, and paint the nose with the ointment at the approach of sneezing, after you have put on the gold a bandage from cloths, or wool, and extend the gold towards the top.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum hac cura.	For this treatment should be repeated several times.
Si autem non egreditur, tunc administra extractionem eius cum Gesti, id est, Pizigarolis subtilibus: cuius forma est haec.	But if it does not leave, then administer the extraction with Gestigans, that is to say, subtle Pyzgarolies: whose form is this.
Si ergo egreditur cum gesti, est bonum.	Then if it leaves with Gestigant, it is good.
Et si non, tunc administra extractionem eius cum uncino caeco subtili paucae duplicationis.	And if not, then administer the extraction with a subtle, weak, single-dose unction.
Si ergo non egreditur per illud, tunc fac cannulam ex aere, et intromitte extremitatem cannulae in foramen auris multum, et opila quod est in circumitu cannulae cum caera mollificata cum oleo, ut non sit uento uia nisi cannulae: deinde extrahe cum uento tuo attractione forti.	If, then, he does not emerge through that, then make a tube of brass; and introduce the extreme end of the tube into the hole of the ear much, and the resin which is around the tube with the soft brass with oil, so that there is no passage for wind except through the tube: then draw out with your breath strongly.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus.	For often he emerges by that way which we have described.
Si autem non egreditur hoc modo: tunc accipe ex helkalimbat, aut ex uisco, id est, gluten praeparato, cum quo capiuntur aues, rem modicam: et pone ipsum in extremitate radii postquam tu inuoluis super eam cotum decenter positum: deinde intromitte ipsum in foramen auris cum facilitate, postquam tu exiccas aurem ab humiditate.	But if he does not emerge in this way then take some glue, or some water, that is, gluten prepared, with which birds are caught, and put it on the end of the tube: and place that in the extreme edge of the ear after you have dried up the ear with a cloth laid askew there: and then introduce the tube into the hole of the ear easily, after you have dried out the ear.
Si ergo non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc propera ad scindendum, antequam accidat apostema calidum, aut spasmus.	If then he does not emerge with all that we have described, then prepare to cut it off, before there occurs any heat or spasm.
Et modus fissurae est, ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis in cephalica: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum mensuram uirtutis eius.	And the mode of the wound is so that the phlebotomist takes blood from the head first: and draw out his blood according to the measure of its usefulness.
Deinde fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et conuerte aurem eius ad superiora, et finde fissuram paruam in radice auris apud adipem eius in loco depresso ipsi: et sit fissura lunaris figurae, donec peruenias ad lapidem: deinde aufer eum cum eo, quod est tibi possibile ex instrumentis.	Then make the sick person sit between your hands, and turn his ear upwards, and find a small hole in the base of his ear next to his fat there: and let the hole be round in shape, until you have reached a stone: then take it out with that, which is possible for you from tools.
Deinde sue fissuram ab hora tua cum uelocitate, et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then sew up the hole from your side with speed, and tend to that, until it heals.
Quod si res cadens in aurem est ex uno granorum, quae crescunt, et inflantur: tunc administra extractionem eius.	That if any thing falling into the ear comes from one grain which grows, and swells: then administer its extraction.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc accipe spatumile tenue, subtile, secundum hanc formam.	But if it does not obey you to the exit, then take a small, thin, thread, according to this form.
Et administra cum eo abscisionem illius speciei ex granis, quae cadunt in aurem, et non facias illud, quando tu cogitas, quod illud granum iam humectatum est per uaporem auris, donec ponis ipsum frusta multa: deinde extrahe ea cum uncinis, aut cum gesti subtili, aut cum suctione, sicut diximus, nam extractio eius alleuiatur.	And administer with that the cutting of its kind from a grain which falls into the ear, and do not think that it is already wet with the moisture of the ear, until you have put many blows on it: then draw it out with a hook, or with a gentle touch, or with suction, as we have said, for the extraction of it eases.
In aqua autem quae ingreditur in aurem, oportet ut utatur infirmus sternutatione cum condisi in primis: et iam impleuit aurem suam cum aliquanto cotto ueteri: et est iacens super illam aurem, in qua est aqua.	But the water that is poured into the ear, it is necessary that the sick man use with coughing at first: and has already filled his ear with some boiled old: and lies on it, in which water is. 
Si ergo egreditur per illud, est bonum.	If then he leaves by that, it is good.
Et si non: tunc accipe lapides multos, secundum longitudinem digiti, tenues, lenes, et calefac eos cum igne parumper, et intromittat infirmus ex eis unum in foramen auris suae: et saliat super pedem suum unum ex illa parte, et percutiat cum lapide alio super lapidem qui est in aure.	And if not: then take many small stones, according to the length of a finger, light, soft, and warm them with fire slightly, and insert one into the hole of his ear: and salt over his foot one from those stones, and hit with the stone that is in the ear.
Non ergo cesset facere illud cum lapide et lapide, donec egrediatur tota aqua.	So he will not cease to do that with the stone and the stones, until he leaves all the water out.
Et iam egreditur aqua ita, ut accipias ex parpyro, aut ex iunco unum, et intromittas extremitatem eius unam in aurem: et accendas extremitatem alteram cum igne, donec comburatur plurimum eius.	And already he leaves out the water so that you take from a torch, or from a branch of a tree, and introduce the end into his ear: and light the end with fire, until it is burned well.
Deinde itera iuncum alium, et fac illud multotiens, donec egrediatur tota aqua: et extrahe ipsam cum cannula secundum quod praemissum est in lapide.	Then repeat the branch again, and do it many times, until he leaves all the water out: and draw it out with a tube according to what has been said above in the stone.
In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.	In extraction however of the animal that enters into it, if it is a small body, like a flea, and similar to it, take care of it as I said in division.
Sed si est corporis magni, quod appareat sensui: tunc administra extractionem eius cum gesti, et uncinis: et res eius est facilior omnibus, quae tenentur in aure.	But if it seems to be a body of great size, then administer the extraction of it with gestures and a hook: and its business is easier for all those who hold it in the ear.
In extractione autem uermis generati in aure, quando curas eum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et in tractatu distilationum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut aspicias aurem in sole.	But in the extraction of the wax that is in the ear, when your care is like that which we said in division, and in the book of distillations, and does not bring your cure: then you should look at the ear in the sun.
Si ergo apparet illic aliquid ex uermibus, tunc extrahe illud cum gesti, aut cum uncinis subtilibus.	But if there appears anything of wax there, then extract it with gestures, or with a fine hook.
Si autem non apparet illic aliquid, tunc accipe cannulam, cuius haec est forma, stricta inferius, ampla superius: et intromitte extremitatem subtilem in aurem secundum quantitatem quod tolerat eam infirmus: deinde suge cum ea suctione forti.	But if there appears nothing there of wax, then take a tube whose this form is, narrow below, wide above: and introduce the end into the ear according to what it can bear from the sick man: and then suck with it strong suction.
Fac illud multotiens, donec egrediantur omnes uermes.	Let us try this many times until all the worms come out.
Si autem non obediunt tibi ad exitum, tunc opila circumitum cannulae cum caera, sicut dixi in lapide.	But if they do not obey you to go out, then bind them around with a stick dipped in tar, as I have said in the stone.
Quod si non egrediuntur cum eo quod diximus: tunc administra distillationes quas iam experti sunt antiqui in interfectione uermium: et inuenies illud in tractatu distillationum.	What if they do not go out with it that I have said: then administer the distiliations which the old people have already experienced in the infection of worms: and you will find it in the book of distillation.
Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicta est hic.	And let your pouring be as you pour oil and medicines on the ear with this instrument, whose shape is depicted here.
Sicut uides fac ipsum ex argento, aut aere, inferius strictum, in quo sit foramen paruum, amplum superius.	As you see, make it from silver, or from brass, lower part strictly, in which sits a small hole, wide at the top.
Sit ergo ut impellens quod est in concauitate cannulae, sit ex aere decenter factum.	So that it is driven out what is in the urge of the cannula, let it be made of brass poorly done.
Et si uis, accipe radium, et inuolue in extremitate eius cottum inuolutione decenti: deinde proiice oleum, aut succum, aut quod uis ex istis medicinis in cannulam: et ipsa sit in aure: deinde intromitte radium cum cotto desuper, et exprime ipsum manu tua compressione temperata, donec impellatur oleum in concauitate auditus, et sentiat ipsum infirmus interius: et illud quod infunditur in aurem, sit iam calefactum cum igne parumper: et caue ne sit res quae distillatur in eam frigida ualde: medicinae enim non tolerant illud.	And if you want, take the radium, and let it turn round at the end of it with a gentle turning: then pour oil, or juice, or what you want from these medicines into the cannula: and let it be in brass: then throw in the radium with the cot which is slightly heated, and squeeze it out with your hand under moderate pressure, until it drives out the oil into the urge of the ear, and feels sick inside: and that which is poured into the ear, may already be slightly warm by the fire: and let there not be anything which distills in it coldly: for the medicines do not bear this.
Â¶ De cura opilationis accidentis Auri.	On the care of the healing of an ear injury.
Caput VII.	Chapter VII.
Quandoque egrediuntur quidam infantes ex uentribus matrum suarum non perforati.	When some children come out of their mothers' wombs without piercing.
Et iam accidit etiam quibusdam hominibus opilatio in meatu Auris a uulnere, aut carne nata in ea.	And it has also happened to some men that there is an infection in the ear from a wound, or from flesh born in it.
Et haec opilatio quandoque fit in profundo foraminis Auris, quam non consequitur uisus: et quandoque accidit ad exteriora foraminis parum, et consequitur eam uisus.	And this infection, when it comes to be in the deep cavity of the ear, which is not caused by washing: and when it happens on the outside of the cavity a little, and causes it to wash itself.
Illa ergo quae accidit in profundo Auris, et quam non comprehendit aspectus, est in pluribus dispositionibus difficilis sanationis.	So then that which comes to be in the deep cavity of the ear, and which is not comprehended by appearance, is in many dispositions difficult for healing.
Et in illa quam consequitur uisus, oportet ut ponas Aurem infirmi in sole, et aspicias in ea: tunc si uides opilationem apparentem, aperi eam cum spatumili subtili, cuius forma est haec quae sequitur, sit extremitas eius in qua sit quaedam latitudo parua, cuius quaedam pars sit acuta: et reliquum spatumile sit duarum laterum lenium: ut non laedat aurem.	And for the one that follows the temperature rise, it is necessary that you place the golden nurse in the sun and look at her; then if you see an apparent operation, open it with a thin spatula, whose shape is this that follows, let the end be in where there is some small width, whose part is sharp: and let the other side of the spatula be soft on both sides: so that it does not hurt the auricle.
Si ergo opilatio est a carne nata in meatu auris: tunc tene eam cum uncino subtili, et incide eam cum facilitate uehementi, donec auferatur tota caro.	If therefore an operation is born from the flesh in the meatus of the ear: then hold it with a small hook, and cut it with ease by means of a knife, until it is all removed.
Quod si opilatio est in profundo auris: tunc accipe radium subtilem, lenem, et calefac ipsum cum igne parumper: deinde mitte ipsum in meatum auris.	That if the operation is in the deep part of the ear: then take a small ray, smooth, and heat it slightly with fire: and then send it into the meatus of the ear.
Si ergo senseris opilationem cum eo, quod inuenit infirmus cum grauitate auditus, conare apertionem eius cum facilitate: et caue, ne uulneres neruos auris.	If therefore you feel that the operation is with him who has a problem with hearing, try to make an opening of it with ease: and carefully, so as not to hurt the nerves of the ear.
Deinde pone in aurem licinium secundum quantitatem amplitudinis foraminis, quod inuoluisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud aliquot diebus, donec sis securus de consolidatione uulneris.	Then put into the ear a liquid of second quantity of width of the hole that you have made with Egyptian ointment: let it be for several days, until you are sure about the healing of the wound.
Aut accipe licinium, et infunde ipsum in aqua rosata, et pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, et utere ipso.	Or take a liquid, and pour it into rose water, and powder it lightly on top of it, and use it.
Quod si uides aurem iam apostemari: tunc oportet ut extrahas licinium, et permittas ipsum cum licinio alio, quod inuolues in caeroto quod sit factum cum oleo rosato, donec sedetur apostema calidum: deinde cura ipsum usquequo sanetur.	That if you see the ear already blistered: then it is necessary that you remove the liquid, and let it be with another liquid that you have made with rose oil, until it cools down: and then take care of the ear until it is healed.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis: tunc submerge spongiam, aut pannos in aqua frigida, et pone super eam aurem: et utere reliqua curatione, quae abscindit fluxum sanguinis praedicta in tractatu distillationum.	But if blood comes out: then dip a sponge or cloth in cold water and put it on the ear: and use the remaining cure that stops the predicted flow of blood in the book of distillation.

Oportet ergo ut teneas eos cum tenaliis: aut cum uncino, et incidas eos cum spatumili a radicibus suis.	You must therefore hold them with tenalis; or with an iron hook, and knock them down with a mallet from their roots.
Deinde pone super loca zegi tritum.	Then place on the table the body that has been cut into three pieces.
Si autem ex eis fluat sanguis, tunc cauteriza eos cum cauterio lenticulari subtili.	If however blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a thin lens-shaped cautery.
Et cauterizare eos, est melius post incisionem.	And cauterize them, it is better to do so after the incision.
Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid.	For many times they return when some remains of the roots.
Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.	And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned up, and do not return.
Â¶ De cura Grandinum palpebrarum oculi.	De the treatment of the eyelids of the eye:
Caput IX.	Head 9.
Multotiens accidit in palpebris aliquid quod assimilatur Crandini in fortitudine sua, et sua duricie, et propter illud nominatur Grando: et est aggregatio humiditatis grossae in palpebra superiore, et palpebra inferiore.	This often happens in the eyelids what is absorbed by Crandini in his strength, and hardness, and for that reason it is called Grando: and is an aggregation of moist gross in the upper eyelid, and lower eyelid.
Operatio ergo in eis est, ut consideres tunc, si est Grando procedens in eo, quod apparet de palpebra, et mouentur ad omnem partem, et res eius est facilis.	Operation then on them is, so that you consider at that time, if there is Grando proceeding from it, which appears to the eyelid, and move all parts, and the matter of it is easy.
Finde ergo super eam fissura per latitudinem.	Then find on it a slit across its width.
Deinde excoria eam ab omni parte cum facilitate, donec euadat.	Then scrape off that from all parts with ease, until it is peeled off.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncino, et abscinde ipsam.	Then suspend on it with a hook, and cut it off.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi abscisio eius, nisi postquam tu penetras palpebram cum incisione parumper, tunc nocet infirmo illud in aliquo.	If however you are not prepared to cut it off, unless after you have penetrated the eyelid with a slight incision, then it will hurt the sick person.
Quod si fissura est magna: tunc aggrega ipsam cum sutura: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	That if the slit is large: then aggregate to it with a stitch: and care for it, until it heals.
Et si est parua, non superueniet tibi malum ex ea.	And if it is small, do not worry about it.
Vnguentum enim restaurat ipsam, et incarnat eam.	The ointments restore that and makes it carnation.
Et si grando est decliuis ad interiora auris uersus superficiem intrinsecam, tunc inuersa palpebram, et suspende grandinem cum uncino: praeter quod indigeas incisione, et preme eam ab omni parte.	And if Grando is hidden to the inside of the ear towards its surface on the inside, then turn it around and hang on it the hook: except that you penetrate the incision, and press it from all parts.
Quod si elongatur palpebra per incisionem, non nocet illud in aliquo.	If the eyelid is stretched by an incision, that does not hurt in any way.
Deinde ablue oculum post incisionem grandinis, cum aqua salsa: et cura locum cum eo quod incarnat, donec sanetur infirmus.	Then afterward cleanse the eye after the cut with salt water; and care for the place where it is swollen until the wound heals.
Â¶ De cura Axirnath palpebrarum.	In the treatment of eyelid wounds:
Caput X.	Head 10.
Axirnath est adeps qui generatur in tunicis palpebrae superioris: et plurimum quidem accidit illud pueris: et ipsum grauat oculos eorum, et accidunt eis catarri in matutinis, et non possunt intueri lumen solis, propterea, quod lachrymae properant ad eos, et propter illud uides eos discumbere super facies suas semper, et super eas dormiunt, et sunt palpebrae eorum sub superciliis humidae, quas iam cooperuit inflatio: et eminentia quidem Axirnath apparens est oculo, et quando tu premis locum cum digitis tuis, sentis Axirnath inter eos.	Axirnath is the fat that is found in the eyelids; and it often happens that young people suffer from it; and this affects their eyes, causing their vision to become blurry, and they cannot see the sunlight; because the tears flow towards them, and because of this the eyelids are always wet with them, having swelled up; and the prominence of Axirnath is clear to the eye, and when you press the spot with your fingers, you feel Axirnath between them.
Et modus operationis eius est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And its mode of action is that the sick person places his head in your lap.
Deinde accipe pannum lini, et praepara in eo licinia, et fac ex illo licinio circulum secundum quantitatem quod continet Axirnath ab omni parte.	Then take a piece of linen cloth and prepare it with a ribbon; and make from it a circle according to the amount that contains Axirnath on all sides.
Deinde pone eum super eam, et preme cum digitis tuis ab omni parte, ut aggregetur Axirnath in medio circuli.	Then place it on top of it, and press with your fingers from all sides so that Axirnath is collected in the center of the circle.
Deinde finde in medio illius humiditatis cum spatumili incidente fissuras per latitudinem, et non sit fissura maior illa quae fit in phlebotomia in profundo.	Then find in the middle of it with a blade of grass the width of a hair, and do not let there be a larger crack than that which is made in the phlebotomy in the deep.
Aut oportet ut findas cutem totam, donec peruenias ad Axirnath in pluribus enim dispositionibus procedit Axirnath ex fissura secundum formam frusti pinguedinis albae.	Or it should be that you find the entire skin, until you reach Axirnath; for Axirnath often proceeds from a crack in many locations; for Axirnath is often formed from the width of a hair when the wound is healed.
Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.	Then take it out with the cloth that you have soaked between your fingers at the outside; and you should move your hand to the right and left until it is scattered; and be careful not to add it to the crack, so as not to reach the eye with the blade of grass, and let it go.
Si autem non appareat tibi Axirnath in principio fissurae, tu addas in fissura parum cum facilitate, donec procedat Axirnath.	But if you do not see the axilla at first in the incision, you add a little to the incision with ease until the axilla comes out.
Deinde extrahe eam, sicut diximus.	Then remove it outside, as we have said.
Deinde submerge pannos in aceto et aqua, et pone eos super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis.	Then soak the cloth in vinegar and water, and place it on the spot, and tighten it with flour.
Et ex hominibus sunt qui terunt salem, et ponunt ipsum in concauitate fissurae, ut liquefiat quod remansit ex illa humiditate.	And there are those who grind salt, and put it in the incision to melt what remains of the moisture from that.
Deinde cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then care for yourself until you recover.
Si autem accidat in loco apostema calidum, tune cura ipsum cum emplastris sedatiuis, donec sanetur.	But if a hot blister occurs in the place, then care for that with wet poultices, until it heals.
Â¶ De modis Ataxmir oculi, id est, cum palpebra mollificatur oculi, unde fit ut rugetur sicut non debet.	As for the methods of Ataxmir regarding the eyes: that is, when the eyelids become soft to the eyes, so that they do not turn red as they should.
Caput XI.	Chapter XI.
Quando nascuntur in palpebris oculi pili additi praeter cursum sub pilis naturalibus, et antiquantur: tunc ipsi nocent oculo, et faciunt accidere modos aegritudinum, sicut lachrymas assiduas, et mollificationem palpebrarum, et albuginem, donec fit illud caussa destructionis oculi.	When hair grows in the eyelids different from the natural course of hair, and becomes ingrained: then it hurts the eye, and causes diseases such as persistent tears, softness of the eyelids, and discoloration, until it destroys the eye itself.
Et Ataxmir quidem oculi curatur secundum quatuor modos.	And Ataxmir also treats the eyes according to four methods.
Aut per cauterium cum igne.	Or with a cauterizer using fire.
Aut cum medicina acuta, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo cauterii.	Or with acute medicine, as stated in the chapter on cauterization.
Aut curatur Ataxmir per incisionem et suturam.	Or Ataxmir is treated by incision and suturing.
Aut per cannas, secundum quod ego dicam.	Or with canes, as I call it.
Oportet ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	It should be placed so that the head of the nurse is in your lap.
Deinde conuerte palpebram oculi manu tua sinistra.	Then treat the eye with your left hand.
Si ergo conuertitur, bonum est.	If it is turned in the right direction, that is good.
Et si non: intromitte acum in eam, in qua sit filum ab inferiori parte palpebrae, et fac penetrare acum cum filo desuper, et sit illud prope pilos ipsos, id est, prope marginem palpebrae, in quo nascuntur pili: et trahe filum ad superiora cum palpebra, et conuerte eam cum radio.	But if not: push it in where the hair grows from the lower part of the eyelid, and let it penetrate with a needle through the skin, and let it rest next to the hair itself, that is, next to the edge of the eyelid, where the hair grow: and pull the thread up superiorly with the eyelid, and turn it around.
Deinde finde in interiori parte palpebrae sub pilis additis cum spatumili incidente a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus.	Then find in the inner part of the eyelids under the hairs added with a spatula incident from the greater tear until the smaller tear.
Deinde extrahe filum, et pone sub palpebra puluillum paruum ex cotto, aut panno: deinde signa super palpebram cum encaustro, quod sit sicut figura folii myrti.	Then remove the thread, and place under the eyelid a small feather from wool or cloth: then mark on the eyelid with the caustic, which should be as long as the shape of the feather of myrtle.
Verumtamen oportet, ut fit figura secundum quantitatem et eleuationem palpebrae: quoniam iam diuersificatur illud in hominibus.	However, it should be done according to the quantity and elevation of the eyelid: because that varies a lot among people.
Ex eis enim est, qui indiget ut incidatur ex palpebra quantitas magna, secundum quantitatem quae mollificatur a palpebra.	From these there is one who needs to be cut from the eyelid according to the quantity that softens from the eyelid.
Deinde cum spatumili finde super duas lineas quas signasti, et incipe a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus, et sit fissura una prope pilos naturales, sicut est grossitudo radii.	Then with the spatula find on two lines that you have marked and begin from the greater tear until the smaller tear, and let there be a groove one near the natural hairs, as is the thickness of the radius.
Deinde intromitte uncinum in uno duorum angulorum cutis.	Then insert the hook in one of two angles of the skin.
Deinde excoria ipsam totam.	Then scrape off the whole thing.
Deinde aggrega cum sutura duo labia, cum acu et filo lana subtili: et absterge sanguinem, et fac adhaerere quod superfluit ex filis super duo supercilia, cum quibusdam rebus inuiscantibus, si uis facere illud: et si non, non cures.	Then gather together with a stitch the two lips, with an aiguille and a fine thread: and wipe away the blood, and let it stick to what is excess from the hairs on the two eyelids, with some things that you can smell, if you want to do this: and if not, then it does not matter.
Deinde dimitte suturam et fila usque ad tres dies, aut quatuor: postea cura illud.	Then let go of the stitch and thread until three or four days: then take care of that.
Et si uis, dimitte uulnus absque sutura, et cura ipsum cum eo, quod exsiccat et constringit.	And if you want, let go of the hook without a stitch, and take care of it itself with what dries up and tightens.
Nam palpebra eleuatur apud sigillationem uulneris et aggregationem eius: sed futura est melior.	For the eyelid is released at the sealing of the wound and the aggregation thereof: but that which comes later is better.
Hunc modum curandi Ataxmir docuerunt antiqui.	In this way, Ataxmir taught how to treat it.
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.	However, there is worry about the sick, and it is from a good operation, and there is no fear in that.
Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est, ut signes super palpebram figuram, quae sit sicut figura folii myrti, sicut narrauimus.	And another way too, which Ataxmir also mentions: and it is as follows: to mark on the eyelid a figure like that of the feather of myrtle, as we have related.
Deinde eleua palpebram cum tribus uncinis separatis, aut aggregatis, secundum formam hanc quae sequitur, deinde incide quod superfluit cum forficibus paruis, secundum hanc formam, cum aequalitate incisionis.	Then wipe the eyelids with three separate or gathered hooks, according to this form that follows, and then cut off what is in excess with small scissors, according to this form, with equal incision.
Si autem non est tibi possibile tenere uncinum, et non aequatur illud: tunc accipe acum in qua sit filum, et intromitte ipsum in medio figurae: et intromitte filum aliud prope lachrymale maius, et filum secundum prope lachrymale minus: et aggrega inter digitos tuos fila cum aequalitate.	If you are not able to hold the hook, and it does not fit [the eyelid]: then take the thread in which the hook is placed, and insert it into the middle of this figure: and insert another thread next to the larger tear, and a second thread next to the smaller tear: and gather the threads between your fingers with equal tension.
Deinde eleua manum tuam eleuatione aequali: et eleua cutem super quam est signatum cotum, sicut narrauimus.	Then wipe your hand with equal wiping [motion]: and wipe the skin over which is marked the crease, as we have described.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then gather together the two eyelids with a stitch: and take care of it, until it heals.
Si uero accidat apostema apud incisionem tuam, aut fissuram tuam: seda illud apostema cum caeroto, et his similibus, ex unguentis sedantibus.	If, however, there is a hematoma on your incision or a tear: but let that hematoma be with green ointment, and these others like it, sitting on oil-based ointment.
Et quandoque accidit palpebrae etiam, ut conuertantur pili eius.	And when the eyelids also turn, so that his hair grows out.
Oportet ergo ut utaris in ea quod diximus in incisione: sed sutura utrisque magis est artificialis.	Therefore you must use the same method for the eyes as we have described for the incision: but the stitch on both sides is more artificial.
Â¶ De cura Ataxmir cum cannis.	In the care of Ataxmir with canes.
ET Est, ut conuertas palpebram, et scindas fissuram quae est deintus, secundum quod narraui.	And is it that you turn the eyelid, and split the crease that is inside, according to what we have described.
Deinde arte fac duas cannas, aut duo ligna subtilia: quarum longitudo sit secundum longitudinem palpebrae, et latitudo earum sit minor latitudine spatumilis: et tu iam incidisti in extremitatibus utriusque ab utrisque partibus ubi tenes fila.	Then make two canes, or two thin sticks: whose length is according to the length of the eyelid, and whose width is less than the width of a quill: and you have already cut at both ends where you hold the threads.
Deinde aggrega utramque cum subtilitate super illud quod superfluit ex palpebra oculi, et stringe duas cannas ab utrisque partibus strictura forti, et dimitte eam diebus aliquot.	Then gather each one together with care over what is in excess on the edge of the eyelid, and tightly tie the two canes from both sides with a strong knot, and let it go after a few days.
Cutis enim stricta morietur, et denigrabitur, et putrefiet, donec cadet per se.	For the skin is stiff and will die, and will rot, and will fall off, until it falls away on its own.
Si ergo tardatur, tunc incide eam cum forficibus.	If it is delayed, then cut it with scissors.
Deinde cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it until it heals.
Cum ergo consolidatur, eleuatur palpebra: et non pungunt pili.	When it has consolidated, remove the splint: and do not poke at the hair.
Et haec est forma duarum cannarum, quas facies secundum hanc figuram, et quantitatem in longitudinem et latitudinem.	And this is the form of two tubes, which you shall make according to this figure, and their quantity in length and breadth.
Â¶ De eleuatione pilorum pungentium in oculo cum acu.	Â§ On the piercing of the hairs in the eye with an aiguille.
Caput XII.	Chapter XII.
Operatio in illo est, ut accipias acum subtilem, et intromittas in eam filum ex serico subtile, lene.	The operation in that case is, to take an aiguille (a sharp-pointed needle) and to introduce a fine silk thread into the eye.
Deinde aggreges extremitates eius, et nodes utramque nodo subtili ualde: et sit longitudo filorum palmus unus.	Then bind the ends of it with a fine knot on each, and let the length of the threads be such that they may touch the knuckle of the hand.
Deinde compone in Alinxotati filum aliud subtile sub eo in breui, et noda extremitates eius si uis.	Then compose in a ligature a second fine thread under the first, and bind the ends of it if you wish.
Deinde ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo, et sit prope solem ut declaretur operatio: quoniam est operatio subtilis, uel minuta.	Then put the sick person's head in your lap, and place him near to the light that the operation may be declared: for it is a delicate operation, or minute.
Deinde intromitte acum cum alinxotati in radicem palpebrae, et fac eam penetrare in palpebram festinanter, donec extrahas eam desuper pilum naturalem.	Then introduce the aiguille with the ligature in the root of the eyelid, and let it penetrate into the eyelid rapidly, until it has passed over the natural eyelash.
Deinde trahe pilum usque supra alinxotati: et intromitte in alinxotati illum pilum: si est unus, aut duo, aut tres, non plures.	Then draw the eyelash up above the ligature: and introduce into the ligature that eyelash; if it be one, or two, or three, not more.
Deinde trahe manum tuam cum eo, donec egrediatur pilus cum alinxotati in palpebra cum pilo naturali.	Then take away your hand with it, until the eyelash has come out with the ligature on the eyelid with the natural eyelashes.
Si autem trahatur alinxotati, et non egrediatur pilus cum ea: trahes alinxotati ad inferiora, cum filo quod tu composuisti in ea, donec egrediatur alinxotati ex foramine superiori, et uideas eam uisione oculi: tunc enim trahes alinxotati, et filum: et extrahe utraque, et claude oculum: et dimitte ipsum clausum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec adhaereat pilus loco suo, et nascatur super ipsum caro.	If the ligature is drawn out and the eyelash does not come out with it: then draw the ligature lower down on the eyelid, with a thread which you have composed in it, until the ligature comes out of the upper orifice of the eyelid, and is removed from the eye: then take both out, and close the eye: and let him go closed for two days, or three, until the eyelash has become attached to its place, and has grown over the top of the flesh.
Quod si pilus est breuis, tunc aut associa ei pilum longum ex pilis naturalibus, et eleuatur cum eo: aut dimitte ipsum, donec elongetur post spacium, et tunc eleua ipsum.	If the hair is short, then either attach to it a long hair from natural hairs, and cut off with it; or leave it until it has grown longer after a gap, and then cut it off.
Â¶ De cura Alxatrati quae accidit in palpebra superiori.	On the treatment of the condition affecting the upper eyelid as described by Alcaz
Caput XIII.	Chapter XIII. On the head.
Quando accidit oculo haec Alxatrati, nominatur Leporina.	When it affects the eye, this is called Leporina.
Et haec Alxatrati est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And this condition of Al-Khazani is either innate or acquired.
Accidentalis ergo fit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et similium illis.	So the acquired one results from the hardening of the membrane, or from a cut, or from cauterization, and like these things.
Et modus operationis in ea est, ut tu findas illam consolidationem, et ut separes labia eius, et ponas in eo quod est inter ea licinium ex lino, et liges eam, donec sanetur.	And the mode of action in it is that you find this hardening, and that you separate her lips, and place in it what is between them from linen thread, and bind her, until she heals.
Et non oportet, ut utaris in curatione eius rebus quae exiccant et constringunt: nam si tu facis illud, redit Alxatrati deterior quam fuit: imo utere in ea rebus quae mollificant, sicut foenumgraecum: et embroca cum aqua, in qua cocta sit althea, semen lini: et unguento dyaquilon, quod liquefactum sit cum aliquo ex oleis: et inuolue cum eo licinium, et cura cum eo.	And you should not use, in her treatment, those things that dry and constrict: for if you do so, it returns worse than it was before: but use, in her, those things that soften, such as fenugreek; and dip it in water in which althaea has been boiled, and semen lini; and anoint with the ointment called dyaquilon, which softens when mixed with some oils; and wrap it up with linen thread, and treat it with it.
Et thesaurus curationis tuae est, ut coneris omni ingenio, ut non consolidetur, secundum formam quae fuit in primis.	And the treasure of your treatment is that you should guard against any ingenuity, so that it does not harden, following the form which it had at first.
Et haec quidem operatio quam diximus, non est nisi quaedam rectificatio Alxatrati, ut non redeat forma loci secundum quod fuit omnino.	And this operation which we have described is nothing but a certain correction of Al-Khazani, so that it does not return to the form of the place at all as it was before.
Â¶ De cura Alxatrati quae fit in palpebra inferiori, et est rugatio uel contractio sursum ad dextrum et sinistrum.	On the treatment of the condition affecting the lower eyelid, which is rust or contraction upward toward the right and left.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter XVIII. On the head.
Haec Alxatrati quae fit inferius, est quae uere nominatur Alxatrati.	This condition of Al-Khazani which affects the lower part is what is called in truth Al-Khazani.
Et est naturalis, et est accidentalis.	And this is either innate or acquired. Quod naturalis est, ex causa uulnerum in palpebra infer
Et accidentalis fit ex uulnere, aut fissura, aut cauterio, et illis similibus.	And the accidental is done from the ulna, or a crack, or a scar, and those similar.
Et uia operationis in ea est, ut accipias acum, in qua sit filum duplum, et tingas eam in carnem, et facias eam penetrare a lachrymali sinistro usque ad lachrymale dextrum, donec perueniat filum in duabus extremitatibus carnis.	And the path of operation is in it, so that you take an ear, in which there is a double filament, and dip it into meat, and let it penetrate from the left tear until it reaches the right tear, until the filament reaches both ends of the flesh.
Deinde extende carnem ad superiora cum acu, et incide eam cum spatumili lato.	Then extend the meat towards the top with a sharp tool, and cut it with a chisel on the side.
Si ergo redit figura palpebrae secundum quod oportet, est bonum.	If then returns the figure of the eyelid according to what is necessary, it is good.
Et si non, accipe radium, et pone ipsum in fissuram, et conuerte cum eo palpebram: et finde duas fissuras in latere interiore palpebrae, et sint extremitates duarum fissurarum ex duobus angulis incisionis, donec concurrant et fiat ex eis angulus: donec quando aggregantur fiat figura earum haec figura, et est litera lauda graeca.	And if not, take the radius, and put it in the crack, and turn it with it: and find two cracks on the inner side of the eyelid, and the ends of the two cracks are from two angles of incision, until they meet and become one angle: until when they come together, becomes this figure, and is the Greek letter lambda.
Deinde aufer illam carnem per quantitatem, quod est latus eius acutum inferius, ab eo quod sequitur palpebram.	Then remove that meat by its quantity, which is the acute lower side of it, from there that follows the eyelid.
Deinde aggrega partes separatas: sue eam cum filo lanae.	Then bring together the separated parts: sew them with a sheep's thread.
Deinde cura eas cum eo quod diximus, de medicinis mollificantibus, et liciniis, donec sanentur.	Then take care of them with that which I have said, about the soothing medicines and the liniments, until they are healed.
Et si Alxatrati accidat ex fissura, et sutura, aut cauterio: tunc oportet ut findas fissura plana sub pilis palpebrarum, etiam secundum quod praecessit.	And if the surgery of Albucasis has happened from a crack, and stitching, or cauterization: then you must find a flat crack under the eyelids' hairs, also according to what preceded it.
Deinde separa inter duo labia cum licinio, secundum quod diximus.	Then separate the two lips with a liniment, according to what I have said.
Et summa sermonis de cura Alxatrati, quando est desuper, aut inferius, est, ut currat in ea operatio, secundum quod praeparatur ex forma Alxatrati.	And the whole speech about the care of Albucasis, when it is on top, or below, is that it runs in it, according to what it has prepared from the form of Albucasis.
Ipsa namque est multarum diuersitatum in forma: et artifex prudens praeparat ingenium cum quocunque modo est possibile ei, donec redire faciat figuram ad formam naturalem, aut prope eam, et ipsemet infirmus, secundum quod conuenit ei ex operatione et instrumentis in plurimis dispositionibus.	For it is many different forms: and the prudent craftsman prepares his mind with whatever way is possible for him, until he returns the figure to the natural form, or close to it, and himself becomes ill, according to what suits him from operation and instruments in many dispositions.
Â¶ De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.	About the adhesions of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or cornea.
Caput XV.	De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum
Quandoque accidit haec consolidatio multis hominibus, ita ut consolidetur palpebra superior cum albedine oculi, et prohibeat ipsum ab operationibus suis naturalibus.	When this consolidation happens to many people, so that the upper eyelid is consolidated with the white of the eye, and prevents itself from its natural operations:
Oportet ergo quod intromittas extremitatem radii sub palpebra, et eleues eam sursum: aut extendas eam cum uncino: deinde incide adhaerentiam cum spatumili subtili, quod non sit cum acuitate incisionis spatumilium, imo sit obtusum parumper: ut non inquietetur infirmus apud operationem, et remoueatur spatumile, et laedat oculum cum acuitate sua: et sit incisio tua quasi tu excories illam adhaerentiam cum facilitate, donec quando redit palpebra secundum formam suam naturalem, et sanetur adhaerentia tota.	It is necessary that you introduce the tip of the radius under the eyelid, and lift it up: or that you extend it with a tiny hook: then cut the adhesion with a very thin knife, which does not have the sharpness of the incision of the scalpel, but rather is slightly blunt: so that the sick person does not disturb at the operation, and moves the hook, and hurts his eye with its sharpness: and make your incision almost like you remove that adhesion with ease, until when the eyelid returns to its natural form, and heals the whole adhesion.
Funde tunc in oculum aquam salsam, cum aqua ablue ipsum: aut distilla in ipsum ex sief facto, ex ziniar dissoluto cum aqua.	Then pour into the eye water, with water wash it: or distill into it from a water-to-alcohol solution, dissolved from zinc with water.
Deinde separa inter palpebram et oculum cum licinio lini: et pone super oculum lanam infusam cum albugine oui: et post diem tertium utere sief, et cum solidatiuis, donec sanetur.	Then separate between the eyelid and the eye with a lint: and place on the eye wool soaked with wax: and after three days use alcohol, and with consolidations, until it heals.
Â¶ De incisione ungulae et eminentiae carnis lachrymarum.	About the incision of the nail and the eminence of the flesh of tears.
Caput XVI.	When you make an incision in the nail and in the emin
Scias, quod ungula est secundum duos modos.	You know that the nail is second to two ways:
Aut est neruosa: et est similis sifac duro, subtili.	Or it is a nerve: and it is similar to the hard bone of the sifac, thin.
Aut est non neruosa, similis humiditati congelatae albae: quae quando tangit cam ferrum, aut conaris capere eam cum uncino, abscinditur, et non figitur in ea uncinus.	Or it is not a nerve, similar to the frozen moisture of snow; which when it touches iron, or when you pick it up with a hook, it breaks off, and does not stick to it.
Et utraeque species non incipiunt, nisi a lachrymali maiore, usquequo uadit paulatim, donec cooperit uisum, et prohibet lumen, et motum oculi.	And both kinds of species do not begin until from the larger tear, until they slowly spread out, and prevent water, and stop the movement of the eye.
Et modus operandi in incisione eius est: ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the way to operate on it is: so that the sick person puts his head in your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et eleua palpebram manu tua.	Then open his eyes and close his eyelids with your hand.
Deinde collige ungulam cum uncino paucae duplationis, et extende eam ad superiora.	Then take the nail with a little hook and extend it towards the upper part.
Deinde accipe acum, et intromitte in eam pilum ex pilis equi, et bouis, aut uaccae: et sit filum forte, et duplica extremitatem acus parumper, et fige eam in medio ungulae: et penetra eam cum acu, et liga cum filo ungulam, et extende eam ad superiora: et excoria cum pilo latus ungulae quod sequitur pupillam, ac si tu serres eam cum pilo usque ad postreimnum eius.	Then take the awl and insert it into the nail with a little hook, or a pin: and fasten the thread firmly at both ends, and fix it in the middle of the nail: and pierce it with the awl, and tie the thread to the nail, and extend it towards the upper part: and scrape away the flesh with the hair next to the nail which follows the pupil, as if you were pressing it with the hair until it reaches its tip.
Deinde incide residuum in radice lachrymalis cum spatumili subtili, aut cum forficibus paruis: et dimitte carnem lachrymalis naturalem, ut non accidat ex incisione eius cursus lachrymarum assiduus.	Then cut the residue at the root of the eyelid with a sharp knife, or with small forceps: and let go of the natural eyelid flesh so that the usual flow of tears does not run out from the incision.
Et quandoque extenditur ungula cum uncino solo: aut cum filo, sicut diximus.	And when the nail is extended with a little hook: or with a thread, as we have said.
Deinde excoriatur cum spatumili leni, cuius haec est forma.	Then scrape it away with a sharp knife whose edge is slightly curved.
Et caue, ne tangat spatumile tunicam corneam, et accidat in ea ruptura, et perforetur pupilla.	And be careful so that the blade does not touch the ÑÐ¾Ð³ue cloth, and do not make a tear in it, or else the pupil would be pierced.
Deinde post incisionem, proice in oculum aliquid salis contriti, aut ex sief facto ex ziniar, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then, after the incision, pour into the eye some crushed salt, or take some of the solution made from the ash of a sheep's ear: and leave it until the next day.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur.	Then care for the eye with what is necessary until it is healed.
Quod si ungula est non neruosa, et non potes intromittere in eam acum, neque figitur in ea uncinus, tunc multotiens curatur haec species ungulae cum medicinis, et sanatur sicut narraui in diuisione.	If the nail is not nerveless, and you cannot insert an awl into it, nor fix a hook into it: then often treat this nail-disease with medicines, and heal it as a thumb is healed in its separation.
Quod si uis incidere eam, tunc aperi oculum infirmi, et accipe spatumile subtile, lene, debilis acuitatis, secundum hanc formam.	If you want to cut the nail, then open the eye slowly with your hand, and take a sharp blade, slightly acute, such as this one.
Et rade ungulam desuper rasione cum subtilitate.	Then scrape the top of the nail with care.
Quod si uides quod ipsa rarificatur et confringitur, et imprimit in eam rasio, tunc distilla ex hora tua in oculum ex sief facto ex ziniar, aut ex sief rubeo, aut sale trito: et opila oculum usque ad diem alium.	If you see that the nail is becoming thinner and tighter, and it is impressing itself into the blade, then pour into the eye from your own saliva made into a solution, or from a red ash, or from salt ground fine: and blind the eye until the next day.
Deinde itera super ipsam operationem, donec remoueatur totum eius.	Then he would iterate over the same operation, until he had removed everything of it.
Nisi contrarium sit tibi in oculo apostema calidum: tunc enim dimitte ipsam, et cura apostema, donec sanetur.	If there is no bloodshot eyes, hot swelling: then you should let go of the same, and take care of the wound, until it heals up.
Deinde itera operationem super ipsam cum rasione, donec sanetur.	Then he would iterate over the same operation with a razor, until it has healed up.
Eminentia autem carnis lachrymalis, si nocet in oculo nocumento magno, suspendatur cum uncino, et incide ex ea partem eius: et non ultimes incisionem, ut non accidat cursus lachrymarum.	If there is a great pain in the eyes of the flesh, it should be suspended with an anchor, and cut from that part of it: and not the last cut, so that the course of tears does not run.
Deinde stilla in lachrymale sief rubeum, aut factum ex ziniari, donec sanetur.	Then add a little rub or made with zein to the eye, or made from it, until it has healed up.
Â¶ De incisione Alguardenic, et carne nata in oculo.	Regarding the incision of the Albucasis, and the flesh born in the eye.
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII.
Nascitur quandoque in quibusdam oculis hominum caro rubea composita, uel superposita, donec cooperit pupillam, aut appropinquat, aut stringit super palpebras, et fortasse conuertit palpebras ad exteriora: et assimilatur rosae balaustinae.	When it also appears in the eyes of some people's flesh, red or applied, until it covers the pupil, or comes close, or tightens on the eyelids, and perhaps turns the eyelids outward: and it is absorbed by the rose of the folds.
Et operatio in ea etiam est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the operation in it is that he puts a sick head in your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et collige illam carnem totam cum uncinis conuenientibus ad illud: et tene illud cum forcipe uno, aut gesti.	Then open his eyes and take all the flesh with an anchor suitable for it: and hold it with one clamp, or grasp it.
Deinde incide carnem in primis, donec finiatur totum eius cum incisorio.	Then cut into the flesh first, until it has finished completely with a razor blade.
Et caue ab oculo, ut non laedas ipsum apud operationem: et sit incisio tua qua ipsam incidis, aut cum spatumili, quod narrauimus in incisione ungulae: aut cum forficibus paruis, cum quibus colligitur asebel, secundum quod ueniet forma eius post hoc capitulum.	And remove from the eye so that you do not leave it during the operation: and let your cut be what you cut, or with a chisel, which we have spoken about in the incision of the nails: or with small forks, with which Bel is bound, according to which his form will come after this chapter.
Cum ergo completur incisio tua, et remouetur tota alguardenici, tunc imple oculum ex sale contrito: aut distilla in eum puluerem rubeum, et similia illi ex medicinis corrosiuis: et pone super oculum deforis cottum cum albugine oui: ut securetur ab apostemate calido.	When your cut is finished, and all the Alguezenici has been removed, then fill the eye with crushed salt: or distil into it red powder, and other similar corrosive medicines: and place on the eye a cotton wool with albugine, so that it may be protected from the hot swelling.
Quod si remanet ex alguardenici aliquid, et dominatur tibi sanguis calidus, et times apostema calidum: tunc dimitte oculum, et cura ipsum cum eo quod sedat apostema.	If something remains of the allium and a hot blood prevails over you, and you fear a caldough: then let go of the eye, and take care of itself as it sits on the caldough.
Deinde itera super ipsum cum operatione, donec sanetur.	Then wipe it again on the eye with the operation until it is healed.
Et similiter fac cum carne addita quae accidit in oculo ex hac specie.	And do the same for the flesh that comes to the eye from this kind.
Verumtamen oportet, ut alienes curationem omnis oculi debilis ex uia naturali, aut ex uia accidentali, operando cum ferro: et non intromittas manum tuam in aliqua harum operationum, donec uideas, quod illud membrum est tolerans illam operationem.	However, it is necessary that you do not interfere with the cure of any weak eye from natural or accidental causes, operating with iron: and do not put your hand in any of these operations until you feel, for that member is tolerant of that operation.
Â¶ De collectione Sebel ex oculo.	Regarding the removal of Sebaceous from the eye.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter 18: The Head.
Sebel sunt uenae rubeae quae texuntur super oculum, et prohibent uisui operationem suam: et debilitant oculum cum longitudine dierum.	SÐµÐ±Ðµl are small red lumps that grow on the eye and prevent surgery from being done: and they weaken the eye with the passage of days.
Necesse est ergo tibi in primis, ut consideres, si oculus in quo est Sebel, est fortis, et non est in eo aegritudo aliqua, praeter Sebel: tunc collige Sebel eius.	Therefore, you must first take into account, if the eye in which Sebel is, is strong, and there is no other disease in it except Sebel: then gather Sebel from it.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo.	And is, as you command the sick, to put his head in your lap.
Deinde suspende illas uenas cum uncino uno, aut duobus secundum prudentiam tuam: et sit uncinus subtilis duplationis, secundum hanc formam, aut sint duo uncini gradat in corpore uno, secundum hanc formam.	Then hang those small lumps with one or two hooks according to your prudence: and let the hook be thin, double-long according to this form, or let there be two hooks in one body, according to this form.
Deinde collige cum forficibus subtilibus illas uenas cum subtilitate, et absterge sanguinem hora post horam, donec uideas illas uenas remoueri ex oculo, et resoluuntur: et caue ne laedas oculum cum extremitatibus spatumilis.	Then take with subtle hooks those small lumps with subtlety, and wipe the blood hour after hour until you feel them come out of the eye, and resolve: and do not leave the eye with sharp tips.
Et sit operatio tua in meridie coram sole, et sis firmus in operatione tua ualde: ut non incidas nisi illas uenas.	And let your operation be in the middle of the day before the sun, and be strong in your operation very much: so that you do not fall except for those small lumps.
Et cum tu expleueris, tunc distilla in oculum sief uiride, aut rubeum: ut sua acuitate corrodat quod remansit ex sebel.	And when you have emptied it, then distill in the eye green viride, or red: so that its sharpness corrode what remains of Sebel.
Si autem non est tibi possibile colligere illud totum in illa hora, tunc emplastra oculum cum eo, quod sedat dolorem oculi: et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur dolor eius: et securetur ab apostemate calido: deinde itera super ipsum secundum modum eundem, donec sanetur.	But if you cannot collect that whole thing at that time, then patch the eye with that, which soothes the eye's pain; and leave him for a few days, until his pain subsides: and keep him from hot poultices: and then put it on again in the same way, until he is healed.
Et haec est forma forficis.	And this is the form of the scalpel.
Â¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.	Â§ On reducing a rupture to the nose.
Caput XIX.	Chapter XIX.
Nominant medici Arissati Fistulam, quam curas cum cauterio, aut cum medicina acuta comburente, secundum quod praecessit eius narratio.	They name the medical instrument as a fistula, which they use with caustic or with sharp-burning medicine, according to what has preceded in his story.
Et si non sanatur, tunc non est ingenium in ea: nisi ut findas super apostema apud natiuitatem eius, et extrahas totam humiditatem quae est in eo et pus, donec detegatur os.	And if he does not heal, then there is no skill in it: unless you discover the pus and all the moisture that is in it and the swelling, until the opening is found.
Cum ergo detegitur os, et uides in eo corruptionem, aut nigredinem, tunc rade ipsum cum instrumento, cuius forma est haec.	But when the opening is discovered, and you see corruption or blackness in it, then shave it with an instrument whose form is this.
Et nominatur Asperi capitis.	And it is called the scalp of asperity.
Fiat ex ferro indo, et sit caput eius rotundum sicut azir, quod sit punctatum punctatione limae, aut punctatione aliskilferi punctatione subtili: et pone ipsum super locum corruptum ossis.	Let it be made of iron, and let the head be round like a chisel, which is pierced with a file or with a fine saw: and set the skull on the place where the corruption is.
Deinde reuolue ipsum inter digitos tuos, et tu preme manum tuam parumper, donec scias quod illa corruptio iam rasa est: et fac illud aliquotiens.	Then roll the skull between your fingers and press your hand lightly, until you know that that corruption is now smooth: and do it often.
Deinde restaura locum cum medicinis exiccatiuis stipticis.	Then restore the place with drying styptics.
Si ergo consolidatur locus, et nascitur in eo caro, et abscinditur cursus saniei: et remanet quadraginta diebus, et non renouatur, et non apostematur, et non accidit in eo accidens: tunc scias quia iam sanatus est.	But if that place has hardened and a bone has grown there and the scar has healed: and it remains for forty days, and does not break out again, and does not suppurate, and no accident happens to it: then you shall know that he is now healed.
Et si non, tunc non est in eo ingenium, nisi reducere fistulam ad foramen nasi, secundum hanc formam.	And if not, then there is no skill in it unless a tube is placed into the nose, according to this form.
Et est, ut detegas ab osse secundo cum ferro, aut cum medicina acuta: et cum detectum est os, tunc accipe terebrum secundum hanc formam, sit extremitas ferrea, triangulata: et lignum eius sit pyramis extenuata usque ad extremitatem, sicut uides.	And is, in order to detect the second bone with iron, or with sharp-burning medicine: and when the bone is detected, then take a twig according to this form, whose end is an iron rod, triangular; and let its wood be extended into a pyramid up to its end, as you see.
Deinde pone illud super os ipsum: et sit illud prope lachrymale: et elonga manum tuam ab oculo parum.	Then put this above his own skull: and place it near his tear duct: and extend your hand a little from his eye.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum terebro, donec penetret os, et sentiat illud infirmus: per hoc quod inuenit uentum exire ex eo, quando tenet manum suam super nasum suum.	Then turn your hand with the skull, so that it penetrates the bone, and feel whether it is weak: in this way he will find the pulse coming out from it when he holds his own hand on his own nose.
Ergo tunc restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis exiccantibus, sicut docui te.	Therefore at that time restore the place with the stinging medicines, as I taught you.
Cum ergo nascitur caro, et induratur locus: tunc materia quae effundebatur ad exteriora, redit ad nasum: est ergo leuius illud super infirmum.	When therefore the flesh is born and the place hardens: then the substance which flows out to the outside returns to the nose: so it is lighter over the weak one.
Â¶ De reductione eminentiae Oculi.	On the reduction of the greatness of the eye.
Caput XX.	Chapter XX - On the Reduction of the Greatness of the
Quando eminet Oculus cum totalitate sua, et non accidit in uisu nocumentum, neque diminutio: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum: deinde phlebotomes eum: postea ponas uentosas in ceruice absque scarificatione, sed cum suctione.	When the eye eminently and completely comes out, and does not happen to be injured or diminished: then you should relieve the weak one: then you should bleed him: then you shall put the wound-healers in the skin without scaring, but with suction.
Deinde pone super Oculum linimentum quod fit ex acacia, et aloe, et olibano, et sarcocolla.	Then put on the eye a liniment which is made from acacia and aloe and olive oil and sarcocolla.
Deinde stringe Oculum desuper super emplastrum cum puluillis multis.	Then tighten the eye down over a plaster with many powders.
Et modus puluillorum est: ut accipias pannos lenes, multos, et duplicetur omnis pannus ex eis super quatuor: fac ex eis multos: deinde pone eos unum super alium, secundum quantitatem qua indiget Oculus: deinde stringe super ipsos cum panno duro strictura forti.	And the mode of the powders is: that you take soft cloths, many and twice as much cloth as there are clothe panels for four: make it from those many: then put them one above the other, according to the quantity which the eye requires: then tighten them together with a hard, strong cloth.
Et itera uentosas cum suctione sine scarificatione.	And again wound-healers without scaring, but with suction.
Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.	Then take away the wound-healers and release the eye, keep it shut during the day and at night.
Si autem ligamentum iterum mollificatur, tunc oportet ut stringatur multum: deinde aufer ligamentum post diem et noctem, sicut diximus.	If the ligament softens again, then you should tighten it much: then take away the ligament after a day and night, as we have said.
Si ergo uides oculum iam redisse uuae tunicae, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam, et uentosas, donec sanetur.	If therefore you see that the eye has been relieved with new lint, it is good: and if not, then again the plasters, and the tightening, and the wound-healers, until it is healed.
Â¶ De incisionie Vuae tunicae.	On the incisions of the king's tunics.
Caput XXI.	Chapter XXI.
Quando accidit disruptio in tunica Vuea, deinde eminet et procedit extra palpebras sicut granum Vuae, et foedatur forma hominis propter illud, et uis incidere illud: tunc operatio in eo est, secundum quod narro: et est, ut intromittas acum in radice Vuae ab inferiori ad superiorem partem.	When a breach occurs in the king's tunic, then it is cut off and brought out from between the eyelids like a grain of wheat, and shaped into the form of a man because of that; and the operation is, according to what I have said: and it is, so that you insert the acumen into the root of the king from below to above.
Deinde intromitte acum aliam in qua sit filum duplum a parte lachrymalis, et fac eam penetrare: et dimitte acum primam secundum dispositionem suam.	Then introduce another acu with a double filament on the side of the lacrimal, and let it penetrate: and release the first one according to its direction.
Deinde incide locum fili dupli, et liga cum eo partem Vuae in circumitu acus: et stringe eam multum.	Then cut the spot where the double filament is, and bind that side of the king with it around the acu: and tighten it very much.
Deinde extrahe acum, et pone super oculum lanam infusam in albugine oui: et dimitte eum, donec cadat filum cum Vua.	Then withdraw the acu, and place a wet wool on the eyeball in the white part above it: and release it, until the filament drops with the king.
Deinde cura oculum cum eo, quod confortat ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then care for the eye with it, which comforts it, until the wound heals.
Et quandoque stringitur Vua ab omni parte cum circulo ex panno, donec addat oculus eminentiam magnam.	And when the king is stretched tight from all sides by a circle of cloth, so that the eye projects greatly.
Deinde perforetur cum spatumili subtili, quod perueniat ad profundum oculi, et currat humiditas albuginea, et descendat oculus, et ingrediatur statim: deinde stringe eum, donec sanetur.	Then it is pierced with a thin spatula, which reaches to the depth of the eye, and makes the albugineous fluid flow, and the eye drops down, and is inserted immediately: then tighten it, until the wound heals.
Â¶ De curatione Alcomnati.	Chapter XXII.
Caput XXII.	The Cure of the King's Eye
Haec Aegritudo quae nominatur Alcomnati, non, est nisi sanies, quae aggregatur in oculo, similis aquae descendenti, et non est ipsa.	This condition called Alcomnati, is not anything else but a deposit gathered in the eye, similar to water that drops down, and it itself is not.
Et modus operandi in ea est, ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem praeparatum, uel directum.	And the method of operation with this is, so that you make the sick sit on a chair prepared, or directly.
Deinde accipe caput eius manibus tuis a partibus duabus, et moue ipsum, donec uideas saniem peruenire ad inferiora oculis tuis.	Then take his head in your hands from the two sides, and move it, until you feel the deposit reach to the lower eyelids of his eyes.
Deinde figatur, et non descendat, et absoluatur lumen: et uideat infirmus res sicut uidebat: et si non descendit inferius, scias quia est aqua.	Then bind it, and so that it does not drop down, and let the light be clear; and let the sick person see things as they are; and if it does not drop down below, you shall know that it is water.
Si autem non praeparatur descensus saniei cum eo quod diximus, tunc fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas.	But if the descent is not prepared with him as we have said, then make him sit between your hands.
Deinde accipe spatumile subtile, et finde cum eo supra panniculum corneum parumper apud continuationem coniunctiuae cum tunica cornea in corona, donec egrediatur sanies.	Then take a thin spikelet and find it with him above the cornified tissue somewhat at the edge of the connective tissue where it joins the corneal layer on the crown, until the pus is discharged.
Cum ergo egreditur, tunc distilla in oculum aquam calidam in qua miscuisti mel: aut aquam in qua iam bullisti foenumgraecum et mel: deinde curetur cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When it has discharged then distil into the eye warm water in which you have mixed honey: or haygrass and honey: then treat with the remaining treatment until it heals.
Â¶ De cura aquae, quae descendit in oculo, uel cataracta.	Of the care of water, which has entered into the eye, or cataract.
Caput XXIII.	CHAPTER XXIII.
Iam Diximus species aquae in diuisione, et quae conuenit ad perforandum sermone declarante et exponente, tunc accipe illud idem secundum sanitatem.	We have already spoken on the species of water and that which is suitable for piercing with a revealing and explanatory statement, then take it up again according to health.
Tunc ergo oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas quadratum, oppositum lumini, prope solem: et liga oculum eius sanum, et stringe eum ualde: deinde palpebram oculi eius manu tua dextra, si oculus in quo est aqua, est oculus sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then it is necessary that you make the sick person sit between your hands square-wise, opposite the light, near the sun: and bind his healthy eye, and tighten it firmly: then with your own hand squeeze the eye from which the water comes, if the eye is on the left, then with your right hand: or if the eye is on the right, then with your left.
Deinde accipe manu tua dextra almagda, si oculus est sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then take in your right hand alum, if the eye is on the left: or in your left hand, if the eye is on the right.
Deinde pone extremitatem almagda prope coronam per grossitudinem radii in ipsa albedine oculi apparente lachrymalis minoris: deinde impelle almagda cum uirtute: et tu reuoluis cum eo manum tuam, donec penetret in albuginem oculi: et sentias, quod almagda iam peruenit ad rem uacuam.	Then place the end of alum near the crown by the thickness of a ray into the same white part of the tear film of the eye: then push the alum with force: and you rub it up with your hand, until it penetrates into the corneal layer; and you will feel that the alum has already reached the wet part.
Et oportet, ut sit mensura itineris almagda ad profundum, mensura spacii quod est a pupilla usque ad finem nigredinis: et est corona oculi.	And it should be such that the distance of the alum to the depth is a measure, the space which is from the pupil to the end of the blackness: and this is the crown of the eye.
Uidebis enim ea in ipsa pupilla uisione oculi, propter claritatem tunicae corneae.	You will see it in the same pupil with a vision of the eye, because of the clarity of the corneal layer.
Deinde pone almagda usque ad locum in quo est aqua.	Then put the almagest to the place where is water.
Deinde preme ipsum inferius uice una post aliam.	Then press on the bottom with a single hand after another.
Si ergo descendit aqua statim, tunc infirmus uidet illud super quod aperit uisum suum statim, et almagda in oculo suo.	If however water has dropped immediately, then the sick person will see it on what opens his own sight immediately, and the almagest in his own eye.
Deinde quiescas paululum.	Then you rest a little.
Si ergo descendat aqua, tunc depone eam secundo, praeter quod egrediatur almagda.	If however water has dropped, then put it down second, except that the almagest should come out.
Quando ergo figitur, et non ascendit: tunc extrahe almagda cum facilitate: et tu reuoluis manum tuam paulatim.	When it is fixed, and does not rise up: then remove the almagest with ease: and you raise your hand slowly again.
Deinde dissolue in aqua aliquid ex sale claro gemmae: et ablue cum eo oculum deintus.	Then dissolve in water some of the clear salt of the gem: and rinse with it the inner eye.
Deinde pone extra oculum totum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, et albugine oui: et liga cum eo oculum sanum.	Then put outside all the puff up, or wool dipped in oil and bleached, and glue with it a healthy eye.
Nos autem, et illi qui sunt nostri temporis, ponimus super eum ciminum tritum cum albumine oui.	But we and those who are of our time, put on him ground pepper mixed with white of an egg.
Quod si non obedit tibi almagda ad introitum in oculum propter duriciem suam, quoniam ex hominibus est, cuius oculus est durus ualde: tunc oportet ut accipias spatumile, quod nominatur Alberid, cuius haec est forma.	That if the almagest does not obey you at the entrance into the eye because of its hardness, since it is from men, and whose eye is very hard: then you should take a twig called Alberida, whose this form is.
Pefora ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctiuam tantum, et non ultimes manum tuam in foramine: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagda locum subtilem.	Proro ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctio tantum, et non ultra manum tuam in foramine ponas: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagdam locum subtilem.
Deinde intromitte almagda, secundum quod diximus.	Then put the almagest in, according to what we have said.
Et apud complementum operis tui, praeparetur infirmo dormitorium decenter factum, in quo dormiat super dorsum suum in domo tenebrosa: et prohibeatur ab omnibus motibus, et a tussi: et pone cibum eius illud quo lenitur natura eius: et non moueat caput suum dextra, neque sinistra omnino.	And near the end of your work, prepare for the sick person a dark bedroom in which he should sleep on his back: and prohibit any movement, or coughing: and do not let him eat anything that is not natural to him: and do not let his head move to the right, or at all.
Et sit ligamentum secundum dispositionem suam usque ad diem tertium.	And let it be bound up according to its shape until the third day.
Deinde solue illud in illa domo tenebrosa, et experire uisum eius: et fac eum uidere res.	Then solve it in that dark house, and test his sight: and let him see things.
Deinde reduc ligamentum usque ad diem septimum.	Then reduce the ligaments until the seventh day.
Et non oportet ut faciat illud in hora curationis, aut post incisionem statim: imo oportet, ut alienes illud: propterea quod aqua ascendit uelociter per aspectum uehementem.	And it is not necessary for him to do this at the time of cure, or immediately after the incision: but he should delay it, because water quickly rises through the whelming face.
Si autem accidit apostema calidum: tunc oportet ut soluas oculum ante septimum: et rectifica illud cum eo quod sedat apostema, donec sedatur: tunc absolue ipsius uisum, et pone super faciem eius orale quo regatur uisus eius sub eo diebus aliquot, ipso existente in illa domo tenebrosa.	But if an apoplexy of heat occurs: then you should open his eye before the seventh day: and straighten that with him when he sits down so that the apoplexy is straightened until it has been set for some days while he remains in that dark house.
Deinde egrediatur a domo gradatim, et conuersetur in casis suis.	Then let him go out of the house gradually, and let him turn round in his cases.
Et scias, quod in zaltea non excusatur discipulus a uisione aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super operationem.	And know that the student is not excused from an operation for a little while: then he may dare to speak about the operation.
Et iam quidem peruenit ad nos quidam ex illis qui sunt de Alayrach, qui dixit, quod factum fuit in Alayrach magdan perforatum, quo sugitur aqua.	And already some of them have come to us from Al-Arab who said that a hole was made in Al-Arab by which water is drawn up.
Verum ergo non uidi aliquem in terra uostra, qui fecerit illud: neque legi illud in aliquo ex libris antiquorum: et est possibile, ut sit illud nouum.	But I never saw anyone in your country do this: nor have I seen this written in any of the old books: and it is possible that this is new.
Et istae sunt formae specierum ex magda, ut stet super ea qui ea ignorat.	And these are forms of eyes from a hole, so that it stands on top of him who does not know it.
Fiant ex aere proprie: et sint extremitates eorum cum hac eadem subtilitate triangulatae, et extremitas acuta.	Let them be made of pure brass: and let their ends be shaped like this same triangular subtlety, and the sharp end.
Formae magda.	The forms of the hole.
Â¶ De cura Carnis natae in naso.	Regarding the cure for a birthmark on the nose.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter 22: The head.
Quandoque nascuntur in naso Carnes diuersae additae, ex quibus est aliquid quod assimilatur scorpioni multorum pedum: et ex ea est caro cancerosa, lapidea, fusci coloris: et ex ea est quae est caro lenis, non fusci coloris.	When and how birthmarks arise in the nose: some of them have a substance that is like scorpion's many legs: and from this is the flesh which is cancerous, hard, pale-colored: and from this is the soft flesh, not pale-colored.
In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.	In which of these marks is soft, not fraudulent, and not cancerous, you should make him sit with his hands opposite the sun, and open his nostrils, and stick pins in those parts: then pull them out towards the outside, and cut off what you have stuck with a sharp, fine needle from one side, until you know that all the flesh has been taken away.
Quod si remaneret aliquid ex ea cuius abscisio non est possibilis: tunc rade illud cum uno instrumentorum subtilium cum facilitate, donec non remaneat ex eo aliquid.	If anything remains from that which its removal is not possible: then cut it with one of the instruments and easily remove it until nothing remains.
Si autem sanguis tibi dominatur, aut accidat apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei per id quod oportet: aut est ex apostematibus malignis, tunc propera cauterizando eum, donec abscindatur sanguis, et auferantur omnes carnes.	But if blood dominates you, or an aposteme is hot: then oppose it as needed: or if it is a malicious apostema, then approach it with cauterizing, until the blood is cut off and all flesh is taken away.
Deinde proiiciatur in nasum post incisionem acetum, et aqua, aut uinum.	Then let it be poured into the nose after incising it with vinegar, and water, or wine.
Si autem aperitur nasus, et procedat ex eo humiditas usque ad palatum, tunc scias quia iam sanus est.	But if the nose opens, and moisture proceeds from it to the palate, then you shall know that he is already well.
Si uero non penetrat humiditas, secundum quod oportet, tunc scias quod intra ipsum est caro nata in superioribus ossibus naris, ad quae non peruenit cum incisione instrumentum.	But if the moisture does not penetrate, as is necessary, then you shall know that it is born flesh within the upper bones of the nose, to which the knife does not reach with the incision.
Tunc ergo oportet, ut intromittas filum lini cui sit quaedam grossitudo, et noda in eo nodos multos: et pone inter omnem nodum quantitatem digiti, aut minus: et ingeniet infirmus, ut mittat extremitatem unam fili in nasum cum radio, aut cum quo possibile est ei postquam fecerit ipsum simile azer: et trahat odoratum suum, donec perueniat usque ad caassum, et egrediatur super guttur suum.	Then it is necessary that you introduce a thread of linen with some thickness, and nodules many in it; and place between each nodule a quantity of finger, or less: and let the sick person exhale his breath, until he reaches as far as the throat, and goes out over his tongue.
Et multotiens quidem faciunt simile huic Attomi pueri in scholis: et est res facilis ei, qui uult.	And many times this same boy makes Atom like in school: and it is an easy thing for him who wants it.
Deinde pone duas extremitates fili, extremitatem unam quae egreditur super nasum, et alteram quae remansit in naso.	Then place the two ends of the thread, one end that exits over the nose, and the other that remains in the nose.
Deinde ac ministra serraturam carnis cum nodis qui sunt in filo.	Then, and also with the help of a lock for the flesh with the nodules that are in the thread.
Fac illud donec scias quod carnes iam sunt cum nodis fili.	Make it so that you shall know that the flesh is already with the nodules of the thread.
Deinde extrahe filum: et pone in nasum post abstersionem sanguinis licinium quod imbibisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud tribus diebus, aut plus, donec unguentum corrodat totum quod remansit ex carnibus.	Then remove the thread: and place in the nose after abstinence of blood a liquid that you have soaked in Egyptian ointment: make it so many days, or more, until the ointment corrodes all that remained of the flesh.
Deinde pone in fine rei in nasum cannulam de plumbo, diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	Then place at the end of the matter in the nose a pipe made of lead, for a few days, until it is healed.
Si autem indiget curatione quae exiccet, utere illa.	If, however, the cure does not respond to extraction, use that method.
Ad caputpurgium faciendum, cum quo distillantur olea, et aliae medicinae in nasum, fac illud ex argento, aut aere: quod sit simile lampadi paruae, apertum sicut conchula: et meatus eius similiter.	For making an ointment for the head, when oil is distilled and other medicines are added to the nose, make it from silver or gold: let it be similar in appearance to a small lamp, opened like a conch shell; and its opening should also be like that.
Et si uis fac cannulam clausam, sicut canna.	And if you want to make a tube closed like a cane.
Et conchula instrumenti ad caputpurgium faciendum, sit plena, detecta: cui sit manubrium in postremo eius, cum quo teneas ipsam, quando calefacis in ea oleum, aut quod uis ex succis, et rebus fluxibilibus.	And the shell of the instrument for making an ointment for the head should be full, filled up: which has a handle at the end, which you hold when you heat it with oil, or what you want to add, and fluid substances.
Et haec est forma instrumenti.	This is the form of the instrument.
Â¶ De cura Thelul nasi.	On the cure for the nose.
Caput XXV.	Head 25.
Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius.	The ulcer on the nose often grows in severity and becomes larger over time until it forms a pus pocket.
Et propter illud oportet, ut in cidas illud in principio apparitionis eius, et eradices totum eius.	And for this, when it first appears, you should cut off the whole of it.
Deinde pone super locum, aut cauterium, aut medicinam comburentem quae stat loco eius.	Then put a cauldron on the place, or cautery, or burning medicine that stays in its place.
Si ergo tardatur incisio eius, donec magnificetur, tunc considera, si est lapideum, durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro: quoniam apostema est cancerosum.	But if the incision is delayed until it has grown larger, then observe: if it is hard, gray in color, and of few sensations; then do not touch it with iron: for it is a cancerous growth.
Multotiens enim uidi, qui incidit hmoni apostema, et accidit ex eo malicia magna super illum qui ipsum habebat.	For many times a person who has been cut on the nose has become infected with a bad malice that has grown large over it.
Et si apostema est lenis tactus, non fusci coloris, et uides quod incisio possibilis est in toto eius, tunc euacua infirmum, et incide ipsum sine timore, absque pauore: et cura locum cum eo quod exiccat et constringit, donec sanetur.	And if the pustule is mild to the touch, not gray in color, and you see that the incision can be made throughout its entire length, then wipe away the pus, and cut into it without fear or anxiety; and treat the place with a cure that dries it up and tightens it up until it heals over.
Â¶ De sutura nasi, et labii, et auris.	On sewing the nose, lips, and ears.
Caput XXVI.	Head 26.
Scias Quia quando accidit solutio continuitatis in una harum cartilaginum, parum confert in ea operatio, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	You should know that when there is a break in the continuity of one of these cartilage pieces, the operation is not successful unless in certain people.
Oportet ergo quando accidit alicui aliquid ex illo, ut consideres, si est uulnus recens cum sanguine suo: et tunc aggrega duolabia uulneris cum sutura: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Therefore, when something happens to someone, you should examine whether the fracture is recent with its blood: and then add pain to the wound with a stitch; later take care of it until it heals.
Et si solutionis continuitatis labia iam separata sunt, et facta est unaquaeque pars sana: tunc oportet ut excories omnem partem a cute sua apparente, donec sanguinetur.	And if the break in the continuity has already separated the lips and some healthy part has been made: then one should remove all the apparent skin from its part, until it bleeds.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cum sutura, et stringe ea, et pulueriza super ipsum sanguinem draconis, et olibanum trita: et pone supra pulueres frustum emplastri diafinicon, et alicuius alterius ex emplastris consolidatiuis: et dimitte ipsum ligatum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then add two lips to the wound with a stitch and tighten them, and sprinkle blood from the dragon on it, and crushed olive oil: and put a fragment of a plaster of diafinicon over the powder, and some other consolidant plaster; and leave it bound for two days, or three.
Deinde solue ipsum, et permuta medicinam: et dimitte ipsum, donec abscindantur fila per se.	Then loosen it and change the medicine: and leave it until the threads separate themselves by themselves.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointment until it heals.
Modus autem suturae est, ut aggreges solutionem continuitatis, aut cum acubus, sicut narrauimus in sutura uentris: aut aggrega solutionem cum filo, sicut feci te scire.	The way of sewing is that you gather the solution of continuity, or with a thread, as we have explained in the case of sewing an eye: or you gather the solution with a thread, as I told you.
Â¶ De extractione nodorum labiorum.	The extraction of nodules from the lips.
Caput XXVII.	Chapters 27
Multis Quidem hominibus accidunt plaerumque in interioribus labiorum suorum apostemata dura similia granis herbi: et quaedam eorum minora, et maiora.	Indeed, many people have hard spots within their lips like little grains of grass: and some smaller ones, and larger ones.
Ergo oportet ut conuertas labium, et findas super omnem nodum eius, et suspendas ipsum cum uncino, et incidas ipsum ab omni parte.	Therefore you should close the lips and find all the knot in them, and hang it by a hook, and hit it from all sides.
Deinde impleas locum post incisionem zegi trito, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then fill the place where you have cut after grinding three times, until the blood has dried up.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto, et curetur locus cum eo, in quo est stipticitas, usquequo sanentur uulnera.	Then soak it with vinegar and care for the place with that until the wounds heal.
Â¶ De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.	The incision of flesh born on the gums.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapters 28
Multotiens nascitur super gingiuam caro addiat, quam antiqui nominant abuluss.	Often a flesh grows above the gums that the ancient ones call abluss.
Oportet ergo ut suspendas eam cum uncino: aut teneas eam cum forcipibus, et incidas eam apud radicem suam, et dimittas saniem currere, aut sanguinem.	Therefore you should hang it by a hook: or hold it with tongs and hit it against the root and let the blood flow, or pour blood on it.
Deinde pone super locum zegi tritum, aut alios pulueres stipticos, exiccatiuos.	Then put on the site three times, or other powdery astringent, drying.
Quod si redit illa caro post curationem, nam multotiens redit, tunc incide eam secundo, et cauteriza ipsam: ipsa namque non redit post cauterium.	If that returns to health after treatment, for it often returns many times, then cut it again and cauterize it; for it does not return after cauterization.
Â¶ De rasione Dentium cum ferro.	In the case of toothache, when he is in pain, apply a hot iron to the tooth.
Caput XXIX.	Head XXVIII.
Quandoque aggregantur in superficiebus Dentium ab interiori et extetiori parte, et inter gingiuas cortices asperi, turpes, et quandoque denigrantur, et citrini fiunt, et uirides, donec peruenit ex illo corruptio ad gingiuam, et foedi fiunt dentes per illud.	When teeth are gathered in the surface from within and from the outside part, and between the gums roughness, and sometimes they corrode, and become yellow and wrinkled, until corruption comes out of it to the gum, and the teeth become rotten because of it.
Oportet ergo ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et caput eius in sinu tuo, et rade molam et dentem, in quo apparent tibi cortices, et res similis arenae: donec non remaneat ex eis aliquid, et similiter fac de nigredine, et uiriditate, et citrinitate, et aliis donec mundentur.	Therefore you should have the sick person sit between your hands, and place his head in your lap, and rasp off the molars and teeth on which you can see the gums, and make it like sand: until there is nothing left of it, and likewise do with yellowing, and wrinkling, and yellowness, and all else until it is cleansed.
Si ergo auferatur quod in eis est a principio rasionis, bonum est: et si non, tunc itera super eos rasionem die alio, secundo, et tertio, donec ad ultimum perueniat studium in eo quod uis.	If then what is in them from the beginning is removed by shaving, it is good: but if not, then repeat the shaving on them one day, and the next, and the third, until you have reached the last study of it that you want to do with it.
Et scias, quod dens indiget rasoriis diuersarum formarum, multarum figurarum: secundum quod praeparatur operationi tuae: proptera, quod rasorium quo raditur dens ab inferiori parte, est aliud a rasorio quo raditur inter dentes, secundum formas alias.	And know that teeth are resistant to different shapes of shaving, and many figures: moreover, the blade with which you shave teeth from below is different from the blade with which you shave between teeth, according to the shapes.
Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.	And these shapes of blades are prepared in your hands, which you will see.
Â¶ De extractione doloris Dentium.	On the extraction of toothache.
Caput XXX.	Head XXX.
Oportet ut cures Dentem a dolore suo cum omni ingenio, et tardes in eradicatione eius.	It is necessary that you take care of the tooth from its pain with all your effort, and be late in eradicating it.
Non est enim quod uicem eius suppleat quando eradicatur: quoniam est substantia sublimis: donec quando non est excusatio de eradicatione eius, tunc oportet quando cogitur infirmus eradicare ipsum, ut firmetur, et certificetur apud te dens dolens.	For it is not that the tooth will be satisfied when eradicated: for it is a subtle substance: until, when there is no excuse for the eradication of it, then you should, when it is decided by illness to eradicate it, so that it hardens, and is confirmed with you the tooth that hurts.
Multotiens enim decipit infirmum dolor, et putat quia est in dente saha et eradicat ipsum: deinde non recedit dolor, donec eradicetur dens infirmus.	Many times pain deceives the sick person and he believes that it is in the tooth and pulls it out himself; afterwards, the pain does not cease until the diseased tooth is pulled out.
Nos enim iam uidimus illud ex operatione phlebotomatorum.	For we have already seen this from the operation of bloodletting.
Cum ergo certificatur apud te dens dolens ipsemet, tunc oportet ut scarifices in circumitu dentis cum spatumili, in quo sit quiddam uirtutis, donec soluatur gingiua ab omni parte: deinde moue ipsum digitis tuis, aut cum forcipibus subtilibus in primis paulatim, donec concutias ipsum.	Since the tooth is certainly painful, then it is necessary that you make incisions around the tooth with a scalpel, where there is some strength, until the gum is completely removed: then break it with your fingers or with small tweezers, little by little, until it breaks off.
Deinde loca tunc in eo forcipes magnos locatione bona, et caput infirmi inter genua tua: quod iam bene tenuisti, ita quod non moueatur: deinde trahe dentem secundum rectitudinem, ut non frangas ipsum.	Then make big incisions in that place with good positioning and place the wound between your thighs: you have already held it well so that it does not ache; then pull out the tooth along its length, so as not to break it.
Si ergo non egreditur, tunc accipe aliquod illorum instrumentorum, et intromitte ipsum sub eo ab omni parte cum facilitate, et conare motionem eius, sicut fecisti in primis.	But if it does not come out, then take one of their instruments and push it under it from all sides with ease, and try to move it, as you did at first.
Si autem dens est perforatus, aut corrosus: tunc oportet ut impleas illud foramen panno: et stringas ipsum cum extremitate radii subtilis, ut non frangatur in hora constrictionis tuae super ipsum cum forcipibus.	But if the tooth is punctured or corroded, then you must fill the cavity with cloth; and tighten it with a fine hook so that it does not break at the time of your constriction over it with tweezers.
Et oportet, ut exquisite agas cum scarificatione in circumitu gingiuae ab omni parte multum.	And you should do, so that you carefully make incisions around the gums from all sides.
Et custodi fortitudinem tuam, ut non frangas ipsum, et remaneat pars eius, et redeat super infirmum ex ea malicia quae sit maior dolore eius primo.	And keep your strength so that you do not break it and a part of it remains, and returns to the diseased part of it with the same malice that causes it greater pain first.
Et caue, ne facias illud quod ignorantes faciunt phlebotomatores in festinatione sua, et audacia ipsorum super eradicationem eius, praeter quod administrent illud quod narrauimus.	And beware, do not do what the bloodletters do in their haste and the courage of their actions, in eradicating it, except that they administer to it what we have described.
Multotiens enim faciunt euenire super homines infirmitates magnas, quarum difficiliores sunt ut frangantur, et remaneant radices eius omnes, aut quaedam earum: aut ut extrahant ipsum cum quibusdam ossibus mandibulae: sicut testificati sumus multotiens illud.	Many times they bring about great illnesses in men, which are more difficult to break than the teeth and remain with their roots or some of them; or to pull out the tooth with certain mandible bones; as we have often witnessed this.
Deinde colluatur post eradicationem eius cum uino, aut cum aceto et sale.	Then wipe it down with wine, or with vinegar and salt.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis ex locis (multotiens enim accidit) tunc tere aliquid ex zegi, et imple cum eo locum: et si non, cauteriza ipsum si non confert tibi zegi.	If, however, a flow of blood occurs from the places (for often it occurs) then dry some of the wound, and fill it with the same stuff: and if not, cauterize him; if that does not help you, then apply medicine to him.
Formae forcipum subtilium quibus mouetur dens in primis, sint longarum extremitatum, breuis manubrii, grossi, ut non duplicentur quando cum eis premitur super dentem: sint sicut uides grossorum manubriorum, donec quando stringis cum eis, non dent seipsas, neque duplicentur: breuium extremitatum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut ex faled decenter facti, directarum extremitatum: et in eorum extremitatibus sint dentes, quorum quidam ingrediantur in quosdam, et stringant constrictione decenti, forti.	The form of the forceps which moves quickly in the first place, are long in their extremities, short in the handle, so that they do not double when applied to the tooth: they are like the large handles that you see, until when you squeeze them together, they do not bite into themselves, and do not double; the short extremities, and let them be of iron, or of a bent bar made straight, of the right angles: and in their extremities are teeth, some of which enter into certain ones, and press firmly by constriction, strongly.
Et quandoque fiunt extremitates sicut forma oris auis quae nominatur ciconia, et sunt fortis constrictionis.	And when the extremities become such as the form of the ear which is called the ciconia, and are strong in constriction.
Â¶ De eradicatione Dentium, et extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.	Of the extraction of teeth and of the fracture of the bones of the mandible.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter XXXI.
Quando remanet apud eradicationem Dentis qui frangitur aliquid, tunc oportet ut ponas super locum cotum cum butyro die uno, aut duobus diebus, donec mollificetur locus: deinde intromitte ad ipsum algasti, aut forcipes: quorum extremitates assimilantur ori auis quae nominatur ciconia.	When there remains after the extraction of a tooth which is broken some, then you should place it on the spot with butter for one or two days, until it becomes soft; and then introduce to it the algin, or the forceps; of whose extremities are like the form of the ear which is called the ciconia.
Forma autem haec est forcipum.	This form, however, is that of the forceps.
Sint extremitates eorum factae sicut lima deintus: aut sicut aliskilfegi.	The extremities of them are made like a lever: or like an alewife-fish.
Si ergo non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.	If he does not obey you in regard to the extraction with these forceps; then let him hold on to the root, and peel off all the flesh, and introduce the instrument which is called a small pliers, of whose form is this.
Sit breuis extremitatis, grossae parumper: et non sit imbibitum, ut non frangatur.	Let it be short in its extremities, broader a little; and let it not be dipped in water, lest it break.
Si ergo egreditur radix per illud, est bonum: et si non, iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis aliis quorum formae sunt istae.	If therefore a root is removed for this purpose, it is good; and if not, it should be done with these other instruments whose shapes are such.
Forma primi triangulatae extremitatis, in qua est quaedam grossitudo.	The form of the first triangular extremity, in which there is some roughness.
Forma triangulatae extremitatis subtilis.	The form of the second triangular extremity, which is slender.
Etiam iuuatur cum hoc instrumento habente duos ramos, cuius haec est forma.	Also done with this instrument having two branches, whose form is such.
Et cum aliis instrumentis et ferramentis quae praecesserunt in rasione dentium.	And with other instruments and tools which have preceded in the sequence of tooth extraction.
Etiam sit iuuamentum cum hoc instrumento quod assimilatur uncino magno, huius formae, triangulatae extremitatis tortae, in qua est quiddam grossitudinis, ut non frangatur: et sit non imbibitum.	Also sit with this instrument which is similar to a large hook, of such a form, of the second triangular extremity which is curved, in which there is some roughness so that it does not break, and is not soaked.
Et scias, quod instrumenta dentium sunt multa: et similiter reliqua instrumenta non computantur, et artifex prudens, subtilis in arte sua inuenit per se ipsum instrumentum, secundum quod significant ei operatio et aegritudines ipsae.	And know that there are many dental instruments: also the other instruments are not considered, and the prudent artisan, subtile in his art, finds himself the instrument itself, according to which signifies its operation and its diseases.
Quoniam ex agritudinibus sunt ad quas non dixerunt antiqui instrumentum, propter diuersitatem specierum earum.	For from the diseases of the teeth are made the instruments not mentioned by the ancients, due to the diversity of their forms.
Si autem frangatur os ex mandibula, aut ex aliis ossibus oris, aut putrefit: tunc perscrutare super ipsum in loco suo cum eo quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis et forcipibus quae dixi in extractione radicum, et iuuare cum gesti, cuius forma est haec.	But if the jaw breaks from a tooth, or from any other bone of the mouth, then examine on itself at its own place with what is suitable to it from instruments and pliers which I mentioned in the extraction of roots, and be careful with the movement, whose form is this.
Sit in eo quiddam grossitudinis paulatim, ut stringatur, uel teneatur cum eo os, et non fugiat et uadat, donec egrediatur os: et restaura locum cum medicinis conuenientibus ad illud.	Sit with it some roughness gradually, so that it is held or clamped with the jaw, and does not move or shake, until the root has been removed; and restore the place with suitable medicines to it.
Si autem in osse est putredo parua, tunc rade ipsum a putredine sua, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	But if there is a small putrefaction in the bone, then shave off the putrid part from its own putridness, and heal the part, until it is healed.
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.	Of the important locking of teeth on others.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter 32.
Quando Dentes eminent non secundum cursum suum naturalem, foeda fit per illud forma: et praecipue quando accidit illud in mulieribus, et puellis, scilicet uenalibus.	When the teeth do not move in their natural course, they become rotted by that form; and especially when it happens to women and girls, that is, to those who bite their lips.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	You should therefore reflect on it.
Nam si dens est natus post dentem alium, et non locatur, uel est possibilis eius serratura, neque limatura ipsius: tunc eradica ipsum: et si est annexus cum dente alio, tunc incide ipsum cum isto instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	If however he was born after a tooth has come out and has not been fitted with an artificial tooth or if it is possible to drill a hole in it or file it down: then you should extract the tooth: and if it is joined with another tooth, then you should cut through it with this instrument, whose shape this is.
Est simile rostro paruo, et fit ex ferro indo, acutae extremitatis ualde.	It is similar to a small chisel, and is made of iron, with a sharp end.
Et sit incisio tua qua ipsum incidis in diebus multis, et propter duriciem dentis, et ut non commoueatur alius ex dentibus.	And your cut should be deep, and because of the hardness of the tooth, and so that it does not move another tooth.
Si autem est eminens expositus limaturae suae: tunc lima ipsum cum lima ex indo, cuius forma est haec.	If however it is exposed to the wear of its own grinding: then file it with a file made of iron, whose shape this is.
Sit totum ex indo, et manubrium eius minutorum punctorum ualdae, sicut lima cum qua fiunt acus: cum quo limetur dens paulatim in diebus multis cum facilitate, ut non commoueatur dens, et cadat: deinde leni ipsum, in fine rade ipsum cum quibusdam rasoriis.	It should be made entirely of iron, and its handle small, with a sharp point, like a file with which they make needles: it is ground little by little over many days with ease, so that it does not move the teeth and falls out: then smoothen it off, cut it short with some razors.
Quod si est dens, ex quo frangatur pars, et laedit linguam: tunc oportet ut limes eum etiam, donec auferatur asperitas illius fractionis, et aequetur: et applanetur, et non laedat linguam, neque corrumpat sermonem.	If however a tooth breaks off and hurts the tongue: then it is necessary to smooth out that piece as well until its roughness has been removed and made even: and to make it flat, so that it does not hurt the tongue or spoil speech.
Â¶ De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.	On the retention of teeth with gold fillings.
Caput XXXIII.	ChapterXXXIII On retaining teeth with gold fillings.
Quando accidit Dentibus anterioribus concussio et commotio a percussione, aut casu: et non potest infirmus stringere super illud quod comedit ut non cadat: et curasti eos cum medicinis stipticis, et non ualuit curatio: tunc ingenium in eis est, ut stringantur cum filo auri: quoniam argentum fit uiride, et putrefit post dies: sed aurum nunquam mutatur.	When an anterior tooth is bruised or shaken by a blow, or by an accident: and cannot be held steady on it so as not to fall out: and has tried many treatments with the stinging medicines, but there was no benefit from them: then use skill in it, so that they are held with a gold wire: for silver turns yellow, and perishes after some days: but gold never changes.
Et sit filum medium in subtilitate et grossicie secundum quantitatem quod capiat inter Dentes.	And the wire should be of medium thickness, fine or coarse according to how much it takes between the teeth.
Et forma quidem retationis est, ut accipias filum, et intromittas duplum eius inter duos dentes sanos: deinde texeas cum duabus extremitatibus fili inter dentes motos, siue unus sit, aut plures, donec peruenias cum tela usque ad dentem sanum alterius partis.	And the shape of the retention is so that you take the wire and slide it between two healthy teeth: then tie it with both ends of the wire between the teeth, or one or more, until you reach the opposite side with the wire up to the tooth on the other side.
Deinde itera texturam usque ad partem a qua incaepisti: et stringe manum tuam cum subtilitate et sapientia, donec non remoueatur prorsus: et sit constrictio tua qua stringis filum, apud radices dentium, ut non euadat.	Then examine the texture all the way to the part from which you began: and hold your hand firm with subtlety and wisdom, until it is completely still: and let your constriction be where you tighten the thread, next to the roots of the teeth, so that it does not cause pain.
Deinde incide extremitates fili superfluentes cum forficibus: et aggrega utrumque, et conuerte eas cum gesti: et occulta ipsas inter dentem sanum et dentem motum, ut non laedat linguam: deinde dimittatur ita strictum dum remanet.	Then cut off the excess thread with forceps: and join them together, and twist them with a motion: and hide them between a sound tooth and a moving tooth, so that they do not hurt the tongue: then let it be tightened thus while it remains.
Si autem soluitur, aut inciditur, stringe eos cum filo alio, et stabit cum eo taliter tempore toto.	If it becomes loose, or gets cut, tighten them with another thread, and make it stable with that one for a long time.
Et haec est forma Dentium, et figura retationis duorum dentium sanorum, et duorum dentium motorum, sicut uides.	And this is the shape of teeth, and the figure of holding two sound teeth and two moving teeth together, as you see it.
Et quandoque fit, ut redeat dens unus, aut duo post casum urriusque in locis suis, et retentur sicut narrauimus, et remaneant: et non facit illud nisi artifex, prudens, et expertus.	And sometimes one tooth recedes, or two after falling and returning to their places, and remain as we have told you, and do not make it except the craftsman be careful, and experienced.
Et quandoque aptatur aliquod ex ossibus uaccinis: et fit ex eo sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in loco, ex quo munitur dens et stringitur, sicut diximus: et remanet, et seruitur cum eo tempore longo.	And sometimes a certain bone becomes stiff: and it is made into a tooth-shape, and set in its place, from which the tooth holds fast and is tightened, as we have said: and remains, and sticks to it for a long time.
Â¶ De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et prohibet loquelam.	Regarding the incision of the ligament under the tongue, and what prevents the tongue from moving.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter 34.
Quandoque ligamentum hoc quod accidit sub lingua, est aut naturale, cum quo nascitur homo, aut accidentale, a uulnere quod iam consolidatum est.	Sometimes the ligament that happens under the tongue is either natural, with which man is born, or accidental, from an arrow that has already hardened.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi in capite eius in sinu tuo, et eleua linguam eius: deinde incide illud ligamentum neruosum per latitudinem, donec soluatur lingua a retentione sua.	And the operation in it is that you open the mouth at the top of its jaw in your throat, and you move the tongue out of its place: then cut this nerve-ligament through its width, until the tongue is free from its hold.
Quod si in eo fuerit quiddam duriciei et nodationis, et fuerit illud ex consolidatione uulneris: tunc proiice in illud uncinum, et finde illud per latitudinem, donec incidas ligamentum, et soluatur nodatio.	If there is any hardness and nodding in it, and it comes from the hardening of an arrow wound: then throw it into the hook, and finish it through its width, until you cut the ligament, and free the nodule.
Et caue, ne sit fissura in profundo carnis, et incidas arteriam illic, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And if a crack does not occur deep in the flesh, and you cut the artery there, and blood flows.
Deinde colluatur in uestigio incisionis cum aqua rosata, aut cum aceto, aut aqua frigida.	Then clean the wound of the incision with rose water, or vinegar, or cold water.
Deinde pone sub lingua licinium ex lino, quod teneat infirmus in omni nocte: ut non consolidetur secundo.	Then put under the tongue a piece of linen that the sick person hold all night: so that it may not congeal again.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc pone super locum zegi tritum.	But if blood flows, then put three pounds on the spot.
Si uero uincit te sanguis, tunc cauteriza locum cum cauterio lentiginoso, quod conuenit ad illud: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	But if you really bleed, then cauterize the place with the red-hot cautery that belongs to it: then take care of yourself with the rest of the cure, until it is healed.
Â¶ De extractione Ranulae quae fit sub lingua.	Â§ On the extraction of the wound that is under the tongue.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter LXXV.
Quandoque accidit sub lingua apostema quod assimilatur Ranae paruae, prohibens linguam ab operatione sua naturali: et fortasse magnificatur adeo, donec implet os.	When a small pustule that has come up under the tongue and which is absorbed by the little wound, prevents the tongue from its natural function: and perhaps it grows so big until it fills the mouth.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi coram sole: et considera apostema.	And the operation on him is such that you open the mouth before the sun: and consider the pustule.
Si ergo uides ipsum fusci coloris, aut nigri, durum, cui non inuenit infirmus sensum: tunc non tangas ipsum, quoniam est cancer.	But if you see it a dark color, or black, or hard, and the sick person does not have a feeling of touch: then do not touch it, for it is cancer.
Et si est decliue ad albedinem, in quo est humiditas, tunc proiice in ipsum uncinum, et incide ipsum cum spatumili subtili, et libera ipsum ab omni parte.	And if it declines to whiteness, and in which there is moisture, then throw into it a hook, and cut it with a sharp scythe, and free it from all sides.
Quod si uincit te sanguis in hora tuae operationis, tunc pone super ipsum zegi tritum, donec abscindatur sanguis: deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec extrahas ipsum cum complemento eius.	If blood flows from you during your operation, then put under the wound a piece of linen that the sick person hold until the blood stops flowing: and then return to your operation, until you remove the flesh along with its supply.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto et sale: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then clean it with vinegar and salt: and take care of the rest of the cure that is fitting for it, until it is healed.
Â¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.	Â§ On the treatment of pustules on the two amygdales.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter LXVI.
Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.	When two glands in the throat, that is, the glandules that resemble adam's apple, happen to be affected, and are called the two amygdales: when you do not cure them as we have said in the division, then consider.
Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.	If therefore the wound is hard and of a pale colour, and has little sensation: then do not touch it with iron.
Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.	And if the colour is red and its root is thick: then do not touch it either with iron, fearing a flow of blood, otherwise leave it until it has healed.
Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.	And then you shall either pierce it: or let it burst by itself.
Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.	And if its colour is white, round, and its root is thin: then the wound must be opened.
Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	And carry out the operation on it, so that you consider whether before the operation its apostema was warm and complete in quietness, or is about to diminish slightly: then therefore make the patient sit in front of the sun, and let his head be in your lap: and open his mouth, and take hold between its hands, and press its tongue downwards with the instrument, which has this shape.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.	Let it be made of silver or of brass, that it may be sharp like a knife.
Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.	When therefore you press it with the instrument and see the apostema, and it bleeds a little: then take hold of a hook, and fasten it on the amigdalus, and pull it out as much as you can, taking off with it some of the tunic.
Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.	Then open it again with the same instrument, which has this shape following.
Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.	It is joined by a fork: however its extremities are curved so that the opening of each of them is in a straight line with the other: wherefore take care that it be made of iron, or of lead dipped in oil.
Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.	If this instrument is not present, then open it with a chisel, which has this shape.
Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.	Let it be sharp on one side, and not sharp on the other.
Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.	And after you have opened the amigdalus on one side, open the other on the second according to this same shape of incision.
Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.	Then after incision rinse the patient with cold water, or with vinegar and water.
Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	If, however, a flow of blood occurs, gargle with water in which the cortices of pomegranates have been boiled: or leaves of myrrh, and similar things from styptics, until the flow of blood has stopped: then care for him, until he is well.
Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.	And sometimes splinters come out of the throat, other than the two amygdals.
Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.	So cut them as equally as I have said to cut the two amygdals.
Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.	And I have already treated a woman with an splinter that had lodged in her throat, which made her difficult to breathe and she was losing her senses, which almost closed her throat: and this woman breathed through my mouth and had stopped eating, and drinking water, and she was close to death, if she had remained one day, or two days.
Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.	And the splinter rose only as much as to leave two branches, until it came out through two openings in the nose.
Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.	So I rushed faster, and fixed my hook on one of them.
Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.	Then I pulled him out, and a large piece came out with him.
Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.	Then I cut it off, where it was caught in the opening of the nose.
Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.	Then I made him go out through the other opening in the nose.
Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.	Then I opened her mouth, and pressed her tongue: then I fixed my hook on him: then I cut off a part of it, and there was not much blood coming out of it, so the throat of the woman was absolutely clean, and she immediately started drinking water, and then eating food.
Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.	So I did not keep cutting off the splinter after a long time: and the splinter that I cut off came back again after a while and it was very irritating: so I kept cutting it for a long time, until it was too late and painful.
Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.	So I was careful, and I sterilized the splinter between the two lips of the throat.
Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.	Then it stopped bleeding: then I walked away from him, and I don't know what God did to her after me.
Â¶ De incisione apostematis uuulae.	On the incision of an ulcer.
Caput XXXVII.	De incisione apostematis uuulae.
Quando descendit catarrus ad uuulam, et apostematur, et est long: tunc ipsa nominatur perpendicularis: et si est in inferiori parte grossa, rotunda, tunc ipsa nominatur uua.	When a catarrh has descended to the ulcer and has formed an abscess and is long, then it is called a perpendicular; and if it is on the lower part and is thick and round, then it is called a boil.
Quando curatur cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: et uides quod apostema calidum quieuit ab ea, et est subtilis: tunc oportet ut incidas eam.	When it is cured with the medicine which we have mentioned in the division, and there is no improvement, and you see that the abscess has become cool and thin, then it should be incised.
Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.	And that which has gathered around it is round and not long, and is bloody or dark in color or black and does not have a sensation: then the incision of it should be made.
In ea enim est timor super infirmum.	For there is fear over the weakness.
Oportet ergo quando uides eam secundum modum quem dixi ex albedine, et longitudine sua, ut facias sedere infirmum coram sole: et premas linguam eius cum instrumento, cuius praecessit narratio: deinde fige uncinum in uuam, et trahe eam inferius: et incide eam cum uno duorum instrumentorum quae dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum.	Then when you see it according to the manner which I have mentioned from whiteness and its length, let the sick person sit before the sun: and press his tongue with an instrument which has gone before in narration; then fasten a hook into the ulcer and pull it down: and cut it with one or two instruments which I have mentioned in the incision of the two Ø¢ÙÛØ¯Ø§ÙØ§.
Et oportet ut non incidas ex ea, nisi illud quod additur super naturalem terminum sine additione.	And you should not incise from it unless that which is added to it over the natural limit without adding.
Nam si tu incidis ex ea plus, laedes uocem et sermonem.	For if you incise from it more than, you will hurt speech and discourse.
Deinde post incisionem utere eo quod narrauimus in incisione duarum amigdalarum: et cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then after the incision use that which we have mentioned in the incision of the two Ø¢ÙÛØ¯Ø§ÙØ§: and take care of it until it is healed.
Si autem terretur infirmus ab incisione: tunc oportet ut utaris ingenio in cauterizatione eius absque timore et pauore.	But if the sick person shudders from the incision: then you should use your skill in cauterizing it without fear or anxiety.
Et modus cauterii in ea non est, nisi cum aqua acuta: et est, ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	And the mode of cauterization for it is not, except with sharp water: and it is, as you put a nurse's head in your lap.
Deinde preme linguam eius cum instrumento quod diximus.	Then press his tongue with an instrument which we have mentioned.
Deinde accipe ex aqua quam dixi tibi in capitulo cauterizandi, et confice cum ea calcem non extinctam, et pone eam non spissam, neque subtilem, et imple ex ea concauitatem huius instrumenti, cuius haec est forma.	Then take from water which I have mentioned to you in the chapter on cauterization, and mix with it the powdered herb which we have mentioned, and fill with it the above-mentioned instrument, whose form is as follows:
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.	Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.
Et pone instrumentum cum medicina super uuulam ipsam: et infirmus sit iacens super latus suum, ut currat saliua ex ore eius ex intrinseca medicina, ut non descendat ex ea ad guttur ipsius aliquid, et laedat ipsum.	And set the instrument with the medicine on the wound: and let the sick person lie on his side, so that he may blow out the salve from his mouth by the natural power of it, so that nothing may descend from it to his throat, and may harm him.
Deinde tene manum tuam cum medicina.	Then take your hand with the medicine.
Et tu ex primas eam super uuulam quantitate medietatis horae, donec uideas eam iam denigratam, et sedatam mordicationem medicinae.	And put half of it on the wound at first, until you see it has grown dark, and let it rest with the medication's tingling.
Et si uis ut accipias cotum, et inuoluas ipsum super extremitatem radii, et infundas cotum cum medicina, et intromittas radium cum coto in cannulam desuper, donec adhaereat cotum super uuulam.	And if you wish to take a measurement, and spread it over the edge of the ear, and put the medicine on it, and insert the earwand with the medicine into the canal up to where it adheres to the wound.
Fac illud multotiens, donec consequaris quod uis de cauterizatione uuae.	Do this many times, until you get the result that you wish from the cauterization.
Deinde dimitte eam: ipsa namque arescit et cadit post tres dies, aut quatuor.	Then let it go: for it will dry up and fall off after three or four days.
Quod si indiges ut iteres medicinam, itera ipsam: et post cauterizationem absterge in circumitu uuae cum coto imbibito in butyro, et mundifica cum eo quod est in circumitu eius ex medicina: et colluatur cum aqua frigida.	Which if you wish to use the medicine again, repeat it: and after the cauterization wash around the wound with a cotton swab dipped in butter, and clean with it what is around it from the medicine: and let it drip with cold water.
Et curetur extrinsecus cum embrocis, et deintus cum gargarismis, donec sanetur.	And treat externally with poultices, and internally with gargling, until it is healed.
Haec ergo species curationis est salubrior incisione et longinquior a timore.	This therefore of the cure is more salutary than incision, and less fearful to the patient.
Et quandoque curatur uuula etiam cum eo quod est subtilius quam cauterium et incisio: curatur enim cum suffumigatione, secundum hunc modum.	And when it is cured with the medicine, which is thinner than cauterization and incision, for it is cured with suffumigations, in this way.
Sume calamentum, et hyssopum, et origanum, et rutam, et sseah, et chamomillam, et abrotanum, et similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia, aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.	Take mint, and hyssop, and oregano, and Rue, and Rosemary, and Chamomile, and Lemon Balm, and similar herbs; and put them all together, or some of them in an ointment, and soak them with vinegar, and boil them: let the pot be covered with a thin layer of lead: and set up in the middle of the pot an opening, above which place the instrument for the application of the medicine, in this way.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere: et intromittatur extremitas, in qua est granatum, in os infirmi, donec ascendat uapor ad uuulam super cannulam, donec obscuretur uuula multum.	Let it be made of silver or brass; and let the end, in which is the granule, enter into the bone, until the vapor ascends to the wall above the tube, until it becomes dim.
Deinde itera super ipsam multotiens, donec arescat.	Then go over it many times, until it heals.
Et caue, ne facias hanc curationem in principio aduentus apostematis.	And do not make this cure at the beginning of a fever.
Plaerumque enim addit in apostemate: et non oportet ut facias illud nisi apud declinationem apostematis eius calidi.	For it adds to the plague; and you shall not make this cure except at the decline of the plague from its heat.
Si autem non est praesens tibi hoc instrumentum, tunc accipe cannam, et compone in extremitate eius corticem oui: ut non comburatur os infirmi: quoniam cortex oui prohibet uaporem comburere os: et haec est ex bona curatione cum salute.	But if you do not have this instrument with you, then take a tube and fit it into the end of it a piece of wood so that it does not burn the bone; for the wood prevents the vapor from burning the bone, and this is a good cure when done in health.
Â¶ De extractione spinarum, et ossium de gula.	Regarding the extraction of spines and bones from the throat.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter 38. On the extraction of spines and bones from the
Multotiens adhaeret in gutture os, aut spina piscis, aut aliud.	Often adhere in the throat a bone, or a fish spine, or something else.
Oportet ergo ut extrahas quod ex eis est apparens super quod cadit uisus, postquam premis linguam cum instrumento apud solem, et declaratur tibi quod est in gutture.	Then you should extract whatever is visible above the jaw when you press the tongue with the instrument near the sun, and tell me what it is in the throat.
Et quod non apparet tibi et occultatur in gutture, oportet ut facias uomere infirmum antequam digeratur cibus in stomacho.	And whatever is not visible to you and hidden in the throat, you should make a sick person fast before food enters the stomach.
Fortasse enim egredietur res annexa per uomitum.	Perhaps something attached will come out through vomit.
Aut deglutiat infirmus frustum napi, aut radicem lactucae, aut deglutiat buccellam panis sicci: aut accipiat frustum spongiae marinae siccae lenis: et liga ipsum in filo, deinde deglutiat ipsum.	Or a sick person shall swallow a strand of seaweed dry, or bread cracker, or he shall take a strand of sea sponge dry and soft; and he shall bind it with a thread, then he shall swallow it.
Cum ergo peruenit ad locum ubi sunt spinae, aut os, et extrahitur, tunc egreditur.	When, therefore, it has reached the place where are the spines or bone, and is extracted, then it goes out.
Si ergo non egreditur cum eo quod diximus: tunc utere instrumento ex plumbo secundum hanc formam.	But if it does not go out with that which we have said: then use the instrument of lead in this form.
Sit grossius quam Radius parumper, et in extremitate eius sit curuitas, quam intromittat in guttur suum cum facilitate: et ipse habeat caput suum eleuatum sursum.	Let it be thicker than a bone just a little, and let the end of it be smooth, so that it may easily enter into his throat; and he shall hold his head up.
Et caueat a tactu suae epiglotis, ut non accidat ei tussis, et impellat cum eo os, aut spinam, aut intromittat ipsum medicus manu sua.	Let him beware of touching his epiglottis, lest he cough and drive the wind out with it, or push himself back with his own hand.
Verum quod infirmus intromittat, hoc est melius: propter scientiam suam de loco rei annexae: et impellat inferius, aut trahat manum suam cum instrumento sursum, totum illud secundum quantitatem quae praeparatur ei, donec egrediatur.	But if the patient is weak, it is better: for he knows about the place of the wound and will push down or take his hand with the instrument up; all this in accordance with the quantity that has been prepared for him until he goes out.
Â¶ De extractione Sanguisugae.	On the extraction of blood from the tongue.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter XXXIX. On the extraction of blood from the tongue.
Quando medicatur sanguisuga cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex curatione cum medicinis, et non confert, tunc considera in gutture infirmi coram sole, siue apud solem postquam premis linguam eius cum instrumento quod narraui tibi.	When the bloodletting is done with medicines as I said in the division of cure and does not work, then look in his throat in front of the sun, or behind it when you press his tongue with the instrument which tells me.
Si ergo cadit uisus tuus super sanguisugam, extrahe eam cum uncino paruo, aut cum gesti subtilibus decenter.	But if your cough falls on the leech, extract it with a small hook or with subtle movements from the side.
Quod si non est possibile cum eis: tunc accipe cannulam concauam, et intromitte eam in guttur infirmi usque prope guttur: deinde intromitte in concauitatem cannulae ferrum ignitum cum igne.	That if it is not possible with them: then take a closed tube and insert it into his throat as far as the throat; and then introduce into the tube an iron rod heated with fire.
Fac illud multotiens: et abstineat infirmus ab aqua tota die.	Do this many times: and let the patient abstain from all water during the day.
Deinde accipiat uitreatam plenam aqua frigida, et aperiat os eius in ea: et colluat os suum cum ea, et non deglutiat ex ea aliquid: et moueat aquam una hora post aliam cum manu sua.	Then let him take a full drink of cold water and open his mouth in it; and let him blow out air from his mouth while drinking it, and not swallow anything: and let him move his hand with the water.
Sanguisuga enim ilico cum sentit aquam cadit.	For the leech immediately falls when he feels the water.
Si autem non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc suffumiga infirmum cum cimicibus, aut cum asa cum instrumento quod narraui in suffumigatione uuulae.	But if he does not go out with it which we have said then smoke the patient with incense, or with an ashe-pot, with an instrument which tells me in smoking.
Fac illud multotiens, quoniam ipsa cadet.	Do this many times, for she will fall by herself.
Et modus operationis in suffumigatione est, ut accipias ollam, in qua sint prunae uiuae cum igne: et olla sit cooperta cum coopertorio, in cuius medio sit foramen: et componatur in illo foramine extremitas instrumenti.	And the method of operation in smoking is, that you take a pot, in which there are plums with fire; and the pot is covered with a lid, in which there is a hole; and place the end of the instrument in that hole.
Deinde proiice suffumigationem, et ponat infirmus os suum in extremitate cannulae, et claudat os suum, ut non egrediatur suffumigatio, donec scias quod suffumigatio iam peruenit ad sanguisugam.	Then allow a suffumigation, and let the sick one place his nose at the end of the cannula, and close it, so that the suffumigation does not escape, until you know that the suffumigation has reached the blood-sucker.
Nam sanguisuga statim cadet.	For the leech quickly dies.
Quod si non cadit, tunc itera suffumigationem multotiens.	If it does not fall, then perform many suffumigations.
Et toleret infirmus sitim, et comedat salsa, et allia, et non bibat aquam.	And let the sick one bear hunger, and eat sauce, and other things, and do not drink water.
Necesse est ergo ut egrediatur cum hoc regimine.	Therefore it is necessary that he go out with this regimen.
Et haec est forma instrumenti cum quo extrahitur sanguisuga ex gutture, quando cadit super ipsam uisus.	And this is the form of the instrument from which the leech is drawn out of the throat when it falls on it and it burns.
Est simile forcipibus, sicut uides: nisi quia est ei haee curuitas quae intromittitur ad guttur.	It is similar to forceps, as you see: but because it has a curved tip that enters the throat.
Et extremitas eius similis ori auis quae nominatur ciconia, in quo est asperitas limae: quando comprehendit aliquid, non dimittit ipsum omnino.	And its end is similar to an ear, which is called cicogna, in which there is a sharp edge of the blade; and when it grasps anything, it does not let go at all.
Â¶ De apertione Apostematum, et eorum sectione, et cura in genere.	The opening of Aphemata, and their section, and care in general.
Caput XL.	Head 40.
Apostematum species sunt multae, multorum modorum, secundum quod uenit rememoratio eorum, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et sunt diuersae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.	There are many species of Aphemata, many ways, according to which the memory comes, that is, one, and the same in this book: and they differ in the perforation of them, and in the section of their own from two types.
Quorum unus est ex specie apostematis in seipso, et eo quod comprehendit ex humiditatibus.	Of which one is a species of Aphemata in itself, and because it grasps from the moisture.
Et modus secundus est propter loca, in quibus accidit ex corpore.	And the second type is because of the places, in which it happens out of the body.
Quoniam apostema accidens in capite, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in ano: et apostema accidens in loco carnoso, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in iuncturis: et unicuique eorum est iudicium suum ex operatione.	For an accident of Aphemata happens in the head, it is different from an accident of Aphemata in the anus; and an accident of Aphemata happens in fleshly place, it is different from an accident of Aphemata in joints; and each has its own judgment according to operation.
Et ex apostematibus sunt quae non oportet ut perforentur, nisi post maturationem saniei in eis, et complementum eius: et ex eis sunt, quae oportet ut perforentur, dum sunt cruda, et non maturantur secundum complementum.	And of the Aphemata are those that do not need to be pierced, unless after maturation of blood within them, and completion of it; and of them are those that need to be pierced when they are raw, and do not mature according to the completion.
Sicut apostemata quae sunt propinqua iuncturis.	As the blisters which are near to the wound.
Quoniam apostema quando accidit prope iuncturam, et prolongatur esse eius, donec putrefit quod est in circumitu eius fortasse corrumpuntur ligamenta, aut nerui illius iuncturae: quare est caussa propior contractionis illius membri.	Because the blister, if it occurs near the wound and is prolonged, until it becomes rotten what is in its surroundings maybe the ligaments are corroded, or the nerves of that joint: so it is the cause of a closer contraction of that member.
Aut est apostema apud membrum principale: quoniam si tu tardas perforationem eius, donec maturetur, nocebit uel illi, uel per illud membro principali.	Or is the blister on the main limb: for if you delay the piercing of it, until it has ripened, it will harm him or through that main member.
Aut est prope anum, perfora ergo ipsum immaturum: et non oportet, ut perfores, apostema crudum, non completae digestionis, nisi quod est prope anum, ut non putrefiat profundum, et longetur ad interiora ani, et fiat fistula, aut fiat in termino eius quod non sanatur.	Or is near a limb, pierce then that immature one: and do not, so you pierce, the raw blister, which has not been completely digested, unless it is near a limb, so that it does not putrefy deeply, and it extends to the insides of the body, and becomes a fistula, or becomes at the edge of it, that does not heal.
Oportet ut scias horam perforationis apostematis, quod maturatum est secundum complementum: et est apud sedationem doloris, recessionem febris, et diminutionem rubedinis, et pulsationis, et acuitatem capitis apostematis: et reliqua signa.	It is necessary that you know the time for piercing the blister, which has ripened according to the complement: and it is with the sedative of pain, the retreat of fever, and the diminution of redness, and pulsation, and keenness of head of the blister: and the rest of the signs.
Et oportet, ut facias eandem perforationem in inferiori loco apostematis, et uehementioris eminentiae: et sit perforatio uadens in longitudine corporis, si apostemata sunt in partibus manuum et pedum, et locis lacertorum, et chordarum, et neruorum, et arteriarum, et ad ultimum in omnibus locis aequalibus, quibus non est reflexio.	And you shall make the same piercing in the lower place of the blister, and more prominent eminence: and is the piercing to be made in the length of the body, if the blisters are in the parts of the hands and feet, and places of the ligaments, and nerves, and arteries, and up to the last in all equal places, there is no reflection.
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.	In those which reflect, pierce with the hand of the member.
Quando uero apostema est in locis carnosis: tunc melius est ut dimittas perforationem eius, donec confirmetur eius digestio, sicut diximus secundum complementum.	When however the blister is in the fleshly places: then it is better that you should stop piercing it, until its digestion has been confirmed, as we have said according to the complement.
Quoniam si tu perforas ipsum ante illud, prolongatur cursus uirus ex eo, et est multae sordis et sordiciei, et fortasse indurantur labia eius, et profunditas eius.	Because if you pierce it before that one, the course of the virus will be prolonged from it, and there is much dirt and corruption, and perhaps the lips of it will become harder, and its depth.
Et quaedam apostemata perforantur secundum latitudinem corporis apud necessitatem: aut secundum illud quo indiget membrum.	And certain staples are to be drilled through according to the breadth of the body, at need; or according to that which the limb requires.
Et oportet, ut administres in apostematibus paruis perforationem paruam, et in apostematibus magnis perforationem amplam: aut sectiones multas per similitudinem magnitudinis apostematis.	And it is necessary to make a small drill hole in small staples, and a large drill hole in large staples; or to cut sections of similar sizes of staples.
Et sunt ex apostematibus, in quibus oportet ut concauetur cutis: et incidatur quando iam facta est sicut pannus, et facta est in termino, quod iam mortua est: sicut illud quod accidit in multis, ut dubelet, et bubonibus.	And there are staples from which the skin should be sewn; and it is cut when it has already been made like a cloth, and has been completed, that which has already died: like that which happened to many, such as a laceration, and abscesses.
Et ex eis sunt quae secantur sectione habente tres angulos.	And there are staples that cut in three angles.
Et ex eis est, ex quo inciditur sicut figura folii myrti.	And from this one cuts like a fig leaf.
Sicut apostema inguinum.	As the staple of the groin.
Et ex eis sunt in quibus administratur sectio rotunda, et sectio lunaris: et similes eis ex sectionibus.	And there are staples from which a round section is made, and a lunar section; and similar ones from sections.
Illud uero cui non est caput, sicut sunt apostemata lenia superficialia, oportet ut perfores ipsum perforatione superficiali, uel plana tantum.	In truth, where there is no head, such as the soft staples, it is necessary to drill him with a superficial drill, or simply flat.
Et oportet, quando apostema est grossum, et iam collegit saniem multam, et perforas ipsum, ut non properes et extrahas pus totum in illa hora: imo extrahe ex ipso partem eius.	And it is necessary, when the staple is thick, and has already gathered a lot of puss, and you drill it, so that it does not break and does not leak all the pus at once: but take off a part from it.
Deinde opila apostema usque ad diem alium.	Then wrap the staple with cloth until another day.
Deinde extrahe quiddam ex pus iterum.	Then take out some pus again.
Fac illud multotiens secundum gradationem, donec egrediatur: praecipue si infirmus est debilis uirtutis, aut mulier praegnans, aut puer paruus, aur senex decrepitus: spiritus enim animalis ab animali multotiens resoluitur cum egressione saniei: et fortasse moritur infirmus, et tu non percipis.	Do this many times according to the measure, until it comes out: especially if he is a weak person of declining vigor, or a woman expecting, or a small boy, or an old man decrepitous: for the spirit of animals often resolves with the exit of pus: and perhaps the sick one dies, and you do not perceive it.
Caue ergo hoc capitulum cautela magna.	Therefore take care of this chapter with great caution.
Et post perforationem tuam, qua ista perforas apostemata, oportet ut abstergas uulnus: et considera.	And after you have drilled him, when you have drilled these staples, it is necessary to wipe the wound clean: and consider.
Si ergo est uulnus apostematis paruum, aut est sectio plana, tunc administra licinia ex lino, aut coto antiquo.	If then there is a staple of little wax, or it is a flat section, then administer wax from linen, or an old cot.
Et si est apostema magnum, et fissurae perforationis multae sunt, oportet tunc ut intromittas in omnem fissuram licinium, donec perueniant adinuicem.	If there is a large abscess and many perforations of the fissures, then you should then insert an awl into all the fissures until they are closed.
Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.	If you have cut off a part of the abscess or have made it around: then you should fill it with old cloth, or as when the skin is tender, or when the hair has grown and there is no moisture: and bind it tightly for three days.
Deinde proiice ipsum, et cura illud cum eo quod oportet ex unguento, donec sanetur.	Then let him discharge it, and care for that with him as he needs to with ointment, until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis in hora tuae operationis, tunc administra aquam frigidam, et acetum, postquam imbibitur in eis pannus: et ponis ipsum super locum fluxus sanguinis multotiens.	If, however, there is a flow of blood at the time of your operation, then you should administer cold water and vinegar to it after it has been soaked with cloth: and place it often on the site of the bleeding.
Si autem perseuerat fluxus sanguinis, tunc oportet ut administres regimen, et curationem, et pulueres, quae narraui in locis multis huius nostri libri, et ex diuisione.	If, however, the bleeding persists, then you should administer a regimen and treatment, and powders, which are recorded in various places in our book of this subject, and with a powder.
Si autem est in tempore hyemis, et locus apostematis est multorum neruorum: tunc oportet ut infundas puluillos cum uino, et oleo calidis: et ponas eos super loca.	If, however, it is in the season of winter and the site of the abscess is full of nerves: then you should fill the powders with wine and hot oil: and place them on the sites.
Et si fuerit in aestate, et loca sunt carnosa: tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos imbibitos in aqua, et oleo, aut eum uino et oleo, et totum illud frigidum.	And if it is in the season of summer and the places are fleshy: then you should place powders soaked with water and oil, or wine and oil, and all of that cold.
Donec quando erit dies tertius, sicut diximus, tunc oportet ut soluas apostema, et abstergas ipsum, et administres in curatione eius quod ei conuenit, donec sanetur.	Until the third day, as we have said, then you should let go of the abscess and clean it, and administer to it what is suitable for its treatment, until it heals.
Hoc est ergo quod necessarium est ex cognitione curationis apostematum uniuersaliter.	This is therefore what is necessary from the knowledge of the treatment of abscesses in general.
Secundum semitam uero distinctionis, iam dixi de omni apostemate, qualiter est uia ad curationem eius capitulatim singulariter.	According to the half, however, I have already said about every abscess, which is a path to the treatment of its individual head.
Â¶ De sectione apostematum quae accidunt in cute capitis.	On the Section on Abscesses that occur in the Skin of the Head.
Caput XLI.	Head 31.
Accidunt in cute capitis apostemata parua, et sunt ex speciebus Nodorum, quos continent tunicae, quae sunt eis sacci: quasi ipsa sint hausolati gallinae.	Abscesses occur on the skin of the head, small ones are made of nodules, which are surrounded by tunica, which are bags, like those from hens' nests.
Et ipsorum species sunt multae.	There are many types of them.
Ex eis sunt pingues: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditatem similem limo: et ex eis quae continent humiditatem similem frisatis et pultibus: et eis similibus, et ex eis sunt, quae sunt lapidea dura.	Of these there are many: and of these there are those that retain moisture similar to lime: and of these there are those that retain moisture similar to mud and pulp: and these are like, and among these are those that are hard rocks.
Et in sectione omnium, et ipsorum extractione non est timor, dum apud ipsorum sectionem non facit contrarietatem arteria.	And in the cutting of all, and in the extraction thereof there is no fear when you cut at their joints, for there is no difference in the arteries.
Et operatio in sectione eorum est, ut experiaris ea cum instrumento, cuius forma uenit post haec, quod nominatur Intromissum, donec scias quid contineat.	And the operation in their cutting is, that you try it out with an instrument, whose form has come after these, which is called the intromitter, until you know what it contains.
Nam si est illud quod continet humiditas, tunc seca ipsum sectione secundum longitudinem sectione superficiali: secundum hanc formam.	For if that is what contains moisture, then dry it up by cutting it according to the length of the surface section: in this form.
Et incipe cum sectione ex linea b. ad lineam, g. Cum ergo euacuatur humiditas, tunc excoria kistin quae continet illam humiditatem, et non dimittas ex ea aliquid penitus.	And begin with the cutting from line b to line a. But when the moisture is emptied out, then peel off the skin that contains that moisture, and do not leave anything of it inside.
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.	For many times it will return if there remains anything of it.
Deinde submerge cotum in unguento aegyptio, si est praesens: et si non, in aqua et sale: et imple cum eo uulnus, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then dip the cloth in Egyptian ointment, if it is present: and if not, in water and salt: and fill it with it, and leave it until another day.
Ipsum enim corrodet quod remansit ex kisti.	For this corrosion will eat up what remains of the skin.
Deinde itera super ipsum cotum cum aegyptio secundo, et tertio, et si indiges illo, donec confidas quia non remanserit ex kisti aliquid, tunc enim cura uulnus cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the ointment over the cloth a second time and a third time: and if you bear it well, until you are convinced that nothing remains of the skin, then indeed do not be afraid of the ointment; for I will heal.
Quod si apostema continet nodum pinguem: tunc seca ipsum secundum hanc formam, sectione habente formam crucis: et proiice uncinos inter duolabia sectionis, et excoria ipsum ab omni parte: et conare uirtutem tuam in extractione tunicae quae continet ipsum.	That if an apoplexy contains a swollen nodule: then dry it up according to this form, having a section of the shape of a cross: and throw off the skin between two lobes of the section, and peel it off from all parts: and try your skill in extracting the skin that contains the nodule.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi arteria, tunc fac illud quod narrabo tibi post.	But if there is a difference to you when the arteries are cut, then do what I will tell you after.
Et similiter fac in apostemate, si est lapideum, ex sectione, et curatione eadem, secundum quod diximus.	And do likewise in an apoplexy, if it is hard, from the section, and with the same cure, according to what we have said.
Et sectio super apostema lapideum est facilior: quoniam est pauci sanguinis et humiditatis.	And cutting above the stone is easier: for it is little of blood and moisture.
Et quandoque sunt quaedam horum apostematum quae sunt in capite in quibusdam hominibus, cum quibus penitus non est humiditas.	And when there are some of these stones in the head of some men, where there is no moisture within.
Quod est: quia ego secui super apostema in capite mulieris uetulae, et inueni apostema sicut lapis solidus et durus, asper, albus, qui non poterat frangi: et si percuteretur cum eo aliquis proiiciendo, uulnerat ipsum.	That is: because I followed over the stone in the head of a married woman, and found the stone like a solid and hard, rough, white, which could not be broken: and if it were struck by him when he threw, it wounded himself.
In aliis uero apostematibus accidentibus in capite, praeter haec scilicet apostemata quae accidunt in capitibus puerorum, et apud radices aurium, sectio eorum omnium sit sectio superficialis.	In others however of these stones of accidents in the head, besides this that happen in the heads of boys, and at the roots of the ears, all of them is a superficial cutting.
Vel pone perforationem eorum semper ab inferiori parte eorum, ut alleuietur cursus saniei ad inferiora.	Or put an incision of them always from their lower part, that it may alleviate the course of blood to the bottom.
Deinde cura ea cum eo quod conuenit eis ex curatione.	Then take care of those with him as they should be taken when he is cured.
Â¶ De sectione Strophularum in collo.	Regarding the cutting of the strumpfes in the neck.
Caput XLII.	Chapter LII. The head.
Multotiens acccidunt ista apostemata in collo, et sub assellis, et inguinibus: et quandoque accidunt in reliquo corpore.	These stones often happen in the neck, and under the armpits, and sometimes in all the body.
Et super illa quae ex eis accidunt in collo, sunt unum, et multa: et generantur ab inuicem: et omnis Strophula ex eis est intra tunicam propriam ei, sicut est in nodis et apostematibus capitis, sicut narrauimus.	And over those that happen from them in the neck, there is one, and many: and they come from within; and all of the strumpfes come out of their own skin, as we have reported.
Et species harum Strophularum sunt multae.	And the kinds of these strumpfes are many.
Et ex eis enim sunt lapideae: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates: et ex eis sunt malignae, quae non obediunt curationi.	For they are some from stones; and some hold moisture; and some are wicked, and do not submit to the cure.
In illa ergo quam ex eis uides bonae dispositionis in tactu, cuius manifestum est propinquum colori cutis, et mouetur ad omnem partem, et non est annexa cum neruis colli, neque cum guidegi, neque cum arteria, neque est profunda: oportet ut seces eam sectione superficiali a superiori parte ad inferiorem partem corporis ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. et excoria eam ab omni parte: et extende duo labia cutis cum uncino, aut cum uncinis multis, si indiges illo, sicut diximus in apostematibus capitis, et extrahe eam paulatim.	In that one that you see of good disposition when it is touched, whose manifest is its nearness to the color of the skin, and which moves to all parts, and does not adhere to the nerves of the neck, nor to the guide-è¡ç®¡, nor to the arteries, and is not deep: let it be cut off with a superficial cutting from the upper part to the lower part of the body in a line, b. to the line, g., and clean it out of all parts: and extend two skin lips with an anchor, or with many anchors, if you can bear it, as we have said in the head strumpfes, and draw them out slowly.
Et est super cautelam, ut non incidatur uena, aut neruus.	And it is necessary to take great care so that no new wound or nerve occurs.
Et sit spatumile non acutum ualde: ut non addat tibi manum tuam cum incisione, aut inquietet infirmum, et incidas quod non est necesse.	And let the knife be not very acute, lest it cut your hand with an incision, or disturb the sick person, and you fall into a mistake which is unnecessary.
Si autem incidis uenam, aut arteriam, aut prohibet te ab operatione, tunc pone in uulnus zegi tritum, aut quosdam pulueres qui abscindunt sanguinem, et stringe uulnus, et dimitte ipsum, donec quiescat acuitas apostematis, et mollificetur uulnus: uel incipit et uult putrefieri.	But if you cut a vein or an artery, or prevents you from performing the operation, then put the piece in a dry place, or some powder that stops the blood, and tighten the tourniquet, and let go of it until the sharpness subsides, and the wound softens: or else it begins to rot.
Nam sanguis abscinditur tuncia Redi ergo ad operationem tuam, donec compleas.	For the blood is stopped by the bandage. So bring it back to your operation, until you are finished.
Deinde inquire digito tuo indice, si remansit aliquid ex Strophulis aliis paruis: ergo incide eas, et munda eas.	Then inquire with your index finger, if there is anything left of the staphylitis with some powder: so cut them and clean them.
Quod si est in radice Strophulae uena magna: tunc oportet ut non incidas illam Strophulam ex radice sua: imo oportet ut liges eam cum filo duplato forti, et dimittas eam donec cadat per se absque nocumento.	For if it is in the root of a staphylococcus a large new one: then it should not be cut from its root: but it should be tied with a strong double knot, and let it fall by itself without doing any harm.
Deinde imple uulnus coto ueteri, quod iam submersisti in unguento aegyptio.	Then fill the wound with old cotton that has already been soaked in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum.	Then take care of yourself.
Si inciditur Strophula tota, tunc oportet ut aggreges labia duo uulneris: et suas ipsum statim, postquam uides quia prorsus non remansit superfluitas.	If the whole staphylococcus is cut: then you should gather the two edges of the wound: and close it immediately, once you see that there is no dÆ°;
Si autem uides quod remansit superfluitas propter magnitudinem Strophulae, tunc oportet ut intendas ad incidendam radicem eius, et extrahendam eam: et administra suturam quam diximus.	If you see that there is dÆ° due to the size of the staphylococcus, then you should consider cutting its root and pulling it out: and administer the suturing that I have described.
Et quae ex Strophulis continet humiditates, perfora illam perforatione superficiali: ut appareat tibi locus maturitatis eius: et pone perforationem ab eo quod sequitur inferius corporis, sicut diximus.	And the staphylococcus that contains moisture should be punctured with a superficial puncture: so that you can see the place of maturity of it: and put the puncture away from what follows below the body, as we have said.
Deinde administra post perforationem licinia cum unguento, et similia eis, ut corrodat quod remansit ex corruptione, donec quando uides uulnus iam mundatum esse: tunc cura ipsum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then after the puncture administer liniment with ointment and similar things, so that it corrupts what remains from corruption, until such time as you see the wound have healed: then take care of yourself with a generous ointment of meat, until it is cured.
Â¶ De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.	On the sectioning of the epiglottis with an accident in the throat.
Caput XLIII.	De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente
Dixerunt antiqui hanc sectionem in Epigloti, et non uidi aliquem in terra nostra, qui eam fecerit: et haec est scriptura sermonis eorum.	The ancient ones said that this sectioning of the epiglottis was done by someone, and I do not see anyone in our land who has done it: and this is the writing of their speech.
In habentibus autem synanchiam, oportet ut deuitetur sectio Epiglotis: cum non fiat iuuamentum per illud: propterea, quod omnes uenae et pulmo sunt infirmi.	In those who have a ÑÐ¸Ð½Ð°Ð½ÑÐ¸Ñ, the section of the epiglottis should be performed: but it is not done by that: for all the air and lung are weak.
In illis uero qui habent apostema calidum in ore, aut gutture, aut duabus amigdalis, quando non est aegritudo in cannali, oportet uti sectione Epiglotis, ad fugiendum ex perditione quae fit ex praefocatione.	In those who have a hot apostema in the mouth or throat or in both amygdals, when there is no disease in the canal, one should use the section of the epiglottis in order to escape the destruction which is caused by pre-formation.
Oportet ergo quando uolumus illud, ut secemus Epiglotim sub tribus circulis Epiglotis, aut quatuor, sectione parua per latitudinem, in eo quod est inter duos circulos per quantitatem, quod sit sectio in sifac, non in cartilagine: et iste quidem locus est conueniens sectioni, quoniam est priuatus carne, et uasa sanguinis ab eo sunt longinqua.	Therefore, when we wish to do this, let us cut the epiglottis with a small section under a circle of the epiglottis or four, in that which is between two circles by the quantity, which is a section in a sifac, not in cartilage: and this place is suitable for cutting, because it is separated from flesh, and the blood vessels are far from it.
Quod si medicator est timidus, tunc oportet ut extendat cutem gutturis cum uncino.	That if the doctor is timid, then he should extend the skin of the throat with a hook.
Deinde findat cutem, donec quando peruenit ad cannalem: deuitet uas sanguinis, si uidet ex eis aliquid.	Then he will find the skin, until he reaches to the canal: he should stop the flow of blood, if he sees anything from it.
Deinde secet sifac quod narrauimus: et significatur super sectionem cannalis ex phlegmate quod egreditur ex ea, cum eo quod disrumpitur, et abscisione uocis.	Then let him cut the sifac which we have mentioned: and let it be signalled on the section of the canal from the phlegm which comes out from it, with that by which it is interrupted, and by the abruption of the voice.
Et dimitte uulnus apertum tempore aliquo.	And let go of the loop at some time.
Cum ergo remouetur hora in qua timetur praefocatio, aggrega duo labia uulneris cutis, et sue ipsam solam absque cartilagine.	So when the hour is coming near in which fear is caused by pre-formation, let two aggregates of the lip of the wound of the skin move it and leave it alone without cartilage.
Deinde administra medicinas quae faciunt nasci carnem, usquequo sanetur.	Then administer medicines which make meat grow, until it heals.
Inquit Albucasis.	Says Albucasis.
Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: uadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.	The summary of this discourse that we have related is an exposition only when it is evident that one of these aphorisms has already been affected by the disease; and the sick person is raised above death, and his thirst is quenched with a desire to breathe: so he is saved from death, and therefore they ordered that the wound should be closed until the malady had spent itself, and it was a malady of three days, and almost the same as himself: then they commanded that the wound should be opened, and that he should be tended until he recovered.
Et illud quod uidi per me ipsum est, quod una ancilla accaepit cultellum, et misit cum in guttur suum, et incidit cum eo partem cannalis pulmonis.	And this which I saw myself is that a servant took a knife and put it into his throat, and it entered with it a part of the canal of the lungs.
Et uocatus sum ad curationem eius, et inueni eam mugire, sicut est mugitus mortui.	And I was called to cure him, and I found him gasping, as it is the breathing of a dead person.
Detexi ergo a uulnere, et inueni sanguinem qui egressus fuerat ex uulnere paruum.	I then opened his wound, and I found blood flowing out from the small wound.
Confisus ergo sum, quod ipsa non absciderat uenam, neque guidegi: et uentus egrediebatur ex uulnere.	So I was convinced that he had not cut the vein, nor had it burst: and breath came out of the wound.
Properaui ergo, et sui uulnus, et curaui ipsum, donec sanum est: et non accidit ancillae aliquid, nisi raucedo in uoce: et rediit post dies ad meliorem dispositionum suarum.	Then I closed the wound, and tended to him until he was well: and nothing happened to the servant but a hoarseness in his voice; and after a few days he returned to his usual health.
Hinc ergo dico: quod in sectione Epiglotis non est timor.	Therefore, I say that there is no fear in the section of the epiglottis.
Â¶ De sectione Herniae gutturis.	On the section of the gullet.
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter XLVIII.
Hoc Apostema nominatum Hernia gutturis, est apostema magnum, secundum colorem corporis: et est in mulieribus multum.	This aphorism called Hernial gut is a great aphorism, second in order of appearance, and the color of the body: it is found in women very often.
Et est secundum duos modos: aut enim est naturale: aut est accidentale.	And it has two causes: or it is natural; or it is accidental.
In naturali certe non est ingenium.	Certainly, there is no talent in the natural.
Accidentale uero est secundum duos modos: quorum unus est similis nodis pinguibus.	But the accidental has two causes: one of which is similar to the nods of the pinguis;
Et modus alter, est similis apostemati quod fit ex nodatione arteriae.	And the other mode is similar to an aphorism that is made from the contraction of an artery.
Et in ipso est timor, et non oportet ut praesumptio fiat ad ipsum cum ferro, nisi in eo quod est paruum: et tu proba ipsum, et inuestiga ipsum cum Intromisso.	And there is fear in it, and it is not right that presumption should be made about it with iron, unless it is little; and you test it, and investigate it with an instrument.
Si ergo inuenis ipsum simile nodo pingui, et non est suspensum cum aliqua uenarum: tunc seca ipsum, sicut secantur nodi: et extrahe ipsum cum eo quod continet ex kisti, si est in kisti: et si non, tunc perscrutare totum eius.	If then you pierce the node with a heavy needle, and it is not suspended with any sutures: then dry the node, as they dry knots; and take it out with what holds it, if it is in a sack: and if not, then examine all of it.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod oportet ex curatione, donec sanetur.	Then be careful of the place with what is necessary for curing, until it heals.
Â¶ De sectione super species Nodorum.	Â§ On cutting above species of nodes.
Caput XLV.	Ch. L.
Nodorum multae sunt species, et ego iam dixi omnes species eorum in diuisione: et oportet ut narrem hic differentiam inter Nodum, et Exituram: cum sit dubitationem faciens.	There are many species of nodes, and I have already spoken about them in a division: and it is necessary that I should tell here the difference between node and excision: when making a doubt.
Dico ergo, quod cum Exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolores uehementes, donec sedatur ebullitio superfluitatis, et completur putrefactio: tunc enim quiescunt febris et calor.	I say, then, that where there is excision, there is heat, and fever, and painful throbs, until an efflux of serous fluid subsides, and putrefaction is completed: for then the fever and the heat subside.
Cum Nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis saccus proprius, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaeptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.	But where there is a node, there is no heat, nor fever, nor pain, and they hold them in a sack of their own, which is second to the color of the body: and it is like beans, and becomes like a mat, and greater or smaller.
Et sunt secundum duas species: aut pingues: aut continent humiditatem.	And they are according to two species: either they are fat: or they hold moisture.
Et colores humiditatis sunt multi, secundum quod dixi in diuisione.	And the colors of moisture are many, according to what I said in a division.
Oportet ergo, quando peruenis ad curationem Nodi, ut experiaris eum, et inquiras ipsum in primis cum instrumento quod nominatur Intromissum, secundum quod ueniet forma eius in capitulo quod est post hoc.	It is necessary, then, when you are treating a node, that you experiment on it, and investigate it with an instrument which is called Intro-mission, according to the form of its shape in the chapter which comes after this.
Et modus inquisitionis apostematum, et Nodorum omnium est, ut accipias hoc instrumentum, et intromittas ipsum in humidiorem locum, quem inuenis in apostemate: et tu reuolue digitos tuos cum eo paulatim, donec scias quod instrumentum iam penetrauit cutem.	And the way of investigating by penetration, and all nodes is, that you take this instrument, and introduce it into a moistened place, which you pierce in an aposteme: and you move your fingers gradually with it, until you know that the instrument has penetrated the skin.
Deinde ultima manum tuam secundum mensuram magnitudinis apostematis.	Then take your last hand according to the measurement of the apophelian arch.
Deinde extrahe Intromissum, et considera illud quod egrediur in uestigio eius.	Then extract the intramuscular and examine what emerges from its groove.
Si ergo egreditur humiditas currens, quicunque color sit: tunc seca ipsum sectione superficiali, secundum quod dixi in reliquis apostematibus.	If then there emerges a running moisture, whatever its color: then dry it out by a superficial sectioning, according to what I said regarding the other apophelian arch.
Et si non egreditur humiditas in uestigio Intromissi, tunc scias quia est pinguis: seca ergo super ipsum sectione habente formam crucis, secundum formam hanc, sicut docui te: et suspende ipsum cum uncinis, et excoria cutem ab omni parte cum facilitate: et custodi kistin si potes super illud, ut extrahas ipsam sanam cum Nodo.	And if there does not emerge moisture in the groove of the Intromissum, then you will know that it is thick: so dry out above the area with a sectioning in the form of a cross, according to this very form, as I taught you: and suspend it by means of hooks, and scrape off the skin from all parts with ease: and guard the cruciform section so that you can remove the healthy tissue with the Nodo.
Si autem disrumpitur kistis apud operationem, et non est possibile extrahere ipsam sanam, multotiens enim accidit illud, tunc extrahe ipsam frustatim, donec non remaneat ex ea aliquid.	If then the skin is broken during the procedure and it is not possible to remove the healthy tissue, since this often happens, then remove it hastily, until nothing remains of it.
Nam si remanet ex ea aliquid parum, aut multum, redit Nodus secundum plurimum.	For if there remains of it a little or much, the Nodo returns according to many accounts.
Quod si uincit te, et remanet ex eo parum: tunc imple uulnus apud completionem tuam, quibusdam pulueribus corrosiuis acutis: et stringe uulnus, et pone supra ipsum quod sedet apostema calidum, et cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	For if it hurts you, and there remains of it a little: then fill your wound with some acrid powder: and tighten the bandage, and place it over the arch that sits on fire, and take care of the wound with the rest of the cure, until it heals.
Si ergo est Nodus magnus, tunc sue duo labia eius, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat.	If then is a large Nodo, then cut two of its lips, and take care of the wound with that which has become inflamed.
Si autem est tibi contraria uena pulsatilis, aut non pulsatilis: tunc propera, et imple locum zegi trito, et dimitte ipsum strictum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec putrefiat uulnus, et quiescat ebullitio sanguinis: deinde redi ad incidendum illud quod remansit ex Nodo.	If then is a new, pulsating or not pulsating nodule: then approach it, and fill the place to be cut three times, and leave it bound for two days, or three, until the bandage putrefies and the inflammation subsides: then return to cutting what remains of the Nodo.
Â¶ De foris instrumentorum pro sectione et perforatione.	Regarding instruments from outside for the purpose of sectioning and piercing.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter LXVI. On the head.
EX Eis sunt formae Intromissorum, et sunt trium specierum.	There are three forms of Intromissums:
Ex eis enim est magnum, et ex eis est medium, et ex eis est paruum.	For from these there is great power, and from these there is mediocrity, and from these there is weakness.
Fiant ex ferro alfulud quadratarum extremitatum decenter, ut festinent introitum in apostemate.	For from iron let there be made a square of four extremities askew, that they may hold fast the entrance to the apotome.
Et istae sunt formae Experientium, et no, id est, perforantia: et unum eorum nominatur beris, idest, peforans: et sunt trium specierum.	And these are forms of experimentations, and no, i.e., piercings: and there is one called bers, i.e., piercing: and there are three species.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et medium, et paruum.	For from these there is great power, and mediocrity, and weakness.
Conueniunt, ut inuestigentur per ea apostemata, et exiturae, et fistulae, et bubones ab eo quod inter ea est ex ossibus.	They come together, that they may be investigated by the apotomes, and exits, and slits, and pustules from him because he is between them from bones.
Et aliis fiunt rotunda, tersa, lenia, sicut acus magnae quibus subsellia suuntur, ex citrino scilicet, aut ex aere, aut ferro, aut argento.	And others are round, third, smooth, such as the big needles which are made of citrine, or of brass, or of iron, or of silver.
Et meliora eorum sunt quae fiunt ex citrino.	And better ones are those that are made of citrine.
Et fiunt Experientia etiam de plumbo nigro, quae conueniunt ut per ea experiantur fistulae, quarum concauitate sunt reflexiones, ut reflectantur cum lenitate sua cum illis reflexionibus.	And there are experiments also of black lead, which come together so that they may be experimented on the slits, whose reflections are caused by their smoothness, so that they reflect with gentleness with those reflections.
Et sunt iterum trium specierum.	And again there are three species.
Quoniam ex eis sunt longa, ex eis media, et ex eis breuia, secundum quantitatem amplitudinis fistulae et stricturae eius.	For from these there are long ones, and from these mediocrity, and from these brevity, according to the quantity of width of the slit and its strictness.
Forma Vncinorum, et sunt multarum specierum.	Form of the anvil, and they are many species.
Quoniam ex eis sunt simplices, scilicet quibus est curuitas una: et sunt trium specierum sicut uides, Magni, Medii, et Parui.	For from these there are simplicity, i.e., those which have one smoothness: and they are three species as you see, Great, Medium, and Small.
Et ex eis sunt Vncini caeci: et sunt trium specierum.	And from these there are blind anvils: and they are three species.
Et ex eis sunt uncini habentes duas curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et ex eis sunt uncini habentes tres curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et omnes isti sunt necessarii in loco suo.	And from these there are anvils having two smoothings, and they are three species: and from these there are anvils having three smoothings, and they are three species: and all of these are necessary in their place.
Et istae sunt formae Scalpellorum, quibus secantur et excoriantur Nodi, et apostemata: et sunt trium specierum: quoniam ex eis est magnum, medium, et paruum.	And these are forms of scalpels, with which they cut and scorch the nodules and apotomes: and they are three species: for from these there is great power, mediocrity, and weakness.
Eorum extremitates quibus fit sectio sunt acutae, extremitates aliae sunt non acutae: et non ponuntur taliter, nisi ut cum eis fiat iuuamentum in excoriatione Nodorum apud timorem incisionis uenae, aut nerui: et ut sanetur per ea infirmus, et inueniat tranquillitatem parumper ex adustione quam inuenit apud excoriationem apostematis.	Their extremities which are acute, the extremities of others are not acute: and they are not laid on so, except as with them a ligament is made in an excoriation of the nods at the fear of an incision of the vein or nerve: and that it may heal through it the sick, and find a little calm from the bitterness as it finds by an excoriation of pustules.
Istae sunt Magda, et sunt specierum trium.	These are Magda, and they are the species of three.
Fiunt ex aere, et sunt similia Radio, cum quo fit alcohol: et in extremitate lata est puncta Spatumilis occultata: et in ea currit ad interiora, et ad exteriora quando uis, sicut uides.	They are made of air, and they are similar to the radio, with which alcohol is made: and in the long end there is a small spot called Oculto: and it runs to the insides, and to the outsides when you see it, like you do.
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magnum, medium, et paruum.	The shape of the Spatumilium which are hidden between the fingers at the perforation of the pustules: and they cannot be perceived by the sick: and they are of three species, great, medium, and small.
Fomae Ventosarum cum quibus abscinditur fluxus sanguinis: et sunt trium specierum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.	The forms of the Wind-vessels, with which the flow of blood is cut off: and they are of three species, great, medium, and small.
Fiant ex aere, aut citrino, rotundae, ad longitudinem parumper, sicut uides: et sint ad subtilitatem.	Let them be made of air, or of yellow brass, round, a little long, like you see it: and let them be to subtility.
Et oportet ut sint istae species Ventosarum apud te magnae, et paruae: ut abscindas per eas sanguinem cum uelocitate apud necessitatem, et tunc quando non est tibi praesens medicina.	And let these species of the Wind-vessels be with you great, and small: that you may cut off blood through them with velocity at need, and then when there is no medicine present with you.
Verumtamen non utaris eis in abscisione sanguinis in omni loco corporis, et non utaris nisi in locis carnosis: sicut lacertis cruris, et coxae, et lacertis brachiorum, et mammillarum, et uentris, et inguinum, et similibus eis, ex lacertis carnosis, humidis.	However, you should not use them for the cutting off of blood in any part of the body, and you should not use them except in the fleshy places: like the lizards of the legs, and of the hips, and of the arms, and of the breasts, and of the foot, and of the groin, and similar to these, from the fleshy lizards, moist.
Et quandoque fiunt ex eis instrumenta parua alia similia corticibus fisticorum, secundum suam formam: quibus abscinditur sanguis quando fluit ex loco phlebotomiae, aut apud incisionem uenae, aut arteriae: et quandoque fiunt ex eis rotundae secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes they are made small from these, other similar to the corks of the fists, according to their form: which cuts off blood when it flows from a place of phlebotomy, or at an incision of the vein, or artery: and sometimes they are made round according to this form.
Â¶ De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.	On the treatment of mammilli in humans which resemble mammilli in women.
Caput XLVII.	Chapter LVII. On the treatment of mammaries in humans which
Quandoque inflantur Mammillae quorundam hominum apud complementum somni (id est, cum incipiunt pollui in somno) donec similantur mammillis mulierum: et remanent apostemosae foede.	When the mammaries of some men swell up towards the side of sleep (that is, when they begin to be inflamed while sleeping), until they resemble the mammilli of women, and then remain swollen with milk.
Qui ergo abhorret illud, oportet ut secet super mammillas sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Deinde excoria pinguedinem totam.	Whoever wishes to avoid this (that is, the swelling of the mammaries), should cover them with a lunar cloth, according to this form from the line B to the line G. Then scrub the entire area with a poultice.
Postea imple uulnus ex medicamine incarnatiuo.	Afterwards fill it with a poultice of incurable ointment.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then join the two lips of the wound together with a stitch, and care for it, until it is healed.
Si autem declinat mammilla ad inferiora, et mollificatur propter magnitudinem suam, sicut accidit mulieribus: tunc oportet ut findatur in duobus lateribus suis superioribus duabus sectionibus similibus figurae lunari, quarum unaquaeque continetur cum altera apud fines utriusque, donec sit linea maior continens minorem, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Postea excoria cutem quae est inter duo labia, et aufer pinguedinem, et administra quod diximus de sutura et pulueribus, quod est necessarium ex curatione, donec sanetur.	If, however, the mammilla turns downward towards the lower part and softens on account of its size, as happens to women: then it is necessary that it be joined in two parts of a similar lunar shape on both sides, each holding the other near its ends, until they are united by a larger line containing the smaller one, according to this form from the line B to the line G. Then scrub the skin which is between the two lips, and remove the poultice, and administer what we have said about the stitch and powders, which is necessary in the treatment, until it is healed.
Si autem non comples incisionem eius quod oportet te incidere, propter inquietudinem infirmi, aut propter fluxum sanguinis: tunc oportet ut impleas uulnus coto submerso unguento corrosiuo, et dimitte ipsum, donec corrodat illud quod remansit ex pinguedine.	If, however, you do not wish to incise it as is necessary to incision, on account of trembling or of the flow of blood: then fill it with a poultice immersed in a corrosive ointment, and leave it, until that which remains from the poultice is corroded.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it, until it is healed.
Â¶ De perforatione apostematis, quod accidit sub Titillico.	Chapter On the perforation of abscesses, which happened during the reign of Titus.
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter LVII.
Ista apostemata quae accidunt sub Titillico, sunt ex speciebus Strophularum dura, quae continet kistis, et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates.	These abscesses which happen during the reign of Titus, are of a hard kind, which contains a sac and from it there issue secrets.
Quae ergo sunt ex eis quae continent humiditates, oportet ut secentur sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam, ex linea b. ad lineam, g. cum ergo euacuatur totum quod est in apostemate ex sanie, tunc imple ipsum coto ueteri, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Whatever is contained within these that is wet should be washed with lunar section, in this form, from line b to line g; and so whatever is there in the apomate from the filth, then fill it with old cloth, and leave it until another day.
Deinde auferatur cotum, et curetur cum unguento conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then the cloth should be removed and treated with a suitable ointment for that purpose, until it heals.
Quod si apostema fuerit ex specie nodorum Strophularum, tunc scinde super ipsum, sicut diximus in sectione super Strophulas aequaliter.	If the apomate is from the species of nods of the Strophulus, then cut it over it as we have said in the section on Strophulus equal to it.
Si autem extenditur uulnus in hoc ut emittat pus, tunc administra in eo cauterium, secundum quod diximus in eo quod praemissum est.	If however a tendon is stretched out in this way so that it discharges pus, then administer cauterization to it, as we have said before, in what was pre-empted.
Â¶ De sectione apostematis quod accidit propter Arteriam et Venam.	As for the section of apomatides that occurs due to an artery or a vein.
Caput XLIX.	Chapter XLVIII.
Quando disrumpitur Arteria, et consolidatur cutis quae est supra eam, tuno multotiens accidit inde apostema: et similiter accidit Venae etiam, ut accidat in ea apostema et inflatio.	When an artery bursts and the skin that is above it hardens, often there results a pustule; also occurs to veins, as it does with them, resulting in a pustule and swelling.
Et signa quibus cognoscitur, quod apostema et inflatio sint propter Arteriam et Venam, sunt: quoniam, quando apostema est propter arteriam, est longum, aggregatum in profundo corporis: et quando impellis apostema digits tuis, sentis quasi sit ei stridor.	And the signs by which it is recognized that the apomate and swelling are due to an artery or a vein, are these: because, when the apomate is due to an artery, it is long, aggregated in the depth of the body; and when you feel the apomate of your fingers, you almost hear a whistle.
Et illud quod est propter Venam, est rotundum in manifesto corporis.	And what is due to a vein is round, evident on the surface of the body.
Et sectio super hoc apostema est error, et praecipue quod est sub ascellis, et inguinibus, et collo, et in locis multis corporis: et est magnum ualde.	And the section over this apomate is an error, and especially if it is under the armpits, and groin, and throat, and other places on the body; and it is great indeed.
Oportet ergo ut deuitetur eius cura cum ferro, et quod ex eis etiam est in extremitatibus, aut in capite, oportet ut deuitetur.	Therefore, so that it is cured with iron, and whatever is also on the edges, or in the head, it should be cured too.
Super illud ergo quod ex eis est ex inflatione orificii Arteriae, finde in cute sectione in longitudine.	Over this, then what is on it from the swelling of the opening of an artery, find in the skin in length.
Deinde aperi sectionem cum uncinis, postea Arteriam: et libera eam ex tunicis, donec detegatur.	Then open the section with a hook, then the artery: and free it from the tunics until it is detected.
Deinde intromitte sub ea acum, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, et stringe Arteriam cum filo duplo in duobus locis, secundum quod docui te in extractione duarum Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then introduce a hook underneath it, and let it penetrate until it reaches another side, and tighten the artery with double thread in two places, as I have taught you in the extraction of two arteries that are in the temples.
Deinde punge locum, qui est inter duo ligamenta cum spatumili, donec egrediatur sanguis qui est in eo totus, et soluatur apostema.	Then pierce the place which is between the two ligaments with a sharp instrument, until blood comes out completely, and break up the aphemia.
Deinde administra curationem quae generat pus, donec cadant ligamenta: postea cura illud cum unguentis conuenientibus ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then administer the cure which generates pus, until the ligaments fall: then treat that with suitable unguents, until it heals.
Quod si fuerit apostema propter sectionem Venae, tunc oportet ut teneas manu tua quod tibi possibile est ex apostemate cum cute.	That if there is an aphemia due to the section of a vein, then you must hold your hand so that you do not touch it from the aphemia with skin.
Deinde intromitte acum sub loco quem tenuisti manu tua, et fac eam penetrare: et sit in ea filum duplum, donec extrahas ipsum ex latere altero.	Then introduce a hook underneath the place which you held with your hand, and let it penetrate: and let it remain in it a double thread, until you extract it from the other side.
Deinde liga cum ipso apostema ligamento bono: secundum quod dixi tibi in ligamento uuae, a duabus partibus cum duabus extremitatibus fili.	Then tie up with it the aphemia with a good ligament: as I have told you in the tying of an artery, from its two parts with its two extremities with thread.
Si autem times quod extrahatur filum, tunc intromitte acum aliam cum filo alio sub apostemate toto apud incisionem acus: preme, et stringe fila tua in quatuor locis.	If you are to extract the thread, then introduce a hook with another thread under the aphemia all around the incision of the hook: squeeze, and tighten your threads in four places.
Deinde seca apostema in medio sui, donec quando egreditur quod in eo est: tunc incide superfluitatem cutis, et dimitte quod ligatum est ex ea.	Then dry up the aphemia in the middle of it until there is nothing left inside: then cut off the excess skin, and let go what has been tied to it.
Deinde pone super ipsum puluillum quem submersisti in uino, et oleo.	Then put on top of it a little feather which you immersed in wine, and oil.
Deinde administra curationem, quae fit cum liciniis et unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then administer the cure, which is made with liniments and unguents, until it heals.
Â¶ De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.	The aphemia that occurred from a twist of the nerves.
Caput L.	Head.
Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.	As happened to the aphemia in the artery and vein, so it happened to the nerves: which happened from a punch, or from excessive work, and similar: and it happens to them in many places of help, or of heels, and in any place where joints move: and it is a grey aphemia.
Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.	The color is similar to that of the rest of his body, and it is in many positions without pain: and when it is stretched with vehemence, he feels in it a similar stupor of weakness.
Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.	And there is no swelling in the depth of the body, but it is under the skin, and it moves itself to all parts, and does not feel in front, nor before, nor behind.
Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportet ut inuadatur cum ferro.	What is there on the joints, then, that needs to be rubbed with iron?
Fortasse enim accidet contractio.	Perhaps, then, a contraction may happen.
In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.	But in that which is on the head, or forehead, find skin with oil.
Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.	If then there is a small swelling, then hold it with tweezers, and cut it off from the root.
Et si est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uulnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if it is large, then hang it by a hook, and scrape it off: then take it off, and collect the wound with a stitch: and take care of it, until it heals.
Â¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.	Regarding the cutting open of swellings, which occurs in the belly.
Caput LI.	Chapter LI.
Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.	Some people often get a kind of fungus in their bellies, and in the rest of their bodies, which they call 'Fungia', because it resembles fungi.
Quorum radix est subtilis, et ipsorum caput est grossum, et conuersa sunt labia eorum.	The root is subtle, and the head is large, and their lips are wide apart.
Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.	And there is a little of it: and there is some that grows very large.
Et ego quidem iam uidi uirum, et in uentre eius erant duo thelil, quae erant magis quam rebus aliis similia fungis: non erat differentia inter ea, alba, minutae radicis, et inuersabantur labia eorum, et findebantur, et humiditas currebat ex eis semper.	And I have already seen a man, and there were two swellings in his belly, which were more than other things similar to mushrooms; there was no difference between them, white, small-rooted, and their lips were open, and they were projecting, and moisture flowed out of them always.
Incidi ergo ea, et inueni in pondere unius quasi X et VIII uncia et in altero quasi VI uncia Et operatio in incisione eorum est, ut consideres tunc, si infirmus est humidus, et color thelil est albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili lato, et sint in praesentia tua cauteria in igne.	I therefore cut them open, and I found in weight one as much as eight ounces, and the other as much as six; and their operation is, that you consider then, if the moist is infirm, and the color of the swellings is white, moist, subtile-rooted: then cut them open with a sharp chisel, and let the cauterization be in your presence on fire.
Multotiens enim expellitur apud sectionem eius sanguis multus: propera ergo si te uincit sanguis, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	For much blood is expelled during the incision; therefore, if the blood beats you, then cauterize it.
Quod si uides infirmum pauidum et timidum ab incisione cum ferro, tunc accipe filum ex plumbo decenter factum, et stringe cum eo athelul: cuius modus est quem diximus, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	If you see the patient pale and frightened by the incision with the iron, then take a thread from lead which has been made slightly irregular, and tie it with the knot that we have spoken of, and let go of him for two days.
Deinde adde in strictura plumbi.	Then add to the string on the lead.
Non ergo cesses stringere plumbum, quotiens imprimit in thelil, donec abscindatur, et cadat per se absque labore.	Therefore do not cease to tie the lead, when it is tight in the wound, until it has been cut off and falls by itself without working.
Si autem thelil grossae fuerit radicis, tunc in incisione eius est quiddam timoris et pauoris: praecipue quod est in uentre.	But if the lead is thick at the root, then there is some fear and trembling in his incision: especially since it is in the belly.
Verumtamen possibile est, ut incidas medietatem eius.	However, it is possible that you cut off half of it.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum, ut non redeat.	Then cauterize him so that he does not return.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then take care of the patient until the wound is healed.
Et caue ne praesumas incidere thelil quod est fusci coloris, pauci sensus, foedi aspectus: ipsum enim est apostema cancerosum: et ego ueniam cum rememoratione Cancri post hoc.	And do not suppose that the lead is incised which is of a dark color, few senses, and an appetizing appearance: for it is an apoplectic cancer: and I have come with a reminder of Cancer after this.
Â¶ De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.	On the cure of a prominent umbilical hernia.
Caput LII.	Chapter II.
Fit eminentia Vmbilici ex caussis multis.	Hernia can have many causes.
Aut ex fissuris sifac, quod super uentrem est: et exit ex eo althub, aut intestinum, secundum quod accidit in reliquis rupturis.	Or from a fistula which is above the navel: and comes out of it thin, or of the intestine, according to whether it happens in the other ruptures.
Aut ex sanguine qui fluit ex Vena, aut ex Arteria, secundum quod praemissum est.	Or from blood that flows from a vein, or from an artery, according to what has been said above.
Aut ex uentositate coartata in eo.	Or from a constricted windiness in it.
Si autem est propter fissuram sifac, et exitum thirbi: tunc est color apostematis similis colori corporis: et est lene, absque dolore: et apparet diuersi situs.	If, however, it is from a fistula which is above the navel and comes out dirty: then it resembles the color of an apoplectic patient, and is soft, without pain, and appears in various places.
Et si est propter egressionem intestini, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uehementioris diuersitatis.	And if it is from the exit of the intestine, then its location is with that which we have spoken about, which is more variable in kind.
Cum ergo tu premis ipsum digitis tuis, occultatur: deinde redit, et fortasse est cum eo sonitus: et magnificatur multum apud introitum balnei, et laborem uehaementum.	So when you grasp with your fingers, it hides: then it returns, and perhaps there is a sound: and it is greatly magnified at the entrance to the bath, and laborings are heard.
Si uero est propter humiditatem, est lene, tunc non occultatur quando premis ipsum manu tua, neque constringium, neque additur.	But if indeed it is because of moisture, it is soft; then it does not hide when you grasp it with your hand, nor does it tighten, nor is any added.
Quod si est propter sanguinem, tunc cum istis signis apparet apostema ad nigredinem de cliue.	Which if it is because of blood, then with these signs appears a patch of bruising to turn blue.
Si autem est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.	But if it is born of flesh: then it is a bruise, gray, coarse, and it spreads out according to the quantity of one unit.
Si uero est propter uentositatem, tunc tactus eius est lenis.	But if indeed it is because of warmth, then you feel it soft.
Et operatio in illo est, ut consideres tunc, si eminentia umbilici est propter sanguinem Arteriae, aut Venae, aut uentositatem: tunc oportet ut prohibearis a curatione eius.	And the work on it is this, that you then, if eminence of the umbilical cord is because of blood of an artery, or vein, or warmth: then you must refrain from its cure.
Nam in illo est timor et pauor, sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi apostemata propter arteriam et uenam.	For in it is fear and dread, as I taught you in the chapter where I said about bruises because of an artery and a vein.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est propter intestinum, aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum, et stet stans extensus.	Which if the eminence of the umbilical cord is because of intestines, or a hernia: then you must order the sick person to hold his breath, and stand upright with his arms outstretched.
Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.	Then signs with caustics around the umbilical cord throughout.
Postea praecipe ei, ut resupinetur inter manus tuas super dorsum suum.	Then order him to lie on his back with your hands under his back.
Deinde circunda cum spatumili lato in circumitu umbilici super locum quem signasti cum encaustro.	Then with a wisp of tow around the umbilical cord around the spot you marked with caustic.
Postea extende medium apostematis ad superiora, cum uncino magno.	Then extend a middle strip of cloth to the top, with a large hook.
Deinde liga eum in circumitu forti cum filo, aut cum chorda de serico ligamento firmo: et sit nodus ligamenti alenxotati.	Then tie him strongly around the waist with a cord, or with a silk ribbon tightly bound: and let the knot of the binding be unfastened.
Deinde aperi medium apostematis extensum supra ligamentum.	Then open the middle strip of cloth that was extended above the ligament.
Si ergo inueneris ipsum iam captum a ligamento: tunc extrahe alenxotati, et intromitte in ipsum digitum indicem, et impelle intestinum ad interiora uentris: et si inueneris zirbum, tunc accipe ipsum cum uncino, et incide superfluitatem eius.	But if you should find him already caught by the ligament: then pull out the binding, and insert your finger into his rectum, and push his intestines into his inside: and if you find a hernia, then take it with a hook, and cut off its surplus.
Si autem contraria est tibi arteria, aut uena: tunc circunda ipsum multum.	If, however, the arteries are opposite to each other, or new: then surround it much.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam.	Then go on to your operation.
Et accipe duas acus, et intromitte in eis duo fila fortia: et intromitte duas acus in circumitu quem fecisti circa apostema in modum crucis, quas facis penetrare.	And take two needles, and introduce into them two strong threads: and introduce into the two needles that you have made around the clot in the form of a cross, which you make to penetrate.
Deinde stringe apostema in quatuor locis super acus: et si uis, aufer acus, et dimitte locum, donec putrefiat caro extensa: et cadat per se: aut incide ipsam quando subtiliatur et putrefit.	Then tighten the clot in four places on the needles: and if you want, remove the needle, and leave the place, until the flesh has rotted out: and it will fall of itself: or cut it off when it has become thin and rotten.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the wound with the ointment, as much as is necessary, until it heals.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est ex carne nara in eo, aut ex humiditate: tunc oportet ut concaues apostema, sicut diximus.	That if eminence of the navel is out of flesh into it, or out of moisture: then you must tighten the clot, as we have said.
Et extrahas sanguinem, aut humiditatem, quam inuenis in eo.	And draw out blood, or moisture, which you have injected into it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod solidat locum.	Then take care of the wound with the ointment to harden the place.
Â¶ De cura CANCRI.	Of the treatment of cancer.
Caput LIII.	Chapter LIII.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Cancri, et qualiter est uia ad curationem eius cum medicinis: et cauendum ab eo cum curatione eius cum ferro, ut non ulceretur: et diximus Cancrum generatum in matrice, et cautelam a curatione eius.	Now we have spoken in the division of the species of cancer, and how it is treated with medicines: and to beware of its cure with iron, so that it does not ulcerate: and we have spoken of cancer generated in the womb, and of the care to be taken in its cure.
Et dixerunt antiqui, quod quandoque Cancer est in loco, ubi possibilis est eius eradicatio: sicut Cancer qui est in mammillis, aut in coxa, et eis similibus, ex membris locatis ad extrahendum totum eius: praecipue quando est incipiens paruus.	And the ancients say that whenever cancer is in a place where it can be eradicated: such as cancer in the breast, or in the thigh, and similar places, from the body by means of an operation to take out all of it: especially when it is just beginning.
Quando uero antiquatur, et est magnus, non oportet ut appropinques ei.	When, however, it has been cut away, and is large, you should not approach it.
Ego enim non potui sanare ex eo aliquem: neque uidi alium ante me qui peruenerit ad illud.	For I cannot heal it by any means: nor did I see anyone else before me who has cured it.
Et operatio in eo, quando est locatus sicut diximus, est, ut praecedas, et soluas infirmum ex cholera nigra aliquotiens.	And the operation on it, when it is located as we have said, is, as it were, a cure for disease from black cholera sometimes.
Deinde phlebotoma ipsum si inuenis cum repletione manifesta.	Then phlebotomy him himself if the veins are filled with blood.
Deinde praepara infirmum praeparatione, in qua locetur cum operatione.	Then prepare the sick one with preparation, in which he lies during the operation.
Deinde proiice in Cancrum uncinos qui conueniunt ei.	Then throw into the cancer the hooks that fit it.
Postea concaua ipsum ab omni parte cum cute, secundum perscrutationem, donec non remaneat aliquid ex radicibus eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere, et non abscindas ipsum uelociter, imo exprime loca, et absterge sanguinem grossum totum manu tua, aut cum quo possibile est ibi ex instrumentis.	Then cut off the patient from all sides with the blade, following the examination, until nothing remains of his roots: and stop the bleeding, and do not tear him away quickly, but rather squeeze the places, and wipe away the gross blood with your hand, or with whatever is there.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi fluxus sanguinis grossi ex incisione arteriae, aut uenae: tunc cauteriza uenam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If, however, the blood flow from the incision of an artery or a vein causes you difficulty: then burn the vein, until the blood stops flowing.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the patient with the rest of the cure, until he is healed.
Â¶ De cura Hydropisis.	Of the treatment for hydropsis.
Caput LIIII.	Chapter LIIII.
Iam narrauimus in diuisione species Hydropisis, et qualiter fit aggregatio aquae: et signa omnis speciei, et curationem eius cum medicinis.	We have already spoken at length about the division of hydropsis into its species and how water is gathered; we will now speak about the signs of each species and how to cure it with medicines.
Et illa quae curatur cum ferro, non est nisi species asclitis sola: et non approximatur cum ferro speciei timpanitis: neque speciei hyposarcae penitus: nam illud mortale est.	And that which is cured by means of iron, is not any other species but only a single one: and it does not approach iron for the species timpanitis: nor for the species hyposarcus within the bowels: for that is a mortal illness.
Quando tu iam medicatus es hanc speciem Hydropisis timpanitis cum medicinis, et non contulit medicatio tua: tunc considera.	When you have already tried to cure this species of hydropsis with medicines and your treatment has not succeeded: then consider the following.
Nam si infirmo iam consecuta est debilitas, aut est cum eo infirmitas alia praeter Hydropisim: sicut si sit cum eo tussis, aut uentris solutio, et similia illis: tunc caue ne mediceris ei cum ferro: quoniam est timor illud.	For if the sick one already has a weakness that is added to his hydropsis or other weakness besides the hydropsis: such as if he has a cough, or a fluid-like urine, and similar things: then be careful not to treat him with iron: for there is a fear of this.
Si autem uides infirmum exuberantis uirtutis, neque est cum eo aegritudo praeter Hydropisim solam: et non est puer, neque senex: tunc modus operationis in eo est, ut tu eleues infirmum stantem inter manus tuas, et minister post ipsum exprimat uentrem eius manu sua impellendo aquam ad inferiorem partem pectinis.	But if you see a young person with an excessive amount of vigor, and there is no other illness besides hydropsis: and he is not a boy or an old man: then the mode of operation in him is such that you stand him up straight between your hands, and have someone else press down on his back while he empties his bowels.
Deinde accipe spatumile spinosum, secundum hanc formam.	Then take a spike-shaped spoon, shaped like this.
Sit duarum partium acutarum, longum, acutae extremitatis sicut Spatumile.	Take two acute parts, one long and the other sharp at one end like a spike-shaped spoon.
Verumtamen in eo sit quiddam breuitatis paulatim, ut non pertranseas cum eo apud operationem usque ad intestinum, et laedas ipsum.	However, in it there is something that narrows gradually, so that it does not pierce with it while operating up to the intestines, and does not hurt itself.
Deinde considera.	Then consider.
Nam si est generatio Hydropisis ex parte intestinorum, tunc oportet ut elongeris cum sectione ab umbilico quantitate trium digitorum, ad inferiora in directo eius supra pectinem.	For if there is a generation of Hydropisis from the part of the intestines, then it should be extended with a cut from the umbilicus by three fingers' width, towards the lower side directly over the spine.
Si uero generatio Hydropisis est propter aegritudinem epatis: tunc sit sectio tua sinistra ab umbilico tribus digitis.	But if there is a generation of Hydropisis due to liver disease: then your section from the umbilicus should be three fingers' width.
Et si generatio eius est propter splenem, tunc sit sectio in latere dextro: et non oportet etiam ut sit sectio in latere super quod uult iacere infirmus, ut non currant superfluitates ad illum locum debilem.	And if the generation of it is due to the spleen, then your section on the right side: and it should not also be that it is cut at the place that you want to lay sick, so that there do not run into the weak spot fluids.
Deinde perfora cum instrumento cutem totam.	Then pierce with a sharp instrument all the skin.
Deinde intromitte in illam sectionem, et eleua manum tuam cum Spatumili inter cutem, et sifac, quasi tu excories ipsum: et sit quantitas quae excoriatur quantitas unguis, aut circiter ilud.	Then insert into it the section and spread your hand with the spike-shaped spoon under the skin, as if you were scraping it off: and let the amount that is scraped off be a quantity of a nail, or around that spot.
Deinde perfora sifac, donec perueniat Spatumile ad locum uacuum: et est locus aquae.	Then pierce with a needle, until the spike-shaped spoon reaches the empty place: and this is the place of water.
Deinde extrahe ipsum, et intromitte in foramen instrumentum, cuius haec est forma.	Then draw out the flesh, and insert into the hole an instrument like this, which has this shape.
Et est simile cannulae: fit ex argento, aut aere, aut aurichalco, lene, tersum: cui in inferiori parte sui est foramen paruum, et in lateribus eius sunt tria foramina, duo ab una parte, et unum a parte altera: et facia est extremitas eius incisa, secundum modum incisionis calami, sicut uides: in extremitate eius superiore est armilla.	And it is like a tube: it is made of silver, or brass, or gold, smooth, sharp: its lower end has a small hole, and on its sides are three holes, two on one side, and one on the other: and its end should be cut at an angle, as you see in a penknife's end, and there is an armlet on it.
Nam quando instrumentum peruenit ad aquam, tunc ipsa descendit statim super instrumentum, ergo euacua ex aqua in hora quantitatem mediam.	For when the instrument reaches water, then it immediately drops onto the instrument, so that it flows out of water at a middle rate.
Quoniam si tu euacuas ex ea plus quam oportet, in hora fortasse moritur infirmus per resolutionem spiritus sui animalis: aut accidit ei syncopis quae appropinquat morti.	For if you drain too much from it, a sick person may die at a time when his animal spirit is resolved; or he may die of syncope approaching death.
Verum euacua ex ea secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius, et secundum quod significant tibi dispositiones infirmi ex uirtute pulsus eius, et ex bonitate eius.	But drain from it according to the quantity of its power, and according to what I tell you about the dispositions of the nurse from its pulse, and from its goodness.
Deinde extrahe instrumentum, et retine aquam.	Then take out the instrument, and retain the water.
Quod est, quia retinetur statim propter cutem quae retinet foramen quod est super sifac: de quo narraui, ut perfores ipsum secundum illum modum.	That is, because it holds immediately by the skin which holds the orifice which is above the syphons; of which I told you that you should do so and so.
Deinde itera instrumentum die altero, si uides infirmum tolerare illud: et extrahe etiam ex aqua quantitatem paruam.	Then take out the instrument again on the other day, if you see the sick one ØªØ­ÙÙ it well; and also take out from the water the quantity of it which he exhales.
Fac illud diebus aliquot sine timore, et custodi te ab errore: donec non remaneat ex aqua nisi parum.	Do it on some days without fear, and guard yourself from error: until there remains in the water only a little.
Si autem times super infirmum, et dimittis ex aqua rem multam: tunc cura ipsum cum sepultura in harena calida, et sudore multo in balneo et sole, et expectet super sitim: et cura ipsum cum medicinis exiccatiuis, donec sanetur: et cauteriza super stomachum, et epar, et splenem, post extractionem aquae: secundum quod narraui in eo quod praecessit.	But if you are to do it on a sick person, and to let go of a lot of water: then take care of him with the grave in the hot sand, and with much sweat in a bath and in the sun, and let him wait for thirst: and take care of him with dried-up medicines, until he is healed: and cauterize over his stomach, and his spleen, and his liver, after drawing out the water: according to what I told you beforehand.
Â¶ De cura infantium qui nascuntur locis urinae eorum non perforatis.	Of the care of infants who are born in places whose openings have not been pierced.
Caput LV.	Chapter L.V.
Quando egreditur aliquis infantium ex uentre matris suae, et caput mutonis eius est non perforatum, aut est foramen strictum, aut in non suo loco.	When any child is brought out of its mother's womb, and the top of its head is not pierced, or the hole is tight, or is in an incorrect place.
Oportet ergo succurrere cum perforatione eius statim cum nascitur cum Spatumili subtili ualde, secundum hanc formam.	Then it should be helped with a sharp knife immediately after it is born, with a thin awl, according to this form:
Deinde pone in foramine clauum subtilem ex plumbo, et liga ipsum: et tene ipsum tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then put into the hole a little claw made of lead, and tie it up; and hold it for three days, or four.
Quando ergo uult urinam emittere, remoueatur, et mingat.	When he will need to urinate, let him move his head, and let him go.
Deinde reduc ipsum.	Then reduce the swelling.
Et si tu non ponis plumbum, iam possibile est, ut urina quae incedit super locum, non permittat ipsum claudi.	And if you do not put lead [plumb], it is now possible that the urine which has flowed over the place, should not allow the wound to close.
Ille autem cuius foramen est strictum, medicatur cum plumbo, sicut diximus, diebus multis, donec amplificetur.	But this one whose wound is tight, is treated with lead, as we have said, for many days, until it increases.
Illi autem in quibus est foramen in non suo loco, laeduntur.	But those in whom the wound is not in its proper place, are wounded.
Quod est, quia ex eis qui nascitur, foramen est apud finem capitis uirgae: quare non potest mingere ad anteriora, donec eleuat uirgam manu sua ad superiora.	That is, because from him who is born, the opening [foramen] is at the end of the penis: so that he cannot urinate [mingere] toward the front, until he raises his penis by hand to the top.
Neque est ei generatio, propterea, quod sperma non potest peruenire ad matricem secundum rectitudinem: et est aegritudo foeda ualde.	And there is no generation in him, therefore semen cannot reach the womb according to its straightness: and it is a foul disease.
Et modus operationis in illo est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum.	And the mode of action in that is, so that the sick one lies down on his back.
Deinde extende caput uirgae eius manu tua sinistra extensione uehementi, et incide caput capitis uirgae ex loco priapi, cum acumine, aut spatumili acuto: sicut est incisio calami, aut sicut tu radis aliquid, ut medium eius ueniat simile capiti uirgae: et ut cadat foramen in medio secundum quod oportet.	Then extend the penis of him with your left hand with a quick extension, and cut off the head of the penis from a place near  [ex loco priapi], with an edge, or with a sharp chisel: just as you would cut a wood, or like you cut anything, so that the opening comes in the middle, according to what is necessary.
Et caue tibi apud operationem tuam a fluxu sanguinis.	And cause yourself so that there be no flow of blood during your operation.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	For that often happens.
Oppone ergo ei cum eo quod abscindit sanguinem, et cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	So do not leave him, and worry about the wound, until he is healed.
Â¶ De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et capite uigae, et corruptione, nigredine, et adhaerentia.	As for what happens in the prepuce and at the head of the penis, and corruption, blackness, and adherence.
Caput LVI.	The head.
Multotiens accidunt istae Albather in uirga, et est eminentia carnis foedae.	For these things often happen in the penis, and there is a swelling of foul flesh.
Et ex ea alia est maligna, et alia non maligna.	And from that another bad one comes, and another not bad.
Non malignam ergo oportet ut suspendas cum uncino subtili, et abscindas eam, donec mundes eam totam.	So do not hang the not bad one with a fine hook, and cut it off, until you have completely cleaned it.
Deinde pone super eam cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio.	Then put over it a plaster submerged in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud cum unguento dyafinicon, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound afterwards with unguent of daphnicum, until it is healed.
Quod si Albather est maligna, foedi coloris, tunc oportet ut administres in ea cauterium post incisionem eius et ipsius rasionem.	That if the albather is malicious and of foul color, then you should administer to it a cautery after incising it and its rasp.
Si autem Albather est in praeputio captiui, non circumcisi, et est pars Albather inter praeputium, et pars eius extra: tunc oportet ut auferas Albather, quae est intus in primis, donec quando consolidatur, tunc cura ipsum exterius: quoniam quando tu curas eam simul, non securatur praeputium quin preforetur.	But if the albather is captured in the foreskin, uncircumcised, and is a part of the albather inside the foreskin, and a part of it outside: then you should remove the albather which is within first, until when it is consolidated; then care for him from the outside: for when you care for it at the same time, the foreskin is not secured except that it is pierced.
Et iam accidunt etiam in testiculis, et praeputio nigredo et corruptio.	And also happen and in the testes, and blackness of the foreskin and corruption.
Oportet ergo, ut tu concaues totum quod iam denigratum est, et quod uult corrumpi, aut iam corruptum est.	Therefore, so that you bring together all that which has already been discolored, and what seeks to corrupt, or what is already corrupted:
Deinde line super ipsum post illud cum melle quod iam concussum est cum farina corticum granatorum, et herbi tritorum cribellatorum.	Then apply a line over the wound after that with honey that has already been crushed with flour of chopped corns, and with herb of three times chopping.
Deinde cura illud cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with the remaining cure, until it is healed.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra cauterium cum cauterio lunari, secundum hanc formam.	But if there happens a flow of blood, then administer a cautery with lunar cautery, according to this form.
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.	For the cautery is right for two things at the same time, that is, for a flow of blood, and for corruption when it seeks to corrupt:
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.	That if it corrodes the head of the penis and destroys all in an hour: then you should introduce into it a plunger of lead, so that the weak one mixes over it.
In adhaerentia uero praeputii cum capite uirgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter uulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput uirgae ab omni parte.	But in adhering to the foreskin with the head of the penis, and this kind of adhesion does not happen except in that whose foreskin is sound, and it does not require circumcision on top: and when that happens adhesion because of a wart or pustule: then you should cut it out with an dull awl, until it resolves the ligaments, and releases the head of the penis from every part.
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite uirgae, et ex praeputio.	If it is difficult to distinguish them closely, then you should cut something from the head of the penis and from the foreskin.
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam uelociter.	That is, because the foreskin, when it is thin, might perhaps pierce quickly because of its thinness.
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput uirgae cum panno lini subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.	Then separate between the foreskin and the head of the penis with a thin linen cloth that has already been soaked in cold water so that it does not stick again.
Deinde curetur cum uino stiptico, donec consolidetur.	Then bandage with Styptic Wine until it hardens.
Â¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.	The washing of infants and the treatment for them if they make a mistake by accident.
Caput LVII.	Chapter LVII.
Circumcisio non est solutio continuitatis, sicut reliqua uulnera: uerumtamen cum sit ex operatione nostra, uoluntate nostra, et usus eius sit in pueris proprie, est necesse ut signemus in ea operationem meliorem, et uiam leuiorem perducentem ad salutem.	Circumcision is not a cure for continence, as are the other wounds; however, since it is an operation of our art and practice, and its use is proper to boys, we must indicate in it a better method, and introduce a lighter procedure leading to health.
Dico ergo, quod antiqui non dixerunt circumcisionem in aliquo suorum librorum: quoniam non utuntur in legibus suis, et non est nisi quod acquisiuimus per experimentum.	I therefore say that the ancient ones did not speak of circumcision in any of their books; for they do not use it in their laws, and it is only what we have acquired through experimentation.
Quod est, quia ego inueni maiorem partem artificum, et phlebotomatorum uti mundificatione, circumcidendo cum nouacula, et cum forficibus: et utuntur alfecati, et ligaudo cum filo, et incisione cum ungula.	That is, because I have discovered most of the arts, and the use of phlebotomy for washing, circumcision with a blade and with forceps: and they use leeches, and bind with thread, and cut with a nail.
Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modos, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.	And I myself have already tested all these methods, and I did not find a better way of washing with forceps and binding with thread.
Quoniam in mundificatione cum nouacula, multotiens effugit cutis.	For in washing with leeches, the skin often escapes.
Quoniam cutis praeputii duas habet tunicas: ergo forsitan inciditur cutis superior, et temanet tunica inferior: cogitur ergo ad incisionem ad incidendum alteram, et dolorem futurum.	For the foreskin skin has two layers; so perhaps one layer of skin might be cut, and the other protected by the cloth: it is therefore necessary to consider cutting the second layer in order to cause pain.
Et cum mundificatione quae fit per alfecati, id est, digitalis, quo utuntur sutores, non securatur incisio extremitatis uirilis membri: quoniam fortasse ingreditur in foramen eius.	And when washing is done with a leeches' digit, as the surgeons do, the incision at the extreme end of the male organ does not ensure security; for it might well enter into a hole.
In mundificatione autem cum ungula, fortasse euadit ferrum, et corrumpit operationem tuam: et cutis quidem pueri est breuis natura, et multotiens nascuntur taliter, quod non indigent mundificatione: et iam uidi illud.	In the washing of the feet, perhaps he has an eye on the iron and thus ruins your work: and indeed the skin of the boy is short by nature, and many times it comes like this, so it does not need to be washed: and already I see it.
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.	In the washing of the feet, perhaps he has an eye on the iron and thus ruins your work: and indeed the skin of the boy is short by nature, and many times it comes like this, so it does not need to be washed: and already I see it. As for the cutting with blades and binding with thread, a good experiment has shown me that: for the blade which is above is like the blade which is below: since the sharpness which is above is like the sharpness which is below.
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.	Now when you squeeze the hand, two sharpnesses are proportionate and incise one according to the other in one time and place; and it forms a compression of similar shape, containing the skin of the arm from all sides, with which there is no mistake at all.
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.	And the way of the operation is its own, so that you may guess at it, especially if he is one of those who understand a little, which you do not do, unless you tie the thread in his arm only: and you leave him until another day.
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.	Then let him rejoice and be glad in every way as much as possible for you: since he receives understanding of his own.
Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.	Then let him stand between your hands which are prepared to stand, and not sitting: and conceal the blades in your arm, or under your foot, so that he does not see them at all, nor any of the instruments.
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.	Then put your hand on his arm, and blow into the skin, and pull it up until the head of the arm comes out.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.	Then wash that which has been gathered there by squalor.
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.	Then bind the marked place with a double thread.
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum.	Then bind the lower part with a little less of that bond than the upper one.
Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.	Then hold with your index finger, and keep the lower loop well with the thumb, and incise between the two bonds.
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.	Then caress the skin gently from top to bottom, and extract the head of the penis.
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est uitellus oui decocti in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo ros recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then allow the blood to flow slowly (for it is better) and place the powder from above: and on top of the powder, a cloth in which the raw flesh has been stretched out, soaked with rose water, rubbed with fresh good oil: and leave it until another day: and take care of the rest by cure, until it is healed.
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.	The shape of the tweezers for cleaning is this.
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.	But the two ends should be flat and joined together: let there be no projection in it like the knuckle of a claw: and let the length of the points be equal to the length of the two hands from the wrist.
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.	But a mistake in the cutting is due to the fact that perhaps all the inner skin will be lost, or a part of it near the incision.
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.	Therefore you should spread it out from your own time with your own nail before the inspection of the place: and lay it down according to equality.
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.	If you cannot hold it with your nail, then remove it with a tweezers and cut it.
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.	If, however, it has passed three days and what is under the penis remains swollen, inspected: then leave it until it has subsided by itself, and with ease remove the scar, and cut it according to your preparation: and caulk you at the head of the penis.
Non enim nocebit ei illud.	For that will not harm him.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.	Take care, therefore, that this hardens with the powder, which we have mentioned in the book about the powders: and if it is cut from the skin above the line, and rises upward, it will not harm him either.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.	Take care, therefore, that this has been said, until it is healed.
Â¶ De extractione Vrinae retentae in uesica.	Regarding the extraction of the hymen retained in the urethra.
Caput LVIII.	Chapter LVIII.
Urinae retentio in uesica, fit ab opilatione facta ex lapide, aut sanguine congelato, aut pus, aut carne nata, et similibus illis ex eis quae diximus ex modis curationis in diuisione.	Retentive urethra in the bladder, is due to a deposit made from a stone, or congealed blood, or pus, or flesh born, and similar things from which we have spoken regarding the division of cures.
Et si non soluitur Vrina, et uides retentionem eius esse propter Lapidem, qui iam est in collo uesicae: tunc oportet ut sit infirmus super genua sua curuatus.	And if the wound does not heal, and you see that it is because of the stone which has already come to the throat of the esophagus: then it is necessary that he be treated lying on his knees.
Deinde componantur pedes eius super dorsum eius, et extendat uentrem suum ex superiori parte dorsi eius, et stringat infirmus anhelitum suum quantum possibile est ei.	Then they put his feet on his back, and he extends his belly from the upper part of his back, and strangles the sick man as much as is possible for him to do.
Cogitur ergo cum collo uesicae ad expulsionem Lapidis ad posteriora: quare absoluitur Vrina.	It is considered that with the esophagus up to expulsion of the stone towards the back: why does Vrina heal?
Quod si non soluitur cum eo quod diximus, et uehemens sit res super infirmum: tunc oportet ut administres extractionem eius cum instrumento, quod nominatur siringa, cuius haec est forma Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.	That if it does not heal with that which we have said, and the disease is on the sick man: then it is necessary that you administer extraction with a tool, which is called a syringe, whose this is the form It is of silver, and is fine, soft, and smooth like a feather's tube in subtlety of its radius, long in similarity of the palm of one hand and half of it: which has a thin tube at the end.
Et modus exitus Vrinae per ipsum est, ut accipias filum duplicatum, et liges in extremitate eius lanam, aut cotum, ligatura bona: et intromittas extremitatem fili in inferiori parte Siringae: et incide cum forficibus si superfluit aliquid ex lana, uerum intromitte in cannulam cum uehementia, sicut alzer.	And the way out of Vrina through itself is that you take a doubled thread, and tie it well at its end with wool or cotton, knot: and you insert the end of the thread into the lower part of the syringe: and you strike with pliers if there is anything that comes out of the wool, really insert into the tube with caution, like raising.
Deinde inunge siringam cum oleo, aut cum butyro, et albugine oui: et fac sedere infirmum super sedem, et embroca uesicam, et ipsius uirgam cum oleis humidis, et oleo oliuae, et aqua tepida.	Then dip the syringe in oil, or in butter, and in alum powder: and make him sit on a seat, and immerse the esophagus, and his thread with wet oils, and olive oil, and warm water.
Deinde intromitte siringam in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat ad radicem uirgae.	Then insert the syringe into the thread with ease, until it reaches the root of the thread.
Deinde dupla ipsam superius a parte umbilici.	Then double yourself above from the navel part.
Deinde impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad Vesicam, et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam: et non fit hoc secundum hunc ordinem, nisi quoniam meatus, in quo uadit, est in quo est tortuositas.	Then push the syringe into itself until it reaches the bladder, and feel that the sick man has already reached the vacant part: and this does not happen according to this order unless because of the meatus in which you inject, is in which there is a curvature.
Deinde extende filum cum lana paulatim.	Then extend the thread with wool gradually.
Vrina enim sequetur lanam.	Then the thread follows the wool.
Deinde extrahe eam, et fac currere Vrinam per uiam urinae: et itera siringam, et non cesses facere illud, donec euacuetur uesica, et inueniat infirmus alleuiationem.	Then pull it out, and let the thread run along the urethra: and repeat this movement, and do not stop doing so until the urine is discharged, and the discomfort is relieved.
Â¶ De qualitate clisterizationis uesicae cum Clepshydra.	A discussion of the quality of cleansing the bladder with a clepsydra.
Caput LIX.	Chapter LIX:
Quando accidit in uesica ulcus, aut sanguis in ea congelatur, aut coartatur in ea pus, et uis distillare in eam aquas et medicinas: tunc fiat cum instrumento quod nominatur Clepshydra, et haec est forma eius.	When a sore happens in the bladder, or blood freezes up in it, or pus is contained in it, and water and medicines are to be distilled into it: then do with the instrument which is called a clepsydra, and this is its form:
Est enim surda, id est, clausa.	It is a closed vessel.
Et in eo sunt tria foramina, duo ex parte una, et unum ex parte altera, sicut uides.	And in it are three openings, two on one side, and one on the other side, like you see them.
Et locus concauus, in quo est illud quod impellit, sit secundum quantitatem quod opilet ipsum sine additione, donec quando trahitur cum eo aliquid, ex humiditatibus attrahatur: et quando impellitur, cum eo expellatur ad longinquum: secundum quod facit clepshydra, qua proiicitur naphta, id est, ignis graecus in praeliis martis.	And the cavity where the push rod is located should be behind the quantity that it draws up without adding anything, until when it is pulled out with it something is drawn out from the moisture: and when it is pushed, it expels it far away: and this is what the clepsydra does, it throws out naphtha, that is, Greek fire in battles of war.
Cum ergo uis proiicere humiditates in uesicam, intromitte extremitatem clepshydrae in humiditatem, et trahe cum eo quod impellit ad superiora, humiditas enim trahitur in concauitatem clepshydrae.	When you then pour the water into the bladder, introduce the end of the clepsydra into the water, and pull out with it what pushes up, for the water is drawn out into the cavity of the clepsydra: indeed, what pushes up is pushed out with it.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem eius in uirgam, secundum quod narrauimus in siringa.	Then introduce the end of it into the penis, as we have described in the syringe.
Deinde impelle humiditatem cum eo quod impellit illa namque humiditas peruenit ad uesicam statim, ita quod sentit eam infirmus.	Then push the water with it, which, as we have said, goes into the bladder immediately: so that he feels the discomfort.
Forma clisteris subtilis quo clisterizatur uesica.	The form of a light clepsydra with which the bladder is cleansed.
Fiat ex argento, aut auricalco: cuius caput altius sit simile alcama paruo, et sub eo sinus inter quem cadat ligamentum.	Let it be made of silver or brass; and let its handle be higher than the base, similar to an almond nut, and under it a pocket for the spring which pulls out:
Deinde accipe uesicam arietis, et pone in ea humiditatem, qua uis clisterizare uesicam.	Then take the wool from the sheep and put moisture on it, so that it becomes like a sponge.
Deinde liga eam inter duos sinus ligatura forti cum filo duplo: et calefac illam humiditatem parumper super ignem.	Then bind it between two loops of strong thread: and warm it slightly with moisture over the fire.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem clisteris in uirgam, postea stringe manum tuam super uesicam cum humiditate strictura decenti, donec sentiat infirmus, quod illa humiditas iam peruenit ad uesicam.	Then introduce the tip of the clister into the penis; afterwards grasp the wool with your hand over the wound with the moisture constricted, until the patient feels that the moisture has reached the wool.
Si autem non est tibi praesens uesica, tunc accipe frustum pergameni, et fac ex eo circulum, et perfora ipsum ab omni rotunditate sua.	But if you do not have present wool, then take a fragment of parchment, and make it into a circle, and pierce it from all its roundedness.
Deinde intromitte filum forte in illis foraminibus, sicut reuoluuntur.	Then introduce a strong thread into those pores, as they rotate.
Deinde aggrega circulum, sicut aggregatur alsofratu: postquam tu ponis in eo illud quod uis ex humiditatibus, et oleis, et aquis.	Then gather the circle together, as it is gathered also with yarn: and then you put on it that which you have prepared from moisture, oils, and water.
Deinde liga ipsum in instrumento: et fac cum eo sicut fecisti cum uesica ex expressione cum manu tua, donec perueniat humiditas ad uesicam.	Then bind him to the instrument: and do with him as you did with wool from the expression with your hand, until the moisture reaches the wool.
Â¶ De extractione Lapidis.	The Extraction of a Stone.
Caput LX.	CHAPTER LX.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Lapidis, et curationem eius cum medicinis: et dixi differentiam inter Lapidem generatum in renibus, et uesica, et signa illius totius: et dixi Lapidem in quo cadit operatio cum manu et sectio: et est Lapis generatus in uesica proprie: et ille qui figitur in uirga: et ego sum narrans illud cum expositione manifesta et abbreuiatione.	We have spoken in the division of species of stone, and the treatment thereof with medicines; and I have described the difference between stone formed in the kidneys, wool, and the signs of all these things: I also spoke of the operation that takes place by hand and its section; and this stone that is formed in the wool is particular to itself; and that which is figured on the thorn, and I am telling it with a clear exposition and abridgment.
Dico ergo, quod Lapis generatus in uesica, plurimum accidit pueris.	I say, then, that stone formed in the wool mostly happens to boys.
Et ex signis eius est, quod urina egreditur ex uesica similis aquae in subtilitate sua: et apparet in ea harena alba, et fricat infirmus uirgam suam, et laborat cum ea, et multotiens pendet.	And of the signs of it is that urine is discharged from the wool similar to water in its fineness: and it appears in it white sand, and it grates on the man's penis, and struggles with it, and often hangs down.
Deinde erigitur, et egreditur cum eo anus in multis eorum.	Then it stands up, and passes with it the anus in many cases.
Et est facilis sanatio puerorum, ex eo usquequo consequuntur quatuordecim annos.	Healing is easy for boys until they reach the age of fourteen years.
Et est difficilis in senibus.	And it is difficult in the elderly.
In iuuenibus autem est media, in eo quod est inter illud: et eius cuius Lapis est maior, curatio facilior: et si paruus, est econuerso illius cura.	In youths it is moderate, for it lies between that and this; and cure is easier when the stone is small: if it is large, then the cure is difficult.
Cum ergo peruenimus ad curationem, oportet in primis, ut mundificemus infirmum cum clisteri, quod extrahat totum stercus quod est in intestinis suis: ipsum enim quandoque prohibet inuentionem Lapidis apud inquisitionem.	When we come to the cure, it is necessary at first that we should remove the dirt from within with a clister, which draws out all the dung that is in the intestines: for this often prevents the appearance of the stone during examination.
Deinde accipiatur infirmus cum pedibus suis, et concutiatur, et moueatur ad inferiora: ut descendat Lapis ad profundum uesicae, aut saliat de loco alto aliquotiens.	Then let the sick man take his feet and bend, and move towards the lower parts: so that the stone may go down into the depths of the bladder, or sometimes may come out from its high place.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas praeparatum, et manus eius sint sub coxis ipsius, ut fiat uesica tota decliuis ad inferiora.	Then let him sit between your hands, prepared like this, and his knees under his thighs, so that the bladder may all go down towards the lower parts.
Deinde perquire eum, et tange eum extrinsecus.	Then examine him, and touch him from outside.
Si ergo sentis Lapidem in spacio, tunc propera statim cum sectione super ipsum.	If you feel the stone in a space, then immediately approach it with your knife from above.
Quod si non cadat sub tactu tuo omnino, tunc oportet ut abstergas digitum indicem cum oleo manus sinistrae, si infirmus est puer: aut digitum medium si est iuuenis completus: et intromittas ipsum in anum suum, et perquire de Lapide, donec stat sub digito tuo: et conuerte eum paulatim ad collum uesicae.	If it does not fall under your touch at all, then you should wipe the finger of the index with oil from your left hand, if the sick boy is a child: or the middle finger if he is a full youth: and let him insert himself in some part of his body, and examine the stone, until it rests under your finger: and gradually turn it towards the neck of the bladder.
Deinde preme super ipsum cum digito tuo, et impelle ipsum ad exteriora aduersus locus, cuius sectionem uis: et praecipe ministro, ut premat uesicam manu sua, et praecipe alii ministro, ut extendat testiculos manu sua dextra ad superiora: et alia manu sua, ut remoueat cutem, quae est sub testiculis in parte a loco in quo est sectio.	Then press on it with your finger, and push it towards the outside against the place where you want to make the incision, and order one minister to grasp the bladder with his hand, and another minister to spread out the testicles with his right hand, from above: and with a third hand, let him remove the skin, which is under the testicles in the part where the incision is to be made.
Deinde intromitte Spatumile incidens, cuius forma haec est.	Then introduce the scalpel, whose shape is thus:
Et finde in eo quod est inter anum et testiculos, et non in medio, ad latus natis sinistrae: et sit sectio super ipsum lapidem, et digitus tuus sit in ano: et fiat sectio transuersa, ut sit sectio exterius ampla, et interius stricta, secundum quantitatem quod sit possibile egressio Lapidis ex ea non maior.	And find in it what is between the testicles and something else, and not in the middle, at the side of birth on the left: and the section above it, and your finger be in the anus: and let the section be turned around, so that the section be wide outside, and strict inside, according to the quantity that it is possible for the stone to come out of it, not bigger.
Fortasse enim comprimit digitus, qui est in ano Lapidem apud sectionem, et egreditur absque difficultate.	For perhaps the finger which is in the anus compresses the stone at the section and comes out without difficulty.
Et scias, quod ex Lapide est cui sunt anguli et margines, quare fit difficilis exitus eius propter illud.	And know that from the stone there are angles and edges, therefore it is difficult for him to come out because of that.
Et ex eo est lenis, similis glandulae, et rotundus: et fit facilis egressus eius.	And from it is soft, similar to a gland, and round: and the exit of him is easy.
Ei ergo cui sunt anguli, et margines, adde in fissura.	So then who have angles and edges, add in the crack.
Quod si non egreditur ita, tunc oportet ut ingenies super ipsum: aut stringas super eum cum gesti decenter, cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna, quae stringat super Lapidem, et non euadat ab ea: aut ut intromittas sub eo instrumentum subtile, curuatae extremitatis.	That if it does not come out like this, then you should use the tool on top: or tighten it with a twisted hand, whose tip is as the moon, which tightens over the stone, and does not rub against it: or so that you introduce a thin instrument below it, with curved extremities.
Si autem non potes super cum, tunc amplifica foramen parumper.	If you can't do it on top, then widen the hole slightly.
Quod si uincit te aliquid ex sanguine, abscinde ipsum cum zegi.	That if he hurts you with any of his blood, cut him off with a blade.
Si uero lapis est plus quam unus, tunc impelle in primis magnum ad os uesicae.	If the stone is more than one, then push it into the first big hole at the nose.
Deinde incide super ipsum.	Then cut on top of it.
Postea impelle paruum post illud: et similiter fac si sunt plures duobus.	Then push a little behind it, and likewise do if there are two or more.
Quod si magnus est ualde, tunc ignorantia est ut seces super ipsum sectione magna.	That if he is very big, then ignorance is how to cut over the stone with a large section.
Quoniam accidit infirmo una duarum rerum, aut ut moriatur, aut accidit ei distillatio urinae assidua: proptera, quia non consolidatur locus omnino.	Since it has happened to one of the two things, or that he dies, or that there is a regular release of urine: soon, because the place does not consolidate at all.
Verum administra expulsionem eius, donec egrediatur: aut ingenia in fractura eius cum forficibus, donec extrahas eum frustatim.	But give him an expulsion, until he comes out: or use tools to break it open, until you take it out quickly.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc imple uulnus thure, et aloe, et sanguine draconis: et stringe ipsum, et pone super ipsum pannum infusum oleo et uino, aut oleo rosato, et aqua frigida: ut sedetur apostema calidum.	When you have therefore finished your operation, then fill the ulcer with thur, and aloe, and dragon's blood: and bind it tight, and place over it a cloth dipped in oil and wine, or in rose-water, and cold water: that an apostema may be dried up by the heat.
Deinde resupina infirmum super collum suum, et non soluas ligamentum, usque ad diem tertium.	Then wrap the patient's neck tightly, and do not separate the ligaments until the third day.
Cum ergo solueris ipsum, embroca locum cum aqua, et oleo multo.	When you have undone him, put much oil and water in the place.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dyafinicon, et unguento basilicon, donec sanetur.	Then cure him with the ointment of daphnes and the ointment of basil, until he is healed.
Si autem accidit in uulnere apostema calidum additum, et corrosi, et illi similia: sicut si congeletur sanguis in uesica, et prohibeatur ex eo urina: et cognoscitur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina.	If however an apostema of heat is added, and corroded, and similar things: such as if the blood congeals in a bladder, and urine is prohibited from it: and it is known from the exit of blood with urine.
Intromitte ergo digitum tuum in uulnus, et extrahe illum sanguinem.	Then put your hand into the ulcer, and draw out the blood.
Nam si remanet, prouocat ad corruptionem uesicae, et putrefactionem eius.	For if any remain, it provokes the corruption of the bladder, and the putrefaction thereof.
Deinde ablue uulnus cum aceto, et aqua, et sale: et oppone omni speciei cum eo quod conuenit ex curatione, usquequo sanetur.	Then wash the ulcer with vinegar, and water, and salt: and oppose to it all that is convenient out of the cure, until it is healed.
Et oportet in horis curationis totius, ut liges duas coxas, et aggreges, caussa medicinarum quae ponuntur super locum.	And it is necessary in the hours of the cure, that the two hips and the joints be bound on, for those medicines which are put over the place.
Quod si lapis est paruus, et sit in meatu uirgae, et figitur in eo, et prohibetur urinae exitus: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod narro antequam peruenias ad sectionem.	That if the stone be small and is in the meatus of the urethra, and does not pass by itself, and stops the passage of urine: then cure him with it before you come to a section.
Multotiens enim a sectione excusaris per hanc curationem, iam enim probaui illud.	For many times from the section you will be excused with this treatment, for I have tried it already.
Et est, ut accipias Perforatorium ex ferro alferico, cuius haec est forma, triangulatae extremitatis, acutum, fixum in ligno.	And there is, that you take the perforator out of iron-hardened iron, which has this form, triangular extremities, acute, fixed on a piece of wood.
Deinde accipe filum, et liga cum eo uirgam sub lapide ut non redeat ad uesicam.	Then take a thread, and bind it with the urethra under the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
Deinde intromitte ferrum perforans in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat Perforatorium ad ipsum lapidem: et reuolue Perforatorium manu tua in ipso lapide paulatim: et coneris perforationem eius, donec facias ipsum penetrare a parte altera.	Then introduce the piercing iron into the penis with ease, until it reaches its rock: and remove the piercing iron from your hand, little by little, on that rock: and feel the piercing, until you make him pierce from the other side.
Urina namque absoluitur statim.	Then urinate immediately.
Deinde preme manum tuam super illud quod remansit ex lapide ab exteriori parte uirgae.	Then press your hand on that which remains of the rock from the outside of the penis.
Ipse enim frangitur, et egreditur cum urina, et sanatur infirmus.	For it itself is broken, and it comes out with urine, and the sick one is healed.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi haec curatio, propter aliquid quod prohibet ab illo: tunc liga filum sub lapide, et filum aliud supra lapidem.	But if this treatment has not been prepared for you because of something that forbids it from him: then tie a string under the rock, and another string above the rock.
Deinde seca super lapidem in ipsa uirga inter duas ligaturas.	Then dry on the rock in the middle between the two ties.
Deinde extrahe ipsum.	Then remove him.
Postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.	Then solve the tie, and cleanse the frozen blood which has formed in the wound.
Et non est necessarium ligamentum fili sub lapide, nisi ut non redeat ad uesicam: et ligamentum aliud desuper, nisi ut quando soluitur filum post egressionem lapidis, redeat cutis ad locum suum, et cooperiat uulnus: et propter illud necesse est tibi illud quando ligas filum superius, ut eleues cutem ad superiora, ut redeat apud complementum tuum, et cooperiat uulnus, sicut diximus.	And it is not necessary to tie the string under the rock unless you want to return it to the wound: and a string above, unless when the string is untied after the rock has come out, it returns to its place, and covers the wound, as we have said. For this reason it is necessary for you to tie the upper string, so that you raise the skin to its height, so that it returns to its place, and covers the wound, as we have said: and because of this necessity you must untie the lower string when you wish to return it, in order that the skin may return to its place, and cover the wound, as we have said.
Â¶ De extractione Lapidis mulierum.	On the Extracting of the Stone from Women.
Caput LXI.	Chapter LXI.
Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus.	A stone does not form much in women.
Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibetur propter modos multos.	But if a stone should happen to any of them, then the treatment is difficult, and is forbidden on account of many causes.
Vnus eorum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo.	One of these is that the woman may be a virgin.
Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos.	And the second is that you should not touch a woman who is a doctor when she is chaste, or among those who have husbands.
Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu.	And the third is that you should not touch a woman who knows this art well, especially the manual operation.
Et quartus est longinquitas a loco lapidis: quare indiget sectione profunda, et in illo est timor.	The fourth is the distance from the stone: why does it require deep cutting, and there is fear in that.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.	If necessity compels you to do so, then you should take a female physician who is well-versed in it: and there is little found.
Si uero priuaris ea, tunc quaere medicum castum, subtilem, et praesenta mulierem obstetricem bene doctam in re mulierum, aut mulierem quae in hac arte innuit partem artis: fac ergo eam praesentem, et praecipue ei, ut faciat totum quod praecipis ei ex inquisitione super lapidem.	But if you are concerned about it, then ask a well-versed male physician, subtle, and present a female obstetrician who is well-versed in the matter of women, or a woman who is skilled in this art part: do so, and especially to him, that he may do all that you command him concerning the stone.
In primis quod est, ut aspiciat si mulier est uirgo: tunc oportet ut intromittat digitum in anum eius, et quaerat lapidem.	First of all, if she is a virgin, then he should let his finger touch her private parts and feel the stone.
Si ergo inuenit ipsum, coartet eum sub digito suo, et tunc praecipe obstetrici, ut intromittat digitum suum in uuluam infirmae, et inquirat super lapidem, postquam ponit manum suam sinistram super uesicam, et comprimit eam compressione bona.	But if he finds it, he should let his finger slide into the opening and then instruct the obstetrician to put his own finger inside the woman's vagina and feel for the stone, after he has placed his left hand on her lower back, and squeezes it with a good grip.
Si ergo inuenit lapidem, tunc oportet ut gradatim moueat eum ab orificio uesicae ad inferiora cum summa uirtutis suae, donec perueniat cum eo ad radicem coxae.	But if he finds the stone, then he should gradually move it from the opening of the vagina to the lower part with all his strength, until he reaches it with the root of the pelvis.
Deinde secet super eum apud oppositionem medietatis uuluae apud radicem coxae, ex quacunque parte praeparatur ei, et sentit lapidem in illa parte: et digitus eius non remoueatur a lapide, coartans sub eo: et sit sectio parua in primis.	Then he should cut above it on the opening of the middle part of the vagina near the root of the pelvis, from whichever side it is prepared and feels the stone in that part: and let his finger not move from the stone, holding it under: and first make a small incision.
Deinde intromittat radium super illam sectionem.	Then he should insert his finger above that cut on the opening of the middle part of the vagina near the root of the pelvis:
Si ergo sentit lapidem, tunc addat in sectionem secundum quantitatem proportionatam quod lapis egreditur ab ea.	If he feels the stone, then he should add to that cut a quantity that is proportionate to how much the stone moves out of it.
Et scias, quod species lapidis sunt multae.	And you should know that there are many kinds of stones.
Ex his enim est paruus, et magnus, lenis et asper, longus, et rotundus habens ramos.	For some are small and big, some hard and sharp, some long and round, having branches.
Scias ergo species eius, ut significetur tibi per hoc super illud quod uis.	Know his nature, so that it may be made clear to you by this regarding what you see.
Si ergo uincit te sanguis, tunc adde in loco zegi tritum, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If therefore the blood annoys you, then put three layers of cloth in the place and hold it for an hour, until the blood is dried up.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis: et fac, ut praepares tecum ex instrumentis, quae dixi in extractione lapidis in uiris, ut adiuueris per ea in operatione tua.	Then go back to your work until the stone has come out: and make ready all the instruments which I have said are necessary for taking out a stone from the bladder, that you may help yourself with them during your work.
Quod si uincit te fluxus sanguinis, et scis quod expulsio sanguinis est ex arteria quae incisa est: tunc pone puluerem super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis strictura decenti: et non mutes illud: et dimitte lapidem, et non extrahas ipsum.	That if the blood annoys you, and you know that the escape of the blood is from the artery which has been cut: then put powder on the place, and press it down with a pressure coming on gradually: and do not change that; and let go of the stone, and do not draw out the same.
Fortasse enim morietur mulier infirma.	For perhaps the woman would die if she were weakened.
Deinde cura uulnus.	Then take care for the wound.
Cum ergo sedatur acuitas sanguinis post dies, et putrefit locus, tune redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis.	When however keenness of the blood has passed and the place has become putrid, then go back to your work until the stone has come out.
Â¶ De sectione suiper Herniam aquosam.	Regarding the cutting through the hernial hool: with water.
Caput LXII.	Chapter LII.
Ramex aquosa non est, nisi aggregatio humiditatis in sifac albo, quod est sub cute testiculi continente ouum: et nominatur sifac.	The ramet is not wet with water, but there is a gathering of moisture in the sheath of the scrotal skin which contains one: and it is called a sheath.
Et quandoque est in panniculo proprio sibi, quem praeparauit ei natura in parte oui, donec putetur: quod est ouum aliud, et est cutis testiculi inter sifac album, quod diximus: et non fit illud nisi raro.	And when it is in its own bag which nature has prepared for it in its own part, until it puts out: that is another thing, and that skin of the testicles between the sheath is white, which I have said: and does not come about except rarely.
Et generatio quidem huius ramicis, est ex debilitate quae accidit testiculis: quare effunditur ad eos haec materia.	And the generation of this ramet comes from the weakness which happens to the testicles: why this substance is poured out on them.
Et quandoque accidit ex percussione super testiculos.	And when it comes about from a blow on the testicles.
Et haec humiditas est habens colores multos.	And this moisture is having many colors.
Aut enim est color eius decliuis ad citrinitatem, aut est sanguineus rubeus, aut faeculentus, niger, aut est aquosus albus, et est illud quod est plus.	Or indeed the color of its discharge is in the direction of citrinism, or it is bloody red, or fecundous, black, or it is white and watery, and that which is more so.
Et signa quibus scitur ubi sit aggregatio aquae, sunt ista.	And the signs by which one knows where the aggregation of water is, are these.
Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figura oui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.	For if it is in the scrotum or what we have said, then the swelling is round and of almost the same length as the figure of a circle: and the testicle does not show because the moisture holds it from all sides.
Et si est humiditas in panniculo proprio sibi, tunc apostema est rotundum cum parte oui, et propter hoc extimat homo quia est ouum aliud.	And if there is moisture in the pouch to itself, then the swelling is round with a part, and for this reason one estimates man because he is another.
Et si humiditas est inter cutem testiculorum et sifac album, tunc cadit sub sensu.	And if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white scrotum, then it hangs down.
Quando ergo uis cognitionem coloris humiditatis, tunc experire colorem humiditatis in apostemate cum Intromisso quadrato, cuius forma praecessit.	When you want to know the color of the moisture, then feel the color of the swelling with the square inserted, whose shape preceded.
Secundum illud ergo quod egreditur in uestigio Intromissi, iudica de illo quod est inter ipsum.	Accordingly, because it is withdrawn into the pocket of the insertion, judge about it that it is between itself.
Cum ergo uenimus ad curationem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, ut phlebotometur si possibile est ei illud, et uides corpus eius plenum.	When we have come to the cure with iron, then it is necessary that you order the sick person to have blood let if possible, and you will see his body full.
Deinde resupinetur super dorsum suum super rem altam parum, et pone sub eo pannos multos.	Then he should lie on his back on a high thing slightly, and put many cloths under him.
Deinde sede tu super sinistram eius, et praecipe ministro, ut sedeat a dextra eius, qui extendat uirgam eius ad unum duorum laterum cutis testiculorum, et ad partem mirach uentris.	Then you should sit on his left side, and order the minister to sit on his right side, who will extend his penis towards one or two sides of the skin of the testicles, and towards the side of the scrotum.
Deinde accipe spatumile latum, et seca cutem testiculorum ex medio per longitudinem, usque prope pectinem: et fiat sectio secundum rectitudinem aequedistantis lineae quae diuidit cutem testiculorum, donec perueniat ad sifac album comprehendens: et excoria ipsum et obserua, uel caue ex hoc, ut seces ipsum: et sit excoriatio tua qua ipsum excorias, ex parte quae suspenditur cum ouo plus: et subtiliter scrutare cum excoriatione secundum quantitatem quod tibi possibile est.	Then take a wide spatula, and dry the skin of the testicles from the middle towards the back along its length: and make the incision according to the equidistant line that divides the skin of the testicles, until it reaches the white scrotum encompassing it: and examine the scar, or rather let go of it, so as to cut it off: and sit your scar in such a way that he is cut off from the part which hangs with the hair more: and carefully look at it with the scar according to the quantity that you can.
Deinde perfora sifac plenum aqua perforatione ampla, et extrahe totam aquam.	Then pierce the full scrotum with a wide water-perforation, and take out all the water.
Deinde separa inter duo labia sectionis cum uncinis, et extende sifac ad superiora, et non tangas cutem testiculorum comprehendentem: et incide sifac qualitercunque est possibile tibi incidere ipsum, aut cum totalitate sua, aut frustatim, praecipue latus eius subtile.	Then separate the two labia of the incision with a hook, and extend the knife upward, and do not touch the skin encompassing the testicles: and cut the skin however it is possible for you to cut it, be it completely or in part, especially its thin side.
Nam si tu non exquisite perscrutaris, in incisione eius non fit securitas, quin aqua redeat.	For if you do not examine it carefully, there will be no security in the incision, but water shall run out of it.
Si autem procedit ouum exterius a cute sua in hora operationis tuae: tunc quando compleueris sectionem sifac, reduc ipsum.	But if he should move outward from his skin during the time of your operation: then, when you have completed the incision of the skin, reduce him.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cutis testiculorum cum sutura.	Then gather together the two skin folds of the testicles with a stitch.
Deinde cura ipsum sicut reliqua uulnera, donec sanetur.	Then take care of him as you would of other wounds, until he heals.
Quod si inuenis ouum corruptum ex nigredine alia, tunc oportet ut liges uasa, quae sunt suspensorium, timens fluxum sanguinis.	That if the skin of his penis should become corrupted by another color, then it is necessary that you bind with ligatures, which are suspenders, fearing the flow of blood.
Deinde abscinde testiculum cum suspensorio, et extrahe ouum: postea cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then cut off the testicle with the suspender, and remove the penis: then take care of it with that which we have said.
Si uero aqua est aggregata in duabus partibus, tunc scias quia sunt duae ramices: seca ergo partem aliam secundum quod fecisti in altera aequaliter.	But if water is aggregated on the two sides, then you should know that there are two branches: so dry one half according to what you have done to the other, equally.
Et si aequatur tibi, ut sit operatio una, tunc fac: deinde absterge sanguinem.	And if it is equal for you, so that the operation shall be one, then do as follows: then wash away the blood.
Et intromitte in sectiones lanam submersam in oleo, aut in oleo rosato: et pone deforis lanam aliam quam submersisti in uino et oleo, et expande eam super duos testiculos, et mirach uentris: et pone desuper pannos duplicatos, et sunt puluilli: et liga eos desuper cum ligamento, quod est habens sex secundum hanc formam.	And introduce into the incisions a wool dipped in oil, or in oil rosated: and place another piece of wool which you have dipped in wine and oil over the two testicles, and press it down with your fingers: and place above it double cloth, and make it thin: and bind it above with a ligature, which has six threads according to this form.
Deinde sumantur duo panni, et suantur, et impleantur la na carminata, secundum hanc similitudinem: et fiant extremitates quibus premitur ex coto, aut lana humida: et aggregentur cum strictura in lumbari bracharum: et una extremitatum accipiat super anum usque ad dorsum, et secunda accipiat ad partem pectinis: et duae extremitates super duas coxas inferius, et duae extremitates aliae super duo inguina, et aggregetur strictura tota in lumbari bracharum.	Then take two cloths, and bind them together, and fill them with carminated wool, according to this similarity: and may the ends which are pressed by the cloth be placed behind the shoulders of the arms, or wet wool: and may they be agregate with a stricture in the lumbars of the arms: and one end may take hold over some until the back, and the other end may take hold to the side of the chin: and may the two ends take hold under the two hips, and the other end may take hold to the two inguinas, and may they be agregate with a stricture in the lumbars of the arms.
Et, quandoque artificialiter medicatur haec ramex cum cauterio loco sectionis cum ferro: et est, ut accipias cauterium cultellare subtile, et seces cum eo cutem testiculorum: et est ignitum, secundum quod narrauimus: donec quando detegitur sifac album continens aquam: tunc accipe cauterium, secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes this wire is artificially treated with a cautery at the site of the section with an iron tool; and it is as if you take a sharp cautery knife and separate the skin of the testicles from it: and it is ignited, according to what we have said: until the time when it is removed from the white sifac that contains water: then take the cautery, according to this form.
Assimilatur literae graecae.	It assimilates Greek letters.
Deinde perfora cum eo illud sifac, et est ignitum, donec egrediatur humiditas tota.	Then pierce that sifac with it, and it is ignited until all the moisture is gone out.
Deinde extende sifac cum uncinis, et excoria cum cauterio subtili ignito, et incide ipsum secundum quod possibile est tibi, donec eradices totum eius.	Then spread that sifac with a hook, and scrape it with a sharp cautery, and cut it as much as you can do, until you have removed all of it.
Et caue ex ouo, ne tangat ipsum ignis.	And let the fire not touch him.
Et scias, quod haec operatio est saluior, et longinquior a fluxu sanguinis, et melior quam operatio cum sectione.	And you should know that this operation is more beneficial, and farther from the flow of blood, and better than the operation with a section.
Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit in hora sectionis, aut in hora cauterii apostema calidum, aut fluxus sanguinis, aut aliquid aliud: tunc oportet ut cures quod contrarietatem tibi facit ex illo cum curatione quae conuenit ei, secundum quod praemissum est.	If, however, it causes you contrariety in the hour of the section, or in the hour of the cautery, hot swelling, blood flow, or anything else: then you should do what contradicts it with the cure that is appropriate for it, according to what has been stated.
Si autem infirmus est timidus, et non expectat super hanc operationem, propter horribilitatem suam: tunc administra perforationem secundum quod ego narro illud: et est.	If, however, he is timid and does not wait for this operation, because of its horror: then administer the perforation according to what I tell you: and that is enough.
Quando certificatur tibi apud te per illud quod diximus de significationibus, quod ramex est aquosa: tunc oportet quod facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	When it is certified to you by that which we have said about the meanings of the wire, that it is an aqueous one: then you should make the sick person sit on an elevated seat.
Deinde perfora apostema in inferiori parte sui cum spatumili lato: et pone perforationem secundum longitudinem corporis, et sit apertio ampla, donec currat aqua tota.	Then pierce the swelling in the lower part of his body with a sharp tool; and place the perforation according to the length of the body, and make it an open space that is wide enough until all the water runs out.
Deinde pone super locum cotum, et liga ipsum, et dimitte ipsum ut currat residuum aquae: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then put a cloth over the site, and tie it up, and let him go so that he can drain off the remaining water: then take care of the injury, until the wound heals.
Si autem contrarietas sit egressioni aquae in hora qua perforas ipsam: et non sit illud nisi propterea, quia panniculus albus contrarietatem facit in orificio uulneris, et prohibet exitum aquae: tunc oportet ut intromittas pennam in uulnus, aut instrumentum cum quo extrahitur aqua hydropicorum, cuius forma praecessit: aut adde in operatione uulneris parumper.	If, however, there is an obstruction to the outflow of water at the time you pierce it: and this should not be done except for that reason, because the white flap [of fat] causes an obstruction in the wound-hole and prevents the exit of water: then you must insert a feather into the wound or a tool with which the water is withdrawn from the hydropic [wound], whose shape preceded it: or add something to the operation of the wound.
Et scias, quod aqua redit, et aggregatur post sex menses, aut circiter eos.	And know that water returns, and is added after six months, or about them.
Cum ergo aggregatur, tunc pertoretur secundum eundem modum, et pertransibit infirmus dies suos.	When it is added then it returns in the same way, and the sick person will spend his days.
Â¶ De cura Ramicis carnosae.	On the care of the ramulus carnosus.
Caput LXIII.	Chapter LIII.
Scias, quod in sectione super hanc Ramicem, est ex timore perducente ad perniciem in pluribus dispositionibus.	You should know that in this section on the ramulus, it is from fear of losing its head and it will lead to harm in several dispositions.
Quapropter uidetur mihi eius dimissio saluari ex ea.	Therefore I leave him to my healing.
Et ego sum rememorans operationem in ea, et species apostematis.	And I remember the operation on it, and the appearance of the apotheosis.
Dico ergo, quod accidunt apostemata multa in corporibus, ex quibus componuntur testiculi: et fit illud ex caussis multis, scilicet.	I say then that many things happen in the bodies from which the testes are composed: and it is made from many causes, namely.
Aut ex superfluitate acuta, uel acri, quae effunditur ad testiculos.	Or from acute or bitter effluxion that flows into the testes.
Aut ex percussione.	Or from a blow.
Et est color apostematis secundum colorem corporis, et non inuenitur ei dolor: et est apostema graue.	And the color of the apotheosis is according to the color of the body, and it is not felt that there is any pain: and the apotheosis is gray.
Et fortasse est apostema lapideum, cuius color est fuscus, et non est sensus ei.	And perhaps it is a stone apotheosis, whose color is dark, and there is no feeling of it.
Et quandoque fit ex nodatione arteriarum, et inflatione earum: sicut iam praecessit eius rememoratio: aut ex inflatione uenarum.	And sometimes it is from the swelling of the arteries, and the inflammation of the veins: as it has already recalled: or from the inflammation of the venae.
Quod ergo est ex eis ex inflatione arteriarum, cognoscitur per dispositionem apostematis, quando comprimis ipsum digitis tuis.	That which is from those things from the swelling of the arteries is known by the disposition of the apotheosis, when you squeeze it with your fingers.
Et non oportet ut tangas ipsum prorsus.	And you should not touch it completely.
Illud uero quod fit ex inflatione uenarum, non dispergitur ex eo aliquid apud compressionem cum digitis.	That which is made from the inflammation of the veins does not emit anything by touching with the fingers.
Et iam possibile est, quod super hanc speciem fiat sectio, et super reliquas carnes: et est, ut seces cutem testiculorum.	It is also possible that a section be made on this form and on the remaining flesh: and it is as if you were to cut off the skin of the testicles.
Deinde extende ouum ad sursum, et extrahe ipsum cum sifach albo: et libera suspensorium ex uasis, et liga uasa: et incide suspensorium postquam tu liberas ipsum ab omni parte ex partibus oui.	Then extend your hand up and remove it with the string or thong: and free the suspension from the river, and tie the river: and cut the suspension after you have freed it from all parts of the body's sides.
Si ergo ouum consolidatum est cum illis carnibus natis, tunc oportet ut attrahas ouum, et incidas ipsum.	So if your consolidated hand is with those flesh-bearing hands, then you must attract your hand and cut it.
Et si adhaerentia est inter aliquid ex siphaket, aut in eo quod est inter uasa: tunc oportet ut liberes totam illam adhaerentiam, et incidas eam incisione rotunda.	And if the attachment is between some of the thongs or in that which is between the river: then you must free all that attachment and cut it with a round incision.
Si autem est natiuitas carnis in loco adhaerentiae quae est retro: tunc oportet ut incidas totum eius, et extrahas ouum, sicut diximus.	But if the birth of flesh is in the place of attachment which is behind: then you must cut all of it and remove your hand, as we have said.
Cum ergo completur operatio tua, tnnc imple uulnus in lana infusa in oleo rosato, et uino: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When your operation is complete, then fill the wound with wool infused with rose oil and wine: and then take care of the wound with the remaining cure, until it heals.
Â¶ De cura Ramicis, quae est cum Vite.	De the cura for the vine ramification.
Caput LXIIII.	Chapter LXXIV.
Uitis est apostema inuolutum quadam inuolutione, simile botro, cum mollificatione testiculorum: et fit difficilis super infirmum motus et exercitium, et deambulatio.	The use is a blisters-like swelling that is somewhat swollen with a soft skin, similar to the blisters of the testicles: and it becomes difficult on the part of weak motion and exercise, and walking.
Et in curatione huius aegritudinis est ex timore, propter illud cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And in the cure for this sickness is from fear, because of which the memory of its predecessor.
Verum oportet, ut dicamus operationem in ea secundum quod fecerunt primi.	But it is necessary that we say the operation in her according to what did the first.
Dico ergo, quod oportet ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	I say, that you should make the sick person sit on an elevated seat.
Deinde impelle suspensorium testiculorum ad inferiora.	Then push the suspension of the testicles to the lower.
Deinde tene cutem testiculorum cum digitis tuis, cum uasis quae sunt propinqua uirgae: et teneat ea minister alius, et extendat ea extensione uehementi.	Then hold the skin of the testicles with your fingers, with the river that is next to the shaft: and it should be held by another minister, and extended with an extension of a fierce.
Deinde incide cum spatumili lato acuto sectione transuersa in directo uasorum, donec detegantur uasa.	Then cut with a sharp chisel-like chisel in the straight direction of the river, until the suspension is detected.
Deinde excoria ab omni parte, sicut diximus tibi in extractione Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then remove the scabs from all parts, as we have told you in the extraction of the arteries which are in the temples.
Postea fige in eis acum in qua sit filum duplum, et liga ipsum in primo locorum quibus accidunt Vites: et liga ipsum iterum in ultimo eorum.	Then tie them together with a double thread, and tie it again at the first place where the thread enters the veins, and again at the last of them.
Deinde seca ea in media sectione recta secundum longitudinem corporis, et extrahe quod aggregatur ex humiditatibus faeculentis corruptis.	Then dry them in a straight line in the middle section for the length of the body, and remove what has accumulated from the corrupting moisture.
Deinde cura uulnus cum curatione reliquorum uulnerum, in quibus uis generari saniem, ut cadant uasa quae nutriunt unum testiculorum.	Then care for the wart with the cure of the other wounds, so that the warts do not grow again and damage the scrotum which nourishes one testicle.
Non est enim malum per illud.	It is not wrong because of that.
Si autem accidat Vitis omnibus uasis, tunc oportet ut extrahantur propter hoc testiculi cum uasis: ut non priuetur ouum nutrimento, propter incisionem, et tabescat, uel arescat, et non sit iuuamentum cum eis.	If, however, all the veins are cut off, then they should remove them for this reason from the testicles with the veins: so that they do not be deprived of their nourishment, because of the incision, and do not scar or dry up, and are not injured with them.
Â¶ De cura Ramicis intestinalis.	As for the cure of intestinal worms.
Caput LXV.	Chapter LVI
Euentus huius Ramicis est ex sectione, quae accidit in sifach extenso super uentrem in parte inguinum ex mirach uentris.	The end of this worm is from a section which occurs in the large intestine near the navel on the inner side of the thigh below the groin.
Quare descendunt intestina ex illa Ruptura ad unum testiculorum.	Why do the intestines come out from that break towards one testicle?
Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.	And this break is either from a tear, or from the length of the intestine.
Et accidunt istae duae species ex caussis multis: aut ex percussione, aut saltu, aut clamore, aut eleuatione rei grauis, et similibus.	And these two types of causes occur for many reasons: either from a blow, or from a fall, or from a noise, or from lifting a heavy thing, and similar things.
Et signum, quando est ex extensione sifach.	And the sign, when it is from the length of the intestine.
Est quod accidit paulatim in tempore longo, et non accidit subito: et est apostema aequale uersus profundum: propterea, quod sifach comprimit intestinum.	It is that which happens gradually over a long period of time, and not suddenly; and it is a bulge that is equal to the depth: because the intestine is compressed by the tear.
Et signum eius quando est ex sectione sifach, quia facit accidere ex principio sui dolorem uehementem subito: et est apostema diuersum, apparens sub cute propinque: et illud est propter exitum intestini, et cursus eius ad exteriora sifach.	And the sign of it is when it is from a tear in the intestine, because it makes a sudden sharp pain from its beginning: and it is a bulge that is different, visible under the skin nearby; and this is because of the exit of the intestine, and the course of the intestine to the outside of the tear.
Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zirbum: et nominatur haec Ramex intestinalis, et zirbia: et quandoque fit cum uentositate.	And when it is removed with a sharp blade: and this is called the intestinal ramus, and the zirbum: and sometimes it is done with a sharpness.
Et quandoque currit in intestinum stercus, et retinetur illic: et est cum eo pernicies infirmi: quoniam facit accidere dolorem prauum, et praecipue quando premitur.	And sometimes it runs into the stool, and is retained there: and it is with it that the disease of the bowels is precipitated: for it causes pain before, and especially when it is pressed.
Et in curatione specierum aegritudinis huius cum ferro est timor: quare oportet ut caueatur casus in ea.	And in the cure of the disease of this kind there is a danger with iron: so that care should be taken to prevent a setback in it.
Et modus operationis est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut reducat intestinum manu sua ad interiora concauitatis suae, si obedit reditui.	And the mode of operation is, that you may instruct the sick person to reduce his intestine by his own hand to the interior part of his cavity, if he obeys the return.
Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manus tuas: et eleua crura eius.	Then it shall be raised on its back between your hands: and wash its legs.
Deinde extende cutem quae sequitur cutem ad superiora, et seca cutem testiculorum totam per longitudinem.	Then extend the skin that follows the skin up to the back, and dry the whole skin of the testicles by its length.
Deinde fige in duobus labiis sectionis uncinos, secundum quod indiges ad aperiendum sectionem cum eis: et sectio sit secundum quantitatem, quod sit possibile, ut egrediatur ex ea ouum.	Then fix in two lips of the incision hooks, according to which it should be opened by the length: and the section should sit according to the quantity, that it may be possible for it to come out of it with its omentum.
Deinde excoria siphak, et quae sunt sub cute testiculorum, donec quando detegitur sifach album, durum ab omni parte: tunc intromitte digitum tuum indicem in eo quod sequitur testiculum, in eo quod est inter siphach album, quod est sub cute oui, et inter sifach secundum, et absolue cum eo adhaerentiam quae est in posteriori parte oui.	Then scrape the siphons, and what is under the skin of the testicles, until it is detected when it gets white, firm from all parts: then introduce your index finger into it that follows the testicle, in that which is between the white siphons, which is under the skin, and between the second siphons, and release with it the adhesion which is in the back part of the scrotum.
Deinde moue cum manu dextra ad interiora cutem testiculorum: et cum hoc extende sifach album ad sursum, cum manu sinistra: et eleua ouum cum sifach ad partem sectionis: et praecipe ministro, ut extendat ouum ad sursum: et tu solue adhaerentiam, quae est retro solutione completa.	Then move with the right hand to the inner skin of the testicles: and when this is done, extend the white siphons up, with the left hand: and wash the omentum with the siphons at the side of the section: and order the minister, that he should raise the omentum up: and you will release the adhesion, which is behind by the complete removal.
Et quaere digitis tuis, ut non sit aliquid illic ex intestino inuoluto in sifach albo duro.	And examine your fingers, that there may not be anything left of the intestine in the siphons or hard.
Si autem inuenis ex eo aliquid: tunc impelle ipsum ad uentrem inferius.	If however there is an injury from him: then push him towards the lower venter.
Deinde accipe acum, in qua sit filum grossum, factum licinium ex decem filis: et intromitte ipsam apud postremum sifach, id est, tunicae, quod est sub cute testiculorum quae sequitur sectionem: deinde incide extremitates quae eminent ex filo, donec sint quatuor fila.	Then take hold of the acme, where sits a thick filament, made from ten fils: and insert it between the last sifach, that is, the tunica, which is beneath the skin of the testicles, which follows the incision: then cut off the extremities that protrude from the filament, until there are four fils.
Deinde compone quaedam eorum super quaedam cum figura quae sit in modo crucis: et liga cum eis alsifach, de quo diximus, quia est sub cute testiculorum ligamento uehementi, donec non possit aliquod ex uasis, quae nutriunt eos mittere ad eos aliquid: ut non accidat inde apostema calidum.	Then join together some of them with the figure which sits in the form of a cross: and tie them up with alsifach, of which we have spoken, because it is under the skin of the testicles, ligamentum vehementi, until there is no possibility that any of the veins, which nourish them, should send anything to them: so that no apostema of heat does not occur.
Et pone iterum ligamentum secundum extra ligamentum primum, longinquum ab eo minus duobus digitis.	And put again the second ligature, distant from the first by two fingers' length.
Et post ista duo ligamenta dimitte ex sifach, quod est sub cute testiculorum, quantitatem magnitudinis digiti: et incide reliquum totum secundum rotunditatem, et aufer ex eo ouum.	And after these two ligatures have been released from the sifach, which is under the skin of the testicles, a quantity equal to the length of a finger: and cut off all the rest, following its curvature, and take out one.
Deinde seca in inferiori parte cutis testiculorum sectione, ex qua currit sanguis, et sanies: sicut narrauimus in eo quod praemissum est.	Then dry up in the lower part of the skin of the testicles, from which runs blood and pus: as we have told you before.
Deinde administra lanam submersam in oleo, et pone in uulnus: et administra ligamentum quod narrauimus.	Then administer wool soaked in oil, and place it on a mandrel: and administer the ligature which we have described.
Et quandoque cauterizatur sifach album quod diximus, post incisionem eius timendo de fluxu sanguinis.	And when the white sifach, which we have spoken of, is cauterized after the incision has been made, to the effect that there is no flow of blood.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	This often happens.
Et dimitte ligamentum, donec cadat per se.	And release the ligature until it falls away by itself.
Si autem tardatur casus eius, tunc embrocetur cum aqua calida: et pone super ipsum illud quod diximus, donec cadat.	But if its fall is delayed, then steep it in warm water: and place on it the one which we have spoken of, until it falls away.
Deinde cura uulnus cum reliqua curatione uulnerum, donec curetur.	Then take care of the mandrel with the remaining curing of the wound, until it is cured.
Â¶ De Ramice uentosa.	The ramie
Caput LXVI.	of the ramie
IN Hac Ramice non uidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.	In Hac Ramice non vidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.
Et primi quidem dixerunt, quod fit sicut narrauimus in Ramice quae est cum Vite.	And first of all they said that it was done as we have reported in Ramis which is with the vine.
Quod est, ut liges uasa post sectionem super ea cum facilitate inferius: deinde seca in medio, et cura postremo cum eo quod aperit ipsum, donec cadant uasa: et cura uulnus, secundum quod diximus, donec sanetur.	That is, so that the ligatures are used after the section on her with ease from below: then cut in the middle, and heal afterwards with it as it opens itself, until they fall off: and heal the wound, according to what we have said, until it heals.
Â¶ De disruptione quae fit in inguinibus.	Regarding the section that was made in the groin.
Caput LXVII.	Chapter LVII.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, sicut diximus, et eminet locus, et non descendit ad testiculos aliquid ex intestinis: et si descendit, est illud parum, et redit in omnibus horis: uerum si prolongatur cum ea tempus, additur fissura in sifach, donec descendunt intestina in sifach.	When a rupture occurs in the groin, as we have said, and a place is made, and does not go down to the testicles any part of the intestines: and if it goes down, it is little, and comes back again at all times: indeed if it is prolonged for a long time, a fissure is added to the sifach, until the intestines go down into the sifach.
Et accidit illud ex extensione sifach, quod est in inguinibus, sicut diximus.	And that happened because of the extension of the sifach, which is in the groin, as we have said.
Quod est, quia extenditur sifach: deinde mollificatur, et apostematur locus, et eminet.	That is, because it extends the sifach: then it softens, and a place is made, and it emerges.
Et cura eius est cum cauterio, sicut praecessit eius narratio.	And the treatment of that is with a poultice, as preceded by its report.
Et quandoque curatur cum ferro, secundum hunc modum: et est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum inter manus tuas.	And sometimes it is treated with iron, in this way: and it is so that the sick person lies on his back between your hands.
Deinde seca locum Rupturae apostematum et eminentem, sectione per latitudinem, secundum quantitatem trium digitorum.	Then cut off the place of the rupture, which has been made and is emerging, by cutting across the width, according to the quantity of the three fingers.
Deinde stringe alsifak et, quae sunt sub cute, donec quando detegitur sifach album, quod est sub cute quae sequitur ipsum.	Then tighten the ligature and, which are under the skin, until when it is taken off there is the white sifach, which is under the skin that follows it.
Tunc accipe radium, et pone ipsum super locum eminentem ex sifach, et preme ipsum ad profundum uentris.	Then take a ray, and put the member on the place that emerges from the sifach, and press the member towards the deep of the groin.
Deinde sue duo loca eminentia super extremitatem radii ex sifach, et annecte cum sutura unum eorum cum altero: deinde extrahe extremitatem radii.	Then cut off two place that are emerging on the end of the ray from the sifach, and join them together with a stitch: then remove the end of the ray.
Et non incidas alsifach omnino, neque tendas ouum, neque aliud, sicut feci te scire in curatione ramicis intestinalis.	And do not hit the patient with anything at all, nor stretch him out, nor anything else, as I told you to know about the cure of intestinal worms.
Deinde cura illud curatione uulnerum.	Then the care of that wound.
Cum ergo incidis fila, mundifica illud, et restaura uulnus, donec consolidetur.	How then do you hit the lines, clean it out, and restore the break, until it heals over.
Sisach enim contrahitur, et non additur eminentia Rupturae.	For Sisach is struck against, and no excellence is added to Rupture.
Et cauterium est melius in hoc loco: quoniam est propinquius ad salutem.	And the cauterization is better in this place: for it is nearer to health.
Â¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.	Regarding the softening of the skin of the testes.
Caput LXVIII.	Chapter LVIII.
Multotiens mollificatur cutis testiculorum in quibusdam hominibus, propter quod mollificantur carnes quae sunt inter ea, et foedatur aspectus eius.	The skin of the testes is often softened in certain men, because the flesh between them becomes soft and the appearance of it is changed.
Ergo necesse est ei qui rogatur in curatione eius, ut faciat iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et incidat totam cutem quae mollificata est super cutem naturalem.	Therefore it is necessary for him who is asked to care for himself, that he lie down on his back, and hit all the softened skin on top of the natural skin.
Deinde aggreget duo labia cum sutura: et si uis, sue in primis superfluitatem cutis mollificatae tribus suturis, aut quatuor, et firma suturam.	Then he should gather together two lips with a stitch: and if the patient wants it, in the first place three stitches of the softened skin, or four, and a firm stitch.
Deinde incide inter sututuras.	Then hit between the stitches.
Deinde cura curatione reliquorum uulnerum, usquequo sanetur, et cadant fila.	Then care for the cure of the other wounds, until they are healed, and the lines drop out.
Â¶ De Castratione.	Regarding castration.
Caput LXIX.	Chapter LIX.
Scias, quod Castratio in lege nostra excommunicata est: et propter illud liceret mihi, ut non rememorarer eius in libro meo isto: et non est necessaria rememoratio eius, nisi propter duos modos.	You should know that castration is excommunicated in our law: and because of it I will remind myself not to mention it in this book: but its reminder is only necessary for two reasons.
Quorum unus est, ut sit illud in scientia medici quando interrogatur de ea: et ut sciat curationem eius cui accidit.	One reason is that it be in the knowledge of a doctor when he is questioned about it: and so that he knows how to cure himself if it happens to him.
Et modus alter est, quod nos multotiens indigemus castratione quorundam animalium, propter iuuamenta nostra per illud, sicut arietum, hyrcorum, et gattorum, et similium ex animalibus.	The other reason is that we often do not want to castrate certain animals for our own good, as sheep, horses, and cats and similar animals.
Dico ergo, quod Castratio fit secundum duos modos.	I therefore say that castration is done in two ways.
Aut per attritionem.	By means of friction.
Aut per fissuram, et sectionem.	Or by splitting open.
In illa autem quae fit per attritionem, uia operationis est: quod nos faciamus sedere animal in aqua calida, donec mollificentur testiculi eius, et leniantur, et pendeant: deinde attere eos manu tua, donec resoluantur et non appareant sub tactu.	In that which was made by friction, the method of operation is this: that we make the animal sit in hot water, until his testes become soft and lax and hang down: then do you spread them open with your hand, until they have healed and are no longer apparent to the touch.
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.	In castration by splitting open and cutting, you must hold the animal, and press the skin of his testes with your left hand.
Deinde liga suspensorium, et seca super omne ouum sectione una, donec quando procedunt duo oua: tunc incide ea postquam excoriaueris utrumque, et non dimittas super ea ex sifaket aliquid praeter sifac subtile, quod est super uasa.	Then bind the suspender and dry up all one side of the cut, until when they come forward both two hairs: then cut them after you have scrubbed them so that there is nothing left but a thin skin, which is over the line.
Et iste modus castrationis est melior eo qui fit per attritonem: quoniam attritio fortasse relinquit aliquid ex testiculis, quare desiderat animal coitum.	And this method of castration is better than that which was done by friction: for friction may have left something behind from the testes, whereby the animal desires to have sex.
Deinde cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the wound, until it heals.
Â¶ De cura Hermafroditae duorum modorum.	Of the treatment of hermaphrodite the two ways.
Caput LXX.	Head
Hermafrodita ex uiris est secundum duos modos.	Hermaphrodites come from testes, second by two ways.
Vnus eorum est, quia apparet in eo quod sequitur spacium, aut in cute testiculorum, in eo quod est inter duos testiculos, figura quasi uulua mulieris, in qua sunt pili: et quandoque currit urina ex eo quod est in cute testiculorum.	A man is born of testes, second by two ways. One is because it appears in him that follows the space, or in the skin of the testes, in that it stands between the two testes, figure like a woman's pubis, and when he runs urine comes from it which is in the skin of the testes.
In mulieribus autem est species una, et est uulua mulieris super pectinem sicut testiculi uiri parui omnino, eminentes ad exteriora: quorum unus est sicut priapus uiri, et duo sicut duo testiculi.	But in women there is one species, and it is a woman's pubis over the spine like a man's small testes, prominent to the outside: of which one is like a man's penis, and two like two testes.
Et curatio trium specierum, duarum ex uiris, et speciei unius ex mulieribus, est: quia oportet ut incidas carnes additas, donec effugiat impressio earum.	And the cure of the three species, two of testes, and one of women, is this: for you must cut off the flesh that has been added, until the impression of them disappears.
Deinde cura eas curatione reliquorum uulnerum.	Then take care of the remaining wounds.
In specie autem secunda uirorum, ex qua egreditur urina, quae est in cute testiculorum, non est operatio, neque est eius curatio omnino.	Yet regarding the second sex, from which urine flows, which is on the testes skin, there is no operation or cure at all.
Â¶ De incisione Tentiginis, et carnis eminentis in uuluis mulierum.	Regarding incisions of the hymen and prominent flesh on the vulva of women.
Caput LXXI.	Chapter LXXI: On the Incision of the Hymenal Membrane
Tentigo fortasse additur super rem naturalem, donec foedatur et turpis fit aspectus eius: et quandoque magnificatur in quibusdam mulieribus adeo, donec expanditur sicut in uiris, et peruenit usque ad coitum.	If the hymen is strengthened by being sewn on to the natural place until it grows and looks bad; and sometimes it becomes beautiful in some women so that it spreads like a man's member and reaches all the way up to intercourse.
Oportet ergo ut teneas superfluitatem Tentiginis manu, aut cum uncino, et incidas: et non ultimes in incisione, praecipue in profundo radicis: ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Therefore you should hold back the hymen with your hand, or with a hook, and cut it off; and do not cut it at all, especially deep at the root; so that blood does not flow.
Deinde cura ipsam curatione uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then care for this wound, after cutting, until it heals.
Caro autem orta, est caro quae nascitur in orificio matricis, donec impleat ipsum: et fortasse egreditur ad exteriora secundum similitudinem caudae: et propter illud quidam primi nominant aegritudinem caudatam.	Yet the central flesh, which is born in the opening of the mother's womb, until it fills itself up; and perhaps it flows out on the outside according to the resemblance of a tail: and because of this some call sickly what has a tail.
Oportet ergo ut incidamus eam sicut incidimus Tentiginem, et curemus eam, donec sanetur.	Therefore you should cut it off as we cut the hymen and care for it until it heals.
Â¶ De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.	Regarding the treatment of the clitoris, which is a woman'
Caput LXXII.	Chapter LVII: On the Treatment of the Clitoris
Alratica est, ut sit uulua mulieris non perforata, aut sit foramen paruum.	The Alratica is such that it is a woman'
Et est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And it is either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis est ex aegritudine quae praecessit: et ipsa quidem fit aut ex carne nata addita, aut sifach subtili, aut spisso: et fit aut in profundo matricis, aut in lateribus eius, aut in superiore ipsius, aut inferiori eius: et prohibet a coitu et impregnatione, et partu, et fortasse prohibet menstrua.	The accidental one is from an illness that precedes it; and the same one becomes either from flesh born, added, or filth with a thin blade; and it forms either deep in the mother' belly, or in her sides, or above or below her: and it prevents coitus and impregnation, and birth, and perhaps menstruation.
Et cognitio illius fit per aspectum obstetricis, si opilatio est apparens propinqua.	And understanding of this is obtained by an obstetric examination, if the discharge is apparent nearby.
Si autem non est apparens, tunc quaere eam digitis tuis, aut cum radio.	But if it is not apparent, then feel it with your fingers, or with a ray of light.
Si autem opilatio est ex sifach subtili, et est propinqua duobus labiis: tunc propera, et disrumpe ipsam.	If, however, the wound is deep and close to the lips: then bring it closer, and remove it.
Et est, ut ponas super duo labia puluillos.	And let it be placed on two lips of the pulley.
Deinde pone indices tuos duarum manuum simul, et mulier sit super dorsum suum expansis cruribus suis.	Then place your fingers of both hands simultaneously, and let the woman sit with her legs spread on her back.
Deinde extende duo labia cum fortitudine, donec disrumpatur sifach subtile, et aperiatur opilatio.	Then open two lips with force, until the subtle wound is removed, and the discharge is opened.
Deinde accipe lanam, et imbibe eam in oleo, et pone ipsam super locum: et coeat mulier omni die, ut non consolidetur locus uice alia.	Then take a piece of wool, soak it in oil, and place it on the spot: and let the woman sit for all time, so that the site does not become inflamed with another source.
Si autem sifach est grossum, spissum: tunc oportet ut seces ipsum cum spatumili lato simili folio myrti.	If, however, the wound is thick and dense: then it must be separated with a similar leaf of myrrh.
Si autem opilatio est ex carne nata, tunc suspende eam cum uncinis, et incide eam: et sint tecum medicinae quae fluxum sedant sanguinis absque mordicatione, sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus aggregatum cum albugine oui.	If, however, the discharge is born of flesh: then hang it with a hook, and cut it: and let there be with you the medicines that will stop the flow of blood without scratching, such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and thus the aggregate with alumen and resin.
Deinde administra cannulam ex plumbo amplam, ut non consolidetur uulnus uelociter, teneat eam diebus aliquot: et administra licinium ex lino sicco, deinde curetur reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then administer a large copper tube, so that the wound does not heal quickly, let it remain for several days: and administer milk of wheat, then treat the rest with the cure, until it heals.
Et quandoque nasciur in matrice natiuitas carnium aliarum: oportet ergo ut incidantur secundum hunc modum: dum non est apostema cancerosum apostemati enim canceroso quod est in matrice, non fiat contrarietas cum ferro omnino.	And when the birth of flesh comes about in the mother: it is necessary that they be injured according to this method: while there is no scald-flesh of the cancerous type, for the cancerous one is in the mother and does not oppose iron at all.
Â¶ De cura hemorroidarum, Athehelil, et Bothor rubeae in uuluis mulierum.	Of the cure for hemorrhoids, Athahelil, and Boethor of the red rub on any wound in a woman.
Caput LXXIII.	Chapter LIII.
Hemorroides quidem sunt apertio orificiorum uenarum, donec currit ex eis sanguis multus assidue.	Hemorrhoids are an opening of the anal orifice, from which runs a lot of blood constantly.
Cum ergo antiquantur hemorroides, fiunt thelil: et iam dixi in diuisione species earum, et signa ipsarum: et dicam hic quae ex eis recipiunt curationem, et quae non.	So when hemorrhoids are treated, they become thin: and I have already spoken in the division of their types and their signs, and I will tell here those that receive the cure from them, and those who do not.
Dico ergo, quod hemorroides quae sunt in orificio matricis, et non apparent sensui: tunc non est ei curatio cum ferro.	I say that those hemorrhoids which are in the opening of the womb and do not seem to hurt: then there is no cure for them with iron.
Quae autem ex eis sunt in orificio matricis super quas cadit sensus, sunt quae curantur.	But these which are outside the opening of the womb and fall on it, are those which heal.
Oportet ergo ut intromittas mulierem in domum frigidam.	Therefore let the woman enter into a cold house.
Deinde extende athehelil cum forficibus, aut cum panno aspero, et incide eas ex radicibus suis.	Then extend the atharel with forceps, or with an coarse cloth, and cut them from their roots.
Deinde pulueriza super eas apud fluxum sanguinis ex uno puluerum incisiuorum absque mordificatione: sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus, et similia eis.	Then powder them on top of the flow of blood from one wound that has been powdered without killing: as acacia, and dragon's blood, and thorns, and similar things to them.
Deinde impellat pedes eius ad parietem hora una.	Then push her feet against the wall at a time.
Postea depone eam in aquam frigidam.	Then put her into cold water.
Quod si perseuerat fluxus sanguinis: tunc fac eam sedere in decoctione sumach, et corticum granatorum, et gallarum, et similium.	If the blood flow persists: then let her sit in a decoction of sumach, and of saltpetre, and of gall, and of similar things.
Deinde accipe farinam hordei, et confice eam cum melle et aceto, et fac emplastrum cum eo super dorsum eius.	Then take barley flour, and make a poultice with honey and vinegar, and make a pad with it and put it on her back.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis cum eo, bonum est: et si non, fac adhaerere dorso uentosas, et mammillis, absque scarificatione.	But if blood comes out with it, then it is good: and if not, then let it adhere to the back of the woman, and stinging nettle, without scarifying.
Deinde accipe lanam, et submerge in succo tarathit, aut succo arnoglossae, aut succo ramorum alaulat, id est, aglanter, uino pontico, et fac adhaerere loeo.	Then take wool and dip it in tarathrus (taraxacum), or in the juice of arnoglossa, or in the juice of alder branches, that is, glans, in Pontic wine, and let it adhere to her thigh.
Cum ergo quiescit apostema, tunc cura locum cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	But when the poultice has dried, then take care of the place with ointment, until it heals.
Albarth uero rubeum est simile capitibus alhaasse, et est asperi aspectus.	Albarth is really similar to red capillary hair, and is harsh in appearance.
Oportet ergo ut incidas quod apparet ex eo, secundum quod dixi in thelil aequaliter: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Therefore let him cut what appears, according to what I said about the teeth being equal: and take care of it, until it heals.
Â¶ De perforatione Exiturae quae accidit in matrice.	Regarding exit wounds that occur in the womb:
Caput LXXIIII.	Chapter LXXII
Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.	Appear in the womb many kinds of poultices, such as cancer, and stone poultices, and sores, and pustules, and blisters, and herpes, and colic, and fistulas, and hemorrhoids, and ulcers, and warts, and teeth.
Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.	And I have said already all these diseases and their kinds, and the signs of them, and the cures of them separately: it is necessary that I say in this treaty about a hot apoplexy which happens in the mother when she is from apoplexies which gather her blood, and to know how it is done its opening with iron.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	It is therefore necessary that you should consider.
Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.	Then if the pain of the apoplexy in its beginning is acute with its percussion, and flame, and fever: and you see it red: if it falls on it, then do not suit with its perforation: and cure it with that which it endures over maturation, until when it rests the sharpness of accidents.
Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.	Then it is necessary that you should make the woman sit on a seat which she will cover, and recline, or lie down on her back, and put her feet at the side of the lower leg: and let her hips be expanded, and let her put her arms under her knees, and tie each band to it.
Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latere dextro, et administra instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.	Then the midwife shall sit on the right side, and administer the instrument by which the opening of the womb is opened.
Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.	Whose shape comes to those who are after.
Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.	And it is necessary that when you administer this instrument, you should keep the mother's womb closed with a sharp implement: so that it does not enter into the instrument more than the depth of the womb, and does not wound the sick woman.
Si autem fuerit instrumentum magis quam profundum, tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos super tecturam profundi matricis: ut prohibeatur introitus instrumenti totius in profundum matricis: et oportet ut ponat uertiginem, quae currit in instrumento, ex latere superiore: et ut teneat instrumentum, et ut reuoluat minister uertiginem, donec aperiatur profundum matricis.	But if the instrument is more than the depth, then it is necessary that you should put a layer over the depth of the womb: so as to prevent the entrance of the instrument into all of the depth of the womb: and it is necessary that you should put a turner which runs in the instrument from the upper side: and that he holds the instrument, and that he turns the turner, until the depth of the womb is opened.
Cum ergo apparet Exitura, et tangitur manu, et est lenis et mollis: tunc oportet ut seces ipsam apud caput suum cum spatumili lato.	When it then appears that the birth is approaching, and touches with its hand, and is soft and smooth: then it is necessary that you should separate it from its head with a wide spatula.
Cum ergo euacuatur sanies, tunc oportet ut ponas in uulnus licinium submersum in oleo rosaceo: aut oleo uiridi, in quo sit quaedam stipticitas: et pone licinium, et extrahe sectionem in profundo matricis.	When then the pus is drained, then it is fitting that you place a piece of licorice root submerged in rose oil: or oil of yellow wormwood, in which there is some styptic; and place the licorice root, and extract a piece from the deep matrix.
Et pone exterius super matricem, et super pectinem lanam mundam submersam in aqua, in qua bullitae sunt maluae.	And place outside on the matrix, and over it a clean woolen cloth soaked in water, in which have been boiled some mallows.
Deinde curetur post duos dies cum unguento quod conuenit ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then let the wound be treated after two days with the ointment that is suitable for it, until healed.
Et quandoque abluitur matrix et uulnus, ita quod clisterizatur cum aqua et melle: deinde cum aqua in qua bullita est radix lilii, aut aristolochia longa: deinde redeat ad unguentum.	And when the wound and scar are washed away, so that they clump together with water and honey: then with water in which have been boiled lily roots or long aristochnema: then return to the ointment.
Quod si uulnus absconditum fuerit interius in matrice, tunc oportet ut prohibearis ex curatione eius cum ferro, imo cura ipsum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione.	That if the scar is hidden within the matrix, then it is fitting that you refrain from treating it with iron, but rather tend to it itself with what we have said regarding division.
Â¶ Doctrinae Obstetricum, qualiter medicentur embriones uiui, secundum figuram non naturalem egressi.	Â¶ Doctrine on Obstetrics, how the embryos are treated by the womb, according to a not-natural exit.
Caput Lxxu.	Chapter 70.
Necesse est Obstetrici, ut cognoscat in primis figuram partus naturalis.	It is necessary for the midwife to recognize first of all the figure of a natural birth.
Ex signis ergo eius est, quod quando uides mulierem comprimi ad inferiora, et desiderat odorare aerem, et alleuiatur super eam quod super ipsam est de partu, et festinat exitus embrionis: tunc scias quod iste partus est secundum figuram naturalem, et est exitus eius super caput suum, et secundina cum eo: aut suspensa, uel pendens ex umbilico.	From these signs then it is known that when you see a woman compressing herself towards the lower parts, and desiring to breathe air, and being relieved on her when birth approaches, and hastening of the exit of the fetus: then know that this birth is according to a natural figure, and its exit is above her head, and second with it: or hanging, or pendent from the umbilical cord.
Cum ergo uides haec signa, tunc oportet ut comprimatur uenter eius, ut descendat embrio uelociter.	When then you see these signs, then it is fitting that you compress her belly, so that the fetus descends quickly.
Nam quando descendit super caput suum, descendit secundina cum eo, et mundatur ex illis superfluitatibus mundificatione bona.	For when it has descended above its head, it descended second with it, and is cleansed from it by good cleansing.
Qui autem est praeter hunc partum, est innaturalis, illaudabilis.	But if this birth is beyond this, it is unnatural, unacceptable.
Quoniam quandoque egreditur foetus super pedes suos, et egreditur corpus eius ante caput ipsius, et pedes eius, et manus eius una, aut pes eius unus: aut egreditur caput eius et manus eius: aut egreditur uentrinus: et fortasse conuertitur super collum suum, et similia ex figuris illaudabilibus.	For when the fetus has exited on his feet, and the body of it has come out before the head of it, and the feet of it, and the hands of it one or two: or has exited the head of it and the hands of it: or has exited the navel: and perhaps has turned over its neck, and similar figures that are unacceptable.
Necesse est ergo Obstetrici, ut sit prudens, subtilis in istis rebus omnibus, et caueat sibi ab errore et decaeptione: et ego sum ostendens omnem figuram ex eis, et qualiter est ingenium in ea, et significetur per illud, et stetur super ipsum.	It is therefore necessary that the Obstetrician be prudent in all these matters and guard against error and deception; and I will show you all the figures of these, and how the art works in each case, and what it means by them, and I will explain it clearly.
Quando egreditur foetus super caput suum egressione sua naturali, et uehemens fit illud super mulierem, et difficilis fit ei partus, et uides uirtutem eius iam debilitatam: tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, aut mulieres teneant eam: et uapora uuluam eius cum foenugraeco decocto, et cum oleis humidis.	When the fetus has come out by its natural way of birth, and has risen on top of the woman, and her delivery is difficult, and you see her strength already weakened: then let her sit on a chair, or let the women hold her; and pour over her with foenugreek decoction, and with wet oils.
Deinde intromittat Obstetrix inter digitos suos Spatumile paruum, et findat cum eo secundinam, et secet eam ungue suo, donec currat quod est in ea ex humiditate: et preme uentrem mulieris, donec descendat foetus.	Then the midwife shall insert her fingers between the woman's labia, and find with them the second child, and dry it up with her nail, until she has taken away what is in it of moisture; and she shall press the woman's womb, until the child comes down.
Si autem non descendit, tunc oportet ut clisterizetur mulier ex mucillagine foenugraeci, cum oleo sisamino.	If then it does not come down, then it is necessary that the woman be clensed with a clister of foenugreek, with sise-seed oil.
Deinde praecipe ei post clistere, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi, et tene os eius et nasum ipsius hora una.	Then command her to compress herself after the clister; and make her sneeze with a handkerchief, and hold her nose and mouth at the same time.
Foetus enim egredietur statim.	For the child will come out immediately.
Quod si egrediantur duae manus foetus in primis, iunc oportet ut reducas eas cum facilitate paulatim.	What if two hands of the child have gone out first; then it is necessary that you reduce them with ease little by little.
Si autem non obedit in introitu, tunc pone mulierem super sedem, et eleua pedes eius sursum: deinde concute sedem super terram: et mulier teneatur, ut non cadat apud concussionem.	But if it does not obey in going in, then put the woman on a chair, and raise her feet up; then bring the chair down onto the ground: and let the woman hold herself so that she does not fall by the concussion.
Si ergo non egrediuntur manus, et moritur foetus: tunc incide eas, et extrahe residuum foetus: et liga manum eius cum panno, et extrahe ipsum cum aequalitate: nam ipse egredietur.	But if then the hands do not come out, and the child dies: then make an incision and remove the residue of the child; and tie his hand with a cloth, and pull it out with equality: for he will come out.
Â¶ Exitus embrionis super pedes suo.	The exit of the child is at its feet.
Quando egreditur foetus super pedes suos, tunc oportet ut impellat eos sursum: deinde conuertat foetum paulatim: postea aequet ipsum.	When the fetus has come out by its feet, then it is necessary that you push them up; and then turn the child little by little; afterwards, make it even.
Deinde accipiat unum pedum eius, et extendat eum paulatim.	Then he should take one of his feet and stretch it out gradually.
Cum ergo egrediuntur usque ad coxas, tunc praecipe ei, ut comprimatur, et fac eam sternutare cum condisi: egredietur enim, si Deus uoluerit.	When he has thus come out as far as the hips, then command him to compress and make him sneeze with the bandage on: for he will go out, if God wills it.
Et si non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc reduc foetum paulatim, donec ponas eum secundum figuram naturalem.	And if he does not come out with him when we have described it, then reduce the fetus gradually until you put it back in its natural shape.
Nam ipse egredietur tunc egressu facili.	For he will go out then on an easy exit.
Quod si prohibeatur cum eo toto quod narrauimus: tunc accipe ex mucillagine alteae, et oleo sisamino, et gummi soluto: et percute totum in mortario percussione bona: deinde line cum eo uuluam mulieris, et inferius uentris eius.	That if he is prohibited from doing the whole thing which we have described: then take a ball of aloe vera and oil of sesame and a dissolved gum: and beat it all up in a mortar with a good beating: then take the line with him as a woman's cry, and his lower legs.
Deinde fac eam sedere in aqua tepida, donec consequatur hypocundria.	Then make him sit in warm water until he gets a hypochondriacal condition.
Cum ergo uides quod iam calefacta sunt inferiora eius, tunc fac ei sief de myrrha: et suppone ipsum.	When you see that his lower legs are now heated, then make him apply myrrh to them: and let him lie down.
Quando ergo tenet sief hora una, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	When he has thus held the myrrh for an hour, then make him sit on a seat.
Deinde fac eam sternutare: et stringe ipsius os et nasum: et preme inferiorem partem uentris compressione facili.	Then make her sneeze: and tighten her mouth and nose: and apply a gentle compression to the lower part of her legs.
Nam foeus egredietur statim.	For the fire will come out at once.
Â¶ Exitus foetus super genua et manus.	Exit of the fetus over the knees and hands.
Quando egreditur secundum hanc formam, tunc ingeniet in intromittendo manus suas paulatim.	When he has come out in this form, then insert your hands gradually.
Deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manus suas.	Then the woman shall rise up on her neck and hang her feet down to the ground: and she herself shall lie on a bed and join her hands.
Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim.	Then squeeze above her navel gradually.
Deinde extrahe quod est sub pedibus eius ex puluinaribus, donec sit praeparata in inferiori parte.	Then pull out what is under her feet from the toenails until it is ready in the lower part.
Quod si non egreditur foetus, tunc accipe pedes eius, et moue eos motu uehementi.	That if the fetus does not come out, then take his feet and move them violently.
Deinde preme quod est supra hypocundria paulatim, donec ascendat foetus ad superiora.	Then squeeze what is above the hypochondriac gradually until the fetus rises up towards the upper part.
Deinde intromittat manus suas, et aequet foetum paulatim: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimatur, donec egrediatur foetus.	Then insert your hand and slowly massage the fetus; and order the woman to squeeze, until the fetus comes out.
Â¶ Exitus foetus latitudinaliter pendens ex manibus.	The exit of the fetus hangs downward between the hands.
Ingenietur in reductione manus eius.	Take hold of his hands in order to pull him down.
Si autem non potest reducere eam, tunc eleua mulierem, et fac eam ambulare.	If he cannot be reduced, then take away from her, and let her walk.
Si uero ambulare non potest, tunc fac eam iacere super lectum: et concute crura eius concussione uehementi.	But if she cannot walk, then let her lie down on a bed; and with a vigorous shaking, shake her legs.
Deinde administra linimentum quod praeparasti ex mucillaginibus.	Then apply the ointment you have prepared from mucus.
Quod si accipit eam partus, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	If she accepts it, then let her sit on a chair.
Deinde stude in reductione manus, et aequa foetum secundum figuram naturalem: et fac sternutare mulierem, et praecipe ei, ut comprimat se, donec egrediatur.	Then study to pull his hands, and arrange the fetus according to its natural form; and order her to sneeze, and tell her to squeeze herself, until he comes out.
Â¶ Exitus foetus super collum suum, expansis manibus, et est facies eius ad dorsum matris suae.	The exit of the fetus is over his neck, with spread hands, and its face is toward the back of its mother's body.
Oportet ut teneat Obstetrix manum foetus, deinde reuoluat eum paulatim, et aequet eum cum facilitate.	It is necessary that the midwife hold the fetus by the hand; then rotate him little by little, and stretch him with ease.
Cum ergo aequatur, tunc pone super uuluam eius quod narrauimus ex oleo et mucillaginibus.	But when it is even, then place it on a blanket that we have described made of oil and mucus.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut moueatur paulatim.	Then order her to move little by little.
Cum ergo feceris illud, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, et praecipe ei ut inclinetur ad latus dextrum.	But when you have done that, then let her sit on a chair, and order her to lean to the right side.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi.	Then order her to squeeze; and make her sneeze with a pinch.
Â¶ Exitus foetus praeparati super latus.	The prepared exit of the fetus is on the side.
Quando descendit ad orificium matricis secundum hunc modum cum secundina, tunc scinde secundinam cum ungue tuo, donec euacuetur ex humiditate.	When it went down to the opening of the mother according to this method with a second, then cut the second with your fingernail, until it is discharged from moisture.
Si ergo suspenditur super faciem foetus, et collum eius, tunc incide eam ex umbilico: ut non retineatur, et moriatur.	But if he hangs over the face of the fetus and his neck, then cut it from the navel: so that he does not remain, and he dies.
Deinde impelle foetum ad interiora, donec ponas eam secundum quod oportet: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimat se aliquotiens: ipse enim egredietur exitu leui.	Then push the fetus into the insides, until you place it: and order the woman to squeeze herself a few times: for he will come out slowly.
Â¶ Exitus Geminorum, aut foetuum multorum.	The exit of the twins, or the fetus of many.
Scias, quod Gemini multotiens nascuntur: et quandoque nascuntur tres, et quatuor.	You should know that twin children are often born: and sometimes they are born three and four at a time.
Verumtamen illud extraneum est, et raro contingit.	However, this is unusual, and rarely happens.
Quinque uero est res extra naturam, et non uiuunt penitus: et continet eos, quamuis multiplicentur, secundina una: et separantur per sifach, distinguens inter eos ligatum in umbilico cuiusque eorum.	Five, however, is a foreign number, and they do not live long apart: but, although they multiply, the second one remains: and, separating them by a slit, distinguishing between them, it binds them at the navel of each.
Et quandoque egrediuntur sicut egreditur foetus unus exitu naturali, facili: et egrediuntur exitu illaudabili, sicut narrauimus.	And sometimes when they go out, they go out like a single fetus from a natural exit, easily: and they go out with an admirable exit, as we have told you.
Quod si difficiles fuerint quidam eorum apud partum, et perueniunt ad illud quod diximus ex figuris innaturalibus, tunc cura eos sicut narrauimus: et sit ob stetrix subtilis, et faciat quod facit cum facilitate et tarditate, et ingenietur secundum omnem figuram cum eo quod praeparatur ei ex ingenio ducente ad salutem.	If some of them are difficult to deliver, and they reach that which we have said from an unnatural exit, then take care of them as we have told you: and, sitting behind a soft midwife, let her do what she does easily and slowly, and let her assume whatever form she wishes with him who is prepared by nature's guidance to salvation.
Â¶ Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.	Remember that it forms itself in the mother's womb from embryos, and sometimes they are aborted.
Quandoque formatur in matrice unus, et duo, et tres, et quatuor, et quinque, et sex, et septem, et plures decem: et iam uerificatum est apud me, quod mulier abortiendo emisit septem, et alia quindecim, omnes formatos.	Sometimes when it forms in the womb one, and two, and three, and four, and five, and six, and seven, and more than ten: and I have already proved with myself that a woman has emitted seven, and another fifteen, all formed.
Quod factum est mensuratione gloriosi sapientis.	That which is done by the measurement of a wise sage.
Hoc ergo totum oportet ut sit in scientia Obstetricis.	This therefore should be in the knowledge of Obstetrics.
Fortasse enim perueniet ad eam simile illius: opponat ergo ei cum illo quod oportet	Perhaps, however, it will attain to that which is similar to it: oppose it with that which is necessary
Â¶ De extractione foetus mortui.	Of the extraction of a dead fetus.
Caput LXXVI.	Chapter LVII.
Quando curas foetum mortuum cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex medicatione, et non egreditur, et cogeris uti operatione cum manu, tunc oportet ut consideres.	When you are concerned with a dead fetus, and when it does not go out, and you compel the use of the hand, then you should reflect on what I said in the division from medication, and understand.
Si ergo mulier est sanae uirtutis, et non est cum aliquo ex accidentibus, ex quibus timetur super eam perditio: tunc oportet ut resupinetur mulier super lectum, super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius inclinatum inferius, et crura eius eleuata: et ministra teneat eam a duabus partibus, aut ligetur ad lectum, ut non extrahatur corpus eius apud extractionem foetus.	If then the woman is of sound virtue, and is not with any of those accidents from which she fears harm: then it is necessary that she lie down on her bed, on her back, and let her head be inclined downward, and her legs raised: and the assistant should hold her by the two sides, or bind her to the bed, so that her body is not taken out at the extraction of the fetus.
Deinde humecta os matricis ex oleis humidis cum mucillagine alteae, et foenugraeci, et seminis lini.	Then moisten the jaw with oil of olive, mucilaginous, and fenugreek seed, and linseed.
Deinde inungat Obstetrix manum suam cum istis oleis et mucillaginibus: deinde intromittat eam in matricem cum facilitate.	Then the midwife shall moisten her hands with these oils and mucilaginous substances; then she shall insert them into the womb with ease.
Deinde quaerat cum ea locum in quo figat uncinos ex foetu, et loca conuenientia ad illud.	Then let her inquire about the site to which she shall insert the hook from the fetus, and about the appropriate sites for that.
Considera ergo tunc, si foetus est praeparatus ut descendat super caput suum: tunc fige uncinos in oculos eius, aut in collo eius, aut in ore eius, aut in palato ipsius, aut sub barba eius, aut in furcula ipsius, aut in locis propinquis costis, et sub hypocundriis.	Therefore consider at that time, if the fetus is ready to come down from above its head: then insert the hooks into its eyes, or its throat, or its mouth, or its palate, or under its beard, or in its collarbone, or in adjacent places of the ribcage, and below the hip bones.
Si autem descensus est super pedes eius, tunc in pectine, et costis eius mediis.	If however descent is towards his feet: then between his breasts, and his middle ribs.
Et oportet, ut teneat uncinum cum manu dextra: et ponat curuitatem eius in eo quod est inter digitos sinistrae manus: et intromittat cum manu cum facilitate, et figat uncinum in aliquo illorum locorum quae diximus, donec perueniat ad rem uacuam.	And it shall be that she hold the hook with her right hand; and she should place a knot in it in which is between the fingers of her left hand; and she shall insert her hand with ease, and shall fix the hook in one of those places that we have mentioned, until she has reached the loose part.
Deinde figat in oppositione eius uncinum alium, aut tertium, si indiges: ut sit contractio aequalis, et non declinet ad partem.	Then she shall fix another hook opposite to it, or a third one if she is able: so that there be an equal tension, and it does not decline towards a side.
Deinde extendatur extensione aequali, et non sit extensio secundum rectitudinem tantum, imo moueatur ad omnem partem, ut alleuietur exitus eius: sicut fit cum dente apud eradicationem eius.	Then it shall be extended by an equal extension, and should not be extended only according to the straight line, but should move on all sides, so that the exit is alleviated: as happens when a tooth is removed.
Et oportet in eo quod est inter illud, ut mollificetur extensio.	And it shall be that there is between that one, so that the extension is softened.
Quod si retineatur ex eo pars, tunc oportet ut inungat Obstetrix quosdam digitos cum oleo, et intromittat eos ex parte, ut reuoluat cum eis quod retinetur.	That if a part is retained from it: then it shall be that the midwife shall moisten some fingers with oil, and shall insert them on the part, so that they rotate with them that retains it.
Si ergo egreditur pars foetus, tunc permutentur uncini ad locum alium qui sit altior: fac hoc donec egrediatur foetus totus.	But if a part of the fetus exits: then the hooks shall be moved to a higher place: do this until the entire fetus has exited.
Si ergo egreditur manus ante alia, et non est possibile reducere eam, propter coartationem eius: tunc oportet, ut inuoluatur super eam pannus.	If therefore the hand goes out before others, and it is not possible to reduce it, on account of its constriction: then it should be, that a cloth should be folded over it.
Deinde extrahe eam donec quando egreditur tota, incide eam aut in iunctura plantae, aut in cubito: et ita oportet ut facias in manu altera, et in duobus pedibus.	Then, remove it until you can pull it out completely, cut it or fix it in the joint of the plant, and so you should do for the other hand, and for both feet.
Si autem caput foetus est magnum, aut accidit ei coartatio in exitu, aut est in capite eius aqua aggregata: tunc oportet ut intromittat inter digitos Spatumile spinosum, et findat cum eo caput, et extrahat aquam: aut disrumpat ipsum cum instrumento quod nominatur Almisdac: cuius forma uenit cum formis reliquorum instrumentorum in capitulo quod est post hoc.	If however the head of the fetus is large, or if there has been a constriction at its exit, or if water has accumulated in its head: then it should be that he should put between his fingers the Spathumile spinosum [spoon], and wash away with it the head, and remove the water: or he should break it off with an instrument called Almisdac [skewer]: of which shape it came with the shapes of the other instruments in the chapter after this.
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.	Likewise let him do if the fetus has a large head of nature, then it should be that he separates the algenegam [hair]: or takes it out with Misdach  [scissors], as we have said.
Deinde attrahas ossa cum forcipibus.	Then, grasp the bones with pincers.
Quod si egrediatur caput, et coartetur apud furculam: tunc findatur, donec effundatur humiditas quae est in pectore.	If however the head goes out and is constricted at the fork: then it should be found, until the moisture which is in the chest is discharged.
Si autem non complicatur, neque obedit ad exitum: tunc incide caput frustatim, secundum quod possibile est tibi.	If however it is not complicated, and does not submit to the exit: then cut the head suddenly, according to what is possible for you.
Quod si inferius uentris est apostematum, aut est in eo hydropisis: tunc oportet ut perfores ipsum, donec currat humiditas ex eo.	If however the lower leg is swollen, or there is water in it: then you should cut it open, until the moisture comes out.
Si uero foetus est super pedes suos, tunc attractio eius est facilis, et directio eius ad os matricis est leuis.	If however the fetus is on its feet, then the attraction of it is easy, and the direction of it to the mother's mouth is easy.
Si autem coartatur apud uentrem, aut pectus: tunc oportet ut extrahas ipsum cum panno quem inuoluisti super manum tuam: et findat uentrem, aut pectus, donec currat quod est in eis.	If however it is constricted at the belly, or at the chest: then you should remove it with a cloth which you fold over your hand: and open the belly, or the chest, until what is in them comes out.
Si autem auferuntur reliqua membra, et redit caput: tunc intromittat Obstetrix manum sinistram.	If however other limbs are taken away, and only the head remains: then let the midwife put her left hand in.
Si ergo os matricis est apertum, tunc intromittat manum in profundum matricis, et quaerat cum ea caput, et attrahat ipsum cum digitis usque ad os matricis: deinde intromittat in eo uncinum unum, aut uncinos duos, et attrahat ipsum cum eo.	If the mouth of the mother is open, then put your hand in deep into the mother's mouth, and ask it with your fingers, and pull it towards you to the mouth of the mother: then put in one hook, or two hooks, and pull it together with it.
Quod si os matricis coartatur, propter apostema calidum quod accidit ei: tunc non oportet ut laboretur super ipsum, imo oportet tunc administrare effusionem rerum humidarum, pinguium: et administra emplastra: et sedeat in aquis quae mollificant et humectant.	If the mother's mouth is clenched, because of the heat that comes to it: then it should not work on it, but rather at that time, it is necessary to administer an infusion of liquid, thick: and administer plaster: and sit in water that softens and moisten.
Quod si foetus est super latus suum, tunc possibile est ut aequetur: tunc administretur quod diximus in foetu uiuo.	If the fetus is on its side, then it is possible to make it even: then administer what we have said about a single fetus.
Quod si non est possibile illud, tunc incidatur frustatim, et extrahatur.	That if that is not possible, then cut it short, and remove it.
Et oportet ut non dimittas aliquid ex secundina intus omnino.	And it should not leave anything at all inside the second.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc administra quod diximus in apostematibus calidis quae accidunt in matricibus.	When you have finished your operation, then administer what we have said about the hot apostemata that happen in the mothers.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc descendat in aquis stipticis, et administra reliquam curationem.	That if blood comes out, then go down into the water of cauterization, and administer the remaining cure.
Et ego quidem iam uidi mulierem, in cuius uentre mortuus erat foetus: deinde impregnata est super ipsum uice alia, postea mortuus est foetus alius etiam.	And I have already seen a woman, in whose womb a dead fetus was: and then she became pregnant with another force, and then a dead fetus was born again.
Accidit ergo ei post tempus longum apostema in umbilico suo, et inflatum est, donec apertum est: et coepit emittere pus.	Then happened to her after a long time an apostema in her navel, and it swelled up, until it opened: and it began to emit pus.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius, et medicatus sum ei tempore longo: et non consolidatum est uulnus.	So I was called for her cure, and I treated her at a long time: but there was no solid wound.
Posui ergo super ipsum ex quibusdam emplastris fortis attractionis: et exiuit ex loco os.	I then put over it some strong plaster of projection: and she came out from the place of the mouth.
Deinde praeterierunt ei dies aliquot, et exiuit os aliud.	Then passed a few days for her, and she came out with another mouth.
Miratus sum ergo inde, cum in uentre non sit os.	I was therefore surprised from that inside, because there is no mouth.
Cogitaui ergo, quia erant ex ossibus foetus mortui.	So I thought, because they were the bones of a dead fetus.
Inquisiui ergo uulnus, et extraxi ossa multa, muliere existente in melioribus dispositionibus suis: et iam uixit taliter tempore longo, et mittit ex loco pus parum.	I therefore enquired about the wound, and drew out many bones, while the woman was in better condition than before: and now she had been for a long time in that condition, and sent forth from her place pus a little.
Et ego non firmaui hic hoc extraneum, nisi quoniam in eo est scientia, et adiutorium ad illud, quod administrat medicus artifex cum manu ex curatione.	And I do not find this strange here, unless that there is in it a kind of knowledge, and an aid to it, which the crafting physician gives with his hand from cure.
Â¶ De formis Instrumentorum necessariorum in extractione foetus.	Regarding the forms of the instruments necessary for the extraction of the fetus.
Caput LXXVII.	Chapter LVII.
Hic inferius est forma Strictorii, quo aequantur libri, cui aequaliter sunt duae uertigines in duabus extremitatibus duorum lignorum.	Here is the form of the Strigore, which are equidistant from the books, and which have two twists at each end of two beams.
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilior strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.	However, this twist should be made slightly finer than the strigore: and to make it so, either should be made of ebony, or of wood from a bush.
Et sit latitudo omnis ligni quasi duo digiti: et margo cuiusque amborum est quasi digitus unus, et longitudo cuiusque eorum est palmus et medietas: et in medio duorum lignorum sunt duo additamenta ex genere eiusdem ligni, quae iam firmata sunt in utrisque, quorum longitudo est medietas palmi et plus parum: et latitudo utriusque est quasi duo digiti, aut plus parum.	And the width of each beam should be as broad as two fingers; and the edge of each of them should be as broad as a finger; and their length should be a palm and a half, and slightly less in the middle; and there are two additions of the same kind of wood at the center of both, which have already been fixed, whose length is half a palm and a little more; and the width of each of them is as wide as two fingers, or slightly less.
Et ista duo additamenta intromittuntur in os matricis, ut aperiatur cum eis quando tu reuoluis duas Vertigines.	And these two additions are inserted into the mouth of the womb, so that they open up with them when you rotate the two twists.
Forma Vertiginis qua aperitur matrix.	Form of the Twist which opens the womb.
Forma alia ad simile illius, subtilior, et leuior.	A different form, similar to it, but finer and lighter.
Fiat ex ligno ebani, aut bussi, secundum similitudinem forcipum.	Be made of ebony wood, or of bush wood, according to the similarity of the forceps.
Verumtamen in extremitate eius sint duo additamenta, sicut uides hic supra: et longitudo omnis additamenti ex eis est quasi palmus: et latitudo utriusque est, duo digiti.	However, at the end of it there are two additions, as you see here above: and the length of each of them is almost a palm; and the width of each of them is that of two fingers.
Cum ergo uis aperire matricem cum eo, tunc fac sedere mulierem super lectum, pendentibus pedibus eius, aperto quod est inter crura eius.	But when you are going to open the womb with it, then make the woman sit on a bed, with her feet hanging down from between her legs.
Deinde intromitte ista duo additamenta coniuncta in matricem: et tu es tenens extremitatem instrumenti inferius inter coxas eius.	Then introduce two instruments joined together into the wound; and you, holding the lower end of the instrument, place it between his thighs.
Deinde aperi manum tuam cum instrumento, sicut facis cum forficibus, aequaliter secundum quantitatem quam uis ex apertione oris matricis, donec faciat Obstetrix quod uult.	Then open your hand with the instrument, as you do with forceps, equally according to the quantity that you want from the opening of the womb, until the obstetrician does what he wants.
Forma Vertiginis alterius quam dixerunt antiqui Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.	Form of the spinning other than what said the ancient Form of the driving by which is driven the fetus.
Forma Almisdac, qua conteritur caput magnum: et assimilatur forcipi, cui sunt dentes in extremitate, sicut uides.	Form of the Almazac, by which is turned the great head: and it is like a pair of forceps, having teeth at the end, as you see them.
Et quandoque fit oblungum, sicut forcipes secundum hanc formam, sicut uides, cui sunt dentes sicut dentes serrae, quo inciditur et conteritur.	And when it becomes blunted, like forceps in this form, as you see, having teeth like serrated knives, by which it is struck and turned.
Forma Almisdac quo conteritur caput paruum.	Form of the Almazac by which is turned the small head.
Forma Vncini habentis spinam unam.	Form of the Vincum having one spine.
Forma Vncini habentis spinas duas.	Form of the Vincum having two spines.
Forma forcipis cui sunt dentes serrae, cum quo conteritur caput foetus.	Form of forceps, having serrated teeth, with which the head of the fetus is turned and pushed.
Forma Spatumilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.	Form of the spatula having two ends for cutting the head off.
Forma duorum Spatumilium etiam latorum.	Form of the two spatulas also holding open.
Ista instrumenta omnia exercentur, et quanto plus multiplicantur species eorum, et praeparata sunt apud artificem, est uelocior ad operationem suam, et altior apud homines, propter quantitatem suam.	These instruments all work and the more they multiply in kind, and are prepared for use by the surgeon, so much the faster they are in doing their work, and the higher among men because of their number.
Non ergo despicies ex eis instrumentum, quin sit apud te praeparatum.	Therefore do not despise these instruments, but rather have you prepared them.
Inexcusabilis est enim necessitas eorum.	For necessity is the mother of invention.
Â¶ De extractione Secundinae.	Â§ On the extraction of the second.
Caput LXXVIII.	Head 78.
Quando retinetur Secundina apud partum, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmae, ut retineat anhelitum suum.	When the Second is retained during childbirth, then you should prevent it from falling, so that it does not hinder its breathing.
Deinde fac eam sternutare cum condisi: et stringe manum tuam super os eius, et nares ipsius.	Then make her sneeze with a pinch: and tightly hold your hand over her nose, and the nostrils of her.
Si ergo egreditur per hoc, bonum est.	But if it comes out this way, it is good.
Si non: tunc accipe ollam, et perfora in coopertorio foramen: et pone in ea herbas aperientes os matricis, sicut calamentum, rutam, et anetum, et camomillam, et sseham, et cassiam ligneam, et centauream: accipe omnes istas herbas, aut quasdam earum, et submerge eas cum aqua, et pone eas super ignem.	But if not: then take a ram's horn, and pierce it through the hole in the ceiling: and put in it herbs opening the mouth of the womb, such as calamus, rutabaga, anethum, chamomile, fennel, cassia, and centaury: take all these herbs, or some of them, and boil them in water, and put them on the fire.
Deinde pone embulam arundinis super foramen coopertorii ollae, et extremitatem aliam in os matricis: et teneat eam donec perueniat uapor ad concauitatem matricis.	Then he will place the embulum around the foramen of the cooperatum bone and another extremity in the jawbone: and he should hold it until the vapor has reached the concavity.
Deinde fac eam sternutare, sicut diximus.	Then he will blow into it as we have said above.
Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitate.	For the second time it comes out with ease.
Si autem remaneat post hanc curationem, et non egrediatur: tunc praecipe Obstetrici, ut submergat manum suam in oleo sisamino, aut mucillagine alteae.	If it remains after this cure and does not come out: then order the Obstetrician to dip his hand in olive oil or mutton fat.
Deinde intromittat in uuluam, et quaerat cum ea Secundinam.	Then he will insert it into the wound and ask where the second time is.
Cum ergo inuenerit eam, tunc accipiat eam, et extendat ipsam paulatim.	When he has found it, then he should take it and spread it out little by little.
Si autem fuerit annexa in profundo matricis, tunc intromittat manum, secundum quod narrauimus, donec quando inuenerit Secundinam, et extrahat eam paulatim secundum rectitudinem, ut non cadat matrix apud attractionem uehementem: imo oportet, ut permutetur cum facilitate ad latera dextra et sinistra: deinde addatur in quantitatem attractionis.	If it is annexed in a deep cavity of the jawbone, then he should insert his hand, as we have said before, until he finds the second time, and remove it little by little according to the direction, so that the matrix does not break at the sudden tug: it should be turned over with ease to the right and left side: then it is added in quantity of attraction.
Ipsa enim obedit tunc, et seruatur, et euadit ab adhaerentia.	For it itself will obey, and be drawn out, and free itself from the adhesion.
Quod si os matricis est coartatum, sicut nos iam narrauimus: cura eam cum sternutatione, et ex medicatione ollae cum herbis.	That if the jawbone is tightened, as we have already related: take care of it with sneezing, and after the treatment with herbs.
Si autem non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc caue ne fatigeris super eam in iteratione extractionis.	If it does not come out easily with all that we have said above, then be careful not to tire yourself out by repeatedly trying to remove it.
Verum oportet, ut quod egreditur ad os matricis ex ea, liges ad coxam mulieris.	But it is necessary that when it comes out at the jawbone from her, a few should be tied to her waist.
Deinde clisteriza eam cum unguento tetrapharmacon.	Then cleanse it with the four-fold ointment.
Ipsum enim putrefaciet eam post dies, et dissoluetur, et egredietur.	For it itself will rot and dissolve after a few days and come out.
Verumtamen quando putrefit, eleuatur ex ea odor malus ad stomachum et caput, et laedit illud infirmam.	But when it has rotted, an evil odor is emitted from it to the stomach and head, and injures it.
Oportet ergo ut administrentur suffumigationes conuenientes ad illud.	It is necessary that you administer appropriate suffumigations to it.
Quidam autem antiquorum iam experti sunt suffumigationem nasturtii, et ficuum siccarum.	Some have already been experienced in the sufumigation with nasturtium and dried fig.
Forma instrumenti quo suffumigatur mulier apud retentionem Secundinae et menstruorum.	The form of the instrument that is used to suffocate a woman during the second and menstrual period.
Fiat ex uitro simile alcama, aut ex zere: et ponatur extremitas ampla super ignem: et suffumigatio sit posita super prunas: teneat eam, donec consumatur illa suffumigatio: et itera aliam.	Let a piece of twig be made similar to the one used for suffocating, or from corn; and let it be placed on an edge wide over fire; and let suffocation be placed on plums; hold it until that suffocation is consumed; and let another be taken.
Â¶ De curatione Ani non perforati.	As for the cure of an unbroken wound.
Caput LXXIX.	Chapter LXXIX.
Nascuntur multi puerorum, et Ani eorum sunt non perforati, quos iam opilauit sifac subtile.	Many boys are born, and their women are not yet broken open by the subtle siroc of the air.
Oportet ergo, ut obstetrix perforet illud sifac digito suo: et si non, perforet ipsum cum Spatumili acuto: et caueat lacertum, ne tangat eum.	It is therefore necessary that the midwife should pierce that siroc with her finger; and if not, she should pierce it with a sharp spatch; and let her take care, lest she touch it.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam infusam in uino et oleo.	Then place over it wool soaked in wine and oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum ungentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound with ointment until it is healed.
Si autem times quod opiletur, tunc pone in foramine cannulam de plumbo diebus multis, et auferatur quando puer uult egerere.	But if you should happen to notice that it has become oily, then place a lead plug in the hole for many days, and let it be taken when the boy wants to defecate.
Et iam accidit opilatio Ani etiam ex consolidatione uulneris, aut apostematis.	And it also happens that the oil comes from the consolidation of a wound or pus.
Oportet ergo ut secetur illa consolidatio, deinde curetur cum eo quod diximus ex curatione et plumbo.	It is therefore necessary that that consolidation should be removed; then care for it with what we have said about curing and lead.
Â¶ De curatione Fistularum quae accidunt in inferiori parte.	As for the cure of fistulas which occur in the lower part.
Caput LXXX.	Chapter LXXX.
Fistulae quae accidunt in inferiori, sunt Nodatio, et Grossitudo quae accidunt prope anum deforis: aut in spacio unius partium: et est Fistula una, aut plures.	The fistulas which occur in the lower parts are the result of a nodding or swelling which occurs near the anus of the buttocks, or in the space of one of the parts; and there is one fistula or several.
Cum ergo antiquatur illa Nodatio, aperitur, et currit ex ea humiditas aquosa alba, aut pus subtile.	When that nodding is broken open, it opens, and from it runs a watery white fluid, or subtle pus.
Et quandoque sunt ex istis Fistulis penetrantes.	And when there are fistulas penetrating from among these.
Ergo penetrantes cognoscuntur per illud quod egreditur ex egestione, et uentositate, quando utitur infirmus egestione: et fortasse egreditur ex eis uermis.	Then those which penetrate are known by that which goes out from defecation, and moisture, when a sick person uses it for defecation; and perhaps they go out from them with wind.
Et sunt ex eis Fistulae quando sunt in spacio penetrantes usque ad uesicam, et usque ad meatum uirgae.	And are from them Fistulae when they are in space penetrating up to the meatus of the urethra, and up to the meatus of the vagina.
Et sunt ex eis penetrantes usque ad iuncturam coxae, et usque ad nodum caudae.	And are from them those that penetrate up to the joint of the hip, and up to the tail-bone.
Ex eo autem quo cognoscitur Fistula penetrans usque ad anum, etiam a non penetrante, est, ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum: et intromittas tentam subtilem in Fistulam ex aere, aut ferro: quando non est tortuositas.	From this, from which the fistula is recognized that penetrates up to a place, and also from which does not penetrate, that is, when you introduce your index finger into the anus: and introduce a thin probe of wire or bronze: when there is no curvature.
Quod si in ea est tortuositas, tunc intromitte in eam tentam ex plumbo subtilem, aut pilum ex pilis equarum, donec sentias tentam, aut pilum in digito tuo.	If, however, in it there is a curvature, then introduce into it a thin probe of lead or a quiver of horse-hair, until you feel the touch, or a hair on your finger.
Quod si non sentis ipsam penitus, neque procedit ex foramine aliquid ex egestione, neque uentositas, neque uermis sicut dixi: tunc scias, quia est non penetrans: propera ergo ad curationem.	If you do not feel this one either, and there is no discharge from the opening, nor is it curly or red as I said: then know that it is not a penetrating fistula: so turn to treatment.
Et quando Fistula est penetrans usque ad uesicam, aut ad meatum urinae: tunc significatio eius est exitus urinae ex ea, et prohibitio eius ab hoc ut consolidetur locus cum medicinis.	And when the fistula is penetrating up to the meatus of the urethra, or up to the meatus of the vagina: then the meaning of this one is the exit of urine from it, and its prohibition from it so that the place consolidates with medicines.
Si uero est penetrans usque ad iuncturam coxae, aut ad os coxae: tunc signum eius est, quod perueniat tenta usque illuc, si non est in ea tortuositas usque ad os: et inuentio doloris in circumitu partis, et quod egreditur pus ex ea semper: et quod non ualeat in ea medicatio, neque consolidatur cum unguento.	But if it is penetrating up to the joint of the hip, or up to the mouth of the hip: then its sign is that a probe goes as far as possible into this one, if there is no curvature up to the mouth: and discovery of pain in the surrounding part, and that it runs out pus from it all the time: and that it does not dry up in it with medicine, nor consolidates with unguent.
Et in istis Fistulis omnibus penetrantibus non est curatio omnino: et curatio earum est labor et uanitas ei, ex stultis medicis, super quem formatur.	And in these fistulas: there is no cure at all for all of them that penetrate: and the cure for them is work and futility from stupid doctors, who make up a practice on it.
In illa autem quae non est penetrans, et non antiqua, speratur sanatio cum serro: secundum quod ego narro tibi, et ego iam probaui: et est, ut iaceat infirmus inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et eleua crura eius usque supra coxas ipsius, et coxae eius sint inclinatae ad uentrem ipsius.	But in that one which is not penetrating, and is not old, there is hope of cure with a knife: for I tell you, and have already tested it: and it is, so that the sick person lies between your hands on his back: and wash his legs all the way up to the thighs, and his thighs are bent towards his stomach.
Deinde intromittetentam plumbi, aut aeris, si est in Fistula tortuositas, donec scias ubi peruenit tenta.	Then introduce a lead or air tube if there is tortuosity in the fistula until you know where the thread ends up.
Si autem sentit eam infirmus circa anum, tunc oportet ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum.	But if he feels it weak at a certain point, then you should introduce your finger-tip indicator at that point.
Si ergo sentis in digito tuo tentam iam penetrasse per seipsam detectam, praeter quod sentias inter digitum tuum, et inter ipsum sifac, aut carnem: tunc ergo scias certe, quia est penetrans: non ergo labores in ea, quoniam non est eius sanatio, sicut diximus.	But if you feel the thread already penetrating by itself through your finger and also through the skin or meat: then you will certainly know that it is penetrating: do not therefore work on it, because it is not a cure, as we have said.
Dixerunt tamen, quia sanatur in quibusdam hominibus caro, et ex medicatione qua ei speratur iuuamentum, est, ut ignias cauterium subtile secundum amplitudinem Fistulae, sicut praecessit, et intromittas ipsum ignitum in Fistulam, donec perueniat circa anum.	They said, however, that he is cured by flesh in some people and by the application of a fine cauterizing fire along the length of the fistula, as preceded, and introduce the lit fire into the fistula until it reaches a certain point.
Deinde itera illud bis, aut ter, donec scias, quia iam adustae sunt omnes illae carnes additae filtratae, quae sunt similes cannulae pennae auis.	Then repeat that twice or three times until you know that all the added filtered flesh, which is similar to a feather tube, has dried up.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, donec egrediantur illae carnes, quae adustae sunt: deinde cura illud cum unguentis generantibus carnem et consolidantibus.	Then care for that with a smooth paste of butter, until the flesh that has dried up comes out: then care for that with an ointment-like substance that generates flesh and consolidates it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est.	But if he is cured, it is good.
Et si non, tunc non sanatur cum alia curatione unquam.	And if not, then he does not cure with any other treatment ever.
Et si egreditur tenta, et non peruenerit usque ad digitum tuum, qui est in ano, et est inter ipsum et tentam uelamen spissum ex carne, aut sifac: et uides Fistulam in eo quod sequitur superficiem cutis, tunc seca cutem ab initio Fistulae, et tu uadis secando cum tenta quod est in fistula, donec perueniat secatio ubi peruenit tentae extremitas, et liberatur tenta et cadit.	And if it comes out and does not reach your finger which is in the anus, and is between the thread and a thick stuff of flesh or skin: and you see a fistula running along the skin surface, then dry off the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and you will dry out with the thread that is in the fistula until it reaches the dryness of the thread's end, and let go of the thread and drop.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas, quae assimilantur cannulae pennae auis, ut non remaneat ex eis aliquid.	Then clean those filtered flesh tubes, which resemble a feather tube, so that nothing remains of them.
Si autem uincit te sanguis, et soluit inter te et inter operationem tuam ut seces illas carnes: tunc melius quod fit, et uelocioris iuuamenti, cauterizare eam cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta.	But if blood wins over you and separates you from your own work by solving those flesh, then it is better that it happens, and quicker in its healing, cauterize it with fire, or with acute medication.
Quoniam cauterium cum igne aggregat habitudines bonas, adustionem illarum carnium additarum, et abscisionem sanguinis, et exiccationem humiditatum.	For the cauterization, since it gathers good habits with fire, to add heat to their flesh and cut off blood and dry up moisture.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, aut caulibus tritis, donec locus emittat pus, et egrediantur illae carnes adustae in pus.	Then that care with linen wrapped in butter, or triturated clogs, until the place discharges pus, and those flesh that have been burned dry out from the pus.
Deinde cura tunc uulnus cum unguentis consolidatiuis, generantibus carnem duram: et sunt medicinae in quibus sunt stipticitas et exiccatio.	Then that care when the wound with consolidated ointments, which generate hard flesh: and there are medicines in which are sterility and drying out.
Nam quando restaurantur, tunc iam sanatur: et non times iterationem.	For when they are cleaned, then they are healed: and do not put off repetition.
Si autem Fistula iam peruenit usque ad profundum ani, et elongatur a superfluitate corporis: tunc intromitte digitum tuum in anum, et inquire cum eo.	But if the fistula has reached as far as the hip and extends from the surplus of the body: then put your hand into it, and ask it.
Si ergo sentis tentam, et inter te, et inter eam est uelamen ex sifac, aut carne, et est propinqua penetrationi: tunc non est operatio in illo, nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	But if you feel a trying, and between you and it is an obstacle of skin, or flesh, and it is close to penetration: then there is no operation in it, unless by the way of trust and hope.
Quod est, quia administratur in eo unus trium modorum: aut ut cauterizes ipsam, sicut diximus: aut seces eam, donec consequaris concauitatem eius, ut sit possibile tibi intromittere licinia, et curationem ex proximo.	That is, because it is administered in him one of two ways: or as it cauterizes itself, as we have said: or as it severs it, until the resulting concavity, so that it is possible for you to put a linen and cure from the nearest.
Et non procedas multum cum sectione, ut non incidas lacertum continentem anum, et accidat super infirmum exitus egestionis absque uoluntate.	And do not proceed much with the section, lest you fall into a control of some kind of snake, and it happens to an exit of infirmity without will.
Deinde cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then that care with it which we have said.
Fortasse enim sanabitur: aut elonges ipsum uelamen, et mundes ipsum postquam secas ipsum usque prope anum, sicut diximus, aut cum tenta, aut cum instrumento alio acutae extremitatis.	Perhaps then is healed: or lengthens the wound, and cleans it after drying up it until close to the hip, as we have said, or with a trying, or with another acute extremity of instrument.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas quae sunt in sectione, usque ubi potes cum perscrutatione.	Then clean those filthy flesh that are in the section, until you can examine them closely.
Deinde conare restaurationem uulneris totius cum sectione, et orificio superiore ubi consolidatur: et remanet Fistula aperta in interiore parte anus, et erit leuius super infirmum.	Then endeavor to restore the wound of all with the section, and join it where it consolidates: and remains a fistula open in the inner part of the anus, and will be easier on infirmity.
Et quandoque suitur Fistula secundum hunc modum: et est, quando intromittis tentam in Fistulam: et est in latere ani circa superficiem corporis cum cute et margine ani: tunc accipe tentam perforatae extremitatis, quae est sicut acus aleskef, id est, praeparantium coria, secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes the fistula follows this manner: and it is when you insert a probe into the fistula; and it is in the side of the anus near the surface of the body with skin and margin of the anus: then take hold of the extreme end of the perforation, which is like a needle aleskef, that is, corium preparantium, according to this form.
Et intromitte in eam filum inuolutum ex quinque filis, et circiter ea.	And insert into it a twisted thread of five strands and surround it.
Deinde intromitte tentam cum filo in Fistulam, donec consequatur concauitatem eius.	Then insert the probe with a thread into the fistula, until you feel a resistance.
Si ergo est penetrans in margine ani interius prope, tunc extrahe filum ex illo foramine: ita ut intromittas digitum tuum in anum, et extrahas extremitatem fili, et aggreges duas extremitates simul: et stringe utramque, et dimitte illud die uno, aut duobus diebus: et quanto plus incidit filum in carne, stringe ipsum bene, donec incidantur illae carnes quae sunt inter duas extremitates fili, et cadant: deinde cura uulnus, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	If then it penetrates into the inner margin of the anus near, then remove the thread from that hole: so that you insert your finger in the anus, and remove the extreme end of the thread, and join both ends together at the same time: and tighten them well, until the flesh which is between the two ends of the thread comes together, and falls off: then care for the wound, until it heals, and is cured.
Si autem orificium Fistulae non est penetrans: tunc fac ipsum penetrare quocunque modo praeparatur tibi, nisi sit in profundo multum.	If, however, the opening of the fistula is not penetrating: then let it penetrate in any way you prepare it for yourself, unless it is in a deep place.
Non enim inest tibi, ut facias illud propter lacertum, ut non incidas ipsum.	For it is not good for you, to make it because of the snake, so that you do not strike yourself.
Deinde fac cum ea sicut diximus, donec sanetur.	Then do with it as we have said, until it is cured.
Forma Spatumilis spinosi quo finditur Fistula, cuius curuitas est acuta ualde, et pars altera est non acuta, ut non incidat illud quod non est necesse, sicut uides.	The shape of the needle which is found in the fistula, whose curve is acute very much, and the other part is not acute, so that it does not strike what is not necessary, as you see.
Â¶ De sutura Hemorroidarum, ex quibus currit sanguis ex incisione earum: et cura fissurarum.	The suture of hemorrhoids, from which runs blood from the incision of them: and care for fissures.
Caput LXXXI.	Chapter LIII.
Sunt Hemorroides secundum duos modos.	There are hemorrhoids in two ways.
Aut enim sunt intra anum, similes uesicis carbonum, uel prunarum: aut quasi ipsae sint grana uuae.	Or they are inside the anus, similar to charcoal, or plums: or almost like grain of wheat.
Et ex eis sunt paruae, et magnae: et sanguis currit ex eis semper, et est una, et sunt multae.	And from them there are small and great: and blood runs from them always, and one is cured, and many are not.
Et sunt extra anum, et in extremitatibus eius.	And they are outside the bone, and at its extremities.
Verumtamen istae quae sunt extra anum, sunt secundum plurimum paucae humiditatis, ex quibus currit aqua citrina, aut parum sanguinis cursu assiduo: et sunt secundum colorem corporis.	But those that are outside the bone are very few, and of little moisture, from which runs the yellow water, or a little blood with regular course; and they are according to their color to the body.
Et curatio eius quae est intra anum, est, ut praecipias infirmo ut assellet: et exprimatur, donec egrediatur anus, et appareant athelil tibi.	And the cure of that which is within the bone is, as you command the sick to sweat: and it is expressed, until it comes out through the anus, and appears blood-clots to thee.
Propterea ergo et suspende cum uncinis: aut tene eos cum ungue tuo.	Therefore therefore hang them with a hook: or hold them with your nail.
Deinde incide eos apud radices suas.	Then cut them at their roots.
Si autem non retinentur in eis uncini, propter humiditatem eorum et ipsorum mollificationem: tunc cape eos cum panno aspero, aut cum coto ex diploide lanea, et extrahe eos cum digitis tuis.	But if they do not retain the hooks for their moisture and their own softness: then take them with a rough cloth, or with a twine of double-twined wool, and draw them out with your fingers.
Deinde incide eos, et pulueriza super eos post incisionem quosdam pulueres calidos, ut stent eis loco cauterii.	Then cut them, and sprinkle over them after the incision certain hot powders, so that they may stand in place of cauterization.
Aut cauteriza eos secundum quod praecessit in capitulo cauterizandi.	Or cauterize them according to what has gone before in the chapter on cauterization.
Deinde cura eos cum reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then cure them with the remainder of the cure, until they are cured.
Quod si non obedit anus egressioni, tunc clisteriza infirmum clisteri in quo sit mordicatio parua, ut lauetur cum eo quod est in ano, et obediat egressioni uelociter, quando exprimit se infirmus.	That if the anus does not yield to emission, then bind the sick-person with a clister that has a small mordication, so that it may irritate with him who is in the ano, and yield to emission quickly, when he expresses himself with sickness.
Si autem athelil sunt extrinseci ab ano, tunc res eorum est leuis, facilis: et est ut capias eos cum ungue tuo, aut capias eos cum uncino, et incidas eos.	But if the blood-clots are external from the ano, then the matter is lighter and easier: and it is as if you take them with your nail, or take them with a hook, and cut them.
Deinde cura eos cum eo quod diximus, donec sanentur.	Then cure them with that which I have said, until they are cured.
Et qui abhorret incisionem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut administres suturam eorum secundum hunc modum.	And who hates the incision with iron, then it is necessary that you administer to them a sutura in this way.
Accipe filum inuolutum, et intromitte ipsum in acum.	Take a silken thread, and introduce it into the cavity.
Deinde extrahe athelil ad superiora, et fac ipsum penetrare cum acu in radice eius ex parte altera: et inuolue duas extremitates fili, in inferiori parte acus, et sint latitudinaliter: et stringe athelil strictura forti.	Then draw out the blood-clots towards above, and cause it to penetrate with the point of the needle on one side of the root: and wrap the two ends of the thread round it, in the lower part of the hole made by the needle, and let them lie side by side: and tighten the blood-clot with a firm constriction.
Deinde noda filum, et extrahe acum.	Then remove the knot, and extract it out.
Fac illud cum omnibus athelil, et dimitte ex eis unum: nec suas ipsum, ut currat ex eo superfluitas sanguinis.	Then take away all of the knots, and leave only one behind: and do not harm yourself, lest you cause an excess of blood to flow from it.
Deinde pone super anum pannum infusum in oleo rosato, aut caeroto, et pone ipsum super anum: et praecipe infirmo, ut quiescat.	Then place over it a cloth soaked in rose oil or unguent, and put that on top of it: and order the sick person to lie down.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, donec cadat.	Then let go of him, until he falls.
Cum ergo cadunt athelil, cura eos cum unguentis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	When the knots have fallen, treat them with ointment, and with the rest of the cure, until they are healed.
Â¶ De cura Fissurarum.	Â§ On the treatment of fissures.
Multotiens enim accidunt ex exiccatione stercoris, et constrictione naturae.	For often a person suffers from dry stool, and from natural contraction.
Cum ergo antiquantur, et non ualet in eis medicina: tunc oportet ut radas cum puncta Spatumilis, aut cum ungue tuo, donec fiant humidae, et auferatur ab eis cortex superior qui prohibet eas a consolidatione.	When they have been long constipated, and there is no medicine in them: then you should wash them with the solution of Spongia, or with your own finger, until they become moist, and the upper skin which prevents them from being consolidated is removed from them.
Deinde cura eas, donec consolidentur secundum quod oportet.	Then treat them, until they are consolidated, according to what should be done.
Si autem non consolidantur: tunc itera eas cum rasione uehementiori quam prima, donec sanguinentur multum, et excorientur deinde cura eas, donec sanentur.	But if they are not consolidated: then treat them again with a more forceful solution than before, until they bleed a lot, and then treat them, until they are healed.
Â¶ De curatione Almirmar inuersorum, et non inuersorum: et Athelil siccorum, et Formicae.	Â§ On the treatment of scurvy, and not of scurvy; and of dry knots, and of bee stings.
Caput LXXXII.	Chapter LIII.
Scias quod Almirmar non est nisi nodus rotundus secundum colorem corporis, similis capiti claui: et fit in toto corpore, praecipue in inferioribus partibus pedum, et digitis: et accidit ex eis dolor apud ambulationem.	You should know that scurvy is a round knot-like color on the body, similar to the claw of a head; and it appears throughout the whole body, especially in the lower parts of the feet and fingers; and it causes pain when walking.
Oportet ergo ut secetur quod est in circumitu claui, et teneatur cum forficibus, aut cum uncino, et eradicetur ex radice sua.	Then let it be cut off what is in the shape of a claw, and held with forceps, or hooked; and root it out from its root.
Deinde cura illud: et si uis cauteriza illud secundum quod praecessit in capitulo suo.	Then treat that wound, and if you have cautery, treat it according to what has been said in his chapter.
Ex athelil autem siccis unus est eminentia parua, aspera, filtrata, rotunda supra superficiem corporis.	But of the dry knots there is one little eminence, rough, filiform, round on top of the surface of the body.
Et multotiens accidunt in manibus puerorum.	And often it happens to boys' hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut extendas athelil, et incidas ipsum: aut stringas ipsum cum filo de serico: aut cum pilo, donec cadat.	And the cure of this is that you should spread out the splint and press it down on it; or you should tie it with silk thread; or with hair, until it falls off.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum secundum quod praemissum est cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta: et iam eradicantur athelil inuersi, et non inuersi cum instrumento quod ego dicam.	And if the bone is broken, you should cauterize it according to what has been stated above with fire or with sharp medicine; and these splints that are immersed, whether they are immersion splints or not with an instrument which I call a splint-platter, are removed very quickly.
Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.	But a worm is also an excellent thing, fine, thick, on the surface of the body, wiggling into the depths deeply: and when it comes to be cold, it feels in it a similar stinging of a worm; and it enters into the whole body; and much of it is made in the hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut accipias cannulam ex penna anseris, aut penna uulturis forti: et pone illam cannulam super Formicam, donec contineat circulus cannulae ex partibus eius.	And the cure of this is that you should take a tube from a goose feather or a swan feather, strong; and put it down on the worm, until it holds a circle of the tube in its parts.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum cannula, donec seces quod est in circumitu Formicae: et ponas eam in profundo carnis, et eradices Formicam ex radice eius.	Then rotate your hand with the tube, until you separate what is in the circumference of the worm; and put it in the depth of the flesh, and remove the worm from its root.
Et si uis, fac illud cum cannula aeris, aut ferri, secundum hanc formam.	And if you want to, do this with the tube of air or iron, according to this form.
Sit superius cannulae ad sublimitatem trahens surdum inuolutum, ut alleuietur super digitum apprehensio eius et ipsius reuolutio.	Let the tube be positioned above a limit by pulling down a wisp of hair, so that the grasp of the finger and its rotation are eased.
Et si uis cauteriza Formicam secundum quod praemissum est in cauterizatione Athelil in capitulo de cauterio.	And if you want to, cauterize the worm according to what has been stated above in the cauterizing of Athelil in the chapter on cauterization.
Â¶ De formis Instrumentorum quae administrantur ad Clisteria in aegritudinibus Ani, et solutionis uentris, et colicae.	On the forms of instruments that are used for cauterizing in animal diseases, and for relieving urinary obstructions and bowel constrictions.
Caput LXXXIII.	Chapter LIII.
Quandoque Clistere fit ex argento, aut ex aurichalco, aut ex aere fuso, aut malleato.	When the clister is made of silver, or of gold-plated brass, or of ordinary brass, or of mallet
Et quandoque fit ex istis Instrumentis paruum, et magnum, secundum illos in quibus administrantur.	And when it is made of these small instruments, and of the large ones, according to those in which they are administered.
Illud ergo quod administratur in curatione puerorum paruorum, sit paruum: et quorum ani sunt debiles, aut dolorosi, sic et clisteria eorum.	So then it is necessary to keep the lungs of young children pure; and if they are weak or sore, then also their enemas.
Clistere magnum.	A large enema.
Cistere paruum.	A small enema.
Canna eius, id est, caput superius in quo ligatur uter, sit amplum secundum hunc modum: et sit ei distinctio ut ligetur uter sicut uides, et extremitas eius inferior quae intromittitur in anum, sit surda, id est, non aperta, lenis, ualde, trahens ad subtilitatem: et in uno laterum eius sint duo foramina, et in latere altero foramen unum.	The head of the uterus, that is, the upper part to which a ligature is tied, should be wide according to this manner: and it should have a distinction so as to be tied as you see, and its lower extremity which enters into the pelvis should be dull, that is, closed, soft, drawing towards subtlety: and on one side of her there are two holes, and on the other side one hole.
Et sit amplitudo foraminis secundum grossitudinem radiorum, et grossius parum, et sit uter in quo ponuntur medicinae ex uesica animalis: aut ex charta ouis, quae sit secundum formam asofrati paruae: cuius radix sit palmus unus.	And the width of the hole should be according to the thickness of the radii, and the thicker the smaller, and let the uterus in which the medicine is placed from an animal be: or from a paper sheet, which is according to the shape of a small aspartate: whose root is one palm.
Et perforetur foraminibus multis sicut reuoluitur, et sit spacium quod est inter omne foramen grossitudo digiti.	And let many holes be pierced according to what has been opened up, and let the space that is between all the hole be according to the thickness of a finger.
Deinde intromitte in illa foramina filum forte ex filo crudo, quod sit ex decem filis, aut circiter ea, et aggrega cum eo utrem sicut asofrati.	Then put into those holes a strong thread from raw silk, that it be from ten threads, or something like that, and bind with it so that it is like an aspartate.
Cum ergo ponitur in eo uter, stringatur in capite clisteris inter duo distinguentia constrictione forti.	Then when the uterus is put into this, a strong constriction should be bound on the head of the enema between two distinctions.
Deinde clisteriza cum eo.	Then take the enema with you.
Et haec est forma circuli utris hic depicta, et foraminum.	And this is the shape of the uterus which has been depicted here, and the holes.
Qualitas autem clisterizandi cum eo, est: ut impleas utrem, aut uesicam ex medicina, quae sit calefacta secundum quantitatem tolerantiae infirmi: et caue ne sit calida ualde, aut frigida ualde.	The quality of the enema with you is this: that it fill the uterus, or the uterus from medicine which is heated according to the quantity of tolerance of the nurse: and let it not be hot very much, or cold very much.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et eleuet crura sua ad superiora: et pone sub eo inthaan, id est, corium super quod iacent homines, aut linteamen.	Then let the sick person lie on his back, and raise his legs towards the upper part: and place under him, that is, a blanket over which men sleep, or a mattress.
Deinde inunge extremitatem Clisteris cum oleo, aut cum albugine oui, aut cum mucillagine foenugraeci, aut similium.	Then dip the extremity of the enema into oil, or into wax from the rind, or into mucus from fenugreek, or similar.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in anum cum facilitate.	Then insert it into the anus with ease.
Deinde accipiat minister utrem cum duabus manibus suis simul, et exprimat ipsum cum uehementia, donec euacuet totum quod est in Clisteri in intestinum.	Then the servant takes hold of it with both hands and squeezes it hard until all that is in the clister is emptied into the intestines.
Deinde extrahe Clistere, et eleuet infirmus crura sua ad parietem.	Then he removes the clister, and raises his weak legs against the wall.
Quod si medicina cogit eum ad exitum, tunc teneat quantum potest.	If the medicine makes him feel better, then he should hold on to it as long as possible.
Et si dormit cum ea nocte tota, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if he sleeps with it all night, it is more effective in healing.
Si autem clisterizas eum in aegritudinibus solutionis uentris, et festinat exitus eius: tunc itera clistere, donec sanetur.	If instead you use the clister to soften his hard bowels, and then hasten his discharge: then repeat the clistering until he is healed.
Quod si in ano sunt hemorroides, aut apostemata laedentia, tunc sit clistere subtile ualde, lene, ex clisteribus quibus clisterizantur pueri.	If there are hemorrhoids, or painful blisters in the anus, then sit in a hot clister gently, with ease, using the clisters that the boys clisterize.
Et haec sit forma clisteris subtilis super quod sit stricta cutis.	And this should be the form of a thin clister, made on a stiff skin.
Â¶ De curatione Vulnerum capitis sine fractura ossis.	[On the treatment of head wounds without fracture of the bone].
Caput LXXXIIII.	Chapter LIII.
Iam dixi in diuisione de curatione uulnerum quod conueniebat libro, et ego dicam hic curationem eorum cum manu, et cum medicinis secundum complementum.	I have already spoken in the division of the treatment of wounds that suited the book, and I now say here the treatment of theirs with the hand, and with the second aid.
Dico ergo, quod uulnera diuersificantur secundum illud quo fiunt uulnera, et secundum locum super quem cadit uulnus.	I say then, that wounds differ according to the place where they are struck, and also according to their nature.
Res ergo quibus fiunt uulnera multotiens, sunt sicut iactus lapidis: aut incisio ensis, aut cultelli: aut percussio cum lancea, aut ligno, aut sagitta: et similibus illis ex rebus multis.	Therefore the wounds which are often caused are like the blows of a stone: or the cut of a knife, or a blow with a lance, or a piece of wood, or an arrow: and similar things from among many.
Vulnera autem quae fiunt secundum loca corporis sunt, sicut uulnus quod cadit super caput, aut collum, aut pectus, aut uentrem, aut epar: et similia ex eis membris.	But wounds which are caused according to the places of the body are, as regards their nature, like a wound struck on the head, or the neck, or the breast, or the belly, or the limbs: and similar things from among many.
Et ego sum narrans curationes quorundam uulnerum, ut ponam eam ratiocinationem et regulam super reliqua uulnera.	And I am telling the treatment of certain wounds, so that I may set forth the reasoning and rule for the remaining wounds.
Et ego incipiam a uulneribus capitis simplicibus: quoniam rememoratio compositorum ueniet in principio capituli tertii.	And I shall begin with simple wounds of the head; for the remembrance of the authors will come at the beginning of chapter three.
Dico ergo.	I say this.
Quando accidit in capite uulnus simplex, et non est fractura ossis: considera tunc, si est ex iactu lapidis, aut ei similibus, et iam fregit cutem tantum: et est uulnus magnum, et times super infirmum euentum apostematis calidi: tunc propera, et phlebotoma cephalicam statim: et non tardes illud: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius: si non fuerit prohibens aliquid a phlebotomia, praecipue si fuerit sanguis qui egreditur ex uulnere paucus.	When there is a simple wound on the head, and it is not a fracture of the bone: consider then, if it is from a rock-throw or similar, and he has already torn the skin only: and it is a great wound, and you fear for the possibility of suppurations: therefore draw near, and immediately perform cephalic phlebotomy: and do not delay that: and extract therefrom according to the quantity of its power: if it were not to prohibit phlebotomy, especially if it were blood which comes out from a small wound.
Et sit phlebotomia ex contrario partis uulneratae.	And let the phlebotomy be made from the opposite side of the wound.
Et caueat infirmus sibi a repletione, et uino, et cibis grossis.	And let the patient beware of over-indulgence in wine and rich food.
Si autem minutionem prohibet aliquid, tunc minoretur ex cibo, et non appropinquet carnibus, neque uinis.	But if anything prohibits moderation, then he should abstain from food, and do not approach meat, nor wine.
Et pone super uulnus si accidit ei apostema calidum, cotum infusum in oleo rosato solo, aut cum uino in quo est stipticitas.	And place on the wound if it is a suppuration of hot pus, an infusion of oil of rose-water, or with wine in which there is stenosis.
Si autem securus fueris ab apostemate calido, tunc pone super uulnus, si est recens cum sanguine suo, et non mutauit ipsum aer, puluerem quem ego narrabo post paululum: et si iam mutauit ipsum aer, tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, donec sanetur.	But if you are free from suppuration of heat, then place on the wound if it is new with its own blood, and has not been changed by air, then I will tell you after a little while: and if it has already been changed by air, then place on it an ointment, until it heals.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, aut est ex incisione ensis, et similium: et non aggregantur labia eius per puluillos, tunc aggrega ipsa cum sutura, secundum quod ego narrabo in uulneribus uentris de sutura eorum.	But if the wound is large, or from an incision of a knife, and similar: and the edges of it are not gathered by pus, then gather them together with a stitch, according to what I will tell you about stitches in wounds of the leg.
Si autem uulnus iam detectum est ab osse, et pendet, et non est retentio eius, nisi in suspensorio paruo: tunc incide ipsum.	But if the wound has already touched bone, and hangs down, and there is no support for it, except in a little suspension: then cut it.
Deinde cura uulnus cum medicinis, et restaura in eo carnem duram loco cutis, et praecipe infirmo, ut alatur cibis in quibus est grossitudo, sicut sunt capita, et triticum coctum, donec sit ut puls: et eis similia.	Then take care of the wound with medicines, and restore in it hard flesh at a place where there is skin, and command the patient to eat food which has roughness, such as are heads of animals, and cooked wheat, until it is like a pulse: and those things are similar.
Quod si inuenis in cute putrefactionem, et non adhaeret ossi: tunc incide putrefactum totum, et proiice ipsum: deinde cura illud.	If it is putrefied in the skin and does not adhere to the bone: then cut off the putrefied part, and throw it away; then treat that.
Si autem in his uulneribus est arteria, aut uena ex qua fluit sanguis: et non abscinditur per medicinas, tunc inquire super arteriam.	But if there is an artery in the wound, or a new one from which blood flows: and it does not get cut by medicines, then inquire about the artery.
Si ergo inuenis eam non sectam, tunc seca eam cum Spatumili, aut liga eam.	But if you do not cut it open, then dry it out with Spatemoli, or tie it up.
Quod si necessitas prouocat quando non confert illud quod diximus, tunc cauteriza eam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	What if necessity compels you to do this when it does not grant what we have said, then cauterize it, until the blood stops flowing.
Si autem uulnera ista sunt parua, simplicia, tunc res eorum est facilis, leuis: ita ut puluerizes super ea hunc puluerem: quoniam consolidat ea antequam mutet ea aer.	But if these wounds are small and simple, then the matter is easy and light: so that dust over them dust: for they harden before they change with air.
Â¶ Modus Pulueris incarnatiui.	The way of the dust that has been made into a paste.
Recipe olibani partem unam, et sanguinis draconis partes duas, et calcis non extinctae partes tres: teratur totum multum, et cribelletur: et impleatur ex eo uulnus, et constringatur constrictione bona, donec adhaereat super ipsum bene, et coaguletur cum sanguine.	Take a part of olive oil, and two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of burnt lime: mix them together well, and strain them: and fill them with the paste, and tighten them tightly until they adhere well to the wound, and are hardened with blood.
Deinde stringe ipsum desuper cum puluillis, et dimitte ipsum, neque soluas ipsum dum permanet, ita quod non apostemetur.	Then tie the wound from above with dust, and let it go, and do not remove it until it has healed, so that it does not break open.
Nam non eradicatur ab eo medicina, donec sanatur.	For the medicine will not be removed from it until it has healed.
Et quandoque facit illud calx sola, quando non sunt tibi in praesenti olibanum, et sanguis draconis etiam facit eandem operationem in multis ex uulneribus magnis, quando conuenit ut ponatur super ea et stringantur, et sunt uulnera recentia cum sanguine suo, quae non alterauit aer.	And when it has hardened by itself, for you do not have olive oil at hand, and dragon' s blood also does the same operation on many large wounds, when it comes to be placed on them and tied down, and are wounds that have recently come with their own blood, which has not changed with air.
Quod si iam alterauit ea aer quadam alteratione, praecipue quando est in tempore aestatis, tunc non est in positione huius pulueris intentio: cura ergo ipsum cum eo quod diximus, ita ut ponas super ea quaedam unguenta digestiua: aut ponas super ea pultes ex farina hordei, factas cum aqua et melle, donec emittant pus.	What if it has been changed by air in some way, especially when it is in the season of summer, then this powder's intention is not good: so take care to put on it a kind of digesting ointment that we have mentioned, or put on it a paste made from barley flour, made with water and honey, until it discharges pus.
Deinde cura ea reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then care for the remaining wounds until they heal.
Si uero accidat cum uulnere fractura in osse, et est parua, tunc extrahe illud cum Gesti: et ego iam dicam curationem fracturarum capitis in eo quod futurum est.	If, however, there is a fracture of the bone and it is small, then extract it with the gesture: I will already say the cure for fractures of the skull because what follows needs to be heard.
Â¶ De uulneribus Colli.	Regarding the wounds of the neck.
Caput LXXXV.	Chapter LXXXV regarding the head.
SI Autem uulnus accidat in Collo, tunc non est inter ipsum differentia in medicatione, et inter uulnus capitis quando est simplex.	If, however, an injury has occurred in the neck, there is no difference in treatment between it and a simple injury to the neck.
Si autem iam incisus est neruus Colli, aut arteria: tunc si est neruus, non est in eo ingenium, nisi ut deuitetur curatio eius cum eo quod facit stipticitatem uehementem, sicut ziniar, et zegi, et eis similia.	If, however, an incision has already been made on the nerve of the neck, or on an artery: then if it is a nerve, there is no skill in it unless it is allowed to heal with the application of astringent poultices, such as zine, and rest, and similar things.
Quoniam nocent neruis, et contrahunt eos.	Because they harm nerves, and make them jump.
Et non ponas super uulnus aliquid frigidum omnino: quoniam substantia neruorum est frigida, et continuatio eius est cum cerebro, quod est sublimius membrorum: et sit illud quo curatur ex medicinis lene, sicut calx lota cum aqua dulci aliquotiens infusa cum oleo, aut cum oleo rosato, et tuthia, quando abluitur etiam cum aqua dulci: et reliqui lapides minerales, secundum hunc modum, et unguenta humida.	And do not put anything cold on the wound at all: because the substance of nerves is cold, and its continuation is with the brain, which is a superior member: so let the cure be carried out by doctors using lard, such as lard mixed with sweet water a few times with oil, or rosewater, and myrrh, when it is washed away with sweet water: and also mineral stones, in this way, and moist ointments.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, tunc administra suturam: aut coarta labia eius cum puluillis.	If, however, the wound is large, then apply a stitch: or cover its edges with a powder.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for yourself, until you heal.
Si uero uulneri est profunditas, aut accidit in eo sinus in inferiori parte eius, in quo iam aggregatur pus, tunc perfora ipsum in magis depresso loco in eo.	If, however, the depth of the wound or an injury has occurred in a lower part of it, where pus has already accumulated: then pierce it in a more depressed place.
Quod si iam incisa est in uulnere arteria, et consecutus est sanguinem eius fluxus: tunc separa, uel seca eam, et liga ipsam: aut cauteriza eam, si prouocat necessitas ad illud.	If, however, an incision has been made on a nerve, and it is followed by a flow of blood: then separate it, or dry it up, and tie it up: or burn it if necessity dictates to do so.
Si autem iam incidit spondiles gutturis, aut totum, et saluatae sunt alhaudegi: tunc aggrega labia cutis cum sutura super cannam gutturis, et non tangas guttur, imo aequa ipsum, et reduc ipsum super figuram naturalem.	If, however, an injury has occurred to the spine with a lump, or to all of it, and it seems that it will not recover on its own: then join the skin edges together with stitches above the lump, and do not touch the lump, but bring it back to its natural shape.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti, et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot.	Then tighten the wound with a strip, and leave it for several days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis in quibus est stipticitas et exiccatio, donec sanetur.	Then treat the wound with ointment when there is inflammation and drying out, until it heals.
Si autem uulnus iam fecit impressionem in osse, tunc perquire ipsum: tunc si in ipso sunt fragmenta ossis, extrahe ea omnia, aut quae potes ex eis: et quod non praeparatur, dimitte illud, donec putrescat uulnus, et separetur et alleuietur egressio eius.	If, however, the fracture has already made an impression on the bone, then examine it: if there are any fragments of bone, remove them all, or as many as you can: and if it is not prepared, leave it until the tendon rots, and separates and heals by itself.
Quod si uulnus fuerit recens, tunc pulueriza super ipsum puluerem quem narraui.	If the tendon is still fresh, then powder it with the powder which you have made ready.
Si autem uidetur in uulnere os, et fit Fistula: tunc cura ipsam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.	If it is a tendon that has been injured and has become a fistula: then treat it with what is mentioned in the chapter on it.
Â¶ De uulnere in Spatulis.	On Tendons in Spatel
Caput LXXXVI.	Chapter LXVIII.
SI Est percussio lanceae, aut cultelli: et uides eius profunditatem, tunc considera.	If the wound is caused by a lance or knife, and you can see its depth, then examine it carefully.
Si ergo ex uulnere egreditur uentositas, quando anhelat ex eo infirmus, tunc scias, quia uulnus est mortale.	If, however, a wound from a tendon makes one weak and breathless, then know that the tendon is mortal.
Quod si non fuerit ei profunditas, et est recens cum sanguine suo: tunc non ponas in eo a prima hora puluerem, neque stringas ipsum, ut non retineatur sanguis in profunditate eius, et reuertatur ad cor, et interficiat infirmum: sed pone in ipso unguentum attractiuum, et solue ipsum in die bis.	If it is not deep and is fresh with its blood: then do not put powder on it at first, nor tighten it up, so that the blood does not stay in its depth and flow into the heart, causing weakness: but put on the wound an attractive ointment, and leave it for two days.
Si uero unguentum non est tibi praesens, tunc pone in orificio uulneris cotum uetustum, ut sugat illud quod egreditur de eo ex humiditatibus: et fac ut dormiat infirmus super uulnus, ut currat quod aggregatur in eo.	If, however, you do not have ointment ready, then place on the wound a clean cloth to wet it, so that it sucks up what comes out of it from the moisture: and let the sick person sleep on the tendon so that the gangrenous matter gathered in it is cured.
Si uero iam praeterierint uulneri tres dies, aut plures, et non accidit infirmo spasmus, neque tremor cordis malus, neque strictura in anhelitu, et uides reliquas dispositiones eius bonas: tunc scias, quia uulnus est saluum.	If, however, the wound has passed three or more days without any sickness, no spasms of the heart, no breathlessness, and no other symptoms of illness, then know that the tendon is healed.
Cura ergo ipsum et cum liciniis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with care, and with the rest of the cure, until it heals.
Si uero excusatur sanatio eius, et iam aperitur semper, tunc scias, quia iam factum est Fistula.	If indeed the healing is excised and the wound is always opened, then you know that a fistula has already been made.
Cura ergo ipsam ex capitulo suo.	So then treat the cure from its own chapter.
Et si uulnus est ex incisione ensis, aut cultelli, et est simplex in superficie pectoris, aut dorsi: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit ex sutura, si est magnum: aut cum puluere, si est paruum.	If the wound is from an incision of a sword or chisel and it is simple on the surface of the chest or back, then treat the cure with what preceded it from the stitch, if it is large; or with dust, if it is small.
Si autem iam fecit impressionem in osse, et incidit ex eo frusta: tunc inquire uulnus, et propera ad extrahendum illa frusta, si sunt separata.	If it has already made an impression on the bone and incised from it with a twig, then inquire about the fracture and approach from outside to remove those twigs if they are separate.
Si uero non sunt separata, tunc dimitte ea, donec putrefiat uulnus, alleuiatur enim extractio eorum.	If they are not separate, then let them go until the bone rots away, for the extraction of them will be easier.
Reliquorum autem uulnerum accidentium in reliquis membris iudicium in curatione, est iudicium eius quod diximus.	But as for the remaining wounds and accidents in the other members, the judgment in the cure of them is the judgment that we have spoken of.
Â¶ De uulneribus Ventris, et exitu intestini, et exitura eorum.	Regarding the wounds of the belly and the exit of the intestines and the emerging of them.
Caput LXXXVII.	Chapter LVII.
Disruptio quae accidit uentri, est magna, et media, et parua.	The rupture that happens in the belly is great and medium and small.
Ex magna igitur quandoque egreditur intestinum, aut numerus intestinorum.	So then when the large one exits or the number of intestines.
Quare fit intromissio eorum, et eorum sutura uehementior et difficilior.	Why does it happen and why is the suture of them more severe and difficult?
Et disruptio parua etiam fit difficilis ex modo alio.	And the small one also becomes difficult from a different mode.
Sequitur ergo, ut sit reductio eorum difficilior, si non properas in intromissione sua ad locum suum statim: quoniam inflatur, aperitur, et ingrossatur: quare fit difficilis introitus eius.	So then, if you do not approach the place of its entry immediately, follow this, so that it does not become difficult to reduce them, because it inflates, opens up, and thickens out: why is the entrance to it difficult?
Propter hoc ergo fit melior disruptionum disruptio media: quoniam cum ea non fit difficilis reductio intestini, sicut fit dissicilis in his duabus speciebus.	Therefore, because of this, it is better to have a medium disruption; for when the rupture is not difficult to reduce the intestine, as it is difficult in these two species.
Scias, quod sutura uenris est secundum quatuor modos.	Know that the suture of the belly is according to four modes.
Duae suturae communes conueniunt in sutura uentris, et in sutura reliquorum uulnerum corporis: et duae suturae aliae proprie communicant reliquis uulneribus.	The two common sutures meet together in the suture of the belly and in the suture of the other wounds of the body; and the other two sutures meet by themselves for the remaining wounds.
Verumtamen sunt magis propriae cum sutura uentris: et ego narro tibi unamquamque cum expositione, et declaratione.	Indeed, they are more appropriate with the sewing of the eye; and I will tell you both times, with explanation and demonstration.
Dico ergo, quia quando uulnus est paruum, et egreditur ex eo aliquid ex intestino, et fit difficile reducere ipsum: tunc illud est propter unum duorum modorum.	I say then, because when the wound is small, and something comes out of the intestines, and difficult to reduce; then it is for two reasons.
Aut propter paruitatem disruptionis, sicut diximus: Aut quoniam in intestino est inflatio propter frigus aeris.	Or because of the size of the wound, as we have said: Or because there is an inflammation in the intestines because of cold air.
Quando ergo illud est ita, tunc oportet ut calefacias ipsum, ita ut submergas spongiam, aut pannum humidum in aqua tepida sola.	When then should this be so? Then you should heat the body, so that you dip a sponge, or a wet cloth in warm water alone.
Aut decoquas in aqua squinantum, et cyperum, et spicam, et embroces cum ea intestinum, donec resoluatur inflatio.	Or you should cook it in water with squash, celery, and pepper, and tie it with the intestines, until the inflammation resolves.
Quandoque facit illud uinum in quo est stipticitas: et est melius quam aqua sola in resolutione inflationis.	When then does the eye make a stitch? And it is better than water alone in resolving inflammation.
Cum ergo uides inflationem iam resolui, tunc humecta intestinum cum aqua in qua decocta est altea, aut malua.	When then do you see that inflammation has already resolved? Then wet the intestines with the water in which it was cooked, or make it salt.
Nam per illud alleuiatur introitus eius cum re parua.	For through this the entrance is relieved when it is small.
Si autem excusatur reditus eius post hanc curationem, tunc finde in disruptione parum, cum instrumento quo secantur hemorrhoides.	But if there is no return after this treatment, then find in the disruption a little bit, with the instrument with which they are cut.
Et curatio prima est melior quando praeparatur, quam sectio: et non fit coactio ad secandum post necessitatem et defectum instrumenti.	And the first cure is better when it is prepared, than the incision; and there is no coercion to cut after necessity and defect of the instrument.
Sit pars eius una quae est torta, acuta, et pars eius altera non acuta, et extremitas subtilis non sit cum subtilitate Spatumilis, imo sit obtusior parumper: et est illa quae similatur caiada, sicut uides.	Be it a part of his eye that is twisted, acute, and another part that is not acute, and the edge is not sharp with the sharpness of the blade, but rather somewhat blunter: and this is what resembles a scar, as you see.
Cum ergo amplificatur uulnus, et ingreditur intestinum, tunc oportet, ut sit reductio eius secundum formam suam naturalem in loco suo sibi proprio, si possibile est super illud: quoniam est melius.	When then does the wound increase and enters into the intestines? Then you should reduce it to its own natural form in its own place, if possible against that: because it is better.
Quando uero disruptio est ampla in inferiori parte uentris: tunc oportet ut facias iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et pone crura sua altiora capite suo.	When then is the incision wide in the lower part of the eye? Then you should lay the sick person on their back, and raise their legs from the head.
Et si est in superiore parte uentris, tunc pone caput eius, et pectus ipsius altiora quam eius inferiora.	And if it is in the upper part of the foot, then put its head, and the chest of him higher than his lower.
Et similiter si est disruptio in una duarum partium uentris, tunc pone intentionem tuam, et tuam considerationem semper in hoc, ut pars in qua est uulnus sit altior parte altera.	And likewise if the rupture is in one of the two parts of the foot, then put your intention, and always have your attention on this, so that the part where the wound is sits higher than the other side.
Et ita oportet, ut admimistres illud in uulneribus magnis, et in uulneribus mediis.	And so it should be, that you admit this into large wounds and moderate wounds.
In uulneribus autem paruis, pone illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	In wounds, but small ones, put it according to what is prepared for you.
Deinde fac ut sit praesens inter manus tuas minister pius, qui teneat disruptionem totam manu sua: et aggrega labia eius.	Then make it present between your hands that faithful minister who holds the whole wound in his hand: and spread the lips of it.
Deinde detege ex ea ei qui sequitur suturam aliquid post aliquid: et iste est modus suturae communis unius.	Then discover from him who follows a thread something after something: and this is the method of common surgery of one thread.
Et est, ut accipias acum, aut numerum acuum secundum quantitatem amplitudinis uulneris.	And it is, so that you take it now, or number now according to the quantity of the width of the wound.
Deinde dimitte ab extremitate disruptionis quantitatem digiti anularis, id est, medici: et fige acum unam praeter quod intromittas in eam filum in duabus extremitatibuis cutis, cum duabus extremitatibus sifac quod est sub cute ab interioribus, donec facias eam penetrare ab alia parte, et tu iam aggregasti duas extremitates cutis, et duas extremitates sifac: et fiunt quatuor ordines.	Then let go from the end of the wound a quantity of the finger of the hand, that is, doctor: and fix now one except that you introduce into it a thread in two ends of the skin, with two ends of sifah which is under the skin from inside, until you make it penetrate from the other side, and you have already joined the two ends of the skin, and the two ends of sifac: and there are four orders.
Deinde stringe cum filo duplo in circumitu acus aliquotiens a duabus partibus simul, quousque sint aggregata duo labia uulneris aggregatione decenti.	Then tighten with double thread around the needle from both sides at the same time, until two lips of the wound are joined together by falling out.
Deinde dimitte grossitudinem digiti etiam, et fige in eis acum aliam: postea reta eam cum filo, sicut fecisti cum acu prima.	Then let go of the bulk of the finger as well, and fix another one in them: then make it straight with a thread, just as you did with the needle first.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum eo quo indiges ex acubus, donec compleas constrictionem uulneris totius.	Therefore do not cease to do this with that which you hold from the needle, until you complete the contraction of the whole wound.
Et sint acus mediae inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem: quoniam acus subtiles ualde uelociter incidunt carnem: et grossae sunt difficilis introitus in cutem: propter illud oportet ut sint mediae in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	And let there be a medium needle between the bulk and the subtility: because the fine needles very quickly strike the flesh: and the coarse ones are difficult to enter into the skin: therefore it is necessary that there be a medium in subtility, and in bulk.
Et non oportet, ut figatur acus in duabus extremitatibus cutis propinquae multum: ut non incidatur caro uelociter, et aperiatur uulnus ante consolidationem sui, et non elongentur etiam cum sutura, ut non prohibeatur uulnus a consolidatione.	And it is not appropriate that the needles be placed in the two extremities of the skin that is very close: so that the flesh does not become infected quickly, and the wound does not open before its own consolidation, and does not also increase with the stitch, so that the wound is not prevented from consolidating.
Deinde incide extremitatem acuum, ut non laedant infirmum apud somnum suum: et pone eis puluillos ex pannis ab omni parte, qui teneant extremitates acuum: et dimitte eos, donec scias quod uulnus iam consolidatum est.	Then cut the ends of the needles so that they do not hurt the sick person while he is sleeping: and place them on the skin's ends with feathers taken from all parts, so that they hold the needle's ends: and let them go until you know that the wound has been consolidated.
Et haec quidem species suturae cum acubus taliter est conuenientior in uulneribus paruis.	And this type of stitch with needles is much more convenient for small wounds.
Quoniam sufficit in sutura eorum acus una, aut duae, aut circiter eas.	For it is sufficient in the stitch of their needles one, or two, or about them.
Sutura autem secunda communis est, ut aggreges cum sutura extremitates quatuor: extremitates, duas cutis, et extremitates duas sifac in uice una, cum acu in qua sit filum inuolutum aequale in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	But the second common stitch is that which joins the four ends: the two ends of the skin, and the two ends of the thread in one piece, with a needle in which the filament is twisted evenly in thickness and subtlety.
Deinde quando penetraueris cum acu has extremitates quatuor, reduc acum a parte a qua incaepisti eadem, ut cadat filum retatum a superiori parte uulneris: ut sit sutura, sicut sutura panni quo stringuntur panni, et pone inter omnem suturam quantitatem grossitudinis digiti minoris.	Then when you pierce with the needle all four ends, bring them together from the part where you started, so that the twisted filament falls from the upper part of the wound: so that the stitch is made, as it were, like a stitch in a cloth which is stretched; and place between each stitch the thickness of the little finger.
Hanc autem suturam sciunt homines.	This type of stitch is known to men.
Et cum hac sutura ego sui uulnus quod acciderat uiro in uentre suo, qui fuerat uulneratus cum cultello, et erat disruptio uulneris maior palmo uno: et exierat ex intestinis circiter duos palmos ex intestino medio, et erat disruptio in medio uentris.	And with this type of stitch I sewed up a wound in the man's stomach, which had been cut with a knife, and it was a large wound of about a palm's width: and about two palms' worth of intestinal tissue came out from within the middle intestine, and there was a break in the middle of the gut.
Reduxi ergo illud postquam stetit intestinum eius extra uulnus xxiiii horis.	So I reduced it after he had stayed without bowel movement for 22 hours.
Consolidatum est ergo uulnus in spacio quod fuit circiter XV dies: et curaui ipsum, et sanatus est: et uixit post illud annis multis, conuersatus in suis dispositionibus.	And so the wound was consolidated after about 15 days: and I cared for it, and he recovered: and he lived many years, thriving in his own affairs.
Et medici iudicauerant, quod non sanaretur.	And the physicians judged that he would not heal.
Et ex miraculo fuit, quod non curaui illud cum unguento.	And by a miracle, I did not cure that with ointment.
Quoniam fui in loco in quo non inueniebatur unguentum, neque aliquid ex medicinis.	For I was in a place where the ointment was not found, and there were no doctors.
Posui ergo super uulnus cotum uetustum bis in die, et assiduaui ablutionem eius cum aqua mellis, donec sanatum est.	So I placed a hot cloth on the wound twice a day and gave it a shower with honey water until it healed.
Duas autem species suturae proprias dicam secundum narrationem sermonis.	I will describe two different types of sutures according to the description of the speech.
Et est, ut incipias cum sutura acuta: et intromittas acum ab exteriori ad interiorem partem.	And so you begin with an acute suture: and insert it from the outside to the inside part.
Cum ergo penetrat acus in cutem, et in lacertum euntem secundum longitudinem et latitudinem totius corporis: dimitte extremitatem sifac in latere in quo intromisisti acum, et fac penetrare in extremitatem aliam ab interiori parte ad exteriorem in extremitate altera mirach.	When the needle enters the skin, and goes into the flesh following the length and width of the whole body: release the end of the thread you inserted from the outside, and let it penetrate the opposite end from the inside to the outside at the opposite end by a little margin.
Cum ergo feceris eam penetrare, tunc fac eam penetrare secundum hoc in eadem hac extremitate mirach ab exteriori parte ad interiorem: et dimitte extremitatem sifac, quae est in hoc latere, et fac penetrare acum in extremitatem alteram ab interiori parte ad exteriorem: et fac penetrare cum penetratione tua qua facis eam penetrare in sifac extremitate mirach, quae est in parte eius, donec penetret in ipsum totum.	When you have made it penetrate, then make it penetrate again in the same end by a little margin from the outside to the inside: and release the end of the thread that you inserted from without, and let it penetrate the opposite end from within to without at the opposite end by a little margin. When you have thus made it penetrate, then make it penetrate again in this same end by a little margin from the outside to the inside: and release the end of the thread that is in this margin, and let it penetrate the other end from within to without: and make it penetrate with your own penetration in this margin, which is in this part, until it penetrates throughout.
Deinde incipe etiam ab hoc eodem latere, et sue ipsum cum extremitate, quae est ex sifac in latere alio, et extrahe acum ex cute quam penetrauit.	Then also begin from this same margin, and take the thread with the end that is out of the skin: and bring it out from without at the opposite end, taking it from within to without: and make it come out from the skin through the end that has come out: and then take the thread that comes out of the skin, and bring it back again to its place.
Deinde reduc eam in illam cutem, et sue extremitatem sifac, quae est in latere alio, cum hac extremitate mirach: et extrahe eam ex cute quae est ex parte eius, et fac illud uice una, et alia: et fac illud uice post uicem, usquequo suas extrinsecum totum secundum illud exemplum.	Then also reduce it in that skin, and take the end of the thread that is out of the skin, and bring it back again to its place with the opposite end: and let it come out from the skin through the margin that is out: and then take it that comes out from the skin, and bring it back again to its place; and make it come out from the skin through the other margin: and then take it that comes out from without, and bring it back again to its place, making it go in and out twice: and then make it go out from without entirely according to this example.
Et summa huius suturae, est ut suas sutura pellipariorum qua suunt pelles: ita ut suas sifac uice una ex parte una extremitate cutis: et ut dimittas eam uice alia ex parte alia, donec compleas.	And the upper thread of this suture is so that it may be sewn with the skin as it is done with its thread: in such a way that its thread goes from one side to the other end of the skin; and so that you let go of it on one side with one thread and let it go on the other side with another, until you are finished.
Secunda species suturae propriae, quam dixit Gale nus.	The second kind of suture is its own, which Gallenus said.
Iste eius sermo narratus est, ut suas eam secundum similitudinem, qua suunt eas quidam medicantium, ita quod aggregant omnem partem ad comparem suam conuenientem per naturam: et applicant extremitatem sifac ad eius aliam extremitatem, et extremitatem mirach ad extremitatem eius aliam.	This speech of his is told, that he may apply the second one according to the similarity with which some physicians sew them, so that they collect all the part by nature: and applying the end of the skin to the other end, and the end of the thread to the other end.
Et illud fit secundum quod narro tibi.	And this is how I tell you.
Oportet ut figas acum in extremitatem mirach propinquam tibi ab exteriori parte, et facias eam penetrare ad interiorem in eo solo: et dimittas duas extremitates sifac.	It is necessary that you fix this now at the end of the skin near you from the outside part, and let it penetrate into the inside with it alone: and let go of the two ends of the thread.
Deinde reuolue acum, et fac eam penetrare ab exteriori parte ad interiorem in duas extremitates sifac, scilicet utrinque.	Then you turn this around again, and let it penetrate from the outside part to the inside in two ends of the thread, that is to say, on both sides.
Deinde reuolue utrasque, etiam fac penetrare utrasque ab interiori usque ad exteriorem, in duas extremitates mirach alias, quae sunt in latere opposito.	Then you turn both around again, and let them penetrate from the inside to the outside as well, in two ends of the thread, that is to say, on both sides: and turn both ends of the skin from the inside to the outside in two opposite parts.
Et iste modus suturae est melior sutura communi facili, et est sutura cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And this way of sewing is better than the common easy one, and it is a suture which the memory before it reminds.
Iste est ergo sermo Galeni etiam.	This is therefore the speech of Galen as well.
Et dixerunt quidam.	And some said.
Retificatur sutura uentris cum duabus acubus.	The suture of the foot with two toes.
Quod est, ut intromittas in eis utrisque filum unum: et incipe cum intromissione acus, ex eo quod est apud te, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, secundum suturam eorum qui suunt coria aequaliter.	That is, so that you introduce one thread into both of them: and begin with the introduction of the nail, since it is with you, and let it penetrate up to the other side, according to the suture of those who sew their nails evenly.
Et scias, quod quando disruptio est in medio uentris: tunc sutura eius est difficilior quam reliquorum locorum uentris.	And you should know that when the rupture is in the middle of the foot: then the suture of it is more difficult than that of the other places of the foot.
Iudicium uero medicationis uulneris, est iudicium reliquorum uulnerum.	Judgment of true medicine is the judgment of the wound, and judgment of the remainder of the wound.
Quod est, quia quando tu consequeris uulnus recens cum sanguine suo, antequam alteret ipsum aer: et reducis intestinum, et suis ipsum, et aptas ipsum: tunc pone super puluerem incarnatiuum.	That is, because when you sever a fresh wound with its blood, before it is disturbed by air: and reduce the entrails, and itself, and make itself whole: then put on the poultice of meat.
Quod si aer iam alterauit uulnus: tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, quae sunt tibi praesentia, donec faciant pus: et cadant fila, et consolidentur sifac, et mirach.	That is, if the air has already disturbed the wound: then put on a certain ointment, which is present with you, until it makes pus: and fall off the hair, and harden the sifac, and shine.
Deinde cura illud sicut est curatio reliquorum uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then care for that as if the cure of the remainder of the wound, until it is healed.
Si autem non sunt tibi praesentes medicinae, tunc pone super ipsum statim, exquo incipit emittere pus, cotum uetus: et permuta ipsum bis in die, sicut docui te, donec sanetur.	But if you do not have the medicines with you, then put on it immediately, so that it may begin to emit pus, and change the poultice every day as I have taught you, until it is healed.
Nam tu non indiges medicatione alia in pluribus dispositionibus, quando uulnera sunt simplicia.	For you do not need other medicine in many cases, when wounds are simple.
Si autem times, quod communicet uulnus membris principalibus in laesione, tunc oportet ut submergas lanam lenem in oleo temperatae caliditatis, aut in oleo rosato: et pone ipsam in circumitu locorum quae sunt inter inguina, et sub ascellas.	But if you should happen to injure a member of the body with a wound, then dip the wool in oil of moderate heat, or in rose oil: and put it on in the vicinity of the places that are between the thighs, and under the armpits.
Quod si sentit dolorem, aut punctiones, aut putrefactionem in intestinis suis (nam multotiens accidit illud) tunc clisteriza ipsum cum uino stiptico, nigro, tepido: praecipue si putredo iam peruenit in intestino, et facta est exitura penetrans usque ad concauitatem eius.	That is, if it feels pain, or punctures, or corruption in its entrails (for this often happens) then cleanse the wound with wine mixed with rust, black, and warm: especially if putridness has already set in the intestin
Et scias, quod illud quod est ex intestino grosso, est facilioris sanationis: et quod ex eis est ex subtili, difficilioris sanationis.	And you should know that what comes from the large intestine is easier to heal: and that which comes from the small intestine is more difficult to heal.
Intestinum autem quod nominatur Ieiunum, non suscipit sanationem ex uulnere quod accidit in eo omnino: et illud est propter multitudinem eius, quod est ex uenis, et magnitudine earum, et propter subtilitatem corporis eius, et propinquitatem ipsius naturae neruorum.	But the intestine which is called the jejunum does not accept healing from a wound that has occurred in it at all: and it is because of the multitude of its turns, that it is from intestines, and its greatness, and because of the lightness of its body, and because of the closeness of its nerves.
Si autem illud quod procedit ex uulnere est zirbum, et consequeris ipsum recens: reduc ipsum secundum reductionem tuam, qua reducis intestina aequaliter.	But if that which proceeds from the ulna is a curl, and you have found it so: reduce it according to your reduction, as you reduce the intestines equally.
Si uero praeteriit ei spacium, et iam factum est uiride, aut nigrum: tunc oportet ut stringas ipsum cum filo supra locum qui denigratus est ex eo, ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If, however, the space has been passed over, and the wound is already well, or black: then it is necessary that you tie it with a thread above the place which has been discolored from it, so that the flow of blood does not occur.
In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.	For in the curl there are veins and arteries.
Deinde incide quod est praeter illud ligamentum, et pone duas extremitates fili pendentes ex inferiori parte uulneris extra ipsum: ut alleuietur super te attractio eius, et extractio ipsius apud casum zirbi, et emissionem pus uulneris.	Then cut what is beyond that ligament, and put two ends of the thread hanging from the lower part of the wound outside the skin: so that it will be eased on you by its attraction, and extraction of it at the edge of the curl, and emission of pus from the wound.
Â¶ Rememoratio uulneris quod accidit in Intestino.	Remembrance of the wound which happened in the intestine.
Quando accidit disruptio in Intestino, et est parua: tunc possibile est, ut restauretur in quibusdam hominibus: propterea, quia ego uidi qui fuit uulneratus in uentre suo cum percussione lanceae, et erat uulnus a dextra stomachi, et antiquatum est uulnus: et factum Fistula, et exiuit ex eo egestio, et uentositas.	When the disruption has occurred in the intestine, and it is small: then it is possible that it is restored in some men: for I saw who was wounded in his belly with a lance thrust, and it was a curl on the right side of the stomach, and it was an old curl: and there was made a Fistula, and came out from it a discharge, and a pus.
Posui ergo curationem, usque quod ego non fui confisus in sanatione eius: neque cessaui subtiliare ipsum, donec sanatus est, et consolidatus est locus.	Then I applied the cure, until I was not confident in its cure: and I did not hesitate to examine it, until it was healed, and the place had hardened.
Postquam ego uidi locum iam consolidatum, timui super infirmum, quod accideret super infirmum accidens malum in uentre suo: et non accidit ei ex illo accidens malum.	After I saw the place now consolidated, I feared on the illness, that might happen to the intestine of his own evil accident: and it did not occur to him from that evil accident.
Et remansit in melioribus dispositionibus suis, comedens et bibens, et futuens, et intrauit balneum, et exercitatus est in dietis suis.	And he remained in better health of his, eating and drinking, and enjoying himself, and entering into a bath, and exercising in his walks.
Et iam dixerunt quidam experimentatorum, quia quando accidit in Intestino uulnus, et est paruum: tunc oportet ut ligetur secundum hunc modum.	And some of the experimenters said, because when it happened in the intestine a curl, and it was small: then it should be tied according to this way.
Et est, ut accipias formicas magnorum capitum.	And it is, that you receive big ants' heads.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, et pone formicam unam ex eis quae habeant os apertum super duo labia uulneris.	Then take two pieces of flesh from the wound and place one of them on top of two wounds.
Cum ergo capit super ea, et stringit os suum, abscinde caput eius, adhaeret enim, et non soluitur.	And when he has come up to it, and has tied his mouth, cut off the head, for it is attached, and does not release itself.
Deinde pone formicam aliam prope primam, et non cesses facere illud cum formica post formicam secundum quantitatem uulneris totius.	Then place another fly near the first one, and do not stop doing this with the fly after the second amount of wound on the whole body.
Deinde reduc ipsum, et sue uulnus.	Then reduce the wound, and burn it.
Illa enim capita remanent annexa in Intestino, donec cibetur Intestinum, et sanetur, et non accidat infirmo nocumentum penitus.	That head remains attached to the intestine until the food reaches the intestines, and heals, and does not cause any harm to the whole body.
Et iam possibile est, ut ligetur Intestinum etiam cum filo subtili: quod abstersum est ex intestino animalis, annexo cum eo postquam intromittitur in acum.	And it is possible that the intestine be tied as well with a thin thread: which, if torn from the intestine, is attached to it when it is inserted into the cavity.
Et est, ut accipias extremitatem huius fili ex intestino, et excarnetur multum.	And it is, that you take the end of this thread from the intestine, and burn off a lot of it.
Deinde liga in extremitate eius filum lini subtile inuolutum.	Then tie the end of this thread with a thin woven thread.
Deinde intromitte illud filum in acum, et sue cum eo intestinum.	Then insert that thread into the cavity, and burn it with the intestines.
Deinde reduc ipsum in disruptionem.	Then reduce the wound to the breaking point.
Et iste modus suturae cum formicis et intestino, non est nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	And this method of suturing with flies and intestine is not worth much except as a second aid and temporary measure.
Scias, uulnus quod est magnum, amplum, praecipue si est in uno intestinorum gracilium: tunc non est ingenium nisi subtiliatio, neque est eius sanatio omnino.	You should know that the wound is great and wide, especially if it is in one of the small intestines: then it is not a skill except with a delicate thread, and its healing is not at all certain.
Â¶ De cura Zuchemen, et Fistularum.	Of the care of Zuchium and fistulas.
Caput LXXXVIII.	Head LXXXVIII.
Scias, quod omne uulnus, aut apostema quando ueterascit et antiquatur, et fit ulcus, et non consolidatur, et emittit pus semper, et non abscinditur: tunc nominatur uniuersaliter in quocunque membro fuerit Fistula, et nos nominamus ipsum Zuchemen.	You should know that every wound, or bruise when it has healed and become old, and has turned into a sore, and does not heal, and always discharges pus, and does not close: then it is called universally a fistula wherever it may be in the body, and we call it Zuchium.
Et Fistula quidem est secundum ueritatem nodatio filtrata, dura, alba: cum qua non est dolor, cui est concauitas pennae auis: et propter illud nominant eam quidam Risati, id est, pennam.	And a fistula is, by its nature, a filtered, hard, white, sensitive, and painful finger: and for that reason it is called by some risati, that is, a finger.
Et est in quibusdam horis humida, quae emittit pus.	It is in some hours humid, which emits pus.
Et fortasse scinditur humiditas in quibusdam horis.	And perhaps the moisture splits in some hours.
Et quandoque est haec humiditas multa, et est pauca: et est grossa, et est subtilis.	And sometimes this moisture is great, and it is little; and it is thick, and it is thin.
Et ego iam praemisi in diuisione, tunc cum dixi uulnera, quod omne ulcus quod non sanatur, neque nascitur in eo caro, non est illud nisi propter unam nouem caussarum.

Quod si est ex Fistulis aliqua cuius profunditas non peruenit ad haec loca quae dixi: et speras, et confidis in curatione eius, et uis peruenire ad cognitionem illius, tunc accipe tentam ex aere, aut ferro, si Fistula tendit secundum rectitudinem, et perquire eam cum ipsa.	If it is from the fistulas of which the depth does not reach these places that I have said: and you hope and trust in the cure of them, and you see to know them, then take hold of them with an attempt out of air or iron, if the fistula extends according to rightness, and inquire into it with itself.
Si autem in Fistula est tortuositas, tunc inuestiga eam cum tenta de plumbo subtili.	But if there is a tortuosity in the fistula, then investigate it with a thin lead tent.
Quoniam plumbum cum lenitate sui corporis alleuiatur, et curuatur circa tortuositatem.	For lead, with its own body, mildens itself, and cares for the tortuosity.
Quod si Fistula est habens orificia multa, non est tibi possibile ut significes super eam cum tenta.	That if the fistula has many openings, it is not possible for you to indicate over it with a tent.
Clisteriza ergo ex eis orificium ex orificiis suis.	So that it may spread out from its own openings. And therefore it spreads out from its own openings:
Nam humiditas qua clisterizas ipsum, uadit uersus orificia alia, et currit ex eis.	For the humidity which clisterizes itself, turns towards other openings, and runs out of them.
Deinde exquisite inquire secundum quem modum est tibi possibile: ut cognoscas quod illic est os, aut neruus, et est Fistulae concauitas longinqua, aut propinqua: aut est Fistula una cui sunt orificia multa, et sta super totum illud, cum summa fortitudinis tuae: cum interrogatione tua, qua interrogas infirmum, et inuentione doloris apud compressionem cum manu tua super locum, et similibus ex significationibus et caussis accidentibus apostemati.	Then ask yourself how it is possible for you to know: that you may know that there is an opening, or a nerve, and that the fistula extends far away, or close by: or that the fistula is one which has many openings, and stands over all that, with great strength of yours: with your own question, by which you question the sick, and by the finding out of pain at the compression with your hand on the place, and similar indications and causes of accidents apostemati.
Cum ergo steteris super omnia illa statione uera, tunc uade ad curationem secundum confidentiam: et est, ut consideres tunc, si est Fistula propinqua apparens, aut in loco saluo longinquo a iunctura, aut a neruo, aut arteria, aut uena, aut uno locorum quae dixi tibi: tunc seca Fistulam secundum quod praemissum est ex narratione mea, et aufer quod est in ea ex filtratione, et carnibus corruptis, quod nascitur in orificio eius ex carne, aut thelul, et similibus: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	And when you stand over all that with a true station, then go forward to cure according to confidence: and is, as you consider then, if it is a fistula close by appearing, or in a place of health far away from the joint, or from a nerve, or an artery, or a vein, or one of the places which I have said to you: then dry up the fistula according to what has been premised in my narration, and take away whatever is in it from filtration, and corrupt flesh, which comes out at its opening from flesh, or the membrane, and similar things: and cure it, until it is healed.
Si autem Fistula est longinquae profunditatis, et est secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut seces eam in profundo quantum est tibi possibile.	But if the fistula is of a long depth, and extends according to rightness: then it should be separated from its depth as much as is possible for you.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex omnibus carnibus eius corruptis.	Then wash it with all its corrupted flesh.
Deinde administra licinia inuoluta in medicinis acutis: et intromitte ea usque ad concauitatem Fistulae quam comprehendisti cum ferro: fac cum ea illud aliquotiens, donec corrodat medicina acuta totum quod remansit in concauitate Fistulae ex corruptione.	Then administer the poultice of fresh meat mixed with acute medicines: and introduce it until you reach the fistula which you have confined with iron: do this several times, until the acute medicine has completely corroded what remained in the concavity of the fistula from the corruption.
Deinde restaura ipsam cum unguentis quae generant carnem sanam, donec sanetur.	Then restore it with a unguent that generates healthy flesh, until it heals.
Si uero non sanatur per illud, tunc cauteriza ipsam secundum quod narrauimus.	If, however, it does not heal through this, then caustic it according to what we have described.
Si ergo caussa Fistulae est os, et certificatur apud te illud: tunc inquire ipsum, et seca ipsum secundum quod narraui tibi: si non prohibet te aliquid ex uena, aut neruo, aut membro principali, sicut diximus.	If, however, the cause of the fistula is an opening, and you can certify this for yourself: then examine it, and cut it as we have told you: if it does not prevent you from anything of new flesh, or nerve, or main member, as we have said.
Si ergo detegitur tibi os, et est in eo quiddam corruptionis, et nigredinis: tunc rade ipsum, donec auferatur corruptio eius tota.	If, however, it is detected for you an opening, and there is some corruption and blackening in it: then shave it, until the whole corruption has been removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the flesh with what heals the flesh, until it heals.
Quod si non sanatur, et emittat pus sicut faciebat: tunc scias, quod tu non peruenisti ad totam eradicationem corruptionis.	That if it does not heal, and discharges pus as it did before: then know that you have not achieved total eradication of the corruption.
Detege ergo super illud secundo, et exquisite fac rasionem eius, et mundificationem ipsius cum ultima fortitudine tua.	Then detect on top of it again, and carefully examine its rasion, and wash it with your final strength.
Deinde restaura ipsum.	Then restore the flesh.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est: et si non, tunc scias quod illa corruptio est in profunditate longinqua corporis, quam non es consecutus.	If, however, it heals, that is good: and if not, then know that that corruption is far from the body, which you have not achieved.
Non est ergo tibi in ea ingenium, nisi dimittere ipsam naturae.	Not therefore is your craft in it, except to discharge it into nature.
Quod si corruptum est os paruum, et est possibile tibi, attrahe ipsum cum forficibus subtilibus quae conueniunt ad illud.	That if the corruption is in a small opening, and it is possible for you, attract it with subtle forceps that are appropriate for it.
Si autem sunt ossa multa, tunc exquisite fac attractionem eorum omnium, neque dimittas ex eis aliquid cum tua fortitudine.	If, however, there are many bones, then carefully examine all of their attractions, and do not discharge any of them with your strength.
Si uero contrarietatem facit tibi aliquid ex humiditatibus, et non est in incisione eorum timor, uel error: tunc incide illas humiditates et carnes, si sunt illic, et libera ossa.	If, however, it gives you a contrary force from any humidity, and there is no timor (fear) or error in cutting them: then cut the humidities and flesh, if they are there, and free the bones.
Si uero non est tibi praeparatio auferendi ossa ex hora tua, tunc pone super uulnus quod putrefaciat ipsum: et dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat quod est in circumitu illorum ossium ex carnibus et humiditatibus.	If indeed you are not prepared to remove the bones from your hour, then place them upon a branch that will decay them; and let them go, until they decay as they are in the vicinity of their bones from flesh and moisture.
Et custodi uulnus ut non consolidetur.	And guard the limb so that it does not harden.
Et constringatur sectio quam tu secuisti in operatione tua.	And constrict the section which you followed in your operation.
Imo pone super ipsum, si times, cotum submersum sulfure trito cum oleo: aut cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio, aut aliquo unguentorum uiridium.	Then place over the bones, if needed, the triaded sulfur drowned with oil: or the submerged in Egyptian ointment, or some ointments of violets.
Nam quando putrefient illae scilicet humiditates, et separantur ex eis ossa, alleuiatur ablatio eorum, et ipsorum attractio.	For when those certain humors decay and separate from the bones, the removal of them is eased, and their attraction is avoided.
Si autem est os unum magnum, sicut os cruris, aut os coxae, et similia illis, et quod ex eo corruptum est, est pars magna: tunc rade ipsum rasione ultima, donec auferatur illa nigredo et corruptio.	If, however, there is a large bone, such as the femur or ilium, and that which is corrupted from it is a part of great size, then shave it with the last razor, until the corruption and blackness are removed.
Deinde restaura uulnus.	Then restore the limb.
Si uero quod est in eo corruptum, est pars magna, et corruptio iam consecuta est medullam ossis, tunc necesse est serrare ipsum, et incidere ipsum totum usque ad locum, ubi peruenit corruptio: tunc cura ipsum, donec consolidetur.	If, however, what is corrupted within it is a part of great size, and the corruption has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to cut it off, and to incise it all the way to the place where the corruption ends: then care for it, until it hardens.
Et ego narro tibi zuken, quae accidit uiro in crure suo: ut ponas ipsam exemplum et adiutorium super operationem tuam.	And I will tell you the story of the man who happened to have a leg injury: so that it may be an example and aid for your operation.
Fuit uir iuuenis aetate circiter triginta annos, cui accidit dolor in crure suo, a caussa quae mota est super ipsum intra corpus, id est, ab interioribus, donec peruenerunt materiae ad crus, et apostematum est apostemate magno: et non fuit ei caussa extrinseca.	He was a young man of about thirty years of age, to whom it happened that there was pain in his leg, because of something which had moved within the body, that is, from the inside, until it reached the limb, and there was a great swelling: and it was not caused by an external cause.
Extensum est ergo cum eo tempus cum errore medicorum, donec apertum est apostema, et concurrerunt cum eo materiae multae.	So he remained with that error of the physicians until the swelling had opened up, and many materials had entered with him.
Et postposita est curatio eius, donec fistulatum est crus, et facta sunt in eo orificia multa: quae omnia emittebant pus, et humiditates corporis.	And his treatment was postponed until the leg had been bound up, and many openings had been made in it: all of which discharged pus and body humors.
Curauit ergo ipsum multitudo medicorum circiter duos annos, et non fuit in eo sapiens in arte manus, donec uocatus sum, et uidi crus eius, et materias quae currebant ex illis orificiis cursu magno: etiam omne uiri corpus iam tabuerat, et color eius citrinus erat.	So many doctors had gathered around him for about two years, and there was not one wise in the art of surgery among them until I was called in, and I saw his foot, and the materials that were flowing out of those orifices with a great flow: also the whole body of a man was already covered with poultices, and his color was citrine.
Intromisi ergo tentam in uno locorum orificiorum, et peruenit tenta ad os.	So I entered one of the orifices, and my hand came to the jaw.
Deinde perscrutatus sum orificia omnia: et inueni ea peruenire ad se inuicem ex omnibus partibus cruris.	Then I scrutinized all the orifices; and I found them all flowing into one another from all parts of the limb.
Properaui ergo, et secui super unum illorum orificiorum, donec detexi partem ossis: et inueni ipsum corruptum: quod iam corrosum erat, et denigratum, et putruerat, et perforatum erat, donec penetrauerat usque ad medullam.	Then I stopped up and followed one of those orifices, until I found part of the bone: and I saw that it was corroded: which had already been corroded, and had become decayed, and had holes in it, as far as it penetrated into the marrow.
Serraui ergo quod detectum est mihi, et praeparatum ex osse corrupto.	So I closed up what I had found, and I prepared it from corrupt bone.
Et deputaui, quod non esset in osse nisi illa corruptio, quam abscidi, et serraui.	And I left out what was not in the bone except that corruption, which I did not cut away, and I closed it up.
Et ego iam eradicaueram eam.	And I have now eradicated it.
Deinde posui restaurationem uulneris cum medicinis consolidatiuis spacio longo.	Then I placed a patch of wound healing with long-consolidated medicine.
Et non est consolidatum.	But it was not consolidated.
Deinde tentaui, et detexi super os secundo supra detectionem primam: et inueni corruptionem continuam cum osse: et serraui quod apparuit mihi etiam ex illa corruptione.	Then I probed again, and I found another bone above the first detection: and I saw continuing corruption with bone; and I closed it up, for what seemed to me also come out of that corruption.
Deinde conatus sum restaurationem eius.	Then I tried to restore it.
Et non est restauratum.	But it was not restored.
Detexi ergo super ipsum iterum, et non cessaui incidere os particulatim, et conari restaurationem eius: et non est restauratum, donec incidi ex osse circiter palmum unum, et extraxi illud cum medulla sua.	I probed again on the limb, and I did not cease to cut bone by bit, and I tried to restore it; and it was not restored until I cut out from the bone a little palm, and I took that out with its marrow.
Deinde restauraui ipsum cum medicinis, et consolidatum est uelociter, et sanatum: et non fuit necessaria haec iteratio in operatione eius, et sectione ipsius, nisi propter dispositionem debilitatis infirmi, et paucitatem tolerantiae eius, et timorem meum super ipsum de morte: quoniam accidebat ei in omnibus horis ex superfluitate euacuationis syncopis mala.	Then I restored it with medicine, and it was quickly consolidated, and healed; and such a repetition of the operation, and sectioning of it, was not necessary, unless for the weakness of the nurse, and her lack of tolerance, and my fear over it from death: since it happened to him in all times from excessive evacuation of bad syncope.
Sanatus est ergo sanatione integra: et nata est in loco ossis caro dura, et bona facta est dispositio in corpore suo, et rediit uirtus eius: et conuersatus est in dispositionibus suis: et non fecit ei contrarietatem in ambulatione nocumentum omnino.	He was therefore sound in health; and he had grown up in a strong bone, and his body was well formed, and his strength returned to him; and his habits were healthy; and he did not suffer any injury from walking at all.
Si autem os eminens in loco corporis iam fractum est: tunc oportet ut serres ipsum, secundum hunc modum: et est: ut accipias ligamentum, et stringe ipsum in extremitate ossis eminentis: et praecipe alicui, qui extendat ipsum ad sursum: et pone ligamentum aliud ex lana grossius ligamento primo.	But if the jaw is broken at a point in the body where it has already been broken: then you should join it together again, as follows: take a piece of string, and tie it tightly to the end of the bone; and order someone who will hold the jaw up with his hand; and put another piece of string, made of coarser wool, over the first ligament.
Deinde liga ipsum super carne, quae est suh osse: et extende extremitatem eius, ut trahas carnem ad inferiora: et tu detegis carnem super locum quem uis serrare, ut non laedat Serra carnem.	Then tie the jaw up over the flesh which is under the bone; and extend its end so that you can pull the flesh down towards the bottom; and you should cover the place where you wish to join it together, so that the saw does not cut the flesh.
Pone lignum, aut tabulam sub osse inferius decenter: quoniam quando facis illud, non prohibetur quin secet carnem corruptam.	Place a piece of wood or a slab under the bone from below, because when you do this, it does not hurt the damaged flesh.
Et oportet ut sit Serratura super locum corruptum parumper, ut non sit in concauitate ossis corruptio: et non appareat in apparitione sua sensui, et cogat ad Serraturam sui uice alia.	And it is necessary that the join should be a little forward from the damaged part, so that it does not show in the appearance of the wound, and does not seem to be a joint; and does not allow its own natural movement, but allows another person's power to move it.
Quod si os est corruptum, et non est eminens, imo continuatur pars eius cum parte: et corruptio est in medio eius, aut in parte ipsius: tunc detege carnem ab omnibus partibus totam.	If the bone is damaged and does not rise up from one side to the other: then a part of it continues with another part; or the damage is in the middle of it, or on one side only of it: then cover all the flesh completely.
Deinde pone lignum inferius.	Then place the wood under.
Postea serra illud ex parte prima, ubi est corruptio, donec continuetur Serratura ex parte altera: et sit Serratura secundum longitudinem a corruptione parumper, secundum quod diximus.	Then join it from the first part where the damage is, until it continues as a joint on the other side: and let the join run along the length of the damage a little forward, in the way that I have said.
Quod si corruptio est in iunctura, incide ipsam iuncturam corruptam, et serra os ubi continuatur ex parte altera.	If the damage is at the joint: then cut the joint which is damaged, and join it up again; and join the bone where it continues on the other side.
Si uero corruptio est in continuatione duarum iuncturarum, tunc non est in ea ingenium nisi abrasio.	But if the damage is between two joints: there is no natural movement in that place but only a sore spot.
Quod si corruptio est in pectine manus, aut in pectine pedis: tunc res in eo est difficilis ualde.	If corruption is in the palm of the hand, or in the palm of the foot; then the matter is difficult, indeed.
Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter appareat tibi.	Indeed, you should inquire how the corruption appears to you.
Et abradas eam, et mundes ipsam secundum quamcunque dispositionem tibi possibile est, et cum quocunque ingenio rectificatur tibi: quando non facit tibi contrarietatem Vena, aut Neruus.	And scrape it off, and clean it up in such a way as is possible for you, and with whatever skill you have: when it does not give you an opposite vein, or nerve.
Et scias quod incisoria, et Serrae ad incidendum ista ossa sunt multa, secundum situm ossium, et praparationem eorum, et ipsorum grossitudinem, et subtilitatem eorum, et magnitudinem, et paruitatem ipsorum, et duriciem ipsorum, et eorum raritatem.	And know that there are many knives and saws for cutting these bones, depending on the position of the bones, and their preparation, and their thickness and softness, and their size and smoothness, and their variety.
Quapropter oportet, ut praepares omni speciei operationis instrumentum conueniens ad illam operationem.	Therefore it is necessary that you prepare an instrument suitable for each kind of operation.
Et scias, quod operationes istae significant tibi super speciem instrumenti quo indiges, quando tecum est studium longum.	And know that these operations require a long study on the face of the tool with which you work.
Et cognitio modorum huius artis, testimonium modorum aegritudinum: tunc enim iam inuenies per teipsum illud quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis ad omnem infirmitatem.	And the knowledge of these methods of the art is a witness to the diseases; for then you will already, through yourself, find out what is suitable for each disease.
Et ego sum firmans tibi in ultimo huius capituli numerum instrumentorum, quae pones exempla super quae incides, et probationem qua experiaris super alia.	And I am confirming to you at the end of this chapter the number of instruments, which you place as examples over which you work, and a proof from which you experiment on others.
Forma Serrae.	The form of the saw.
Forma alterius Serrae.	The form of another saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	The form of yet another saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	The form of another saw.
Haec forma Serrae depicta, sit decenter facta.	This form of the saw, even if it is slightly misaligned,
Fiat arcus eius superior, acuitas eius ex ferro: et manubrium eius ex buxo, et sit pyramidale decenter factum.	Let its bow be made higher, and its keenness from steel: and its handle from beech, and let it be slightly misaligned in shape.
Forma Rasorii iuncturarum.	The form of the razor joined together.
Sit caput huius Rasorii, secundum formam capitis claui stellati: et puncta eius sint secundum formam punctorum elischetfegi.	Let the head of this razor be made according to the form of a star-shaped claw; and its points be made according to the form of a star-shaped point.
Et non conuenit, nisi ut fricentur cum eo capita iuncturarum, quando corrumpuntur, aut os amplum, et magnum est.	And it does not suit, except that they rub with it when they are cutting, when they are corrupting, or have a broad and wide opening.
Forma maioris Rasorii.	Major form of the razor.
Forma medii Rasorii.	Medium form of the razor.
Forma Rasorii lati.	Wide form of the razor.
Forma Rasorii in quo est concauitas.	Form of the razor in which is enclosed.
Forma Rasorii alterius subtilis.	Other thin form of the razor.
Forma Rasorii alterius curuatae extremitatis.	Form of the other curved end of the razor.
Forma Rasorii parui, subtilis tentae.	Form of a small, thin hook-shaped tool for cutting hair.
Forma Rasorii cum quo inciduntur ossa.	Form of the razor with which bones are incised.
Forma etiam Rasorii magni.	Form also of the large razor.
Hoc similatur Radio, et extremitas est sicut Serra: exhibetur in locis multis ex rasione ossium.	This is like a rasp and its end is like an axe: it is shown in many places from the scraping of bones.
Forma Rasorii quod conuenit ad rasionem eius quod perforatum est ex ossibus.	Form of the razor which is used to scrape the bone, that which has been pierced out with holes from the bones.
Extremitas eius triangula, acutarum est extremitatum.	Its end is triangular, its angles are acute.
Fit ex Indi.	It fits from India.
Et similiter oportet, ut fiant omnia quae diximus ex Rasoriis, et Incisoriis, et Serris.	And likewise it is necessary that all which we have said of razors, and incisers, and saws be made.
Â¶ De incisione extremitatum, et Serratura ossium.	Of the incision of ends, and sawing of bones.
Caput LXXXIX.	Head LXXXIX.
Putrefiunt extremitates, aut ex caussa extrinseca, aut intrinseca.	The ends putrefy, or for an external cause, or an internal one.
Cum ergo medicatus fueris illam corruptionem curatione medicinarum, et non confert curatio: et uides corruptionem incidere in membrum, quam non repercutit aliquid: tunc oportet ut incidas illud membrum usque ubi consequitu corruptio, ut euadat infirmus per illud a morte, aut a malicia quae est maior defectu membri.	But when you have been healed with medicines and not with the art of healing, and see corruption inciding into a member, but nothing is affected by it: then you must cut off that member to where the corruption reaches, so that the sick may be freed from that which is greater in the defect of the member.
Et signum cui accidit illud est, quod denigratur membrum, donec putetur: quod ignis combussit ipsum, aut putrefit post nigredinem: donec inciditur illa putredo usque ad illud quod sequitur illud membrum, et serpit in totum corpus.	And the sign of that which has happened to it is that a member is discolored until it is healed; for if fire has burned it, or putrefaction after nigridine: until that corruption incises into that member, and creeps through all of the body.
Propera ergo cum incisione eius, et similiter si caussa corruptionis est a percussione quorundam uenenosorum: sicut scorpionis marini, et uiperae, et rutellae, et similium.	Then prepare with the incision, and likewise if the cause of corruption is from percussion of some of the venenosi: as of the sea scorpion, and of the moth, and of the nettle, and of the same kind.
Si ergo corruptio, aut percussio est in extremitate digiti, tunc incide digitum, et non des spacium corruptioni, ut incedat usque ad reliquam manum.	But if corruption, or a blow is in the end of a finger, then cut off the finger, and not leave space for the corruption, so that it incises into the remaining hand.
Et similiter si accidit in manu, tunc incide eam ex radice focilis, et non des spacium corruptioni, donec capiat in focili brachii.	And likewise if it occurs in the hand, then incision is made from the root quickly, and not leave space for corruption, until it takes place in the brisk arm.
Et si inuadit in eo, tunc incide brachium apud cubitum in iunctura sua.	And if it has entered into him, then incision is made in the arm at the knee in its junction.
Si autem pertransit corruptio, et uides eum circiter cubitum: tunc in illo est mors infirmi.	But if corruption has passed through, and you see him all around the hip: then death is in that one.
Et administrare praeter illud ex curatione, est quantitas uirtus.	And to administer besides that from cure, is the quantity of virtue.
Et similiter fac de pede, quando inuadit corruptio in digito, tunc incide ipsum apud unum nodorum: et si capit in pectine pedis, tunc incide pedem totum.	And likewise do to the foot, when corruption has entered into a finger, then incision is made in it at the knuckle: and if it takes hold in the shank of the foot, then incision is made on the whole foot.
Si autem ascendit ad genu, tunc incide crus apud iuncturam genu.	But if it has risen up to the knee, then incision is made on the leg at the junction of the knee.
Quod si corruptio iam peruenit supra genu, tunc non est in ea ingenium, nisi dimissio, et relinquere infirmum morti.	That if corruption has already reached above the knee, then there is no healing in it, except removal and abandonment to sickness to death.
Et modus incidendi membrum, aut serrandi ipsum est, ut stringas ligamentum in inferiori, quem uis incidere: et stringe ligamentum aliud supra locum.	And the mode of incising a limb, or of binding it is, that you stretch the ligament below, which you wish to incision: and tighten another ligament above the place.
Et extendat minister ligamentum unum ad inferiora: et extendat minister aliud ligamentum superius ad sursum.	And let one minister of ligament extend to the lower: and let another minister of ligament extend upwards to the top.
Et tu separa carnem quae est inter duo ligamenta, cum Spatumili lato, donec detegatur caro tota.	And you separate flesh that is between the two ligaments, with a chisel flat, until all the flesh is detected.
Deinde incidatur, aut serretur.	Then incision is made, or bound.
Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.	And it is necessary, that you put from all parts a cloth of linen, and does not touch the serra place to sound health: and happens infirmity in the addita, and a blister hot.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis interius dum operaris, tunc cauteriza locum uelociter: aut pone super ipsum quosdam pulueres abscindentes sanguinem.	But if it has happened to flow of blood inward while you work, then cauterize the place quickly: or put on top some powder to cut off blood.
Deinde redi ad medicationem tuam, donec compleatur.	Then turn back to your medication, until it is completed.
Deinde liga membrum uulneratum cum ligamento conueniente ei, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bind the wounded limb with a suitable ligament, and care for it, until it heals.
Et ego narro tibi quod accidit uiro in pede suo, hoc idem accidens quod narro tibi.	And I tell you what happened to the man in his foot, this same thing that I tell you.
Quod est, quia accidit in pede suo nigredo, cum adustione quae assimilatur combustioni ignis: et corruptio illa in primis accidit in digito suo, donec coepit pedem totum.	What happened was that it occurred in his black foot, when the ash that is made like combustion of fire; and that corruption first happened in his finger, until he began to hurt his whole foot.
Properauit ergo uir ex seipso, postquam uidit corruptionem incidere in membro cum uehementia eius, quod inuenit ex dolore, et adustione eius: et incidit ipsum apud iuncturam, et sanatus est.	Then the man recovered from the swelling, when he saw that the corruption was occurring in his limb with great pain which he felt and because of the ash of him; and it happened to him near the joint, and he got well.
Et postquam praeteriit ei tempus longum, accidit ei illa eadem corruptio in digito manus suae indice.	And after he had passed a long time, that corruption again happened to him in his finger of his right hand.
Venit ergo ad me, et conatus sum recuperare illam superfluitatem cum eo quod posui super manum ex medicinis post mundificationem corporis eius: et non repercussa est superfluitas, et coepit incedere in digitum alium: donec coepit coruptio in manum.	Then he came to me, and I tried to restore that excess with him when I put on his hand from the medicines after purifying his body: and that excess did not respond, and began to hurt in another finger; until the corruption happened in his hand.
Vocauit ergo me, ad incidendum manum eius: et nolui illud, sperans ex me super repercussionem illius superfluitatis: et timui etiam super ipsum apud incisionem manus eius mortem.	He called on me to wound his hand; and I did not want to do it, hoping for a response from me about that excess: and I was afraid also of death at the incision of his hand.
Quoniam uirtus uiri erat super casum.	For the strength of the man was above death.
Postquam ergo desperauit de me, reuersus est ad terram suam: et peruenit ad me de eo, quia properauit, et incidit manum suam totam: et sanatus est.	Then he turned away from me, returned to his land; and he came back to me about it because he wanted to, and he wounded all of his hand; and he got well.
Et non attuli hanc narrationem, nisi ut sit adiutorium super illud quod cadit de genere huius aegritudinis: et ut sit significatio qua significetur, et secundum quam agatur.	And I did not tell this story except to make an aid about what falls from this kind of disease: and to make a sign of what means, and according to what is done.
Â¶ De cura Sinuum, et qualitate clisterizationis cum medicinis.	Concerning the cure of ulcers, and the quality of cauterization with medicines.
Caput XC.	Chapter 80.
Quando accidit apostema in quibusdam membris carnosis, et prolongatur spacium apostematis, donec collectionem facit saniei: deinde rumpitur, aut perforatur, et egreditur quod in eo est ex sanie, et remanet locus uacuus quasi sit uas: et cutis quae est super ipsum sicut pannus qui iam subtiliatus est: et non peruenit ad ultimum in corruptione sua, neque imprimit in os, neque in neruum, neque in ligamentum: meretur ut nominetur Sinus: et non nominatur Fistula: uerumtamen si prolongatur spacium eius, donec imprimat corruptio in aliquid horum membrorum, tunc nominatur Fistula, aut zuken.	When an apostema (ulcer) occurs on a part of the fatty body, and the space of the apostema is prolonged, until it causes a collection of pus: then it bursts, or pierces, and what is in it comes out, leaving a hole behind that is like a hole, and the skin over it is as if it were a thin cloth; and it does not reach its last stage of corruption, nor prints into the mouth, nor into the nerves, nor into the ligaments: it deserves to be called a sinus: and it is not called a fistula: however, if the space is prolonged, until it causes the corruption to impress on some of these limbs, then it is called a fistula, or a fistula.
Et cura eius est, ut incidas illam cutem totam sicut reuoluitur: et praecipue quando subtiliata est, et facta sicut pannus: et confidis quia non aaehaeret cum loco, propter corruptionem suam.	And the cure is so that you fall on all this skin as if it were wound up; and above all when it is thin and has become like a sheet; and you trust because it does not stick to the place, for its corruption.
Si autem speras quod adhaereat cutis, et non consequitur ex eo corruptio illa ultima consecutione: et si in cute est spissitudo ex carne, tunc cura ipsum cum Clisteri: et est, ut consideres ad Sinum.	But if you hope that this skin will stick and not cause that last corruption: and if there is a thickness of flesh on the skin, then cure it with Myrobalans: and it is so, as you consider towards the sinus.
Tunc si est magnus, et pus quod emittitur ex eo est foetidi odoris: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum medicamine aegyptio, quod est aceti, et olei, et ziniar, partes recipiens aequales, aggregentur in uase: et decoquantur super ignem, donec rubeat medicamen: et ueniat in spissitudinem mellis.	Then if it is big and the pus that comes out of it is foul-smelling: then Myrobalans with Egyptian medicine, which is vinegar, oil, and saffron, parts equal, are mixed together in a dish: and they are boiled on the fire, until the medicine turns red: and it comes to be like honey.
Deinde accipe ex eo quod tibi necesse est: et dissolue ipsum cum aqua et melle, et clisteriza cum eo Sinum: et stringe orificium eius, et dimitte medicinam in eo ad quantitatem duarum horarum.	Then take from it what you need: and dissolve it with water and honey and Myrobalans with it to the sinus: and tightly close its opening, and release the medicine into it for a duration of two hours.
Deinde extrahe ipsum cum expressione: fac illud diebus tot, donec mundificetur Sinus, et remoueatur foetor.	Then extract it with an expression: let it be for days, until the sinus is clean and the smell has gone away.
Et quandoque clisterizatur cum aqua cineris, quando non est tibi praesens hoc medicamen: et est, ut accipias cinerem lignorum uitis, aut cinerem ex lignis ilicis: et proiicias super eam aquam.	And when you want to use it as a Myrobalans with water of ash, when this medicine is not present with you: and it is so, that you take the ash of oak wood, or ash from oak wood: and pour over it water.
Deinde cola eam, et clisteriza cum ea, donec confidas quod Sinus iam ablutus est.	Then boil it, and Myrobalans with it, until you trust that the sinus is now clean.
Quod si infirmo non est tolerantia super medicamen aegyptium, neque aquam cineris, tunc clisteriza ipsum cum aqua et melle, cui iam permixtum est aliquid ex ziniar contrito.	That if the tolerance of the sick person is not good with Egyptian medicine and water of ash, then Myrobalans it with water and honey, to which has been added some crushed saffron.
Aut clisteriza ipsum cum melle et uino permixtis, quoniam de proprietate mellis est, ut mundificet, et abluat: et uinum facit adhaerere Sinum, praecipue quando in uino est superfluitas stipticitatis et siccitatis.	Or Myrobalans it with honey and wine, because of the property of honey to clean and wash away: and it makes the wine adhere to the sinus, especially when there is an abundance of astringency and dryness.
Cum facis illud aliquotiens, et confidis quod Sinus corruptio iam remota est: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum eo quod facit nasci carnem in eo.	Sometimes you do it, and trust that the corruption of the sin has already been removed: then you wash him with water, because he washes himself when he gives birth to flesh in him.
Et est, ut accipias ex emplastro dyafinicon: et dissoluas ipsum cum oleo rosato, et uino stiptico: aut clisteriza ipsum cum quibusdam medicinis, et unguentis aliis, quorum proprietates scripsi in tractatu unguentorum.	And it is as if you take the plaster of Dyafinicon: and dissolve him with olive oil, and wine astringent: or wash him with some medicines, and other ointments, whose properties I have written in the book of ointments.
Quod si orificium Sinus est strictum, in quo non capit cannula clisteris: tunc amplifica ipsum cum ferro parumper: aut pone in ipso licinium inuolutum in unguento aegyptio, aut in unguento basilicon, donec amplificetur.	That if the orifice of the sinus is strict, in which the cannula of the clister does not enter: then enlarge it with iron a little: or put in him licorium infusum in unguento Aegyptio, or in unguento Basilicon, until it is enlarged.
Et similiter si est orificium etiam amplum, tunc aggrega labia eius cum sutura: et dimitte ex eo quantitatem in quam ingrediatur clistere sine additione.	And likewise if the orifice is also wide, then join the lips with a stitch: and let go out of him a quantity in which to be infused clister without addition.
Et similiter si orificium eius ex quo currit pus, est eleuatum ad superiora: tunc seca ipsum in depressiori loco qui est in ipso, ut currat ex eo pus usque inferius: quoniam pus quando coartatur in profunditate Sinus, prohibet carnem generari in eo.	And likewise if the orifice of him from which there runs pus is raised upward: then dry him in a lower place which is in him, so that the pus runs down from it: for when the pus is constricted in the depth of the sinus, it does not allow flesh to be born in it.
Quod si non est tibi possibile secare Sinum circiter inferius eius secundum quod uis: tunc conare, ut praepares membrum praeparatione qua currat ex eo pus cum facilitate secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	That if it is not possible for you to dry the sinus completely around its lower part according to what you wish: then strive that you prepare the member in a preparation in which runs from it pus with ease according to which you prepare it for yourself.
Conare, ut non retineatur in eo aliquid ex pus omnino: et accipe medicinas consolidatiuas quae ponuntur super signum, conuenientes ad illud quod uis.	Strive that you do not retain in him anything at all of the pus: and take medicines consolidatrices which are put on a mark, fitting to that which you wish.
Et extende eas super pannum lini.	And extend them over a linen cloth.
Et sit pannus tantae quantitatis, qua fiat communicatio totius Sinus.	And let there be such a quantity of the cloth, that there may be communication with all the sinus.
Deinde incide cum forficibus in directo orificii Sinus foramen, amplius orificio Sinus parumper.	Then cut with forceps in the direct orifice of the sinus hole, slightly wider sinus opening.
Deinde extende ex unguentis lenibus super pannum alium, secundum quantitatem foraminis: et pone eum super ipsum positione longinqua ab orificio Sinus, ut alleuietur exitus pus ex eo: et non auferas pannum magnum, nisi post dies aliquos uice una.	Then extend from the unguentum with soft cloth over another cloth according to the quantity of the hole: and put it on him in a distant position from the orifice of the sinus so that pus comes out from it: and do not hold back the cloth in great size, until after a few days one time.
Ille autem qui est super orificium Sinus, est ille quem remoues in omni hora, ut egrediatur quod aggregatur in eo ex pus: et ut scias, an illud quod currit ex eo uirus, est multum, aut parum: aut digestum, aut indigestum.	The one who is above the sinus opening is he who moves all the time so that he exits what is gathered in him from pus: and know, that which runs out of it is a lot, or little: or digested, or undigested.
Et cum hoc iterum considera locum Sinus ipsius, an in ipso sentiat dominus eius dolorem, aut non sit in eo dolor, et an sit in eo apostema, aut non sit in eo apostema.	And when you consider this place again of the sinus itself, does he feel pain in his lordship, or not be in it pain, and is there in it blood-clot, or not be there blood-clot?
Cum ergo protenditur medicatio tua taliter, et uides materiam quae egreditur super orificium Sinus, tunc scias, quod Sinus iam adhaeret, aut approximat adhaerentiae: tunc ergo solue ipsum in mane, aut in tertio die: et quando soluis uulnus, tunc permuta pannum alium, et renoua unguentum.	So when your treatment extends thus far, and you see the matter that comes out above the sinus opening, then know that the sinus has already become attached, or drawn close to attachment: so then loosen it in the morning, or on the third day: and when you have loosened the wound, then change the cloth with another one, and renew the ointment.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post spacium longum uirus subtile, tunc non desperes de adhaerentia eius, nam sanatio eius appropinquat, quoniam ex hominibus sunt qui tardant generationem carnis in uulneribus suis, et ex eis sunt qui agunt econtrario illius.	But if the pus comes out of the sinus after a long time, do not despair about its attachment, for its healing is drawing near, because there are people who delay the generation of flesh in their wounds, and there are those who act differently.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post dies multos pus indigestum, tunc scias quod sinus non adhaeret.	But if the pus comes out of the sinus after many days, then know that the sinus does not become attached.
Si ergo tardatur adhaerentia Sinus, et prolongatur res eius: tunc adde in exiccatione medicinarum, uerum faciant medici, ut sint medicinae in substantia sua humidae, et in uirtute sua siccae: sicut unguentum dyafinicon, quando additur in eo superfluitas additionis ex zegi.	But if the attachment of the sinus is delayed and its duration is prolonged: then add to the drying of the medicines, that the physicians may do as they should, so that they are in their substance moist, and in their power dry: just like the unguent with dafinicon, when added to it, there being an excess of addition by drying.
Et ex magis ultimo quo curatur, est, ut accipias unguentum dyafinicon, et soluatur cum oleo rosato, et roretur super ipsum uinum antiquum aequale in substantia sua.	And from the greatest one when he is being healed, it is as if you take the unguent with dafinicon and you loosen it with rose oil and you apply it over the old wound to equal it in its substance.
Deinde confice ipsum cum eo, et utere ipso.	Then make fast the wound with him, and use it.
Et iam facit simile huic actioni, quando non est tibi praesens unguentum dyafinicon, mel, quando decoquis ipsum, donec ingrossetur, et uteris eo.	And this same action is done by you when the unguent with dafinicon is not present, or when honey is heated, and you use it.
Aut accipe myrrham, et aloen, et olibanum: tere totum, et pulueriza illud super mel dum est super ignem.	Take myrrh, and aloe, and olive; let them be boiled together with honey, and poured over fire.
Deinde line super ipsum pannum, et stringe ipsum super Sinum: et line cum melle quod decoquisti, donec ingrossatum est: et pulueriza super ipsum species, et pone super ipsum pannum, et stringe eum.	Then wrap a cloth over the wound, and tie it tightly to the sinew: and pour the ointment you have made on top of the wound, until it is thickened: and sprinkle the herbs on top of the wound, and wrap them in the cloth, and tie it up.
Et quandoque administratur in illo aristolochia longa, et radices lilii coelestis, et est lilium: et farina herbi, et centaurea.	And sometimes, when he applies it to him, take the long arzuola herb, and roots of the star lily, and the lily itself; and flour from the herb, and the centaurea.
Utere eis simplicibus, aut aggregatis, tere ea, et cribella ipsa: et pulueriza super mel quod narraui, et utere eo.	Use them either simple or combined, rub them together, and strain them through a sieve: and sprinkle the herbs on top of the honey that you have made, and use it.
Quod si prolongatur res Sinus, et non sanatur hac curatione: tunc scias, quod in profundo eius est corruptio: aut iam facit impressionem in ossibus, aut in reliquis membris duris, aut ligamentis: tunc cura ipsum curatione Fistularum, secundum quod praemissum est.	That if the disease of the sinus is prolonged, and does not heal with this treatment: then you shall know that there is corruption in its depth; or it already makes an impression on the bones, or on the other hard members, or on the ligaments: then cure the sinus with fistula treatment, as has been stated.
Â¶ De cura Panaritii et unguis attritae, et incisione digiti additi, et sectione.	Regarding the cure of a finger bone that is green and swollen, and the cutting of the finger, and the sectioning of it.
Caput XCI.	(Chapter 109)
Panaritium est apostema quod nascitur sub ungue pollicis manus, aut pedis: et fortasse nascitur in reliquis digitis.	Panaritis is a swelling that arises under the nail of the thumb or foot, and perhaps it arises in the other fingers too.
Cum ergo prolongatur res eius, et negligitur curato eius, et apostematur apostemate calido: aut corrumpitur, et emittit pus, donec corrodit radicem unguis: et fortasse corrumpit eam totam, et fortasse peruenit corruptio ad os, donec est ei odor foetidus: et fit extremitas digiti lata, et fit color eius fuscus.	When therefore the disease of it is prolonged, and neglected in its cure, and turns to a blister with heat: or it corrupts, and discharges pus, until it corrupts the nail's root; and perhaps it corrupts all of it, and perhaps the corruption reaches to the mouth, until it has an odour that is loathsome: and perhaps it makes the end of the finger large, and perhaps it darkens its colour.
Quando ergo tu curas ipsum, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut incidas cum ferro totam superfluitatem quae remansit ex ungue.	When therefore you cure the finger, with what we have said regarding its division, and your cure does not bring relief: then you must cut away all the excess that remains under the nail.
Deinde cauteriza uulnus post illud.	Then sterilise the wound after it.
Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.	Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.
Si uero os est sanum, et est unguis etiam sana, et additiones uacuae unguis iam comprimunt carnem ad interiora, et incipiunt pungere ipsam, et laedunt eam: tunc oportet ut ponas Radium subtilem sub angulo unguis quae pungit carnem, et impelle eam sursum: et incide eam carnem cum facilitate, et pone super illud quod remanet de carne ex medicinis comburentibus, corrosiuis, donec remoueatur totum eius.	For the bone is sound, and the nail also is sound, and the addition of the dry nail already compresses the flesh toward the inside, and begins to prick it, and hurts it: then you should put on a fine radium under the angle of the nail that pricks the flesh, and push it up: and cut the flesh with ease, and put on what remains of the flesh from burning medicines, abrasives until it all moves away.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then take care of that with the ointment, until it heals.
Si autem corruptio iam imprimit in os, tunc oportet ut incidas illud os, et extrahas ipsum: non enim sanatur unquam dum permanet in eo os corruptum.	If corruption has already set in at the tooth, then you should cut out that tooth, and remove it: for it does not heal at all while it remains in it.
Quod si uides corrosionem et corruptionem incedere in digitum, tunc incide eum in uno nodorum, secundum quod praemissa est eius rememoratio.	If you see the corrosion and corruption entering into a finger, then cut it at one of its joints, according to what has been said above as a reminder.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of that person, until he heals.
Si autem accidat ungui attritio, aut percussio: et contingit in ea dolor uehemens, tunc oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	If, however, the nail is torn or struck: and there is a sharp pain in it, then you should let blood from it first.
Deinde seca unguem cum Spatumili acuto sectione transuersa de sursum ad uisum.	Then dry off the nail with an acute spatula, cutting across from above to the nail bed.
Et custodi, ne sectio perueniat ad carnem quae est sub ungue, nam tu facies accidere per illud super infirmum dolorem uehementem, et erit caussa ad natiuitatem carnis additae in loco.	And guard it, so that the cut does not reach the flesh under the nail, for you would cause a painful wound to the sick person, and it would be a cause of the birth of flesh added to its place.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod sedat dolores.	Then take care of the place with what is seated there that it hurts.
Digitus uero additus qui nascitur in quibusdam manibus hominum, fortasse est carnosus totus: et fortasse sunt in quibusdam eorum ossa, et fortasse est in eo unguis: et quidam eorum nascitur in radice iuncturae, aut est natiuitas eius in quibusdam nodis digiti.	The finger that is added to some of the hands of men may well be a whole flesh: and it may well be that there are bones in some of them, and it may well be that there is a nail in it: and in some of their fingers the birth may be in the root of the joint, or it may be born in some of its joints.
Ille ergo qui nascitur in quibusdam nodis digiti, non mouetur: et ille qui nascitur apud iuncturam digiti, fortasse mouetur.	So this that is born in some of the joints of the finger does not move: and this that is born at the joint of the finger may well move.
Eius ergo qui ex eis est carnosus, sectio eius facilis est.	Therefore, whoever has this flesh, cutting it is easy.
Quod est, ut incidas ipsum apud radicem suam cum Spatumili lato.	That is, so that you hit him at the root with a flat chisel.
Eius autem cuius natiuitas est in radice iuncturae curatio, est difficilis.	But whoever his birth is in the root of the joint, treatment is difficult.
Abstine ergo ab incisione eius.	Therefore, abstain from cutting it.
In illo uero qui nascitur in digito apud ultimum nodorum, tunc oportet ut incidas in primis carnem eius incisione rotunda usque ad os.	In that person who is born in the finger near the last knuckle, then you should hit the first flesh of his incision roundly up to the mouth.
Deinde serra os cum una illarum Serrarum conuenientium ad illud.	Then tighten the jaw with one of the screws convenient for that.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for the flesh, until it heals.
Consolidatio autem quae accidit digitis adinuicem, multotiens accidit aut ex natiuitate hominis, id est, nascitur cum eo, aut a consolidatione uulneris, aut combustione ignis, et similibus.	However, the consolidation that happens from one side to another, it often happens or from the birth of man, namely, is born with it, or from the consolidation of the wound, or from the burning of fire, and similar things.
Oportet ergo ut seces illam consolidationem, donec redeant digiti secundum formam suam naturalem.	Therefore, it should be that you separate this consolidation, until the second fingers return to their natural shape.
Deinde pone inter eos licinia, aut pannos infusos in oleo rosato: ut non consolidentur uelociter, et separa inter eos: aut pone inter eos laminam plumbi subtilem, donec consolidetur locus secundum quod oportet.	Then place between them a chisel, or damp cloths soaked in oil roseate: so that they do not quickly consolidate and separate between them: or place between them a thin lead sheet, until the site consolidates as necessary.
Et similiter si accidat consolidatio quibusdam digitis cum palma, tunc seca illam consolidationem, secundum quod praeparatur et conuenit figurae membri.	And also if it happens that some fingers consolidate with the palm, then dry this consolidation, according to how it is prepared and convenient for the shape of the member.
Â¶ De incisione Vitium.	Regarding the incision: Vitius enim est et insensatus, si ex una parte incid
Caput XCII.	The head. 82.
Uites sunt Venae inuolutae, grossae, plenae superfluitatibus melancholicis quae accidunt in pluribus membris corporis: et plurimum euentus earum est in cruribus, praecipue in cruribus iter agentium et laborantium, et portantium.	Veins that are swelled up, thick, full of melancholic excesses which occur in many parts of the body: and most of them are in the legs, especially in the femurs, because they walk and work, and carry the weight.
Oportet ergo ut administres excussionem corporis ex cholera nigra aliquotiens excussione forti.	Therefore, it should be that you administer a strong infusion of the body with black cholera from time to time.
Deinde phlebotoma patientis eas basilicam.	Then take the blood of the patient by the bazilicus method.
Curatio uero earum cum ferro, est secundum duos modos.	The treatment of these veins with iron is according to two methods.
Vnus eorum est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger.	He should wash them, and draw out the black blood.
Et modus alter est, ut eleuetur Vena, et extrahatur tota.	And another way is to cut the vein and take it all out.
Sectio uero eius est secundum hunc modum.	But the section is done this way according to this method.
Embroca crus in primis cum aqua calida multum, donec resoluatur sanguis grossus faeculentus.	First, wrap the leg with warm water until the thick, foul blood resolves.
Deinde stringe crus infirmi a superiori parte coxae eius, usque ad inferiorem partem genu cum uitta.	Then tighten the bandage around the leg from the upper hip to the lower knee with the stump.
Deinde seca uenam in loco uno, aut duobus, aut tribus sectione ampla.	Then cut a wide section in one, two, or three places.
Deinde eleua, id est, extrahe sanguinem in manu tua ab inferiori parte cruris, usque ad sursum, et a superiori oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	Then wash it, that is to say, draw blood from the lower part of the leg with your hand all the way up to the top, and from the top it should be done by the phlebotomist first.
Deinde seca unguem cum usque inferius: donec egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uides sufficere, et quam tolerat uirtus infirmi.	Then cut off the toe all the way down: until it comes out of blood as much as you see is enough to drain, and what the strength of the nurse can bear.
Postea liga eam: et praecipe ei, ut abstineat a cibis generantibus choleram nigram: et itera euacuationem et phlebotomiam, quando implentur Venae, et nocet illud infirmo.	Then bind it up: and tell him to refrain from foods that cause black bile: and keep on with the bloodletting and phlebotomy when the veins are full, and let the sick person be warned against it.
Eleuatio autem eius est secundum hunc modum.	But washing it out is done this way according to this method.
Rade crus infirmi, si in ea sunt pili multi.	Scrape the wound of the nurse, if there are many hairs in it.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in balneum: aut embroca ipsum in crure eius cum aqua calida, donec rubeat, et exuberentur Venae: aut exercitetur exercitio forti, si non est ei praesens balneum, donec calefiat membrum.	Then put him into a bath: or wrap him in the leg with warm water until it reddens, and the veins stand out: or exercise him strongly if there is no bath present, until he warms the limb.
Deinde seca cutem in directo uenae sectione per longitudinem: aut in ultimo eius apud genu, aut in inferiori parte eius apud calcaneum.	Then cut off the skin at right angles to the vein section along its length: or at the end of it near the knee, or at the lower part of it near the heel.
Deinde aperi cutem cum uncinis, et excoria uenam ab omni parte, donec appareat sensui: et est apud apparitionem eius, quod uides eam rubeam ad nigredinem decliuem.	Then open the skin with a hook, and scrub off the scar tissue with all its parts, until you feel it: and at this appearing of it, you will see it turn from red to black by the fall of the day.
Cum ergo uadit ex cute, uides eam albam quasi sit chorda.	But when you take off the skin, you will see it white as a cord.
Deinde intromitte sub ea Radium, donec quando eleuatur et egreditur de cute: suspende eam cum uncino caeco, leni.	Then introduce the radical below it, until it is removed and withdrawn from the skin: suspend with a blind hook, soft.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam prope illam sectionem tribus digitis.	Then dry off another piece of flesh next to that piece of flesh with three fingers.
Deinde excoria cutem a superiori parte uenae, donec appareat.	Then scrape the skin from the upper part of the leg until it is scraped off.
Deinde eleua eam cum Radiis sicut fecisti, et suspende eam cum uncino alio, sicut fecisti in primis.	Then wash it with water as you did before and suspend with another blind hook as you did at first.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam, aut sectiones plures, si indiges illo.	Then dry off another piece of flesh or more pieces if you are able to do so.
Deinde eleua, et incide ipsam ultima sectione apud calcaneum.	Then wash and cut off the very last part next to the heel.
Deinde extrahe eam ad sectionem quae est supra eam.	Then pull it out up to the section that is above it.
Et fac illud, donec extrahas eam ex sectione quae est superior, uel altior sectionibus omnibus, donec quando egreditur tota: tunc incide eam.	And do this, until you pull it out from the upper section, or longer sections, until it is completely withdrawn: then cut it off.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad extrahendum, et eleuandum: tunc intromitte acum cum filo forti duplo, et liga eam, et extrahe ipsam: aut intromitte sub ea Radium: et reuolue manum tuam ad omnem partem, donec egrediatur.	But if it does not comply with you regarding withdrawal and washing: then introduce a strong double thread and tie it up and wash it off: or introduce the radical below: and turn your hand around all over, until it is completely withdrawn.
Et caue, ne incidatur.	Then cut, so that it doesn't get cut.
Nam si incidatur, fit difficile tibi eleuare eam ualde, et ingreditur super infirmum ex ea nocumentum.	For if it gets cut, it will be difficult for you to wash it well, and it will enter the wound underneath.
Cum ergo extraxeris eam totam: tunc pone super locum uulnerum lanam submersam in uino et oleo rosato, aut oleo: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	When you have completely withdrawn it: then place it on the spot of the wound that is soaked with wine and oil or ointment, and care for it, until it heals.
Quod si Vitis est contracta, habens tortuositatem cui sit inuolutio ad partes, et non est sicut diximus secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut findas super eam ad omnem partem tortuositatis eius, et loca inuolutionis ipsius.	That if the vein is contracted, it has a curvature that makes it difficult to find the right spot for suturing and does not go according to what we said regarding straightness: then you must find on all parts of its curvature and the spots of its contraction.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncinis, donec eleues eam totam: et caue apud sectionem tuam super eam ne incidas uenam, aut uulneres: nam difficile fiet super te eleuare, uel extrahere eam.	Then suspend it with a hook, until you have completely washed it off: and be careful next to the section on your body not to cut yourself: for it will be difficult to wash over you, or to withdraw it.
Conserua ergo prudentiam tuam.	Preservate therefore your prudence.
Forma Incidentis quo sanatur Vitis.	The form of the incident in which the grape is cured.
Forma Vncini caeci.	The form of the blind vinery.
Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uulneret uenam: et est grossae flectuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret uenam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.	It is not for him the prudence like that of the other vinery, nor has it the acute extremities, so as not to wound the vine by its excessiveness; and its bent is coarse, soft: because if it were delicate, it would fall with its own delicacy; but its grossness is superfluous, as we have said.
De extractione Venae cruris.	On the extraction of a vein from the leg.
Caput XCIII.	Head LIII. On the extraction of a vein from the leg.
Haec Vena generatur in cruribus in terris calidis, sicut Alizegi, et terra Arabum, et in terris aridis, calidis, paucae teneritatis, id est, in quibus non nascitur herba, neque arbor.	This vein is generated in the legs in warm countries, such as Algeria and Arabia, and in dry and hot countries, scarce of tenderness, that is to say, where no grass or tree grows.
Et fortasse generatur in locis aliis corporis praeter crura.	And perhaps it is generated in other parts of the body besides the legs.
Et generatio quidem eius est a putrefactione quae accidit sub cute, sicut accidunt intra corpora serpentes et uermes ascarides, et uermes generati inter cutem et carnem.	And its generation is from that which happens beneath the skin, just as it happens within the bodies of snakes and worms, and of worms between the skin and flesh.
Et signum incaeptionis euentus huius Venae est, quod accidit in crure inflammatio uehemens.	And the sign of the commencement of this vein is an acute inflammation in the leg.
Deinde uesicatur locus.	Then the place becomes sore.
Deinde incipit Vena exire ex loco illius uesicationis, quasi sit radix plantae, aut animal.	Then the vein begins to come forth from the place of its sore, as though it were a root of a plant, or an animal.
Cum ergo apparet ex ea extremitas eius, tunc oportet ut inuoluas super ipsam frustum plumbi, cuius pondus sit ex drachma keil, usque ad drachmas II et noda ipsam: et dimitte plumbum suspensum ex crure.	When therefore this extremitas begins to appear, then you should wrap a leaden wire around it, the weight of which is of two drams and a point, and fasten it there: and take off the lead when you have wrapped it round.
Quotiens ergo egreditur ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, inuolue illud in plumbo, et noda illud.	As often as anything goes out from it to the outside, wrap it again with lead and mark it.
Quod si prolongatur multum, tunc incide partem eius, et inuolue residuum.	If it is prolonged for a long time, then cut away a part of it, and wrap up the remainder.
Et non incidas eam radicitus antequam egrediatur tota.	And do not cut away its roots before it has gone out entirely.
Quoniam si incidis, contrahitur, et ingreditur in carnem: et facit accidere apostema, et putredinem in loco, et ulcus malum.	For if you cut it, it is torn up and enters the flesh: and it makes happen a pustule, and a putrefaction in the place, and a bad sore.
Quapropter oportet, ut suauiter tractetur, et extrahatur paulatim, donec egrediatur ex ultimo sui, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid in corpore: et ex hac quidem Vena egreditur in quibusdam hominibus quod est in longitudine sua quinque palmorum et decem.	So then it is necessary that it be handled with care and removed gradually until it has completely left the last of its own and nothing remains of it in the body: and from this same vein comes out in some men, which is five hands long and ten [palms] wide.
Et iam peruenit ad me, quia exiuit uiro ex XX palmis.	And already it has reached me, because he has gone out of twenty palms.
Si autem inciditur tibi in hora medicationis tuae: tunc intromitte radium in foramine eius, et perfora eam foramine longo, cum corpore, donec euacuetur totum quod est in ea ex materia: et administra putrefactionem loci cum medicinis diebus aliquot.	If however you hit yourself at the time of your own treatment: then introduce a rayon into the hole and pierce it with a long ray with the body, until all that is in it has completely come out of the matter: and administer to the place with medicines for several days.
Deinde cura ipsum curatione apostematum.	Then care for yourself after the treatment with poultices.
Et haec quidem Vena quandoque habet ramos multos, praecipue quando apparet in iunctura pedis, aut in pede ipso: et accidunt ei orificia multa, et egreditur ex omni orificio ramus.	And this same vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears in the joint of the foot or in the foot itself: and many orifices are formed for it, and it comes out from every orifice with a branch.
Cura ergo ipsam, sicut diximus in diuisione, et cum eo quod praemissum est.	So then take care of it as we have said in the division, and along with it what has been stated above.
Â¶ De sectione super Vermes generatos sub cute, et dicitur Aegritudo bouina.	Regarding the section about worms that are generated under the skin, and it is called "aegritudo bouina".
Caput XCIIII.	Chapter LXXVIII.
Haec Aegritudo nominatur in quadam terra apud nos Aegritudo bouina: propterea, quia multotiens accidit bouibus, et est uermis paruus unus, qui nascitur inter cutem et carnem.	This disease is called in some region "aegritudo bouina" because it often happens to cattle and is a bare patch [of skin] one inch long that arises between the skin and flesh.
Et uadit in corpore toto, ascendendo et descendendo: et ostenditur sensui apud ambulationem eius de membro ad membrum, donec disrumpit ubicumque disrumpit in cute locum, et egreditur.	And it was shown in the whole body, going up and down: and it was evident to the sense in its walking with a limb from one limb to another, until it breaks off wherever it breaks off in the skin, and comes out.
Et generatio eius est ex putredine quorundam humorum.	And its generation is from the decay of certain kinds of food.
Sicut accidunt uermes et serpentes, id est, lumbrici, et ascarides in uentre.	As happen worms and snakes, that is, earthworms and roundworms in the belly.
Et timetur ex malicia eius.	And they fear its malice.
Quia quando ipse uadit in corpore, et eleuatur ad caput, et peruenit ad locum: tunc fortasse aperit in eo, et egreditur, et destruit oculum: et accidit illud multotiens.	Because when it is being shown in the body and it is lifted up to the head, and it reaches a place: then perhaps it opens within it and comes out, and destroys the eye: and this happens often.
Cum ergo uis curare eum, et extrahere ipsum, tunc non fit illud nisi apud ambulationem eius, et apparitionem ipsius sensui.	So then you must care for him and extract it, then he will not make that injury except by walking on it and feeling it.
Oportet ergo, ut stringas quod est supra eum, et quod est sub eo cum ligamento constrictione forti.	It is necessary therefore that you should hold up what is above him, and what is under him with strong constriction.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then dry over it, and extract it.
Quod si profundatur in carne, et non inuenis ipsum: tunc pone super locum cauterium cum igne, donec moriatur.	That if it penetrates the flesh, and not injure itself: then place on the spot cautery with fire, until it dies.
Et maius quod timetur, est corruptio eius, qua corrumpit oculum, sicut diximus.	And greater is that which is feared, is corruption of it, which corrupts the eye, as we have said.
Si autem uides eum iam peruenisse in capite prope oculum, tunc stringe sub eo supercilium strictura bona.	But if you see it already reaching to the head near the eye, then hold up under it with good strong constriction.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then dry over it, and extract it.
Et oportet ut utatur infirmus mundificatione sui corporis, cum medicinis soluentibus humores putridos malos.	And it is necessary that he should use his own purification of his body, with medicines solu
Et caueat sibi a cibis generantibus putrefactionem.	And guard himself from foods generating corruption.
Â¶ De sectione super aegritudinem Nakir.	Â§ On the section about disease of Nakir.
Caput XCV.	Head 105
Haec aegritudo nominatur in terra nostra Nakir: et est dolor qui accidit in quibusdam membris: deinde permutatur de membro ad membrum.	This disease is called in our land Nakir: and it is a pain that happens to some member: then it passes from one member to another.
Et ego quidem iam uidi ipsum, secundum quod narro tibi.	And I have already seen it myself, according to what I tell you.
Vocatus sum ad mulierem infirmam in quibusdam uillis.	I was called to a woman sick in some wiles.
Et detexit brachium suum, et uidi inflationem paruam in uena funis brachii.	And she lifted up her arm, and I saw swelling in the armpit of the biceps.
Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.	And after an hour had passed, I saw one swelling go up with fire, like that of the skin, going up at her shoulder faster than it could be: so as to be like flowing silver, when it runs from place to place.
Recessit ergo dolor ex illo loco, et fixus est in humero.	So then the pain left that place, and was fixed in the shoulder.
Deinde sedi hora una, et cucurrit in reliquum corpus, donec perueniret in brachium aliud.	Then she sat for an hour, and it ran in the remaining body, until it reached another arm.
Deinde narrauit mihi, quia reuoluebatur in toto corpore suo, secundum quod uidi.	Then she told me, that all over her body it was going away, according to what I saw.
Miratus sum ergo de uelocitate permutationis eius de membro ad membrum.	I am therefore amazed at the speed with which he moved from one member to another.
Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.	And indeed before that I had not seen this disease in my eyes in such a way.
Verumtamen uidi multos, qui inueniunt dolorem permutari de membro ad membrum: et non uidi ipsum oculis, sicut uidi eum in muliere.	However, I saw many who were suffering from pain moving from one member to another; and I did not see him with my eyes as I saw him in a woman.
Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quod mulier fuit ex illis qui sunt ex uillis sicci corporis detectarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui illa uentositas permutata.	And I do not think that it was because he was a man, since a woman was among those who were suffering from dry blisters on their legs; therefore, this sensation seems to be due to the movement of blisters.
Et est necesse, ut non appareant secundum hanc rationem in illis qui sunt deliciosi, et corporibus humidis, occultarum uenarum.	And it is necessary so that it does not appear in this way in those who are delicate and have moist bodies, hidden blisters.
Cum ergo uis curationem eius, et sentit patiens illud dolorem: tunc si est apparens tibi oculo, sicut diximus, tunc stringe supra ipsum, et sub ipso uelociter: et seca supra ipsum, donec egrediatur illa uentositas coartata: et cauteriza locum.	When you apply the cure to him and the patient feels this pain: then if it appears to your eyes as we have said, then gently press on top of him, and quickly dry out on top of him, until this movement is restrained: and cauterize the place.
Si autem non uides ipsum oculis tuis: tunc cura ipsum cum excussione corporis, et cum eo quod expellit uentositates, et carminat eas cum pillulis foetidis, et pillulis de serapino, et similibus.	If, however, you do not see him with your eyes: then apply the cure to his body with an Excursion, and with it drive away the blisters, and make them turn red with bitter pills, and pills of serapeum, and similar ones.
Â¶ De extractione Sagittarum.	On the extraction of Arrow-fish
Caput XCVI.	Chapter LXVI on the head
Sagittae diuersificantur secundum species suas, et secundum loca in quibus cadunt ex corpore.	The Arrows differ according to their species, and according to the places in which they are found in the body.
Earum uero diuersitas est: quoniam ex eis sunt quae habent cuspides magnos, et paruos: et concauae, et surdae.	However, there are different kinds of arrows: for some have large points and sharp ones; others are curved, and some are straight.
Et ex eis sunt quae habent tres angulos.	And among them are those that have three angles.
Et ex eis quibus sunt linguae.	And among them are the tongues.
Et ex eis quibus sunt astellae.	And among them are the arrows.
Illae uero quae sunt secundum membra in quibus cadunt, est secundum duos modos.	However, those that fall on different members of the body, are according to two ways.
Aut enim membra sunt ex membris principalibus concauis, sicut cerebrum, et cor, et epar, et pulmo, et renes, et intestina, et uesica, et eis similia.	Or, since the members are from the main members that are curved, such as the brain, and the heart, and the liver, and the lung, and the kidneys, and the intestines, and the bladder, and those similar to them:
Quando ergo cadit in aliquo horum membrorum, et apparent tibi signa mortis, quae ego narro tibi post, tunc oportet ut deuites extractionem illius sagittae ex eis, nam mors consequitur illum in quo est, in pluribus dispositionibus.	When then falls in any of these limbs, and appear to you the signs of death, which I will tell you afterwards, then it is necessary that you extract from them this arrow, for death follows him in which he is, in many dispositions.
Et quando non apparent tibi ista signa mala, et sagitta non est absconsa in profunditate membri, tunc extrahe ipsam, et cura uulnus.	And when these bad signs do not appear to you, and the arrow is not hidden deep in the limb, then extract it, and take care of the wound.
Ex signis enim cerebri quando cadit in eo sagitta, et penetrat os, et egreditur siphac quod est super cerebrum, est: quoniam accidunt ex illo soda uehemens, et scotomia, et uertigo, et rubedo in oculis, et inflatio, et rubedo linguae, et spasmus, et permixtio intellectus, et uomitus cholerae.	For when the signs of the brain fall in it, and the arrow penetrates the bone, and comes out above the brain, it is: because from this there happen violent headaches, and scotoma, and dizziness, and redness in the eyes, and swelling, and reddening of the tongue, and spasms, and confusion of thought, and amnesia of cholera.
Et fortasse egreditur sanguis ex naribus, aut auribus.	And perhaps it comes out blood from the nostrils, or from the ears.
Et fortasse abscinditur sermo, et destruitur uox.	And perhaps is severed speech, and destroyed word.
Et egreditur ex loco uulneris humiditas alba similis pulti.	And comes out from the wound place a white moisture similar to pus.
Et exit ex eo simile aquositati carnis.	And comes out from it a liquid similar to meat water.
Si ergo apparent tibi ista signa, tunc abstine a curatione, et extrahe sagittam si non egreditur.	If then appear to you these signs, then refrain from cure, and extract the arrow if it does not come out.
Signa autem sagittae quando cadit in corde, sunt: quod ipsa est prope mammillam sinistram: et sentit cum ea quasi ipsa sit fixa in re dura, non in re uacua.	The signs of the arrow when it falls in the heart, are: that it is near the left nipple: and feels as if it were fixed in a hard thing, not in a soft one.
Et fortasse sagittae est motus similis motui pulsus: et currit ex uulnere sanguis niger.	And perhaps the arrow has a movement similar to pulsation: and black blood runs from the limb.
Et sequitur illud frigus extremitatum, et sudor frigidus, et syncopis.	And follows it this cold in extremities, and cold sweat, and fainting.
Scias ergo, quod mors descendit procul dubio.	Know then, that death has certainly come.
Et signum sagittae quando uulnerat pulmonem, est exitus sanguinis spumosi ex uulnere: et uasa quae sequuntur collum, apostematur, et mutatur color infirmi.	And the sign of the arrow when it wounds the lung, is the exit of frothy blood from the limb: and the veils which follow the neck, are torn, and change color, nurse.
Et expirat spiritum magnum, altum: et quaerit attractionem aeris frigidi.	And breathes a great, strong breath: and seeks cold air.
Quod si cadat sagitta in uelamen, quod est in pectore: tunc est prope costas paruas: et fit anhelitus magnus cum dolore uehementi, cum suspirio: et mouentur omnia membra humerorum.	If the arrow falls into the breast, which is within the chest: then it is near the ribs: and a great anxiety with intense pain, with sighing: and all the limbs of the shoulders move.
Et si cadat sagitta in stomachum, tunc fortasse egreditur ex uulnere ex cibo aliquid indigestum.	And if the arrow hits the belly, then perhaps it will discharge something indigger from food.
Et si cadit sagitta in Ventrem, et figitur in eo: egreditur aliquid stercoris ex uulnere, aut zirbum, aut intestinum quod iam disruptum est.	And if the arrow falls into the Belly, and is fixed there: it will discharge something of dung from the ulcer, or a rib, or an intestine which has already been torn.
Non est ergo spes in curatione eius, neque in extractione sagittae.	There is then no hope for its cure, nor for the extraction of the arrow.
Quod si sagitta cadat in Vesicam, et egrediatur urina: et procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, et fortior sit dolor super infirmum: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	If the arrow falls into the Bladder and discharges urine: and it proceeds from it something to the outside, and the pain is stronger over the sick one: then you know that it is fatal.
Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.	The rest of the limbs, such as the face, and the neck, and the throat, and the tools, and the aid, and the spinal column, and the forks, and the hip, and the leg, and those similar from the body are saved according to many dispositions: when the arrow does not hit an artery or a nerve: and there is no deadly arrow.
Et ego narro tibi quod uidi de esse harum sagittarum, ut significes per illud super curationem tuam.	And I tell you that I saw such things of these arrows, so that it indicates through it about your cure.
Quod est, quia cuidam uiro cecidit sagitta in lachrymali oculi eius, in radice nasi.	That is, because a certain man the arrow fell into his lacrimal eye, at the root of his nose.
Extraxi ergo eam ipsi ex parte altera, sub adipe auris eius: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei in oculo eius nocumentum.	So I extracted it from him on the other side, with fat from his ear: and he was healed, and there did not come to him any harm in his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam Iudaeo, quae cecidit ei in adipe oculi sui sub palpebra inferiori: et sagitta iam occultata erat, et non consecutus sum ex ea nisi extremitatem paruam eius, cum qua adhaeret in ligno suo: et erat sagitta magna ex sagittis arcuum Turcorum, cum ferro leni, in qua non sunt aures.	And I extracted another arrow from the Jew, which had fallen into his fat eye under his eyelid: and the arrow was already hidden, and I did not succeed to get it out except by its small end, by which it was attached to its wood: and it was a great arrow of the arrows of the Turks, with a soft iron, in which there were no ears.
Sanatus est ergo Iudaeus, et non accidit in oculo eius accidens malum.	He is a Jew, and no accident has befallen his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam ex gutture Christiani.	And I drew out another arrow from the throat of a Christian.
Et erat sagitta arabica, et est illa cui sunt aures.	And it was an Arabic arrow, and that one has ears.
Secui ergo super ipsam inter duas guidegi: et iam submersa erat in gutture eius.	So I drew two arrows against her, and already one had been submerged in his throat.
Subtiliatus sum ergo cum ea, donec extraxi eam: et sanatus est Christianus.	I was subtle with her until I pulled her out: and the Christian remained healthy.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam uiro quae ceciderat in uentre eius: et cogitauimus, quia moreretur ex ea.	And I drew out another arrow from a man who had fallen on his belly: and we thought that he would die of it.
Postquam ergo praeterierunt ei triginta dies, et non mutatum est super eum aliquid ex dispositionibus eius, secui super sagittam: et ingeniaui super eam, et extraxi eam: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei accidens malum.	After that I had left him for thirty days, and nothing was changed in his body from his disposition, I drew out the arrow against him: and I was clever with it, and pulled it out: and he remained healthy, and no accident happened to him.
Et uidi uirum cui cecidit sagitta in dorso eius, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam.	And I saw a man to whom the arrow had fallen on his back, and there was a fracture on it.
Postquam ergo fuit post septem annos, exiuit sagitta in radice coxae eius.	After that it was seven years later, the arrow came out of the root of his thigh.
Et uidi mulierem cui cecidit in uentre suo sagitta, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam, et remansit sagitta intra ipsam: et non mutata est ex dispositionibus eius aliqua, et mulier non inuenit ei nocumentum in aliqua ex operationibus suis naturalibus.	And I saw a woman to whom an arrow had fallen into her belly, and there was a fracture on it, and the arrow remained inside her: and she did not change from her disposition in anything, and the woman did not find any harm in any of her natural operations.
Et uidi uirum alium, cui cecidit sagitta in facie sua: et consolidatum est uulnus, et remansit, non inueniens ei multum dolorem: et similia istis multa.	And I saw another man to whom the arrow had fallen on his face, and there was a fracture on it, and it remained, not finding him much pain: and many such things.
Et extraxi sagittam uiro ex principibus Regis, quae ceciderat ei in medio nasi sui, et iam declinauerat ad partem dextram parumper: et occultata erat sagitta tota.	And I drew out the arrow from the prince of the king, which had fallen on his nose, and had already leaned a little towards the right side: and the arrow was completely hidden.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius post casum sagittae usque ad tres dies.	So they called me to cure him after the fall of the arrow for three days.
Inueni ergo uulnus sagittae strictum ualde.	Then I found the arrow's shaft firmly.
Inquisiui ergo eam cum tenta subtili, et non sensi eam: et ipse quidem inueniebat punctionem et dolorem sub aure sua ex parte dextra.	So I asked him what the problem was with it, and I myself felt a prick and pain on his right side.
Speraui ergo, quod erat illa punctio ex extremitate sagittae.	I hoped that it was a spot at the end of the bow.
Emplastraui ergo locum cum emplastro in quo erat uirtus attractiua, et digestiua, confidens apud me, quod apostemaretur locus, et appareret mihi signum sagittae, ut secarem super eam: et non accidit in loco accidens significans quod sagitta consecuta sit locum.	So I hoped that it was a spot at the end of the arrow. So I placed a plaster there which contained the attractive and curative power, confident with myself that the place would heal, and a sign would appear to me, like a mark on the arrow, so that I could cut above it: and did not happen in that place an accident indicating that the arrow had struck the spot.
Assiduaui ergo cum emplastro super eum diebus multis: et non accidit accidens, et consolidatum est uulnus interim: et remansit infirmus de extractione eius spacio dierum, donec sensit sagittam die quodam intra nasum suum.	So I persevered with the plaster for many days: and no accident happened, and the limb healed during that time: and it remained weak from the space of taking it out, until he felt an arrow one day in his nose.
Et narrauit mihi illud.	And he told me about that.
Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno.	So I applied to that limb a sharp medicine, persisting for many days until it was opened up: and when I tried to move it, I felt the tip of an arrow which was sticking in the wood.
Deinde addidi in apertione uulneris per illam medicinam acutam, donec apparuit nobis uisibiliter extremitas sagittae: et praeteriit mihi cum eo spacium temporis circiter quatuor menses.	Then I added to the opening of the wound by that sharp medicine, until we could see clearly the tip of the arrow: and passed by with me about a space of four months.
Deinde postquam amplificatum est uulnus, et possible fuit mihi intromittere forcipes in ipsam, et mouere ipsam, et non obediuit ad exitum: tunc non cessaui subtiliare, et ingeniare super eam cum modis ingeniorum, donec coepi super eam die quodam cum forcipibus decenter factis, secundum quod ueniet forma eorum in fine capituli, donec extraxi eam.	Then after the limb had grown bigger, and seemed to me to be able to put my fingers into it, and to move it, but did not yield to departure: then I did not cease to soften, and to contrive over it with modes of contrivance, until one day I came upon it with bent forforks, according as their shape appeared in the end of the cap: so that I took it out.
Deinde restauraui uulnus.	Then I restored the limb.
Et medici quidem iudicant, quod cartilago nasi non restauratur.	And some doctors say, that the cartilage of the nose is not restored.
Restauraui ergo ipsam, et consolidatum est uulnus, et sanatus est infirmas sanitate integra: nec nocuit ei aliquid omnino.	So I restored it, and the limb healed, and the illness was completely healed by a sound health: and did him no harm at all.
Et ego narro tibi qualitatem extractionis quarundam sagittarum: ut ponas illud regulam et significationem super illud quod non dixi.	And I tell you about the quality of extraction of certain arrows: that you put that rule and sign on it which I did not say.
Quoniam partes huius artis et distinctiones earum non comprehenduntur cum narratione: neque comprehendit illud liber, et artifex prudens comparat cum pauco super multum: et cum eo quod est paesens, super illud quod est absens: et inuenit operationem nouam, et instrumentum nouum apud descensus rerum extranearum huius artis quando accidunt.	For the parts of this art and their distinctions are not included when they are told; nor does that book include them, and a prudent craftsman compares little with much: and as it is painful, he includes what is absent: and he finds a new operation, and a new instrument from the descent of foreign things of this art when they happen.
Dico ergo, quod sagittae non egrediuntur ex membris quibus sunt fixae, nisi secundum duos modos.	I say then, that arrows do not come out of the body where they are fixed, except according to two ways.
Aut per attractionem ex loco ex quo intrauit.	Or by attraction from the place from which it entered.
Aut contrario partis alterius.	Or by the other part of the opposite side.
Et illa quae egreditur unde intrauit, aut est sagitta procedens in loco carnoso: et attrahitur, et egreditur.	And that which comes out from where it entered, or is an arrow going in a fleshly place: and is attracted, and goes out.
Quod si non obedit ad exitum ex hora in qua cadit: tunc oportet ut dimittas ipsam aliquot diebus, donec putrefiat caro quae est in circumitu eius: et alleuietur attractio eius, et eius egressio.	That if it does not submit to going out at the time at which it falls: then you must let it go for a few days, until the flesh that is around it Rotates: and its attraction will be relieved, and its exit.
Et similiter si figitur in osse, et non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc dimitte ipsam etiam aliquot diebus: et itera eam cum attractione et motione omni die, donec egreditur.	And likewise if it is lodged in a bone, and does not submit to you to go out, then let it go also for a few days: and again every day with its attraction and movement until it goes out.
Quod si non obedit tibi ad exitum post dies, tunc oportet ut perfores in circumitu sagittae in ipso osse ab omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificentur sagittae.	That if it does not submit to you to go out after a few days, then you must cut off the arrow in the bone from all parts with a sharp tool, until it grows larger.
Deinde attrahe eam, et extrahe ipsam.	Then attract it, and pull it out.
Si autem sagitta est fixa in capitis osse, et iam processit in uno uentrium cerebri, et apparent ex infirmo quaedam illorum accidentium quae dixi: tunc abstine ab attractione sagittae, et dimitte eam, donec aequetur esse eius post dies.	If on the other hand the arrow is fixed in the bone of the skull, and has already gone into one of the vents of the brain, and there appears to be some of the above accidents that I mentioned: then you should refrain from attracting the arrow, and let it go, until it has been a few days.
Nam si sagitta peruenit ad sifach, tunc mors non prolongatur ei.	For if the arrow reaches the soft membrane, then death is not prolonged for him.
Et si sagitta non est fixa, nisi in corpore ossis tantum, et non penetrat usque ad sifach: et remanet infirmus aliquot diebus, et non accidit ei ex illis accidentibus aliquid: tunc ingenia in attractione sagittae et extractione eius.	And if the arrow is not fixed, except in the body of a bone, and does not penetrate until the soft membrane: and remains weak for a few days, and nothing happens to him from those accidents: then use your cunning in attracting the arrow and extracting it.
Si autem est fixa ualde, et non obedit tibi ad attractionem: tunc administra terebella in circumitu sagittae, sicut narraui tibl: deinde cura locum, donec sanetur.	If it is firmly fixed and does not submit to you for drawing: then apply terebellies around the arrowhead as you have been told; afterwards care for the wound until it heals.
Si autem Sagitta iam absconsa est in loco corporis, et occultatur et absconditur a sensu: tunc inquire eam cum tenta.	If the arrow is already deeply embedded in the body, hidden and concealed from sensation: then feel for it with your hand.
Si autem sentis eam, tunc attrahe eam cum quibusdam instrumentis quae conueniunt attractioni eius.	If you can feel it, then draw it out with some instruments suitable for attracting it.
Si autem non potes super eam, propter constrictionem uulneris, et propter longitudinem sagittae in profundo: et non est illic os, neque neruus, neque uena: tunc finde super eam, donec amplificetur uulnus, et sit possibile extrahere sagittam.	If you cannot reach it, because of the constriction of the wound and the length of the arrow in the depth: and there is no bone or nerve or vessel there: then feel along it until the girth of the arrow increases, and it becomes possible to pull out the arrow.
Quod si sunt ei aures quibus teneatur, tunc libera carnem fixam in eis ab omni parte, omni ingenio quo potes illud, et ingenia, si non potest super euasionem carnis in fractura aurium, et contorsione earum, donec euadat.	That if there are any ears which hold it fast, then free the meat from within them by all means you can, and by any devices you have: if it is not possible to remove the meat from the broken ears, or from their twisting, until it has healed.
Et tu quando administras extractionem Sagittae, in quocumque loco est, tunc utere contorsione manus tuae, cum forficibus ad partes omnes, donec facias eam euadere: et subtilia ultima subtilitate, ut non frangatur Sagita, et fiat difficilis tibi attractio eius, et ipsius extractio.	And you, when you carry out the extraction of the arrow, wherever it is, then use your twisted hand with forceps to all parts, until you have made it heal: and with the greatest care, so that the arrow does not break, and it becomes difficult for you to attract it, and to extract it.
Quod si non potes super eam ex hora una, tunc dimitte eam diebus aliquot, donec putrefiant quae sunt in circumitu eius.	That if you cannot reach it in one hour, then leave it for a few days, until those which are around it rot.
Deinde itera eam: alleuietur enim tuncia Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra quod diximus ex curatione in capitulo suo: et custodi uirtutem tuam ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, aut chordae.	Then try again: for it is a relief if you have blood flow opposite to you, then carry out what we said in our book on treatment: and guard your skill from cutting bone or nerve or tendon.
Et administra ingenium omni modo quo tibi possibile est euasionis Sagittae: et sit illud cum facilitate, et tranquillitate, uel tarditate, et firmitate, sicut narraui tibi.	And carry out the extraction of the arrow by any means which you can: and let it be with ease, and with peace, or tardiness, and with firmness, as I have told you.
Et oportet, ut facias cum trahis Sagittam, ut infirmus sit secundum figuram, secundum quam fuit apud casum Sagittae in ipso.	And it is necessary that, when you draw out the arrow, you make it so that the injured person walks with a limp, according to the position of the arrow when it entered the body.
Quoniam est magis iuuatiuum.	For this reason it is more difficult.
Si autem non est tibi possibile illud, tunc administra quod tibi est possibile ex figuris.	If, however, you are unable to do so, then administer what you can from the figures.
Sagitta autem quae egreditur ex contrario partis alterius, aut iam procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora: aut facit gibbositatem extremitas Sagittae per sensum ex superiore parte cutis propinquae, et uides eam eminentem: seca ergo super eam, et sit sectio secundum quantitatem quod capiant in ea forcipes.	But the arrow that comes from the opposite side or has already passed from it: or does it feel a bulge on the top of the skin near it, and see it sticking out: then cut off the top part of it, and make a second cut according to the amount that is held in it by the arrows.
Deinde attrahe eam: ipsa namque fit facilis ad exitum.	Then attract it: for it becomes easier to come out.
Si uero retinetur in osse, tunc torque manum tuam secundum rotunditatem, donec imprimat Sagitta in osse, et amplificet sibiipsi: deinde trahe ipsam.	If, however, it is held in the bone, then twist your hand according to its roundness, until the arrow presses against the bone and increases its own force: then draw it out.
Et si non: dimitte eam diebus aliquot: deinde itera eam, donec egrediatur.	And if not: leave it for a few days: then try again, until it comes out.
Quod si lignum Sagittae est in ea, tunc impelle ipsam cum eo.	That if the arrow of the bow is in it, then push it with it.
Si autem cecidit lignum, et uis administrare impulsionem: tunc intromitte ad eam instrumentum concauum, ut ingrediatur concauitas eius in caudam Sagittae: deinde impelle eam cum ipso.	If, however, it has fallen and you are able to apply an impulse: then introduce the instrument that is sharp, so that it enters into the end of the arrow: then push it with it.
Si autem Sagita est concaua, tunc impelle eam cum instrumento intrante in ipsam.	If, however, the arrow is pressed together, then push it with the instrument that enters into it.
Sagitta enim alleuiatur per illud.	For the arrow lightens through that.
Quod si Sagitta est toxicata, tunc oportet, ut concaues carnem totam, in qua est uenenum: si est tibi possibile illud.	That if the arrow is poisoned, then you should, so that it enters into all the flesh, in which there is poison: if possible for you to do this.
Deinde cura eam cum eo quod conuenit ad illud.	Then take care of it with him when it comes to that.
Quod si Sagitta est cadens in pectore, aut in uentre, aut in uesica, aut in latere: et est propinqua ex eo quod tangis cum tenta, et possibile est tibi secare super eam: tunc seca, et caue ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, et extrahe eam.	That if the arrow is falling in the breast, or in the belly, or in the groin, and it is near to that which you touch when you try, and it is possible for you to cut off from it: then cut off, and be careful not to make a wound on the flesh, or on the nerve, and pull it out.
Deinde sue uulnus, si uides, et cura illud, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the wound, if you see it, and take care of that, until it heals.
Et haec est forma Forcipum, quibus extrahuntur Sagittae.	And this is the form of the forceps, with which the arrows are extracted.
Sint extremitates similes rostro auis, quae factae sunt sicut ferra: quando capiunt super Sagittam, non dimittunt eam.	They have tips similar to a beak, made like iron; when they grasp onto an arrow, they don't let go of it.
Et fiunt ex eis species multae, magnae, et paruae, et mediae, secundum quantitatem magnitudinis Sagittae, et paruitatis eius, et amplitudinis uulneris, et constrictionis eius.	And there are many kinds of them, large and small and medium-sized, according to the size and width of the arrow and the depth of the wound and the constriction.
Forma Impellentis concaui.	I have also found forceps that are bent at one end and straight at the other,
Et forma Impellentis surdi.	And the form of the forceps that is thick is
Hoc est surdae extremitatis sicut Radius, ut alleuietur introitus eius in sagittam concauam, et impellatur cum eo.	This is the end of the forceps that is wide like a radius, so that it can guide itself into the concavity of the arrow, and it pushes with it.
Huius extremitas impellentis concauae est concaua sicut penna auis: ut alleuietur introitus sagittae in ipsam et impulsio eius.	The end of the forceps that is bent is curved like a feather's beak, so that it can guide itself into the arrow's concavity and its movement.

Â¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Guidegi.	On the phlebotomy of the nose and eyes.

But of the two phlebotomies of Guideius there is a difference: one is for constricting the hot flux, and the incipiency of leprous diseases, melancholic affections, impetigo, and bad sores, and corrosive ulcerations, that is to say, venesections.

Â¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Algeberich.	On phlebotomy by Albucasis.
Venae autem Algeberich phlebotomiae iuuamentum est: quia confert ad alcolam in ore, et corruptionem gingiuae: et ulcera mala: et fissuras labiorum, et ulcera mala, etiam quae sunt in naso, et in circumitu eius.	But the phlebotomy of Al-Ghabiri is a means to bring about drunkenness in the mouth and corruption of the tongue; and bad sores; and cracks of the lips, and also those bad sores which are in the nose and around it.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est, ut facias sedere infirmum coram te: et stringe collum eius cum uitta.	And the quality of this phlebotomy is that you make the sick person sit before you; and tighten his neck with a strap.
Deinde reuolue labium eius, et aspice ad duas uenas: quarum una est a dextera labii, et secunda a sinistra eius: et demonstratio utriusque est per nigredinem ambarum.	Then turn the lips of the person; and look at the two veins; one is on the right side of the lip, and the other is on the left side of it; and the indication of both is by the color of amber.
Et illud uerum est: quia in circumitu earum sunt uenae minutae, nigrae.	And this is true: because there are small veins around them, black.
Incide ergo utramque incisione incidente.	So cut one of them with the other one.
Si autem dubitatio est super te, et non scis quae earum est: tunc intende ad incisionem maioris earum, et ipsarum manifestiorem.	But if there is doubt about you, and you don't know which of them is which; then turn to the incision that is bigger than them, and more apparent.
Et similiter fac de duabus uenis quae sunt in labio superiore: et plurimum quidem currit consuetudo cum eo: et incide duas uenas quae sunt in labio inferiori.	And also make the same thing with the two veins that are in the upper lip: and much more, because custom is used to it; and cut the two veins that are in the lower lip.
Â¶ De phlebotomia Venae sub lingua post Cephalicae phlebotomiam.	On phlebotomy Veins under the tongue after phlebotomy of the head.
Duarum uero Venarum quae sunt sub lingua phlebotomiae iuuamentum: est, quod phlebotomia Cephalicae est ad praefocationes quae sunt in gutture, et aegritudinem uuulae, et aegritudines oris.	But the two veins that are under the tongue certainly require phlebotomy; because phlebotomy of the head is to remove the phlegm that is in the throat, and the disease of the throat, and the disease of the mouth.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est, ut sedeat infirmus inter manus tuas coram sole: et eleualinguam eius, et aspice sub lingua a latere eius uno uenam, et a latere eius alio uenam: et color utriusque decliuis ad nigredinem.	And the quality of phlebotomizing them is that the sick person sits between your hands in front of the sun; and eat his tongue, and look at the two veins on one side of the mouth, and the other vein on the other side: and the color of both should turn to black.
Phlebotoma ergo utramque: et custodi, ne ultimes manum tuam in phlebotomando eas.	So phlebotomize one and then the other; and guard, so that you don't put your hand on them when you are phlebotomizing them.
Nam sub eius sunt arteriae, et fortasse accidet fluxus sanguinis ex illis arteriis.	For there are arteries under them, and perhaps it happens that the flow of blood from these arteries is stopped.
Â¶ De tribus Venis in cubito.	Of the three veins in the cubit.
Venae autem tres quae phlebotomantur in cubito, sunt in quarum phlebotomia cucurrit consuetudo in omnibus hominibus.	But the three veins that are phlebotomized in the cubit, are those in which phlebotomy was customary in all people.
Et phlebotomia earum fit secundum duos modos.	And phlebotomy from them is made according to two ways.
Aut pungendo cum phlebotomo myrtino lato: aut oliuari ad subtilitatem decliui: aut secando cum phlebotomo cultellari, et est Alnesil.	Or by pricking with the phlebotomist on the side: or by oiling to the subtlety of the decline: or by cutting with the phlebotomist with a razor, and it is Anesiac.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is his form.
Sic Alnesil est, quod conuenit ad sectionem.	Thus Anesiac is, which is convenient to the section.
Et ex eis sunt species latae, et subtiles secundum amplitudinem uenarum et stricturam earum Forma phlebotomi myrtini sit lata, sicut uides.	And from them are species wide, and subtle according to the amplitude of the veins and their form Phlebotomy with a Myrtle sits wide, like you see.
Et conuenit ad aperiendas uenas concauas, plenas, procedentes, apparentes, grossas, et illas quae continent sanguinem grossum, turbidum.	And it is convenient to open the veins closed, full, flowing, apparent, thick, and those which contain the gross blood, turbulent.
Et iste phlebotomus est minoris latitudinis, et subtilioris extreminatis.	And this phlebotomist is of less amplitude, and subtler extremities.
Et conuenit ad phlebotomiam uenarum subtilium, quae continent sanguinem subtilem citrinum	And it is convenient to phlebotomy from the veins that contain the subtle citrines blood,
Â¶ De phlebotomia Basilicae.	Of the Phlebotomy of the Basilica.
Basilicae autem quae est una harum trium uenarum phlebotomiae iuuamentum est.	But the basilica which is one of the three veins phlebotomy, the iuuamentum of it is.
Quia extrahit sanguinem ex aegritudinibus, quae sunt sub gutture et collo, ex eo quod sequitur pectus, et uentrem: et conuenit phlebotomatori cum phlebotomat eam, ut caueat, et sit super timorem ex ea nam sub ea est arteria.	Because it draws blood from the diseases which are under the throat and neck, from which follows the chest and abdomen: and it is convenient for the phlebotomist to make a cut with the phlebotome from her, so that he may not hurt, and sit over the fear from her, because there is an artery under her.
Si ergo errat, et addit in punctura phlebotomi, incidet illam arteriam, et accidet fluxus sanguinis.	If then he should make a mistake, and adds to the cut of the phlebotomy, he will strike that artery, and will spill out the blood flow.
Quapropter oportet, ne phlebotomet eam cum phlebotomo pungente: imo sit secans cum Alnesil.	Therefore it is convenient, so as not to phlebotomize her with a cut of the phlebotome: but sit cutting with Anesiac.
Quod si non apparet Basilica apparitione manifesta, tunc oportet, ut alienes ipsam, et permuteris ad aliam, aut quaeras aliquem ramum eius: aut phlebotomes loco eius Funem brachii.	That if not the Basilica appears by a manifest sign, then it is necessary, so as to remove her away, and turn to another, or seek some branch of it: or phlebotomize in the place of her, with a string of the brachial artery.
Ipsa enim est manifesta, et seca eam cum phlebotomo Anesil, sicut diximus.	For this reason it is apparent, and I will dry it with the phlebotome Anesil, as we have said.
Si autem uis phlebotomiam ipsius eiusdem, tunc oportet ante stricturam brachii, ut tangas locum, donec cognoscas locum pulsus.	But if you wish to use the phlebotome of itself, then you should approach it before the stricture of the arm, so that you may touch the place, until you recognize the pulsation.
Deinde signa super locum cum encaustro, postea brachium, et seca uenam sectione concaua cum phlebotomo Alnesil, sicut diximus.	Then mark the spot with caustice, then the arm as well, and dry it up with the phlebotome Anesil in a compressed section, as we have said.
Et caue ne cadat percussio per spacium a loco arteriae.	And let it not fall on the pulsation through space from the site of the artery.
Et quando uides, cum tu stringis ligamen, inflationem in loco quem signasti cum encaustro, tunc illa inflatio est inflatio arteriae: deuita ergo eam.	And when you see that, as you tighten the ligament, there is swelling in the place that you marked with caustic, then that swelling is the swelling of the artery; so remove it.
Quod si uides sanguinem apud phlebotomiam salire, sicut urina pueri, et est sanguis subtilis, rubeus: tunc scias, quia est ex sanguine arteriae.	That if you see the blood rise up at phlebotomy, like a boy's urine, and it is thin blood, red in color: then you will know that it is from the blood of the artery.
Tunc ergo propera, et pone digitum tuum super ipsum spacio longo, deinde aufer digitum tuum.	Then draw near, and place your finger on the spot for a long space, then remove your finger.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis (multotiens namque abscinditur) tunc stringe brachium, et dimitte ipsum: et caueat infirmus a motione eius: et sit super timorem eius.	But if the blood is cut off (for it is often cut off) then tighten the arm, and let go of itself: and let there be rest from its motion: and let it lie in fear for it.
Et non moueat ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	And let not the patient move for a few days, until he is healed.
Si autem non abscinditur sanguis, et uincit te: et non est tibi praesens in momento tuo medicina, tunc incide arteriam, si apparet tibi.	But if the blood does not go away, and it hurts you: and is not present for you in the moment of your need; then cut the artery, if it appears to you.
Nam extremitates eius contrahuntur, et abscinditur sanguis.	For its extremities do quiver, and the blood is cut off.
Aut accipe corticem fistici, et finde eum: accipe medietatem unam, et stringe eam super locum uenae strictura decenti, cum ligamento et puluillis usque ad diem alium.	Or take the skin of the fist, and find it; or take half, and tighten it over the place of the stricture descending, with a ligament and dust up to another day.
Tunc si abscinditur sanguis, est bonum.	Then if the blood is cut off, it is good.
Et si non: tunc cura ipsum cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio ex loco puluerum abscindentium fluxum sanguinis: et abscisio sanguinis eius non est difficilis in pluribus dispositionibus, propter locum paruum uulneris, et possibilitatem ligamenti ex brachio.	Then if not: then take care of the patient with his own recollections from the place where the blood has been cut off: and cutting off its blood is not difficult in many dispositions, because of the small wound, and the possibility of a ligament from the arm.
Â¶ De phlebotomia uenae Fuscae.	On the venesection of the brown-colored blood.
Venae autem Fuscae phlebotomiae iuuamentum est, quod trahit sanguinem ex superiori parte capitis, et inferiore corporis: propterea, quia est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae, sicut diximus.	But the venesection of the brown-colored blood is a procedure that draws blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body: indeed, it is composed of the branch of the Basilica and the branch of the Cephalica, as we have said.
Et conuenit phlebotomanti eam, ut sit super timorem ex phlebotomia eius, nam sub ea est neruus.	And it is fitting that the venesection should be made by one who is not afraid of phlebotomy, for under her is a nerve.
Si ergo addit in punctura phlebotomi, et inuenit neruum, accidit in ea stupor, et difficilis fit sanatio eius, et fortasse non sanatur penitus.	If therefore you add phlebotomy to the puncture, and find a nerve, there will be stupor in her, and the cure of her is difficult, and perhaps she will not be completely cured.
Et iste neruus multotiens apparet sensui.	And this nerve appears often to the sense.
Si autem occultatur in quibusdam hominibus, et est subtilis, et non ostenditur: tunc oportet ut ponas phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas, sectionem cum Alnesil, et deuita neruum cum fortitudine tua.	But if it is hidden in some people and is subtle and does not show itself: then you should put your venesection so that the phlebotomist makes a section with Alnecil and Î±ÏÎ¿Î¼Î±ÎºÏÏÎ½Î¸ÎµÎ¯ÏÎµ from neruam with your strength.
Quod si uena est inter duos neruos, tunc finde uenam in longitudine.	That if the vein is between two nerves, then find the vein in length.
Â¶ De uena Cephalica.	On the cerebral vein.
Phlebotomiae autem uenae Cephalicae iuuamentum est, quia attrahit sanguinem ex capite, et confert ad aegritudines oculorum.	But the procedure for venesection of the cerebral vein is that it draws blood from the head and renders the diseases of the eyes.
Et oportet in hac uena proprie, si uis, ut phlebotomes eam pungendo cum phlebotomo oliuari, aut cum phlebotomo myrtino: quoniam est saluior uenarum omnium, quoniam non est subea arteria, neque neruus.	And it is fitting in this vein to use your own, if you wish, so that you venesection it with a phlebotomizer and oil, or with a phlebotomizer and myrrh: for this vein is salutari of all veins, because it is not subcutanea artery, nor is there a nerve.
Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.	But it is fitting for you to go to venesection, so that you have the head only of a pig, and ask for a softer place: and it does not harm him, if it is not found with a blow first, so that it returns over it with phlebotomy sometimes.
Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.	But perhaps he is blistered in some people when he is not phlebotomized in a blow first, but it does not harm him that blister, but that blister hurts him in a certain thing.
Â¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis.	On the usefulness of phlebotomy and precautions to be taken when performing it.
Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare.	The quality of phlebotomy and the complications that may arise from it are what you should consider carefully in its correction.
Primum ergo illius est de quo oportet ut scias, quod phlebotomia non administratur, nisi in conseruatione sanitatis, et perseuerantia eius, et cautela ab aduentu aegritudinum.	First therefore of its concerns is that you should know that phlebotomy is not performed unless for the preservation of health, and perseverance in it, and caution against the advent of illnesses.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum trium quae sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica.	And so that phlebotomy be made from one of three veins which are in the bed, namely the cerebral, and the femoral, and the bazilica.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in principio Veris super ieiunium, in uere, et aestate: et autumno, et hyeme post comestionem, quando apparent significationes repletionis.	And so that phlebotomy be made at the beginning of the day on a fasting stomach, in summer, and autumn, and winter after digestion, when the signs of fullness are evident.
Et fiat phlebotomia in die primo, aut in tertio, postquam praeterierint de die tres horae.	And let phlebotomy be made on the first day, or on the third day, having elapsed three hours after the end of the day.
Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quando prouocat conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.	But phlebotomy that is administered in illnesses does not have a determined hour: but when it provokes convenience and necessity towards it, at night, or during the day, and at any hour, and at all times.
Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quatuordecim anni.	And it is not necessary that boys be phlebotomized until they have reached the age of fourteen.
Neque phlebotometur mulier praegnans, nisi a mense quarto usque ad septimum.	Nor should a pregnant woman be phlebotomized until she has reached her seventh month.
Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.	 Nor should seniors who have already passed the age of sixty be phlebotomized.
Cum ergo aliquis uult phlebotomari propter quemcumque modum sit: oportet, ut mundificet intestina sua ante phlebotomiam cum clisteri leni, si in eis est stercus multum retentum: ut non attrahant uenae apud phlebotomiam ex intestinis superfluitates putridas nocentes membris principalibus.	When anyone wishes to undergo phlebotomy for any reason: he should wash his intestines thoroughly before phlebotomy with castor oil, if there is much waste retained in them: so that the veins do not attract uenae, putrid effluents from the intestines, onto the main members.
Neque phlebotometur patiens toctina, id est, satietatem nauseatiuam: neque crapulatus, neque euadens ab ebrietate, donec remoueatur illud ab eis.	Nor should a patient who is convulsed, that is, nauseous, or a drunkard until he has removed the intoxication from himself.
Neque infirmus cum hydropisi.	Nor an invalid with hydrophobia.
Et caueatur phlebotomia iterum post colicam passionem, et uomitum, et fluxum uentris, et multiplicationem coitus, et laboris, et exercitii, et uigiliarum, et ieiunii, et omnis quod dissoluit uirtutem ex re corporea aut animali.	And let phlebotomy be repeated again after a fever, or a cough, or a flux of blood, or the multiplication of copulation, or labor, or exercise, or vigils, or fasting, or any that dissolves virtue from the corporeal or animal substance.
Deinde considera in subtilitate humorum ante illud, si sanguis est grossus cum cibis et potibus, et medicinis: si possibile est ei illud.	Then consider in subtlety of humors before that, if blood is thick with food and drink, and medicines: if possible to him that.
Deinde introeat balneum, si non prohibet ipsum aliquid: aut exercitetur aliquo exercitio, ut subtilietur sanguis.	Then introduce steam, if it does not forbid itself anything: or exercise himself with some exercise, that the blood be subtilized.
Et pone phlebotomiam eius in pectore, circa tertiam diei, sicut diximus: et conare, ut euacuetur pectus eius illa die ex omnibus accidentibus animalibus malis: sicut angustia, et ira, et timor: et ex omnibus accidentibus corporeis, sicut labor, et poena, et superfluicoitus, et illis similia.	And place phlebotomy in his chest, on the third day, as we have said: and be careful, so that his chest is emptied of all animal accidents on that day: such as anger, fear, and pain: and of all bodily accidents, such as labor, punishment, excess, and those like.
Et sedi suae faciat esse praesentes res cum quarum usu cucurrit consuetudo hominum ex aromaticitate, et odoramento, et tripudio et similibus illis per quantitatem possibilitatis.	And let him make these present things his usual use, from which custom of men by the aromatic, and fragrance, and delight, and like things by quantity of possibility.
Deinde sedeat phlebotomator super puluinari, quod sit altius quam puluinar phlebotomandi: postea extrahat brachium suum, et fricet ipsum phlebotomator manu sua bis, aut ter.	Then let the phlebotomist sit on a tray, that it be higher than the phlebotomy tray: then he shall draw out his arm, and rub himself with the phlebotomist's hand twice, or three times.
Deinde stringat ligamentum cum corrigia, et inuoluat eam bis.	Then let him tie a ligature with the thong, and twist it around: then he shall wrap it up twice.
Et sit strictura temperata, quoniam strictura quando est inaequalis, aut per superfluitatem in strictura, tunc prohibet cursum sanguinis: aut in mollificatione, tunc etiam prohibet cursum sanguinis.	And let it be tight and warm, because if it is not equal, or by excess in the constriction, then it forbids the course of blood: or in mildness, then also it forbids the course of blood.
Deinde post stricturam oportet, ut fricet phlebotomandus manus suas simul adinuicem, donec inflentur uenae, et declarentur sensui.	Then after the constriction, let the phlebotomist rub his hands together on both sides, until the veins swell, and present themselves to the sense.
Deinde abstergat phlebotomator phlebotomum cum pauco oleo, antiquo proprie.	Then the phlebotomist shall wipe the phlebotomy with a little oil, old and of his own.
Deinde ponat digitum suum indicem manus sinistrae super ipsam uenam sub loco cuius phlebotomiam uult, parum: ut non fugiat uena, et cassetur percussio.	Then let him place his index finger of his left hand on the vein where he wants to make the phlebotomy, a little: so that the vein does not run away, and the piercing sound.
Quoniam ex uenis est quam inuenis sicut chordam fugientem apud phlebotomiam: et ex eis est quae est plena uentositate: et quando ponis phlebotomum super eam, contrahitur sub phlebotomo, et decipitur phlebotomator, et non aperit phlebotomus uenam: et si aperit eam, est stricta: propter illud ergo oportet, ut firmetur phlebotomator, et sit sollicitus in his rebus omnibus.	For from the veins is it that he draws like a running string during phlebotomy: and those are full of blood: and when you place the phlebotomy on it, it is constricted by the phlebotomy, and deceives the phlebotomist, and does not open the vein: and if it opens it, then it is constricted: so that therefore it is necessary that the phlebotomist should tighten it, and be careful in all these things.
Deinde deponat phlebotomum.	Then let him deposit the phlebotomy.
Si ergo aperitur uena ex uice una, tunc bonum est.	If then a new vein is opened from one side, then it is good.
Et si non, tunc itera illud uice alia sub illo loco parum, aut supra ipsum cum festinatione: si non apostematur locus.	And if not, then repeat that same vein slightly below that place or above it with speed: if the spot does not bleed.
Quod si apostematur, aut expauescit infirmus, tunc dimitte eum die, aut duobus diebus: et non stringat ligamentum.	That if it bleeds, or grows weak, then discharge him for a day, or two days: and do not tie the ligature.
Fortasse enim attrahet apostema calidum.	Perhaps, because the heat of the wound may attract the bleeding.
Neque ingrediatur balneum.	And let him not be bathed in a bath.
Deinde iteret phlebotomiam, si amat.	Then let him repeat the phlebotomy if he wishes it.
Quod si apertio est parua, aut currit sanguis subtiliter: et times ut non egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uis: tunc itera phlebotomum in foramine ipso secundum rectitudinem, et adde in operatione parum.	That if the opening is small, or the blood runs gently: and be careful that not an excessive amount of blood comes out: then repeat the phlebotomy in the same spot according to the direction, and add a little to the procedure.
Et fac illud cum festinatione, antequam apostemetur locus, apostematus enim locus est in multis hominibus apud operationem paruam.	And do so with speed, before that place bleeds: for a bleeder place is often found in many people during surgery.
Si ergo uides ipsum iam apostematum, tunc non iteres super ipsum omnino, non enim excusat apud te aliquid.	If then you see that he has already bled, then do not repeat the phlebotomy at all: for it does not excuse with you to let anything happen.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex faece olei: quoniam alleuiat cursum sanguinis.	And put something on the spot from a mixture of oil: because it softens the course of the blood.
Et est melior in hoc loco quam oleum ipsum, et quam reliqua olea.	And is better in this place than his own oil, and than any other oil.
Et similiter administra faecem olei in omni phlebotomia tua, qua phlebotomas uenas apud prohibitionem cursus sanguinis: et faciunt illud tyriaca alfarach, et sagzenea, quando ponitur ex una earum super locum.	And administer the same oil to all your phlebotomies when you wish to stop the course of the blood: and they make it alfarach, and saffron, when put from one of them on the spot.
Sanguis enim subtiliatur et resoluitur, quando est grossus.	For the blood is softened and dissolved when it is thick.
Quod si accidat in loco phlebotomiae apostema magnum, nam multotiens accidit, praecipue ei qui non est phlebotomatus nisi uice illa, aut est apertio uenae parua, tunc propera et pone super locum spongiam infusam in aqua et sale, calefacta parumper: et stringe eam hora una: quoniam soluitur.	That if a great apoplexy happens in the spot of phlebotomy, for many times it has happened, especially to him who is not phlebotomized except from that vein, or is an opening of a small vein, then bind and put on the spot a sponge soaked in water and salt, warmed slightly: and tie it tight for one hour: for it is dissolved.
Et oportet, ut facias illud post exitum sanguinis ex uena ipsa, cum complemento sui, aut ex uena alia.	You should make it so that after the flow of blood from the wound itself, with its own complement, or from another new wound.
Quod si remanet in loco post dies aliquid nigredinis, aut uiriditatis, non nocet illud: et si uis, pone super ipsum aliquid aloe, aut myrrhae solutorum: aut aliquid ex succo menthastri, id est, calamenti aut simile illius.	That if it remains in the place after a few days of bruising, or redness, it does not harm that: and if there is swelling, put something on top of it of aloe, or of dissolved myrrh: or some of the juice of mint, that is, calamus or something like it.
Et multotiens quidem accidunt apostemata et eminentiae apud phlebotomiam Basilicae.	And many times indeed have there been hemorrhoids and eminences in the practice of phlebotomy at the Basilica.
Pone ergo manum tuam super ipsam, tunc si inuenis molliciem apud compressionem tuam super ipsam, tunc illa eminentia est mala.	So place your hand on it, then if it is soft and fragile under your pressure on it, then that eminence is evil.
Caue ergo, ut ponas super eam aliquid ex eo quod diximus.	Cause therefore so that you put something on it from that which I said.
Nam fortasse fluet ex ea sanguis arteriae.	For perhaps blood will flow from it of the artery.
Sed fac emplastrum ei cum eo in quo est stipticitas, ut induretur locus.	But make an aplaster with it where there is stenosis, so that the place hardens.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the wound with the rest of the cure, until it heals.
Et oportet, ut extrahas omni homini ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis suae.	And it is fitting that every man should give up some of his blood according to the quantity of his virtue.
Et quod apparet ex colore uincente super sanguinem.	And what seems to shine on the surface of the blood.
Nam sanguis si est niger, tunc dimitte ipsum exire, donec rubeat: et similiter si uides ipsum grossum: tunc dimitte eum, donec subtilietur: et similiter si est acutus, donec auferatur acuitas eius.	For if the blood is black, then let it not go out until it turns red: and likewise if you see it thick: then let it not go out until it thins: and likewise if it is sharp, then let the sharpness be taken away from it.
Et oportet ei qui est plenus, fortis, et indiget extractione sanguinis uice una, ut amplificetur phlebotomia uenae, et sit phlebotomus latus: et in eo qui est debilis, sit econtrario illius.	And it is fitting for him who is full, strong, and accustomed to the extraction of blood by a single blow, so as to increase the phlebotomy of the new one, and to be a phlebotomist on the back: but in him who is weak, be contrary to that.
Et oportet, ut extrahat ipsum in uicibus, et ut sit foramen strictum: et melius quod administratur in phlebotomia uenae est, ut sit transuersa sectio, non punctura.	And it is fitting that he draws out the wound with blows, and that the hole is closed tight: and better it is if it is administered in the phlebotomy of the new one, so that it is a transverse section, not a puncture.
Et iste modus phlebotomiae est saluus a fluxu sanguinis, et ab incisione nerui: et est laudabilior, et saluior quam phlebotomia per latitudinem et longitudinem.	And this method of phlebotomy is safer from the flow of blood, and from the incising of nerves: and it is more praiseworthy, and healthier than phlebotomy by width and length.
Et cui consueuit peruenire apud phlebotomiam syncopis, oportet ut cibes ante phlebotomiam modico pane infuso in aqua granati muzi: aut secaniabin, si est calefactus: et extrahas ei ex sanguine in tribus uicibus, aut quatuor.	And he who is accustomed to having syncope during phlebotomy, it is necessary that he eat a little bread before phlebotomy moistened with water of gravel: or if it is cold, he should take secaniabin; and let him give himself blood in three or four vessels.
Et si est infrigidatae complexionis, tunc accipiat ante phlebotomiam panem infusum in syrupo miua, aut in syrupo de melle aromatizato cum speciebus, aut in syrupo aromatizato odorifero.	And if his complexion is cold, then he should take before phlebotomy bread moistened with syrup of myrrh, or with syrup of honey flavored with spices, or with syrup flavored with odorous substances.
Quod si accidat syncopis apud phlebotomiam, et est caussa eius exitus sanguinis multi: tunc oportet, ut sumat in potu aquam carnis, et syrupum odoriferum subtilem: et utatur aromaticitate cum algalia, et liniatur pectus eius cum ea: et utatur reliquis quae diximus in diuisione in capitulo syncopis ex euacuatione.	If syncope occurs during phlebotomy and it is the cause of a lot of blood loss, then he should drink water of meat and syrup of scent, and he should use aromatics with algarrobite, and he should open his chest while doing so: and he should use whatever we mentioned in the division on syncope from evacuation.
Qui autem uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo: oportet ei cuius phlebotomia est propter euacuationem multam, et uirtus eius est debilis, ut soluat sanguinem paulatim per quantitatem uirtutis in diebus continuis.	But whoever wants to let his arm bleed and make up for the blood loss: it is necessary that he who does phlebotomy for extensive evacuation, and whose power is weak, should make up for the blood little by little over a certain period of time.
Qui uero uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo, et est corpus eius forte: tunc faciat illud post septem horas, aut nouem a phlebotomia sua prima.	But whoever wants to let his arm bleed and make up for the blood loss, and whose body is strong: then he should do it after seven or nine hours since his first phlebotomy.
Qui autem uult attrahere sanguinem ex corpore suo ad contrarium partis ad quam declinat: oportet ut euentetur ei in die secundo, aut in tertio.	But whoever wants to draw blood from his body towards the opposite side of which he leans: it is necessary that he should do so on the second or third day.
In cuius uero corpore est sanguis multus iam calefactus, et acuitur, et facit accidere febrem: oportet, ut egrediatur ex eo sanguis in uice una, et extrahatur ex eo quantitas multa: et amplificetur apertio usquequo accidat syncopis: postquam tu fueris conseruans omnes conditiones phlebotomiae: et ut ponas manum tuam super pulsum eius apud cursum sanguinis, ut non accidat mors loco syncopis.	But in the body of which there is much blood already heated and sharpened, and it causes a fever: it is necessary that he should get out of it blood in one vessel, and extract from it a great quantity; and increase the opening until syncope occurs: after that you have kept all the conditions of phlebotomy: and let your hand rest on his pulse during the course of the blood, so that syncope does not occur at the place.
Multotiens enim accidit illud, quando ignorat phlebotomator, et cadit negligentia.	For many times this has happened when the phlebotomizer is careless, and he falls by neglect.
Et non oportet quando uis soluere brachium, et soluere sanguinem secundo, cum iam clausum sit orificium uenae, et fiat difficilis exitus sanguinis, ut prematur super ipsum cum uehementia, et curuatum extendatur uelociter.	And it is not right that you should tie the arm when you wish to cut, and cut the blood according to the second way, when the orifice of the vein has already been closed, and let the exit of the blood be difficult, so that it rushes over itself with a sudden movement, and let it curve and extend quickly.
Nam illud est malum ualde, imo dimitte ipsum, donec phlebotometur secundo.	For this is bad to tie tightly, let go of it until the blood is bled by the second way.
Aut remoue cum acuitate phlebotomi illud quod coagulatum est ex sanguine in orificio uenae, et pone super ipsum aliquid salis dissoluti in aqua.	Or move it with sharpness of phlebotomy this that is coagulated from blood at the orifice of the vein, and put over it something dissolved in water of salt.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex tyriaca alfaroch, aut sagzenea, et pone ipsum compressione leni, donec egrediatur sanguis.	And put over it some of the alkaloids of the arnica, or of the sage, and put the compress on it gently until the blood exits.
Si uero iam apostemata est uena, tunc dimitte eam, et non tegas eam, donec sedetur apostema.	But if the vein is already torn, then let go of it, and do not tie it, until it has healed.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad soluendum sanguinem secundo, et non est excusatio, tunc aut phlebotoma ipsum supra illum locum, aut in brachio alio in uena alia.	That if necessity compels to bleed by the second way, and there is no excuse, then either phlebotomize the person above that place, or in the arm of another in a different vein.
Funis autem brachii phlebotomatur loco Fuscae, et Basilicae, cum non inueniuntur, et sunt occultae, quoniam est composita ex eis.	But the vein of the arm is phlebotomized at the place of the fuscus and basilica, when they are not found, and are hidden, since it is composed of them.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus manum suam in aqua calida, donec rubeat focile, et appareat uena manifeste.	And the quality of the phlebotomy of it is, that it should put the hand of the sick in hot water, until it turns red, and the vein appears clearly.
Deinde stringatur super ipsam cum ligamento parum constrictione media.	Then tie over it with a little tight binding on the middle.
Deinde phlebotoma secundum transuersationem paulatim, non latitudinaliter, neque secundum longitudinem: et sit apertio ampla, et sit phlebotomia tua qua eam phlebotomas super iuncturam manus parumper.	Then bleed by the second way little by little, not wide, and not along its length: and let the opening be wide, and let your bleeding be over the vein a little.
Quod si prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera manum in aqua calida, et dimitte sanguinem currere in aqua, donec consequaris necessitatem tuam.	That if the exit of the blood is prevented, then again put the hand in hot water, and let the blood run into the water, until you have satisfied your need.
Si autem fueris in diebus aestatis, tunc excusaris ab iteratione manus in aqua calida.	But if you are in the days of summer, then you are excused from again putting the hand in hot water.
Et plurimum quidem ponitur cursus sanguinis in aqua calida in tempore hyemis.	For certainly the course of blood is put into warm water at the time of the winter.
Et phlebotomia huius uenae est saluior omnibus uenis, quoniam non est sub ea uena pulsatilis, neque neruus.	And phlebotomy of this vein is salutary for all veins, because there is no pulsation of blood under it, and there are no nerves.
Phlebotomia uero Saluatellae manus dextrae, est conferens aegritudinibus epatis.	On the right hand, phlebotomy is salutary for those with liver sickness.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringas mahason manus cum ligamento, aut manu tua, postquam tu intromittis eam in aquam calidam, donec infletur uena, et demonsteretur sensui ualde.	And the quality of phlebotomy is such that you squeeze the hand with a ligature, or your own hand, after you have put it into warm water, until the blood stirs and shows by touch to be very cold.
Deinde phlebotoma eam transuersando.	Then phlebotomize it by passing through.
Et si incidis eam totaliter, non nocebit ei illud in aliquo.	And if you cut it entirely, it will not hurt him at all.
Et conserua, ne ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo.	And keep your hand away from the phlebotomy after.
Sub ea enim sunt nerui digitorum denudati ex carne.	Because under it are naked nerves of the fingers stripped of their flesh.
Deinde itera manum ad aquam calidam, et dimitte currere sanguinem in ea.	Then repeat the hand to warm water, and let the blood flow into it.
Nam si tu non iteras eam in aqua calida, coagulatur sanguis in orificio uenae, et prohibetur a cursu.	For if you do not heat the hand in warm water, the blood will clot in the incision of the vein, and the course will be stopped.
Cum ergo extraxeris ex sanguine quantitatem necessitatis, tunc pone super uenam oleum et sal: ut non consolidetur uelociter.	But when you extract a quantity of blood as needed, then put oil and salt on the vein so that it does not consolidate quickly.
Et similiter oportet, ut facias cum omni ramo stricto.	And likewise it is necessary to do the same with all branches that are tight.
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae eius ex manu sinistra, est: quoniam est conferens ad aegritudines splenis: et similiter fac in phlebotomia eius, sicut fecisti in secunda aequaliter.	The instruction for the phlebotomy of the left hand is this: because it is salutary for heart sickness; and likewise do the same for the phlebotomy of it as you did in the second place equally.
Saphenae autem phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad aegritudines quae sunt in inferiori parte corporis, sicut aegritudines matricum, et retentionem menstruorum, et infirmitates renum, et ulcera coxarum et crurium antiqua, et similia ex aegritudinibus.	The instruction for the phlebotomy of the saphenous vein is this: for diseases that are in the lower part of the body, such as those of the kidneys, and retention of the monthly flow, and sickness of the kidneys and bladder, and old sores of the legs and feet, and other similar ailments.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus pedem suum in aquam calidam: et faciat super ipsum fricationem, donec exuberent uenae: et liga supra iuncturam pedis cum corrigia.	And the quality of the phlebotomy is such that he puts his sick foot into warm water; and let him make friction on it until the blood comes out; and bind above the ligature with a thong.
Et uenae quidem locus est apud calcaneum, apparens uersus pollicem: et ramificantur ex ea in facie pedis rami multi.	And this place is even on the calcaneus, appearing opposite to the thumb; and many branches emerge from it in front of the foot.
Phlebotoma ergo eam in ampliore ramo eius, aut apud calcaneum in aggregatione eius: quoniam est melius et saluius.	Therefore let her bleed from a larger branch of her, or at the calcaneus in their gathering; for it is better and more salutary.
Quod si phlebotomas eam in facie pedis, tunc caue a neruis qui sunt sub ea super faciem pedis.	If she should bleed from before the foot, then be careful of the nerves which are under her on the surface of the foot.
Et pone phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas ex transuerso, quasi tu uelis incidere eam: et sit phlebotomus Nesil.	And put your phlebotomy where you want to phlebotomize her from behind, as if you wished to pierce her; and let the phlebotomy be done.
Si autem prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera pedem eius in aqua calida: et dimitte sanguinem currere in eam, donec euacuatur.	If however the blood flow is forbidden, then turn her other foot to warm water; and let not the blood run into her until it has drained off.
Quod si errat uenam phlebotomator in prima uice, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper, nam locus est saluus, et non times ex eo maliciam, quando tu caues a neruis, sicut diximus.	If however there is an error in the phlebotomizing of the first vein, then let it remain with the phlebotomy up to the same degree, for the place is salutary; and do not wait for it from the malice, when you cauterize the nerves, as we said.
Et similiter cum Saphena pedis alterius aequaliter.	And likewise with the saphenous vein of the other foot equally.
Venae autem Sciaticae locus, sicut diximus, est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	But the location of the sciatic veins, as we said, is on the calcaneus from the lateral side.
Et iuuamentum phlebotomiae eius est, ad dolorem anchae, quando est propter sanguinem calidum.	And the incision for her phlebotomy is, to the pain of the ankle, when it is due to the warm blood.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut ingrediatur infirmus balneum, et festinet: et stringe crus eius a latere anchae usque supra calcaneum quatuor digitis, cum uitta subtili longa: non enim apparet nisi propter illud.	And the quality of her phlebotomy is, that it should enter into an infirm bath, and cause a tingling; and tightly tie her foot from the lateral ankle up to the calcaneus with a long and slender thread: for it does not appear otherwise than because of this.
Quando ergo apparet, tunc phlebotoma eam secundum quodcumque ingenium est tibi possibile, aut secundum transuersionem: et est melius, aut ut incidas eam incisione, aut seces eam sectione.	When however it appears, then phlebotomize her according to whatever talent you have, or at the location; and it is better, or as if you should pierce her with an incision, or cut her off by a section.
Locus enim eius est saluior, et ipsa est in pluribus hominibus occulta ualde.	For the place of her is salutary, and she herself is hidden from many people greatly.
Quod si non inuenis eam, et non apparet sensui omnino: tunc phlebotoma aliquem ramum eius, et est ille qui apparet in dorso pedis, et uersus auricularem: et caue a neruis, et fac currere ex sanguine quantitatem quam uis.	If however you do not feel her at all: then phlebotomize some of her branch, and that which appears on the back of the foot, and opposite to the ear; and cauterize the nerves, and let blood run in quantity as much as you wish.
Deinde solue stricturam, et pone super locum phlebotomiae corium, et stringe locum.	Then cut the strip tightly, and put it on the place where the blood has been let, and tighten the place.
Uelociter enim sanatur.	For this quickly heals.
Â¶ De Ventosatione, et qualitate usus eius.	(Concerning Wind-sucking and its quality of use.)
Caput XCVIII.	CHAPTER LVIII. ON WIND-SUCKING AND ITS QUALITY OF
Uentosae fiunt ex cornibus, et ex aere, et ex uitro.	Wind-sucking takes place from horns, and from air, and from moisture.
Et Ventosatio quidem fit secundum duos modos.	And Wind-sucking takes place in two ways.
Cum scarificatione, et extractione sanguinis: et alter est uentosatio sine scarificatione.	(With scarification and the extraction of blood) one is Wind-sucking with scarification, and extraction of blood; and another is Wind-sucking without
Et haec Ventosatio quae est sine scarificatione, est secundum duos modos.	(And this Wind-sucking, which is without scarification), takes place in two ways: one is
Aut enim est cum igne.	Or on the other hand it is with fire.
Aut est absque igne.	Or without fire.
Et uentosis quae administrantur cum scarificatione et extractione sanguinis sunt quatuordecim loca corporis.	And those Wind-suckings which are performed with scarification and extraction of blood, are four places in the body.
Quorum unus est, Ventosatio Alnocrati, et est postremum capitis: et Alkehel, et est medium colli: et uentosae Alhagdahim, et sunt duae laminae colli a duabus partibus simul: et uentosae menti, et est sub mandibula in inferiori oris: et uentosae duarum spatularum: et uentosae Alachosos super finem caudae: et uentosae duorum focilium, et sunt medium duorum brachiorum: et uentosae duorum crurium: et uentosae duarum cauillarum.	Of these four places in the body are: one is Wind-sucking of the Alnocrati, and it is at last of the head: and Alkehel, and it is in the middle of the neck: and uenosas Alhagdahim, and there are two laminae of the neck from both sides simultaneously: and uentosas of the mind, and it is under the mandible in the lower mouth: and uentosas of two spatulas: and uentosas of the tail; and uentosas of two flames, and they are in the middle of the two arms: and uentosas of the two chaps: and uentosas of the two shoulders.
Et Ventosatio quidem non extrahit sanguinem tibi ex uenis minutis sparsis in carne, et propter illud non cadit uirtus ex eis, sicut est casus eius ex phlebotomia.	(And Wind-sucking does not extract blood from you from small scattered veins in the flesh, and for this reason its power does not fall out of them, as is the case with phlebotomy.)
Neque oportet, ut administretur uentosatio siue cum igne, aut absque igne in aliqua aegritudinum quae fiunt ex repletione, donec euacuetur totum corpus.	Nor does it need to be administered Wind-sucking either with fire or without fire in any sickness which happens from fullness, until the whole body has been emptied.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad Ventosationem ex aegritudine, aut propter consuetudinem, administramus eam in omni hora in principio mensis, in fine eius, et in medio ipsius, et in quocumque tempore fuerit.	If need calls for Wind-sucking because of sickness, or because of custom, let it be administered at the beginning, end, and middle of the month, and at any time.
Quod est, quia ex hominibus est qui quando multiplicatur in eo sanguis, donec indiget extractione eius per uentosationem, inuenit in capite suo grauedinem, et sodahan.	For it is because he is a man who, when blood multiplies within him, does not become ill from its extraction by vomiting, but remains in his head giddiness and dizziness.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit repletionem et rubedinem in facie sua, capite suo, et collo suo.	And of them is he who finds swelling and redness on his face, on his head, and on his neck.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit pruritum in facie sua, et fronte sua, et tenebrositatem, et hebetudinem in oculis suis.	And of them is he who finds itching on his face, on his forehead, darkness, and dullness in his eyes.
Et ex eis est qui scalpit locum uentosationis suae.	And of them is he who scratches the place of his venesection.
Et ex eis est cuius risus multiplicatur.	And of them is he whose laughter multiplies.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit gustum sanguinis in ore suo: aut apostematur lingua, et expuit sanguinem.	And of them is he who finds the taste of blood in his mouth, or spits it out with his tongue, and vomits up blood.
Et ex eis est cuius somnus multiplicatur.	And of them is he whose sleep multiplies.
Et ex eis est qui uidet in somno suo sanguinem et rubedinem, et interfectos, et plagas, et quae sunt similia illis.	And of them is he who sees in his sleep blood and redness, and slain men, and plagues, and things like those.
Quando ergo uidemus aliquid ex illis, et proprie si est in tertia media mensis: praecipimus tunc uentosationem fieri, postquam praeterierunt de die duae horae, aut tres.	When then do we perform venesection if we see anything of them, and especially if it is in the third month from the beginning of the month: let us then perform it after two or three hours have passed since the middle of the day.
Iuuamentum autem Ventosationis nuchae, est: quoniam ipsa confert ad grauitatem in capite, et quod effunditur ad oculos.	But the venesection of the nape is: for it turns to giddiness in the head, and because it flows out into the eyes.
At uero oportet, ut sit illud post euacuationem totius corporis.	But it should be done after emptying the whole body.
Et haec quidem Ventosa est loco phlebotomiae Cephalicae.	And this venesection is at a place phlebotomy of the head.
Et non licet, ut utatur ea qui est frigidae complexionis, aut in quo est catarrus.	And it should not be used as a person with a cold complexional appearance, or one who is hoarse.
Nam infert ei nocumentum magnum.	For it inflicts great harm.
Et propter illud non oportet, ut utantur ea senes, et in cuius capite sunt aegritudines frigidae.	And because of that, it should not be used as a person who has old age, and in whose head there are diseases of cold.
Qui autem super eam fit assiduus, generatur super eum obliuio.	But whoever is accustomed to it, he gets over it by oblivion.
Et propter illud oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut deponat manum suam cum uentosa parumper ad inferiora, timendo ex generatione obliuionis.	And because of that, you should order the venesection, so that he lays his hand with a gentle press down below, fearing the generation of oblivion.
Ventosatio aut Alkehel, est loco phlebotomiae Fuscae, et phlebotomiae Basilicae, et propter illud confert asmati, et constrictioni anhelitus, et fissurae instrumenti anhelitus, et tussi, et repletioni.	Ventosatio or Alkehel is the place of the Phlebothymia of Fuscae and of the Basilica; for that reason it provides relief from asma, constriction of the windpipe, the instrument's fissures, cough, and congestion.
Et oportet, ut impellatur Ventosa Alkehel parumper, quoniam si ponitur inferius, generat debilitatem in corde, et stomacho.	And it should be that Ventosa Alkehel is pushed further back, because if it is placed lower, it generates weakness in the heart and stomach.
Ventosatio uero alhagdahim, confert doloribus accidentibus in capite, et obtalmiae, et hemigraneae, et perforationi, et dolori in radicibus dentium: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae.	But Ventosa Alkehel, it brings relief to the pains of accidents in the head, and to the eyes, and to the headaches, and to the perforations, and to the pain in the roots of the teeth; and it is the place of phlebotomy of the Basilica.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And it should be that you prevent the Ventosator from touching his hand with the scarification, so that he does not hit an artery and cause a flow of blood.
Ventosatio autem sub mento, confert alcolae in ore, et corruptioni gingiuae, et similibus eis ex aegritudinibus quae sunt in ore: et stat loco phlebotomiae alieherich, quae sunt in duobus labiis.	But Ventosa under the chin, brings alcohol into the mouth, and corruption of the gums, and similar ailments that are in the mouth: and it is the place of phlebotomy of Alieherich, which are in the two lips.
Ventosatio autem spatularum, confert ad alchafacham, quae fit ex replexione, et caliditate.	But Ventosa spatulas, brings relief to alchafacham, which is made from a vibration and heat.
Ventosatio uero interiorum partium duorum focilium, confert iuuamentum phlebotomiae uenarum trium, Basilicae, et Fuscae, et Cephalicae: quoniam ipsa attrahit sanguinem ex omnibus illis uenis minutis, quae sunt in carne: et attrahunt illae uenae minutae ex uenis aliis grossioribus eis, donec peruenit attractio ad uenas tres.	But Ventosa of the inner parts, brings relief to the phlebotomy of the three veins, Basilicae, and Fuscae, and Cephalicae: because it itself attracts blood from all those tiny veins that are in the flesh: and these tiny veins attract the blood from other larger veins until it reaches the attraction of the three veins.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne multum procedat in scarificatione: quoniam locus est denudatus carne, et sub eo sunt nerui et arteriae.	And it should be that you prevent the Ventosator from going too deeply in the scarification, because the place is deprived of flesh, and under it are nerves and arteries.
Ventosa autem quae uentosatur super alchausos, confert hemorroidibus Ani, et ulceribus inferioribus.	But Ventosa that is applied on Alchazaus, brings hemorrhoids of the Anus, and ulcers of the lower parts.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut sit uentosa magna, et ut sit ex aere: quoniam locus indiget suctione forti, et fortasse franguntur Ventosae subtiles: et scarificetur scarificatione magna.	And it should be that you prevent the Ventosator from making the Ventosa too small, and that it is made of iron: because the place does not endure strong suction, and perhaps the fine Ventosas break: and it is scarified with a large scarification.
Ventosae autem crurium minuunt diminutione manifesta: quoniam attrahunt sanguinem ex toto corpore, et conferunt doloribus antiquis in renibus, et matricibus, et uesica: prouocant menstrua, et conferunt bothor, et ademenul: et stant loco phlebotomiae duarum saphenarum, et alhorcobeni.	The veins of the legs diminish and are evident because they draw blood from all over the body, and increase old pains in the kidneys, uteruses, and urinary bladder; induce menstruation, and produce bothorrhea and emesis; and stand at the site of phlebotomy of the two saphenous veins, and alhorcobeni.
Verumtamen debilitant corpus multum, et faciunt accidere syncopim in pluribus hominibus.	However, they weaken the body greatly, and cause fainting in many people.
Et Ventosarum alhorcobeni iuuamentum est propinquum iuuamento Ventosarum duorum crurium.	And the alhorcobeni of the two leg veins is a close connection to the alhorcobeni of the two saphenous veins.
Qualitas positionis Ventosarum est, ut ponas uentosam in primis uacuam, et sugas suctione temperata: et non prolonges positionem uentosarum, sed pone eas uelociter, et remoue eas uelociter, ut ueniant humores ad locum aduentu aequali: et non cesses iterare illud et continuare, donec uideas locum iam rubere et inflari, et appareat rubedo sanguinis: tunc ergo scarifica, et itera suctione paulatim.	The quality of the position of the leg vein is that you place the venose in the first place empty, and suck with a moderate temper: and do not prolong the position of the veins, but put them quickly, and move them quickly so that the humors go to the site of adventitious equally: and do not cease to repeat this and continue, until you see the site has already turned red and swollen, and appears to be red blood: then therefore cut, and repeat sucking slowly.
Deinde considera in dispositione corporum.	Then consider in the disposition of the bodies.
Nam qui ex hominibus est tenerae carnis, rarorum pororum, oportet ut scarifices ipsum semel, non plus: ut non ulceretur locus.	For he who is among men of tender flesh and rare pores, should cut himself once, not more: so that the site does not ulcerate.
Et praecipe Ventosatori, ut amplificet scarificationem, et profundet parum: et temperet suctionem in facilitate, et uelocitate, et motu suaui.	And prescribe to the venous cutter, so that he amplifies the cutting, and digs a little: and moderates sucking in convenience, and speed, and smooth movement.
Quod si in sanguine est grossitudo, tunc oportet, ut scarifices ipsum bis.	That if there is thickness in the blood, then you should cut himself twice.
In uice quidem prima aperitur uia subtiliationi sanguinis, et aquositati eius: et in secunda quidem perscrutationi exquisitae extractionis sanguinis grossi.	In a vessel, however, the first opening is a path of subtilization of blood, and its liquification: and in the second, indeed, the perscrutation of exquisite extraction of thick blood.
Si uero sanguis est faeculentus ualde, tunc fiat scarificatio uice tertia: ut consequatur ultimum.	But if the blood is very foul, then let there be a third cutting: so that it leads to the last.
Et ad ultimum, quando uolumus extrahere sanguinem paulatim, uel parumper, sufficit nobis scarificatio una.	And to the last, when we wish to extract blood slowly, or little by little, a single cutting is sufficient for us.
Quod si uolumus extractionem sanguinis multi, scarificamus scarificatione plurima.	If we wish to extract a lot of blood, we make many incisions.
Et si nos mensuramus, quod sanguis est grossus: tunc oportet, ut scarificetur scarificatione profunda: et terminus aequalis in scarificatione, est profunditas cutis.	And if we measure, that the blood is thick: then it is necessary, so that the incision is deep: and the term equal in the incision, is the depth of the skin.
Â¶ Quid sit illud quod oportet administrari ex oleis apud positionem Ventosarum, et quid caueat uentosandus.	What is that which needs to be administered from oils during the placement of the ventosas, and what causes the veno-sandus.
IN illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.	In that indeed whose skin is thick, hard, dark, and the pores of which are tight, it is necessary that the places of the ventosas are anointed with open, soothing, and resolved oils: if it is in the time of summer, as is the oil of a number of things, or oil of caraway, or oil of almonds, or seed-oil.
Et si est in tempore hyemis, tunc oleum narcissinum, aut oleum de lilio, aut oleum camomellinum, aut sarbatinum: et eis similia.	And if it is in the time of winter, then oil of narcissus, or oil of lilies, or oil of chamomile, or oil of mustard: and to these similar ones.
Si uero superfluitas est grossa, frigida: tunc oleum sit amaracinum, aut oleum de balsamita aut oleum alben, aut oleum anetinum: et eis similia.	But if there is too much coldness, then oil of bitter-fennel, or oil of benzoe, or oil of albus, or oil of annatto: and to these similar ones.
Si uero uentosandus est amplorum pororum, tenerae carnis: tunc oportet, ut prohibeatur ab oleo, et oportet ut isti abluant loca Ventosarum earum post uentosationem cum aqua rosata, aut cum aqua frigida, aut cum aqua solatri, aut cum aqua cucurbitae, aut cum aqua portulacae: et similibus eis.	But if the veno-sandus is of large pores, of tender flesh: then it is necessary that there be a prohibition from oil, and that these anoint the places of the ventosas after the veno-sandus with rose-water, or cold water, or water of the marigolds, or seed-cress-water: and to these similar ones.
Ille autem cuius sanguis est multae humiditatis, abluat uentosas cum aceto, aut cum aqua myrti, et sumach: et similibus eis.	That one whom the blood is of much moisture, he washes the ventosas with vinegar, or with water of myrtle, and of sumach: and to these similar ones.
Cuius autem superfluitates sunt grossae, abluat uentosas suas cum uino antiquo, aut cum aqua samsuci, aut decoctione aneti, aut camomillae: et eis similibus.	Whom the excessives are thick, he washes his ventosas with old wine, or water of samphire, or decoction of anetium, or of chamomile: and to these similar ones.
Et oportet, ut caueatur uentosatio in balneo, aut in uestigio balnei, imo oportet, ut administretur post exitum ex balneo per horam, aut per horas duas.	And it is necessary that the veno-sandus be caused in a bath, or in a dressing-room of the bath: and it is necessary that be administered after going out from the bath for an hour, or for two hours.
Et non oportet, ut dormiat aliquis post uentosationem.	And it is not appropriate for anyone to sleep after wound care.
Â¶ Quid est quo oportet ut regatur Ventosandus, aut Phlebotomatus ante uentosationem.	What is the need for someone to be fed or bled before wound care.
ET post eam oportet, ut consideres in primis: tunc si Ventosatus, aut Phlebotomatus sit cholericus, et uincunt super sanguinem eius acuitas et inflammatio: tunc oportet, ut accipiat infrigidantia, sicut granatum muzum: et etiam endiuiam cum aceto et lactuca, et secaniabin, et iuleb: et eis similia.	And after that, it is necessary to consider the first things: if the person is cholericky and there is an acuteness and inflammation in his blood then it is necessary for him to take cooling things like granulated mulberry: also dandelion with vinegar and lettuce and secanabium and juice.
Et pone cibaria eius pullos, et carnes ouium sekebiget, et cibos conditos cum agresta: et eis similia.	And place on his food porridge and meat that is sour, and cooked food with acorn: and similar things.
Et cuius complexio est frigida, oportet ut sumat in potu syrupum de melle, aut de almiua, aut alsecaniabin de seminibus factum: et sumat uinum odoriferum medium, quod est inter uetus et nouum: et praecipiatur, ut utatur paucitate cibi.	And if his complexio is cold then it is necessary for him to take syrup of honey or almond or alsecaniabin made from seeds in wine: and he should take medium-strong wine that is between new and old: and let him be directed to eat a little food.
Et pone cibum eius pullos, et canebir: et passeres, id est, paruas aues: et pullos columborum issiadebet.	And place on his food porridge and hay: and pigeons, that is, many birds: and let him eat pigeon pellets.
Et oportet, ut potus die uentosationis et phlebotomiae plus sit quam cibus: et oportet, ut detur in potu in quibusdam hominibus in horis tyriaca alfaroch, aut medicamen de musco, id est, muscata, aut alesselithe ante uentosationem: et ante phlebotomiam, aut post: ut confortentur membra principalia, et subtilietur sanguis.	And it is necessary for the wine of wound care and phlebotomy to be stronger than food: and it is necessary for it to be given in a drink to some people in hours of tyrrhenic alfaroch or medicine of musk, that is muscata, or alesselithe before wound care: and before phlebotomy or after: so as to strengthen the main muscles and refine the blood.
Et non oportet, ut sumant eam in potu calefacto.	And it is not appropriate for them to drink it in hot wine.
Â¶ De Ventosis sine scarificatione.	Of wound care without scarring.
Uentosae autem quae sunt sine scarificatione, sunt Ventosae quae ponuntur super epar, et splenem, et podagram, et super uentrem, umbilicum, et loca renum, et pixidem anchae: quoniam ista membra non sufferunt scarificationem super se.	But wound care that is without scarring are those that are placed on the liver, and the spleen, and the podanum, and over the windpipe, and the navel, and places of the reins, and the pixied anus: because these members do not undergo scarring on themselves.
Et non quaeritur per eas, nisi aut attactio ex membro sanguinis ad membrum: sicut ponimus Ventosam super mammillas in aegritudine fluxus sanguinis narium.	And it is not sought for them except for an attactio from one member of blood to a member: such as we place Wound care on the breasts in a fever of blood flow.
Et utimur eis, ut soluamus a membro uentositatem frigidam inuiscatam in membro: sicut ponimus uentosam super uentrem, et umbilicum.	And we use them so that we can heal a cold, irritated member of the body, in the same way as we put wind on the belly and navel.
Ipsa enim rarificat membrum, et calefacit ipsum, et remouet dolorem propterea, quia resoluit illam uentositatem.	For it itself tightens up the member, and warms it, and takes away the pain because it has healed that cold irritation.
Etiam ponitur super renes, quando accidit in eis opilatio, aut lapis.	Also, it is placed on the hips when there is an accumulation of fluid or a stone.
Uirtute enim attractionis suae fortasse aperit opilationem, aut eradicat lapidem ex loco suo.	For its own power of attraction may perhaps open up an accumulation or remove a stone from its place.
Et similiter facit quando ponitur super epar, et splenem apud uentositatem terendam in eis utrisque.	And it is the same when placed on the liver and the spleen to relieve any irritation in them. For in both cases, if there is an accumulation of wind, it opens it up.
Et istae Ventosae administrantur uacuae cum sectione tantum.	And these Wind-relievers are applied with a slight cut only.
Et quandoque administrantur cum igne.	And sometimes they are applied with fire.
Et quandoque administrantur plenae aqua tepida in aegritudinibus pleuresis: et illud est, ut impleatur Ventosa, et sit magna, aqua calida sola, aut aqua in qua decoctae sint herbae quae conueniunt.	And sometimes they are applied, filled with warm water, in cases of pleural pain; and that is to say, so that it becomes full of the Wind-reliever, and great in size, with just warm water alone, or with water in which have been boiled the herbs that are suitable.
Â¶ Forma Ventosae administratae cum igne.	The form of the application of the Wind-relievers with fire:
Sit amplitudo orificii eius duorum digitorum apertorum, secundum quod formauimus: et quantitas eius in profundo sit medietas palmi: et sit in latere eius in loco qui est circiter medium eius, foramen paruum, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum acus: fiat ex aere simul, aut citrino, grossorum marginum, lenium, aequalium, tersorum: ut non laedat membrum apud positionem suam super ipsum: et sit in medio eius uirga transuersa ex aere, aut ferro, ubi ponitur candela cum igne.	Let the width of its opening be that of two fingers put together, according to the form we have given; and let the quantity of it in the depth be half the length of a palm: and let it be placed on one side of the member at the point which is about halfway along it, a small hole, according to the quantity which is put into it: let it be made of brass, or yellow metal, broad-edged, smooth, equal, sharp, or triangular: so that it does not hurt the member at the point where it is placed on top of it: and let there be a cross-bar of brass, or iron, where the candle is placed with fire.
Et iam fit haec uentosa magna, maior ea quam narrauimus, et parum minor illa, secundum aegritudines et aetatem eius qui utitur.	And this great Wind-reliever can also be made, larger than we have described, and a slightly smaller one, according to the diseases and age of the person who uses it.
Ventosae enim puerorum, et extenuatorum sunt aliae, quam uentosae uirorum, et grossorum corporum.	For the Wind-relievers are different for boys, and those which weaken are different from those which relieve men, and from those which are suitable for large bodies.
Qualitas autem ponendi hanc uentosam cum igne super membrum, est, ut accendas licinium cum igne ex lino decenter, aut candelam paruam ex caera: et pone eam super medium uirgae transuersae quae est in medio uentosae: ut sit accensus ignis circiter inferiorem partem uentosae, ut non comburatur corpus infirmi.	The quality of this placement of the wound with fire on the limb is that, as you light the linseed oil with fire from linen that is out of center, or a candle made of pitch: and place it in the middle of the hip bone across which is in the middle of the wound: so that the fire is set around the lower part of the wound, so that the body does not burn.
Deinde ponatur super membrum: et digitus sit super foramen quod dixi, donec quando tenemus uentosam: dum indigemus, auferamus digitum, et egredietur uapor super illud foramen, et soluetur uentosa statim.	Then place on the limb and the finger is placed on the hole that I said, as long as we hold the wound open: while we are holding it open, let us remove the finger, and steam will come out of that hole and immediately dissolve the wound.
Deinde igni licinium secundum modum suum, et itera eam, si indiges illa.	Then with oil fire according to its way, and repeat it if you are not used to it.
In Ventosa autem quae administratur in aegritudine pleuresis cum aqua, non est uirga transuersa, neque foramen: et non administratur, nisi quia impletur aqua, et ponitur super membrum tantum.	But in the wound that is administered with water in pleurisy disease, there is no transverse hip bone or hole: and it is not administered unless it is filled with water, and placed only on the limb.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et haec Ventosa quanto plus est magna, ut capiat aquam multam, est melior.	And this wound is the more large one, because it takes a lot of water, it is better.
Â¶ De suspensione Sanguisugarum.	The suspension of blood sugar.
Caput XCIX.	Head 99.
Sanguisugae non administrantur in pluribus, nisi in quibus membris non est possibilis positio uentosarum, propter paruitatem eorum, sicut labium, et gingiua, et eis similia.	Blood sugar is not administered in many places unless the limb cannot be placed on a wound due to its smallness, such as a lip, and gums, and similar ones.
Aut in membro denudato a carne, sicut digitus, et nasus, et eis similia.	Or in a naked member from meat, such as a finger, and nose, and similar things.
Et qualitas utendi eis est: ut ueneris ex Sanguisugis quae sunt in aquis dulcibus, mundis a putredinibus.	And the quality of using them is that you come from blood sugar that is in sweet waters, clean from corruption.
Deinde dimittantur die et nocte in aqua dulci, donec famelicae sint, et non remaneat in uentre earum aliquid.	Then they are left off during the day and night in sweet water, until they become hungry, and nothing remains in their stomachs.
Deinde euacuetur corpus in primis cum phlebotomia, et cum uentosis.	Then the body is emptied out with phlebotomy, and with wound opening.
Deinde absterge membrum infirmi, donec rubeat.	Then the limb is washed, until it turns red.
Postea ponantur super ipsum.	Then they are placed on top of it.
Cum ergo implentur, et cadunt, et est possibilis suctio loci cum uentosa, tunc est magis ultimum in iuuamento: et si non, tunc ablue locum cum aceto.	When therefore they are filled and fall, and it is possible to suck the place with a flowing [blood], then it is more appropriate to tie up: and if not, then suck the place with vinegar.
Deinde cum aqua multa, et fricetur, et exprimatur.	Then, when there is much water, and it is frothed and pressed out.
Quod si prolongatur cursus sanguinis post casum Sanguisugarum, et est illud resudando: tunc infunde pannum lini in aqua frigida, et pone ipsum desuper, donec abscindatur resudatio.	If the course of blood continues after the loss of blood from the wound and there is a residue: then put a cloth made of linen into cold water, and let it rest on top until the residue has dried up.
Quod si multiplicatur sanguis, tunc pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, aut gallas, et similia eis ex stipticis: donec abscindatur sanguis.	If the blood multiplies, then sprinkle powder on top of the wound, crushed eggshell, or similar things from astringent: until the blood has dried up.
Aut ponantur super locum medietates fabarum excorticatarum: et dimittantur, donec adhaereant fabae in loco, nam sanguis abscinditur.	Or place on top of the place half of crushed herbs that are used to stop bleeding: and let them be left until the herbs have stuck to the place, because the blood has dried up.
Et oportet si necessaria est iteratio Sanguisugarum, quando est possibile, mutare eas.	And it is necessary if the necessity arises to repeat the application of bloodletting, when it is possible, to change them.
Si autem prohibentur Sanguisugae a suspensione, tunc abstergatur locus cum sanguine recenti.	If however bloodletting by suspension is prohibited, then the place is cleaned with recently flowing blood.
Aut fige acum in locis, donec egrediatur aliquid ex sanguine.	Or tie it up now on the places until something of the blood goes out.
Deinde ponantur, nam ipsae quando sentiunt aliquid ex sanguine, adhaerent statim.	Then place them on, for they themselves, as soon as they feel a little bit of blood, stick immediately.
Quando ergo uis ut cadant, pulueriza super eas aliquid ex aloe trito, aut salem, aut cinerem: et cadent statim.	When therefore you want them to fall, sprinkle on top of them some crushed aloe or salt or ash, and they fall immediately.

Â¶ Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars III.	The Third Part of the Surgical Book of Albucasis.
Â¶ Sermo uniuersalis de restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus.	The Universal Discourse on Restoration, Dislocation, Treatment of Tormentation, and Similar Conditions.
Caput I.	Title I.
Hoc Capitulum etiam multotiens est necessarium in arte Medicinae, et est restauratio fracturae, et dislocationis accidentium in ossibus.	This chapter is also often necessary in the art of medicine, and it is the restoration of a fracture, and a dislocation of accidents in bones.
Scitote o Filii, quia iactant se de hoc Capitulo stolidi medicorum et uulgi, et qui non inspexerunt unquam antiquorum librum, neque legerunt ex eo literam.	Know you sons, that many doctors of our time are proud of this chapter, and the crowd, and have not ever examined the ancient book, nor read a letter from it.
Et propter hanc caussam fit, quod iste modus ex scientiis in terra nostra est priuatus.	This is why this method is not used among us because it belongs to the sciences which are kept secret on our earth.
Et ego non obuiaui in eo unquam bono omnino, et non adeptus sum ex eo illud, quod sum adeptus nisi propter longitudinem lectionis librorum antiquorum, et studium super intellectum eorum, donec extraxi scientiam illius ex eis.	And I have never found it at all useful, and I have not succeeded in it, except for the length of the reading of old books, and the study of their intelligence, until I extracted the science from them.
Deinde adhaesi experimento et studio longitudine uitae meae.	Then I adhered to experiment and practice because of the length of my life.
Et iam descripsi uobis ex illo in hoc Capitulo totum quod continet scientia mea: et super quod praeteriit experimentum meum, postquam abbreuiaui illud uobis, et liberaui illud ex occupatione elongationis, et abbreuiaui illud fine abbreuiationis, et ostendi illud fine declinationis: et formaui in eo formas multas ex formis instrumentorum quae administrantur in eo, cum sit ex additione declinationis, sicut feci in duobus Capitulis praecedentibus.	Then I have described to you from that all the science that contains my book: and on what concerns the experiment of mine, which I will abbreviate to you, since I have shortened it, and freed it from the occupation of elongation, and abbreviated it by the end of abbreviation, and showed it by the end of depreciation: and I formed in it many forms from the forms of instruments that are administered in it, when it is from the addition of depreciation, as I did in two preceding chapters.
Â¶ Summae, et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessaria est, antequam incipiamus rememorationem membrorum fractorum, et diuersorum, si uniuscuiusque.	The highest, and the collecting from a fracture of bones, from which the premise is necessary before we begin the recollection of the members that are broken, and for a long time, if of each one.
Caput II.	Chapter II.
Oportet, ut dicamus in prologo huius Capituli, summas sermonis, et capitula, ad quarum intellectum cogitur in primis artifex ad stationem super earum ueritatem: scilicet ut uos, et qui sunt prompti, sciant, uel addiscant hanc artem nobilem, et alii a uobis.	It is necessary, that we should say in the prologo of this chapter, the sum of the discourse, and chapters, to which the intellect of the artisan is considered in the first place on the truth of it: that is to say, that you, and who are ready, know, or learn this noble art, and others from you.
Dico, ergo, quod quando accidit alicui fractura, aut dislocatio, aut torsio, aut casus: tunc oportet, ut properes in primis ad phlebotomandum eum, et soluendum ipsum, aut utraque simul: si non prohibeat aliquid, sicut debilitas uirtutis: aut est ille cui accidit aliquid ex illis puer, aut senex decrepitus: aut est tempus uehementis caloris, aut uehementis frigoris ualde.	I say, therefore, that when it happens to anyone that there is a fracture, or dislocation, or torsion, or fall: then you should take care in the first place to phlebotomate him, and solve him, or both simultaneously: if not prevent anything, such as weakness of strength: or is he who happened to some boy, or old man of decrepitus: or it is a time of severe heat, or a severe cold.
Deinde sit contentus in cibo suo, oleribus frigidis, et carnibus auium, et haedorum: et prohibe uinum, et carnes grossas, et repleri ex cibis et omni cibo qui replet uenas sanguine.	Then be satisfied with your food, cold drinks, meats of birds and heads; and prohibit wine, thick meat, and food that fills the veins with blood.
Donec quando securus sis ex apostemate calido, et non times effusionem materiei ad membrum: tunc redeat infirmus ad regimen suum primum cum quo cucurrit consuetudo eius.	Until you are completely cured of your fever and no longer have any discharge from the wound; then return to your regular routine with that person, after his habit has been restored.
Cum ergo incipit os fractum restaurari, tunc oportet, ut cibetur infirmus cibis nutrientibus nutrimento multo, grosso, graui, in quibus sit uiscositas: sicut cibaria facta ex tritico cocto cum aqua, et rizum, et capita, et pedes, et uentres uaccarum, et oua, et pisces recentes: et uinum grossum, et similia illis.	Since then, when the broken jaw begins to be healed and fed with food that is nourishing and abundant, dry, and heavy, and full of blood; as with food made from wheat cooked with water, and rice, and heads, and feet, and entrails of animals, and eggs, and fresh fish: and strong wine, and similar things.
Cum hoc enim regimine fit coagulatio fracturae uelocius, et melius.	Since this regimen will make the fracture heal faster and better.
Et scias, quod ossa fracta, quando sunt in uiris qui sunt in prima senectute, et decrepitis, non est possibile, ut continuentur et consolidentur secundum naturam suam semper, propter exiccationem membrorum eorum: et consolidantur et continuantur quae ex eis sunt in fine lenitatis, sicut ossa puerornm paruorum.	And know that bones that are broken, when they are in a person who is in their old age and decrepitude, it is not possible for them to continue and be healed according to their nature always, due to the drying up of their limbs: and they are healed and continue in the end of their leniency, such as the bones of young boys.
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.	However, nature heals a broken bone from all parts with some kind of glue, in which there is roughness, by which it clings and binds itself together, until it becomes whole and firm, just as it was in the beginning, until it does not prohibit any of its functions: and because of this reason, you must put food into the diet that contains a lot of moisture, and is dry, and heavy, and full of blood, as we have said.
Et scias, quod fracturae species sunt diuersae, secundum diuersitatem membrorum: quoniam fractura cruris, est diuersa a fractura ossis capitis: et fractura ossis pectoris, est diuersa a fractura ossis dorsi: et similiter reliqua membra omnia diuersa existunt adinuicem: et ego ueni cum rememoratione omnis speciei fracturae expositae in Capitulo suo distinctae ab alia.	And know that the types of fractures are different, according to the difference between the limbs: for a fracture of the leg is different from a fracture of the skull: and a fracture of the breast bone is different from a fracture of the spine: and similarly all the other limbs are different from each other; and I will come back with a reminder of all the types of fractures that have been mentioned in their own chapter, which is distinct from the others.
Et diuersificantur species fracturae ossis etiam in seipsa.	They also differ in the types of fractures of bones, even within themselves.
Quoniam fit fractura eius arcuata, praeter quod accidant in ea astellae.	For the fracture is curved, except that which happens to it in the sternum.
Et quandoque fit fractura eius secundum longitudinem ossis: et sunt fracturae eius satagiae, id est, astellae, et additiones procedentes, sicut sunt in calamo, cum aptatur cultello ad scribendum.	And when the fracture is according to the length of the bone; and there are fractures of the hand, that is to say, of the sternum, and additions proceeding from it, as are in the reed, when it is held by a knife for writing.
Et non procedentes: et est fractura cum uulnere et disruptione in capite: et est fractura fissura parua.	And not proceeding: and there is a fracture with the ulna and dislocation in the head; and there is a fracture, a small crack.
Et omni speciei est ingenium, uel instrumentum proprium in restauratione eius, secundum quod ueniet rememoratio eius, distincta in locis suis.	And every species has an art, or its own instrument for repairing it, according to the memory of it, distinguished in its places.
Et ex eo quo cognoscitur fractura ossis, est tortuositas eius, et ipsius eminentia: et apparitio eius sensui, et sonitus eius quando comprimis ipsum manu tua.	And from this it is known that the fracture of a bone is its curvature and eminence; and its appearance to the sense, and its sound when you press it with your hand.
Quando ergo non est in loco tortuositas apparens, neque sonitus apud tactum tuum cum tangis os cum agitatione, neque inuenit infirmus magnum dolorem: tunc non est illic fractura, imo possibile est, ut sit tortuositas, aut fissura parua: non ergo oportet, ut moueas ipsum cum manu et compressione omnino, imo pone super ipsum ex medicinis, quarum uenit rememoratio, post momentum illud quod conuenit loco: deinde stringatur strictura subtili.	And when it is not in place, the curvature does not appear, nor does its sound at touch with your hand when you press the bone with agitation; and there is no great pain in it: then it is not a fracture there, but possible that there is a curvature or a small crack; so you need not to move it with your hand and compression completely, but rather place something firm on it from the doctors, of whose memory it has been said, after time has passed when it comes to its place: and then tighten it tightly with a string.
Et scias, quod locus quando arcuatur, et scinditur in duo, praeter quod accidant in eo satagiae, uerumtamen remouetur omnis pars a compari sua: tunc oportet tibi, ut incipias ab hora tua ad rectificationem eius, aequando ipsum antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And you should know that the place when it is curved, and is divided into two, except that which happens to it in the sternum; nevertheless, all parts are removed from each other: so you must begin to straighten it from your time, equalizing it before it happens to it an apostema of heat.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum, tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec quiescat apoestema.	But if it has happened to it an apostema of heat; then you should leave it for a few days, until the apostema is at rest.
Deinde aequa ipsum secundum quemcunque modum potest ex lenitate et ingenio.	Then make it equal on all sides according to your ability, with ease and art.
Et scias, quod restauratio eius, et ipsius aequatio, est facilior quam ossis, in quo accidunt satagiae.	You should know that restoration and equality of this are easier than bones, in which satagination occurs.
Deinde stringe ipsum, secundum quod ueniet tibi rememoratio eius.	Then tighten him up, according to how you want his memory to be.
Si uero in osse sunt satagiae, tunc necessaria est extensio huius membri fracti ex duabus partibus, si manus sit, aut pes: aut cum manu tua, si membrum est paruum: aut cum duobus funibus, aut cum fune et manu.	If, however, satagiae have occurred in the bone, then it is necessary to extend this broken member from two parts, if the hand is affected, or the foot: or with your hand only, if the member is small: or with two cables, or with a cable and a hand.
Et sit positio tua qua ponis membrum super locum aequalem, secundum figuram suam naturalem, donec quando extenduntur partes membri fracti: tunc conare, ut redire facias illas additiones omni ingenio, et secundum quemcunque modum potes in locis suis: et caue secundum fortitudinem tuam, ne accidat super infirmum per operationem tuam dolor, neque laesio: et conare secundum fortitudinem tuam, ut applices unum duorum ossium cum socio suo, secundum meliores formas.	And your position should be such that you put the member on a place of equality, according to its natural shape, until all the parts of the broken member are extended: then be careful that you do not add anything in any way, and in any form you can: and be careful, according to your strength, that no pain occurs due to your operation, or negligence: and be careful according to your strength, so that you join one two bones with its associate, according to the better forms.
Et oportet in illa hora, ut tentes et tangas ipsum manu tua.	And it is necessary in that hour, so that you try and touch him with your hand.
Si ergo uides illic aliquid diuersum, rectifica ipsum, et aequa illud per quantitatem tuae uirtutis.	If then you see anything different there, straightened out it is, and equal it out by the amount of your strength.
Et caue extensionem uehementem, et compressionem fortem, sicut faciunt multi stolidorum.	And be careful that the extension does not become sudden, and strong compression, as many do with their stupidity.
Multotiens enim faciunt accidere per operationem illam suam apostema calidum, aut contractionem in membro: sicut iam uidimus illud ex operationibus eorum multotiens.	For often by such operation of theirs, they cause hot apoplexy, or contraction in a member: as we have already seen this from their operations many times.
Deinde annecte post aequationem, et decentem operationem, et stricturam illius membri, et quietem, et tranquillitatem: et mone infirmum super ipsum.	Then, after the equality has been completed, and the work of stretching the member is done, and it has become stiff, and quiet, and calm: and warn the sick person about him.
Et fac ipsum cauere, ne moueat ipsum in hora suarum uigiliarum, et somni sui apud reuolutionem suam, et agitationem suam, et apud egestionem suam, et omnes motus suos ultima uirtute sua.	And make him careful not to move in the hour of his strength, and his sleep at its revolution, and agitation, and his delivery, and all his movements at the last of his strength.
Et ut caueat, ne sit positio membri positio cum qua sequatur dolor.	And so that he does not cause a position to be in place where pain follows.
Quod est, quia quando sentit in dispositione positionis membri dolorem, aut laesionem: tunc oportet, ut permutes ipsum ad dispositionem aliam ab illa cum qua non sentiat dolorem.	When he feels pain or injury in the position of a member, then it is necessary that you change him to another position from which he does not feel pain.
Et caue cum illo, ut sit positio eius illa aequalis, recta: ut non accidat in membro tortuositas, quando restauratur.	And if with him so that his position is equal, straight: so that there does not happen to the member, when it is restored, a curvature,
Et qualitas stricturae membri fracti est, secundum quod narro.	and the quality of a broken member is, according to whether it is narrow.
Scias, quod membra fracta diuersificantur in paruitate sua, et eorum magnitudine, et ipsorum forma.	You know that broken members differ in their break, and their size, and their shape.
Quae ergo ex eis sunt parua, sicut brachium, et digitus, et focile, et similia eis, tunc oportet, ut sit inuolutio panni mollis, subtilis.	Which of them are small, such as the arm, and the finger, and the paw, and such things, then it is necessary that there be a soft, thin cloth.
Quae autem ex eis sunt grossa, sicut coxa, et crus, oportet ut sit in eis inuolutio lata, dura.	Which, however, are thick, such as the hip, and the leg, it is necessary that there be a broad, hard cloth.
Quoniam ligamentum latum, connectit membrum magnum, et stringit ipsum ab omni parte strictura aequali, ita quod non ingreditur ipsum macula.	Since the wide ligament connects a large member and tightens it from all parts with an equal tightness so that it does not enter it with a wound.
Deinde incipe post euacuationem tuam ab aequatione ponere linimentum conueniens ad illud, in stuppa leni super locum fracturae ipsius.	Then begin to put after your evacuation the ointment suitable for it on the fracture site with a soft cloth in a poultice.
Deinde incipe inuoluere ligamentum super locum fracturae ipsius tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod meretur membrum: et stringe manum tuam parumper cum ligamento.	Then begin to wrap the ligament over the site of the fracture three or four times, as much as the limb deserves: and hold your hand lightly with the bandage.
Deinde uade cum eo ad partem superiorem a loco fracturae, et stringe minus quam fuit strictura tua, qua strinxisti locum fractum.	Then walk with it to the upper part from the site of the fracture, and tighten less than the tightness you tightened the broken spot, how tight you tightened the spot.
Deinde elonga te cum inuolutione a loco fracturae parumper, et mollifica stricturam paulatim, donec capias ex loco sano rem magnam.	Then stretch yourself with the bandage from the site of the fracture slightly, and soften the tightness gradually, until you take it off at the healthy spot on the skin.
Deinde accipe uittam aliam, et inuolue eam iterum super locum fractum inuolutionibus.	Then take another clean one, and wrap it again over the broken site with the bandage.
Postea uade cum inuolutione ad partem inferiorem a fractura.	Then walk with it to the lower part from the fracture spot.
Et sit operatio tua in strictura inuolutionis, et mollificatione eius, secundum quod diximus in inuolutione prima superiore.	And let your operation be in the tightness of the bandage, and the softening of it, as we said in the first upper wrapping.
Deinde pone inter inuolutiones ex stuppa leni, aut panno, cum quo aequetur tortuositas fracturae, si est in ea tortuositas: et si non, non ponas in ea aliquid.	Then place between the folds of the envelope or cloth a piece of linen, with which to cover the fracture, if it is twisted; and if not, do not place anything in it.
Deinde inuolue super ipsam uittam aliam.	Then wrap another bandage over the top.
Postea aequa super has inuolutiones astellas decenter factas statim, si non est in loco inflatio, neque apostema calidum.	Then immediately apply a warm poultice to these bandages if there is no swelling or bruising; and an ice pack if there is swelling or bruising.
Si autem in ea est inflatio, aut apostema: tunc pone super eam quod sedet illud apostema, et auferat inflationem: et dimitte eam aliquot diebus.	If there is swelling or bruising, then place a poultice on it and let it sit to draw out the swelling; and leave it for a few days.
Deinde stringe super ipsam tunc astellas.	Then bind firmly around the area.
Et sint Astellae ex medietatibus cannae latae, rasae, formatae sapienter: aut sint ex ligno unde fiunt cribra, quae fiunt ex pino, aut geraid, id est, ramis palmae, aut calingi: et sit amplitudo omnis Astellae, secundum hanc formam, et hanc eandem figuram.	And the bands should be made from middle sections of a long cane, thin and shaped wisely; or from a crib-like material made from pine, or from bark; and each band should have the same width and shape, and this same figure.
Verumtamen oportet, ut Astella quae ponitur super ipsam tracturam, sit grossior et latior parumper, quam reliquae Astellae: et longitudo Astellae sit secundum quod licet membro ex magnitudine et paruitate.	However, the band that is applied to the limb should be slightly thicker and wider than the others; and the length of the band should correspond to the size and shape of the member.
Deinde stringe super Astellas cum uitta alia, secundum stricturam primam eandem.	Then bind the bands together with another piece of linen wrapped tightly around them.
Deinde liga desuper cum filis decenter, secundum quod diximus de strictura: et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae plus: et quanto plus elongatur a fractura sit, strictura minor.	Then tie the top ends together with a loose knot, as we have said regarding the tightness of the bandage; and let the length of the band be less than the distance from the fracture, for the tighter it is, the more it will hurt; and if it is too long, cut it short.
Et oportet, ut sint fila media in grossitudine et subtilitate, et sint ex lino molli.	And let the middle bands be neither too thick nor too thin, and let them be made of soft linen.
Quoniam si fila sunt grossa, sicut uidi ex operatione stolidorum ponentium fila sua ex chordis lini tortis, est error magnus: quoniam cadit strictura cum eis extra qualitatem.	For if the bands are too thick, as when a band of linen is wound around with a knuckle from a string of linum tortum, it causes great injury; for the bandage slips out of its place.
Et fila subtilia iterum non conueniunt: quoniam tu non consequeris per stricturam cum eis illud quod uis.	And thin bands are also not suitable: because you do not achieve what you want by using a band that is too loose.
Et non oportet, ut sit inter astellam et astellam minus quam digitus.	And it should not be less than the thickness of a finger between the band and the member.
Quod si laeditur infirmus per extremitates astellarum post stricturam in locis sanis: tunc pone sub eis ex stuppa leni, aut lana carminata, donec nihil laedatur ex illo.	If one is injured through the extremities of the limbs after a constriction in healthy places: then place under them from a loose cloth or red wool, until there is no more injury from it.
Quando autem est fractura cum uulnere, et accidit disruptio in cute, ego ueniam cum rememoratione eius in capitulo secundum singularitatem.	But when the fracture is with the ulnar bone, and there is a rupture on the skin, I will come to it with a reminder of it in the second chapter for singularity.
Et scias, quod non omne membrum fractum oportet ut stringatur cum astellis a primo die.	And you should know that not every broken limb needs to be immobilized with splints from the first day.
Quod est, quia membrum quando est magnum, non oportet ut ponas superipsum astellas, nisi post quinque dies, aut septem, aut plus, secundum securitatem tuam ab euentu apostematis calidi.	That is, because the limb is large when it is, you should not place it on top of splints, unless after five days or seven or more, according to your security from the appearance of callus heat.
Et iste est modus emplastrorum, quibus restaurabant antiqui, quae ponuntur super fracturam et dislocationem.	And this is the way that the ancient splints were made, which were placed on top of the fracture and dislocation.
Â¶ Modus Emplastri communis abbreuiati, restaurans fracturam, conueniens pluribus complexionibus, praecipue mulieribus, et pueris: quoniam est ex eo super quod non uincit calor, neque frigus.	A common shortened way of making splints, suitable for restoring fractures with many layers, especially for women and children; because it does not injure from heat, nor does it freeze.
Et est, ut accipias ex puluere molendini, et est medulla farinae quae pendet in parietibus molendini apud motum molae: et conficias ipsum sicut est, praeter quod cribelles ipsum cum albugine oui: et pone confectionem eius non spissam, neque subtilem.	And it is so that you take from a flour miller's cloth, and there is a flour that hangs on the walls of the miller's motion: and lay it down as it is, except for that the wires are covered with white wax; and place its coating not thick, nor thin.
Deinde utere eo.	Then use it.
Â¶ Modus Emplastri alius, restaurantis fracturam, et dislocationem, et torsionem.	A different way of making splints, suitable for restoring fractures and dislocations and twists.
Recipe almess, et laudani, et acaciae, et enulae, et mugath: et suc, omnium ana Ê X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana Ê V et alethil Ê XX terantur omnia, et cribellentur, et misceantur cum aqua alethil: aut cum albugine oui, si complexio infirmi est calefacta.	Take almes, and lauren, and acacia, and ewes' milk, and mug-beer; and honey of both kinds, of myrrh five parts, and of aleth 20 parts to mix it with water of alethil; or with white wax if the ointment is for a warm injury.
Deinde utere hoc emplastro.	Then use this splint.
Nam ipsum est bonae compositionis, restaurat ossa fracta uelociter, et confert pluribus hominibus.	For it is a good composition, which restore broken bones quickly, and suit many people.
Â¶ Modus Emplastri alius, quod etiam confert fracturae et torsioni.	A different way of applying an plaster which is also used for fractures and twists.
Recipe mugath, et mess, et alteae albae, omnium ana Ê X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana Ê V acaciae Ê VI boli armeni Ê XX terantur omnia contritione multa, et cribellentur, et conficiantur cum aqua, aut albugine oui: et administrentur.	Take myrrh and meslin and other herbs in equal parts: of myrrh 10 drachms, of meslin and other herbs 5 drachms, of acacia 6 drachms, of armenian bole 20 drachms; all well crushed and mixed with water or albumen: and give it to the patient.
Â¶ Modus Emplastri ad iuncturas, et ossa separata ex locis suis: et sedat dolorem accidentem eis, et scissuram ossis, et fracturam.	This is a method of applying an ointment for joints, bones separated in their own places: and to soothe pain, injury to them, fracture of the bone, and twist.
Sumatur lana succida, et submergatur in aceto, et oleo decocto: et ponatur super locum.	Take a lamb's wool, and immerse it in vinegar and oil, and place it on the spot.
Et in hoc quidem Emplastro non est uirtus restaurationis, sed est bonum in sedatione apostematis calidi: et expellit dolores proprie.	And this plaster is not useful for restoring (health), but is good for soothing inflammation of heat: and it drives away the pains (of their own accord).
Â¶ Modus Emplastri, quod restaurat os fractum.	This is a method of applying an ointment which restores a broken bone.
Sume folia fici surdi, et folia papaueris syluestris: et tere omnia, et fac emplastrum ex utrisque.	Take leaves of fig and leaves of wild papaya; all well crushed, and make an ointment of both.
Â¶ Modus Emplastri abbreuiati, administrati apud restaurationem fracturae ossis: et quando tu uis resolutionem residui apostematis.	This is a short method of applying an ointment, to be used for restoring a broken bone: and when you wish to use it for soothing inflammation.
Recipe radicis alteae, et camomillae, et florum uiolarum, et farinae herbi, omnium ana partem unam: terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum uino, si non est membrum calefactum.	Take roots of echinacea and chamomile and flowers of violet and herb-seed, all in equal parts; well crushed all, and mixed with wine, if it is not a member which needs to be warmed.
Si uero est calefactum, tunc confice illud cum aqua coriandri humidi, aut cum aqua, et utere eo.	If it is however to be warmed, then prepare that with water of coriander and water, and use it.
Â¶ Modus Emplastri alius fortioris in resolutione, quam istud primum, quando accidit apostema durum apud restaurationem membri.	This is a stronger method of applying an ointment in case of inflammation which occurs first when restoring a limb.
Recipe radicis alteae, et seminis lini, et balaustiae, et melliloti, et samsuci, et floris uiolarum, et camomillae, omnium ana, partem unam, terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum aqua salicis, aut cum aqua dulci, aut cum uino.	Take roots of echinacea and linseed and balm of gomsuc and mealy-fruit and violet and chamomile, all in equal parts; well crushed, and mixed with water of willow, or with sweet water, or with wine.
Totum illud secundum caliditatem membri, et quietem caloris eius.	All this is due to the heat of the member, and the calmness of his heat.
Hippocrates uero non dixit in libro suo, quod ponatur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius, nisi caerotum factum ex caera, et oleo: non aliud: et narrauit, ut sit medium inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem.	Hippocrates, indeed, did not say in his book that a broken member should be placed in a poultice made of straw and oil, unless it has become infected, nor did he say anything else, and he relates, that it should be between coarseness and softness.
Galeno autem uisum est, ut ponantur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius res, in quibus est exiccatio caliditatis, sicut myrrha, et aloes et olibanum, et similia eis ex eis quae narrauimus.	But Galenus, however, has related that they should be placed on a broken member during its restoration, those things in which there is drying up of heat, such as Myrrh and Aloes and Olibanum, and similar ones from these that we have mentioned.
Â¶ Modus Emplastri quod confert ad laesionem et dolorem.	The mode of the poultice which is applied to a wound and pain.
Recipe mugath, et ciceris, et capillorum hominis incisorum, aut pennae auis, et alteae, et salis partes aequales: terantur, et cribellentur, et conficiantur: et fiat ex eo emplastrum.	Take wool and chickpea and hair of man's teeth, or feathers of bird, and aloes, and salt in equal parts: they are to be ground and shaken up, and made into a poultice.
Quantitas autem secundum quam oportet, ut remaneat ligatura, deinde soluatur, est, ut consideres tunc, si non accidit infirmo dolor, neque pruritus, neque mouetur os fractum a loco suo: tunc non resoluas ipsum diebus multis.	But as regards the quantity, so that the binding remains and then is resolved, you are to consider this then, if it does not happen that the pain remains sick, nor itchiness, nor the broken jaw moves from its place: do not resolve it over several days.
Quod si accidat ei in loco pruritus uehemens, aut dolor inquietans, aut inflatio: tunc propera, et solue in hora ipsum, et aufer emplastrum ab eo: et accipe pannum lenem, aut spongiam marinam lenem, humidam: et submerge eam in aqua tepida, et ablue cum ea locum, donec quiescat pruritus, et sedetur dolor.	If, however, it happens to him in the place that there is a severe itchiness, or an annoying pain, or an inflammation: then hasten and resolve it at once, and take away the poultice from him: and take a sheet of linen, or a sea sponge, wet with linen: and dip it into warm water, and wash away the place with it, until the itchiness is appeased, and the pain subsides.
Deinde dimitte membrum quiescere una hora.	Then let the member rest for an hour.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam succidam, submersam in aceto et oleo, aut oleo rosato: et liga super ipsum nocte una, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido, et quiescat inflatio membri, et remoueatur dolor eius.	Then put on the member a sheet of linen smeared with vinegar and oil, or with oil only: and bind it over him for the night, so that he is safe from being affected by heat, and let the pain in the member subside, and let the pain of the member cease.
Deinde itera ipsum ad stricturam subtilem, et emplastrum paruum: et non stringas ipsum constrictione tua prima, et subtilia cum eo, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the application to the member of a thin poultice, and of a few: and do not tighten it with your own constriction first, and with something fine, until it is healed.
Quod si uides, quod apostema, et rubedo, et dolor, et inflatio, et omnia accidentia iam remota sunt penitus, et indiges emplastro et strictura, tunc itera illud sicut fecisti in primis aequaliter.	If you see that the apthalma [a small flap of skin] is red, painful, swollen, and all other symptoms have disappeared completely, and the plaster has dried up and the constriction has relaxed, then apply it again as you did at first, equally.
Quod si non accidit membro aliquid ex eis quae diximus, tune non soluas ipsum, nisi post tres dies, aut quatuor, aut quinque, aut septem.	If any of these conditions do not exist in the member, do not remove the plaster until after three days, or four, or five, or seven.
Et quando que dimittitur uiginti diebus totum illud, secundum quod apparet tibi ex solutione membri, sicut diximus, donec quando adhaeret fractura, et approximat coagulatio carnis super eam: adde etiam tunc in strictura plus quam strictura tua prima tota: et adde etiam in ingrossatione cibi infirmi, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius.	And when the plaster has been removed after twenty days as far as the member seems to you to be free from its symptoms, according to what we have said, until such time that the fracture seems to be united, and the coagulation of flesh above it is approximated: add also then to the constriction more than your first constriction: and add also to the swelling of food as much as the recollection of it preceded.
Si autem uides locum fracturae iam exiccari, et extenuari plus quam oportet: tunc scias, quod nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad ipsum.	If you see the place of the fracture is drying up and becoming weaker than necessary: then know that food is forbidden to reach it.
Embroca ergo ipsum cum aqua tepida apud omnem uicem qua soluis ipsum, et sit illud in omnibus tribus diebus, et alleuia stricturam parumper.	So wet the plaster with warm water at every turn, and let it remain on for all three days, and let the constriction be slightly relaxed.
Per hanc ergo operationem currit ad membrum nutrimentum, et sanatur uelociter.	By this means the operation runs to the member with food, and heals quickly.
Illud autem quod faciunt stolidi restauratores ex fractura membri uice alia, quando non restauratur in primis, secundum quod oportet, et restauratur secundum tortuositatem, est error ex operatione eorum, et timor magnus: et si esset rectum, dixissent illud antiqui in libris suis, et operati fuissent cum eo.	But that which the clumsy restorators do from a fracture of the limb, when they do not restore it in the first place, according to what is necessary, and restore it according to its tortuosity, is an error of their operation, and a great fear: and if it were right, the ancient ones would have said it in their books, and would have operated with it.
Et ego non uidi alicubi eorum uestigium in illo omnino, et rectius est, ut non fiat illud.	And I did not see any trace of theirs at all on that, and it is better not to do so.
Â¶ De factura accidente in capite.	Regarding the making of an accident in the head.
Caput III.	Chapter III:
Species fracturae sunt diuersae, et figurae eius multae: et caussae eius sunt distinctae.	There are many kinds and shapes of fractures, and its causes are separate.
Nam ex fractura est quae fit a percussione cum ense: et percussio aufert os totum usquequo peruenit ad siphac, quod est sub osse, sicut facit axia in ligno: et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Axialis.	For from a fracture is caused by a blow, and the blow takes the bone away until it reaches the socket, which is under the bone, as it does in wood by an axe: and for this reason this type of fracture is called a axial fracture.
Aut ensis incidit quiddam ossis, et incidit faciem eius, et non penetrat incisio usque ad ultimum eius: et nominatur haec species fracturae Kalaan, id est, Leuatio absolute.	A certain bone was struck by the blow, and it struck his face, and the incision did not penetrate to the very end of it: and this kind of fracture is called Kalaan, that is, an absolute luxation.
Et est uulnus duarum fracturarum, aut magnum, aut paruum.	And there is a fracture of two bones, or a large one, or a small one.
Et ex fractura est, quae est contritio, aut attritio: et caussa eius est percussio cum lapide, aut casus super lapidem, aut eis similia.	And from a fracture there is a bruise, or an abrasion: and its cause is a blow with a stone, or a fall on a stone, or similar things.
Et haec fractura est etiam aut penetrans, quae iam appropinquat panniculo, quod est sub osse: aut est in facie ossis: et est uulnus harum duarum fracturarum etiam aut paruum, aut magnum.	And this fracture is also penetrating, which is beginning to approach a skin flap, which is under the bone: or it is on the face of a bone; and that kind of fracture of the two bones is also small, or large.
Et ex fractura est, quae est occulta in osse in subtilitate capilli: et est fissura parua, et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Capillaris.	And from a fracture there is one that is hidden in the bone in a hair's breadth: and it is a small split, and for that reason this kind of fracture is called the Capillary fracture.
Et ex eis est fractura, quae fit a casu, aut percussione lapidis, et eis similium, quae faciunt ingredi laminam ossis ad interiora, et fit loco concauitas: sicut accidit caldariis aeris, quando occurrit eis percussio, et ingreditur pars eorum ad interiora.	And from them there is one that is made by a fall, or the hitting of a stone, and similar things, which cause the layer of bone to enter inwardly, and it is done by a crushed piece: such as happens in the case of caldarius air, when such an occurrence takes place, and a part of them enters inwardly.
Et plurimum quidem fit illud in capitibus humidorum ossium, sicut sunt capita puerorum.	And many are made in the heads of the moist bones, such as are the heads of boys.
Et fiunt omnibus istis speciebus fracturae satagiae separatae, et ego ueniam cum rememoratione illius totius in loco suo.	And all these kinds of fracture occur separately, and I will go back to remind myself of all this in its place.
Et cognoscimus omnes has species fracturae per detectionem super eam, et inquisitionem earum cum tentis, et ablationem carnium corruptarum, quae sunt super eas.	And we know all these kinds of fractures by their appearance on them, and by questioning them with the touch, and by removing the corrupted flesh that is above them.
Species uero Capillaris cognoscitur per hoc, quod detegitur super os, et abstergitur, et linitur super ipsum cum encaustro: fractura enim apparet nigra.	Indeed the Capillary species is recognized by this, that it is detected on the bone, and is cleaned off, and is kept over it with a caustic: for the fracture appears black.
In curatione autem fracturae, considera in primis accidentia infirmi: tunc si uides ex accidentibus quod significet significatione manifesta super timorem, sicut uomitus cholerae, et extensio, et amissio intellectus, et abscisio uocis, et syncopis, et febris acuta, et egressus oculorum, et rubedo eorum, et similia eis ex accidentibus in pluribus dispositionibus, proculdubio non sanatur: et si uides accidentia non terrentia te, et speras salutem: tunc incipe curationem eius.	In the cure of a fracture, consider first the nursing injuries: then if you see from these injuries what signifies an obvious sign on the fear, such as vomiting cholera, spread, loss of intelligence, absence of speech, syncope, acute fever, Ã§Ä±kÄ±Å of the eyes, and their redness, and similar things to these injuries in many dispositions, it is certainly not a cure: and if you see non-terrifying injuries, and hope for salvation: then begin to treat them.
Quod est, si uenit ad te uulneratus in primis cum uulneratur: et est illud in diebus hyemis, tunc oportet, ut studeas in ablatione ossis ante diem quartumdecimum secundum omnem dispositionem.	If he comes to you wounded first when wounded: and it is that in the days of the half, then you should study to seek out all the arrangement in the ablative of the bone before the fourteenth day second.
Et si est in diebus aestatis, tunc oportet, ut properes remouere os ante diem septimum, antequam corrumpatur quod est sub osse ex panniculo, et accidant illa accidentia quae narrauimus.	And if it is in the days of summer, then you should study to remove the bone before the seventh day, before what is under the bone from a patchwork, and the accidents that we have described.
Quod si fractura ossis iam peruenit ad panniculum tangentem cerebrum, et est cum minutiis, et attractione: tunc oportet, ut incidas partem comminutam, et attritam, secundum quod narro tibi.	That if the fracture of the bone has already reached the patchwork touching the brain, and is with a little, and the attraction: then you should study to strike down the broken part, and broken, according to what I tell you.
Et est, ut radas caput uulnerati: et detege super os secundum quemcunque modum possibile est tibi: et secundum figuram uulneris, et quod leue est super infirmum.	And is, as you shave the head of the wounded: and detect above the bone in any way possible for you: and according to the shape of the wound, and what is easier over the weak.
Quod si accidat tibi apud detectionem ossis fluxus sanguinis, aut apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet.	That if it happens to you during the detection of the flow of blood from the bone, or a warm poultice: then you should oppose it with what is necessary.
Et est, ut impleas locum cum pannis infusis in uino, et oleo rosato: et facias quiescere uulnus, donec sedetur apostema, et sis securus a fluxu sanguinis.	And is, as you fill the place with liniments soaked in wine, and oil rosin: and make the wound quiet, until it subsides poultice, and are secure from the flow of blood.
Deinde incipe in curatione ossis, et ablatione eius.	Then begin in the cure of the bone, and its removal.
Et illud fit secundum unum duorum modorum.	And it is done according to two ways.
Modus quidem unus est, ut incidas os cum Incisorio strictae aciei: et haec est forma eius.	One way is, as you strike the bone with a sharp chisel: and this is the form of it.
Dende administra Incisorium aliud post Incisorum latius eo parumper: et haec est forma eius.	Then administer another Incisorium after the first wider by a little: and this is the form of it.
Deinde administra etiam Incisorium aliud latius etiam quam secundum.	Then also administer a third Incisorium wider than the second.
Et modus secundus est, ut sit apud te numerus Incisoriorum diuersorum: quorum quaedam sint latiora quibusdam, et quaedam eorum breuiora quibusdam: et sint in ultimo acuitatis extremitatum suarum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut fuled: et utere facilitate in percussione super Incisorium, ut non concutiat caput, et laedat ipsum.	And the second way is, as there are by you a number of chisels different: some are wider to some, and some of them are shorter to some: and let them be in the end of their sharpness, and let them be of iron, or of fuel: and use convenience in their striking over the chisel, so that they do not wound the head, and hurt themselves.
Si autem os est forte, durum: tunc oportet, ut perfores in circumitu eius, antequam tu administres Incisoria, cum Terebris quae nominantur Terebra non profundantia: et non nominantur ita, nisi quoniam ipsa non pertranseunt terminum ossis carnei ad illud, quod est post ipsum: propterea, quod Terebro est extremitas rotunda super illud, quod est sub capite eius acuto, similis margini, et circulus paruus prohibet submergi, et pertransire spissitudinem ossis.	If the jaw is strong and firm, then you should perform incisions around it before administering any incisions with knives called tera-brae that do not cut deeply: they are not named so unless they do not pass beyond the border of bone to that which is after it; for tera-brae is a rounded extremity above it, which has an acute tip, similar to its margin, and a small circle prevents it from submerging and penetrating the thickness of the bone.
Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis Terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo Terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.	And it is fitting that you should take from these tera-brae a great number, of which each corresponds to the quantity of thickness of bone, until you have all the cranial tera-brae present: whose acute quantity in length and breadth corresponds to the quantity of thickness of its bone.
Et haec est forma trium specierum Terebrorum, uel Trepanorum.	And this is the form of the three types of tera-brae, or trepanations.
Qualitas autem perforandi in circumitu ossis fracti, est: ut ponas Terebrum super os, et reuoluas ipsum digitis tuis, donec scias, os iam penetratum esse.	The quality of piercing around the fractured bone is this: that you place the tera-brae above the bone, and rotate it with your fingers until you know that the bone has been penetrated.
Deinde permuta Terebrum ad locum alium, et pone quod est inter omne foramen quantitatem grossitudinis radii, aut circiter illud.	Then replace the tera-brae in a different location and place what is between all the apertures of a thickness corresponding to the radius, or around it.
Deinde incide cum Incisoriis quod est inter omne foramen ex osse: et fac illud subtilius quam potes super illud ex fine leuitatis, sicut diximus, donec eradices os, aut manu tua, aut cum aliquo alio ex quibusdam instrumentis, quae parasti ad illud: sicut tenaliae, et forpices subtiles.	Then cut with the incisorim-tools what is between all the apertures from the bone, and make it thinner than you can by hand on top of it, as we have said, until you have cut through the bone, or with your own hand, or with any other tool that you have prepared for it: such as scalpel-blades, and fine tweezers.
Et oportet, ut caueas omni cautela, ne tangat Terebrum, aut Incisorium aliquid ex siphac.	And it is necessary that you should take every precaution so that the tera-brae or any of the incisorim-tools do not touch.
Cum ergo circumieris os perforando, et separatum fuerit a siphac, si fuerit continuum cum eo, et extraxeris ipsum, oportet ut radas, et aeques extremitatem eius quod remanet in osse cum instrumento alio simili Incisorio.	When you have thus gone around the bone with piercing, and separated it away from its socket, if it is still attached to it, and you extract it, then you should saw it off, and make equal its end that remains in the bone with another similar incisorim-tool.
Verumtamen oportet, ut sit tenuis et subtilis magis aliis Incisoriis.	Indeed, it is necessary that he be less and more subtle with other incisions.
Quod si remanet aliquid ex ossibus paruis, et satagiae: tunc accipe ea cum facilitate, cum eo quod est apud te ex instrumentis.	If anything remains of the small bones, and the fracture is stable: then take them easily with you, along with the instruments that are with you.
Deinde cura uulnus post illud cum liciniis, et unguentis quae diximus.	Then care for the wound afterwards with liniments and ointments as we have said.
Et modus alius operationis est facilis, prorsus longinquus a timore: quem dixit Galenus, et laudauit ipsum laude magna: et iste est sermo eius.	And another method of the operation is easy, far removed from fear: which Galen said, and praised it highly: and this is his saying.
Necese est tibi in primis, ut incipias detegere partem ossis ex loco, in quo fractura est uehementior, et manifestior: donec quando detexeris illam partem, et posueris sub eo extremitatem huius Incisorii lenticularis, cuius haec est forma.	It is necessary that you first begin to grasp the bone on the side where the fracture is more severe and more evident: until when you have grasped it, and placed under it the far extreme of this lens-shaped incision, whose this is its form.
Et pars lenticularis, lenis non incidit aliquid: et pars acuta eius in duabus lateribus eius uadens in longitudinem, sicut uides: ut sit pars lenticularis innixa ad siphac, facie eius incidente acuta in osse.	And the lens-shaped part, which does not cut anything: and the acute side of it on its two sides rubbing along the length, as you see: so that the lens-shaped part is placed at the chisel, with its acute edge facing the bone.
Deinde percute super Incisorium a parte una cum malleo paruo, donec incidas totum os cum facilitate, sicut reuoluitur: et tu sis securus ex panniculo, quod non accidat in eo accidens, quod timeas prorsus.	Then hit on the incision from one side with a small mallet, until you hit all the bone with ease, as it rotates: and you are safe from any panic, that there does not happen to it an accident, which you fear absolutely.
Et si medicans non esset stultior hominum, et magis ignarus eius, nec esset dormiens, tunc si remaneret aliquid annexum ossi ex panniculo in quibusdam locis, incideret ipsum ab eo cum extremitate incisorii lenticularis ipsius, et liberaret ipsum ab eo cum facilitate.	And if the medicant is not a fool among men, and more unaware of it, and is not asleep, then if anything remained attached to the bone in some places from the padding, he would hit himself with the extreme end of this lens-shaped incision, and free himself from it easily.
Liberatur enim ab eo sine nocumento, et absque timore.	For it is freed from him without harm, and without fear.
Et si fractura ossis non penetret usque ad panniculum, et illud quod abscinditur ab osse est facies eius, et remanent in ipso asperitas et satagiae subtiles: tunc oportet, ut radas illam asperitatem, et eradices illas satagias cum rasoriis subtilibus ex quibus praeparasti numerum diuersarum quantitatum, ut sit tibi possibile administrare ex eis in omni loco conuenientiora eorum, et rectiora ipsorum, secundum illud ad quod perducit te operatio, et ipsum os fractum, et figura eius.	And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate all the way down to the padding, and that which is cut off from the bone is the face of it, and there remain in it roughness and subtleties: then you should smooth out this roughness, and remove those subtleties with very sharp razors from those which you have prepared a number of different quantities, so that you can administer them to him at all times more convenient for them, and more straight according to the one which leads you the operation, and the broken bone, and its form.
Et oportet, ut administres in rasione tua, qua in primis radis os, latius illorum rasoriorum.	It is necessary that you use your razor sharp blades, especially when cutting the root of the tooth.
Deinde utere post ipsum subtiliore eo.	Then use a smaller blade after the initial cut.
Et non cesses facere illud secundum continuitatem, donec peruenias ad administrandum tenuius, et subtilius eorum omnium.	And do not stop doing that according to continuity, until you reach the point of administration which is thinner, and their all being more delicate.
In unaquaque autem fissurarum reliquarum paruarum capillarium, et fractura subtili, oportet ut administres curam, secundum illud quod perducit ad rectificationem eius.	In every one of the remaining crevices of the palate, and for the fine hair and fragile fractures, it is necessary to exercise care, according to that which leads to the correction of it.
Et est res quae non occultatur super omnem, cui in hac arte est quodlibet studium, et stetit super illud quod scripsimus, et ostendimus in fracturis magnis.	And this is a thing that is not hidden over all, to which in this art there is any study, and stands on what we have written and shown in large fractures.
Si autem panniculus detectus retinetur, quando tu eradicas os: tunc oportet, ut accipias pannum lini, secundum quantitatem uulneris, et submerge ipsum in oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super orificium uulneris.	But if a patch is held to stop the bleeding when you cut the tooth: then it is necessary that you take linen cloth according to the amount of wound, and immerse it in rose oil, and place it over the hole of the wound.
Deinde accipe pannum alium duplicatum, aut triplicatum, et submerge ipsum in uino et oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super pannum primum: et fac illud quam facilius potes super illud, ut non grauetur siphac.	Then take another cloth doubled or tripled, and immerse it in wine and rose oil, and place it over the first cloth: and do as easily as you can over it, so that it does not stick to the syringe.
Deinde administra supra ipsum ligamentum latum: et non stringas ipsum, nisi per quantitatem quae teneat uulnus tantum: et dimitte ipsum cum hac cura die uno, aut diebus duobus, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido.	Then administer over it a broad bandage: and do not tighten it, unless by the amount that holds the bone only: and let it go with this cure for one or two days, until you are free from the hot application.
Deinde solue ipsum, et administra post illud medicinas cum quibus est superflua siccitas: sicut radices lilii, et farina herbi, et puluis thuris, et aristolochia, et similia eis: et est, ut facias ex istis medicinis puluerem, qui puluerizetur super uulnus sicut sunt siccae.	Then dissolve it, and administer after it the medicines with which there is a superfluity of dryness: such as lilium roots, and herb flour, and thistle powder, and aristochnocoa, and similar things: and it is, that you make from these medicines a powder, which is powdered over the bone like those that are dry.
Et uniuersaliter administra in illo omnem medicinam de proprietate cuius est ut abstergat, et non mordicet.	And administer universally in it all the medicine of its property which is to cleanse, and not to bite.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, ut uulnus in curatione tua sit limpidum: neque sit in ea sordes unguenti, neque sordicies.	And be careful according to your skill, that the bone in your cure is clear: and it is not in it the scent of oil, or any type of smell.
Neque dimittas uirus aggregari in eo omnino: quoniam quando uirus aggregatur super panniculum cerebri, corrumpit eum, et putrefacit ipsum, et accidit super infirmum post illud malicia magna: et iam accidit in siphac capitis, cum mundificatur ab eo os, praecipue quando negligitur cura eius, nigredo in superficie eius.	And do not leave the virus to aggregate therein at all; for when the virus aggregates over the cerebrum's pannicule, it corrupts it and it putsrefies itself, and a great malady happens after that: and it has already happened in the head's sinkhole, when it was cleansed away from it the mouth, especially when its care was neglected, and blackness appeared on its surface.
Considera ergo tunc, si accidunt infirmo accidentia quae diximus, scias, quia est pernitiosum proculdubio.	Consider therefore then, if accidents happen to the sick which we have said, you will know that it is certainly perilous.
Et si nigredo non accidit, nisi a medicina quae ponitur super ipsum, et est in uirtute illius medicinae, ut faciat illam nigredinem: tunc oportet, ut accipias ex melle partem unam, ex oleo rosato partes tres, et linias cum eis pannum.	And if blackness does not happen, unless it is medicine which is placed upon it, and it is in the power of that medicine to cause it blackness: then you should take from honey one part, from rose oil three parts, and with them a cloth.
Deinde pone ipsum super siphac: postea cura ipsum cum speciebus curationis quae conueniunt, donec sanetur.	Then place the body on the sinkhole; then care for the body with the species of cure which are suitable, until it heals.
Â¶ De restauratione Nasi quando frangitur.	Of restoring a nose when it is broken.
Caput IIII.	Chapter IV.
Scias, quod non franguntur ex Naso nisi duae partes eius superiores simul, aut una earum: propterea, quod ipse sunt duo ossa: quoniam inferius eius est cartilaginosum, non frangitur, et non accidit ei nisi attritio, et tortuositas, et simitas.	You should know that the nose is not broken unless both of its upper parts break at once, or one of them; for there are two bones in it: for the lower part of it is cartilaginous, and does not break, and does not happen to it except by friction, and twists, and roughness.
Si frangitur una duarum partium eius, tunc oportet, ut intromittas digitum paruum in foramen Nasi, et aeques illam fracturam digito tuo indice, et pollice deforis, donec redeat Nasus super figuram suam naturalem: et fiat illud arte, cum facilitate.	If one of its two parts breaks, then you should put your little finger in the nose's hole, and equalize the break with your own index finger and thumb, until it returns to its natural shape: and let it be done with art, easily.
Et caue, ne accidat per operationem tuam illam super infirmum dolor.	And because, so that the accident does not happen to him on account of your operation.
Quod si fractura est in superiore parte Nasi, et non perueniat ad illam digitus: tunc oportet, ut aequetur extremitate radii, in quo sit grossitudo parua.	That if the fracture is in the upper part of the nose and does not reach that finger: then you should equalize its end with the curve in which there is a small thickness.
Si uero fractura est in duabus partibus, tunc fac simile illius: et propera cum restauratione eius in die primo fracturae, si est possibile.	But if the fracture is in both parts of it, then you should make it like that: and proceed with its restoration on the day when it was broken, if it is possible.
Et si non, tunc post diem septimum, aut decimum apud quietem apostematis calidi.	And if not, then after the seventh, or tenth day near the calm post-hemorrhage heat.
Deinde intromitte in extremitate Nasi licinium ex panno lini, si fractura est in parte una: aut intromite duo licinia si fractura est in duabus partibus: et sit in licinio grossitudo tantae quantitatis, quae impleat foramen Nasi.	Then introduce into the nose the licorice thread from a linen cloth if it is broken in one part: or introduce two licorice threads if it is broken in two parts: and let it sit in the licorice thickness of such a quantity that it fill the nostril hole.
Et dixerunt quidam antiquorum restauratorum, ut infundantur licinia in butyro, et permutentur omni die.	And said certain ancient restorers, as if they were to pour licorice into butter and exchange it every day.
Illud uero non uidetur mihi, imo oportet, ut infundatur licinium in albugine oui, confecto cum puluere molendini.	That, indeed, does not seem right to me; let it rather be poured into the albumin with the powder of a mortar.
Deinde dimitte licinium, donec firmetur os, et induretur cartilago.	Then remove the licorice, until the nose is firm, and the cartilage is hardened.
Et quandoque intromittitur in Nasum loco licinii penna anseris, postquam inuoluitur super ipsam pannus lenis: et fit, quod ipsa tenet fracturam Nasi uehementius, et ut non prohibeatur infirmus ab inspiratione.	And sometimes, when the licorice feather is introduced into the nose place of an Goose, after it has been wetted with a soft cloth: and it works so that it holds the nose fracture more securely, and does not prevent the sick from breathing.
Et non est haec res necessaria.	But this is not necessary.
Si uis, fac illud: et si uis, fac licinia.	If you want to, do that: and if you want, make licorice.
Quod si accidat Naso iterum dum operaris apostema calidum, emplastra nasum cum caeroto, aut cum coto infuso in oleo rosato, aut modico ex dyaquilon.	That, if it should happen to the nose while you are working, to patch up the post-hemorrhage heat with a green plaster, or with a cotÃ³n immersed in rose water, or with a little of dandelion.
Si autem non accidit apostema calidum, tunc oportet, ut emplastres ipsum cum farina sisami, et puluere thuris confecti cum albugine oui.	But if the post-hemorrhage heat does not occur, then it should be, that the plasters themselves are made with a sisami flour, and the thur's powder mixed with albumen is dried.
Deinde pone super ipsum stuppam lenem, et non liges Nasum cum aliquo omnino.	Then put on top of it a thin layer of linen cloth, and do not bind the nose at all.
Si uero franguntur ossa Nasi fractura parua, aut comminuuntur, tunc oportet, ut scindas super ea, et extrahas ipsa cum instrumentis quae conueniunt eis.	But if the nose bones are broken or crushed, then it is necessary to cut them above, and to extract what remains with the tools that are suitable for them.
Deinde sue scissuram, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat, et consolidat ex emplastris conuenientibus ad illud, uel unguentis.	Then take care of the incision, and look after the nose when it is healed, and consolidated with the plasters suitable for it, or with an ointment.
Quod si accidat inter Nasum uulnus, tunc oportet, ut cures ipsum cum liciniis: et administres cannulam de plumbo, donec sanetur.	If a fracture occurs in the nose, then it is necessary to treat it with a sling and administer a plumb line, until healing occurs.
Â¶ De restauratione Mandibulae inferioris, quando disrumpitur.	On restoring the lower jaw when it is broken.
Caput V.	Chapter V.
Quando disrumpitur Mandibula inferior, et fractura eius non est cum uulnere: conspice tunc si est fractura eius deforis tantum, et non frangitur in duo, et curuatur ad interiora: tunc cognitio eius est facilis.	When the lower jaw is broken and the fracture is not with the ulna: examine then if the fracture is only to the outside, and does not break into two pieces, and treat it from the inside: then the diagnosis will be easy.
Oportet ergo, si est fractura eius in parte dextra, ut intromittas digitum indicem sinistrae in os infirmi: similiter si fractura est in mandibula sinistra, tunc intromitte indicem manus dextrae: et impelle cum eo gibbositatem fracturae deintus cum facilitate ad exteriora cum manu tua altera ab interiori parte ossis decenter, et cum eo aequa ipsam.	Therefore, if the fracture is on the right side of the jaw, then you should insert your left finger into the bone to support it: likewise, if the fracture is on the left side of the jaw, then insert your right finger: and push it in with ease from the outside towards the center with your other hand from the inside of the bone, and adjust it so that it is even.
Quod si fractura mandibulae iam separata est in duo, tunc oportet, ut administres extersionem a duabus partibus, secundum rectitudinem: donec possibilis sit aequatio eius.	If the jaw fracture has already separated into two pieces, then you should administer external pressure from both sides, according to its straightness: until it is possible to adjust it.
Si autem iam accidit in dentibus commotio, aut disruptio: tunc stringe illos de quibus speras quod remaneant cum filo auri, aut argenti, aut seta.	If, however, an accident has already occurred with the teeth, or a dislocation or fracture: then tighten them with a gold wire, or silver, or silk thread.
Deinde pone super mandibulam fractam caerotum.	Then put on top of the broken jaw ointment.
Deinde pone super ipsum pannum duplicatum, et pone super pannum astellam magnam decenter factam: aut frustum cutis soleae aequale, in longitudinem mandibulae.	Then place over the jaw a double cloth, and place over it a large piece of leather cut to size: or a fragment of skin from the sole of the foot, equal in length to the jaw.
Deinde liga ipsum desuper, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ligatura eius, et conuenit ipsius applicatio, donec non destruitur: et praecipe infirmo, uti tranquillitate et quiete: et pone cibum eius sorbitiones lenes.	Then bind the jaw from above, according to how you have prepared the ligature, and let the application remain in place until it is not destroyed: and instruct the sick person to use a soft diet.
Si autem estimas, quod iam alteratur aliquid figurae aliquo modorum: tunc propera, et solue ipsum in die tertio.	If, however, you think that something has already changed in some way or another: then see to it, and loosen the binding on the third day.
Deinde rectifica quod alteratum est ex eo, et emplastra ipsum ex puluere molendini, cum albugine oui, aut cum farina sisami, postquam tu abstuleris caerotum: et pone super emplastrum lanam lenem.	Then straighten out what has been altered from it, and cover the jaw with a powder of grinding, mixed with chalk or flour, after you have removed the ointment: and place over the covering a piece of fine wool.
Dum ergo permanet annexum illud emplastrum super ipsum, et non alteratur ossis dispositio, dimitte ipsum, ne soluas, donec sanetur: aut stringe fracturam.	While that plaster remains attached to the wound, and the bone arrangement does not change, remove it, do not tear it off, until it heals: or tighten the fracture.
Multotiens enim stringitur haec fractura in tribus septimanis.	This fracture is often tightened in seven days.
Quod si interim accidat apostema calidum, tunc administra illud quod diximus multotiens in sedatione eius, donec remoueatur illud apostema.	If, however, a warm sweat occurs during this time, then administer to it what we have said often in sedating it, until it removed that sweat.
Et si fractura est cum uulnere, considera.	And if the fracture is with the ulna, consider.
Namsi iam separatur ex osse frustum, aut a satagie: tunc subtilia te in hoc, ut auferas illa frusta satagiae cum eo quod conuenit tibi in ablatione eorum ex instrumentis.	I have already separated the little fragment from the bone, or from the saw; then be careful in this that you remove those fragments of saw with it when it suits you to remove them from the instruments.
Si uero orificium uulneris est strictum, tunc amplifica ipsum cum phlebotomo secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	But if the wound opening is tight, then enlarge it with the phlebotome in the quantity required by your need.
Deinde quando abstuleris illa satagie, et non remanserit ex eis aliquid, sue tunc orificium uulneris, si est amplum: et si non, pone super ipsum ex emplastris quae conueniunt ad illud, et incarnant illud, donec sanetur.	Then, when you have removed those saws, and there remains none of them, then plug that wound opening if it is wide; and if not, put on the wound those plasters that fit to it, and let it heal up.
Â¶ De restauratione Furculae, quando frangitur.	The Restoration of the Fork, when it breaks.
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Plurimum quidem frangitur Furcula ab anteriore parte ex parte humeri, et fractura eius fit secundum unum trium modorum.	Many forks indeed break from the front part of the shoulder, and its fracture is made in one of three ways.
Aut enim frangitur et separatur in duo, praeter quod accidant in ea satagiae: et est facilius ad restaurationem eius.	Or it breaks and separates into two, besides that they come off in sawing: and it is easier to restore it.
Aut ita, quod accidunt in osse satagiae: et est difficilius ad restaurationem.	Or, on the other hand, if they come off in the bone: and it is more difficult to restore it.
Aut ita, quod est fractura cum uulnere.	Or, on the other hand, that fracture is with the ulna.
Et operatio in ea quando fractura est absque uulnere, est, ut facias praesentes esse duos ministros, ut teneat unus eorum adiutorium quod sequitur Furculam fractam, et alter extendat collum uersus partem.	And the operation in it when that fracture is without an ulna, is, so that you have these two ministers, one to hold the aid which follows the broken Fork, and another to extend the neck towards its side.
Deinde aequa fracturam digitis tuis, donec fiat forma eius, secundum quod oportet: et non sit in ea eminentia, neque concauitas.	Then make the fracture of your fingers equal, until it has that shape which is necessary: and do not let it beçªåº or sharp.
Quod si indiges extensione plus, tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico infirmi spheram ex panno, aut lana: et sit magnitudo eius secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae: et extende, et eleua Furculam, et coarta spheram manu tua, donec aeques fracturam, secundum quod oportet.	If you can tolerate a larger extension, then you should place under the tingling ball of cloth or wool: and make its size according to your need: and extend, and relieve the fork, and wrap the ball in your hand, until the fracture is equal, as required.
Quod si non potes trahere extremitatem Furculae ad exteriora: propterea, quia peruenit ad profundum: tunc oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et ponas sub humero eius puluinar medium in magnitudine, et premat minister humerum eius ad inferiora, donec eleuetur os Furculae quod est in profundo ad sursum: atque tunc rectifica fracturam, et aequa eam digitis tuis.	If you cannot bring the extremities of the fork to the outside because it reaches the depth: then it is necessary that the sick one lie on his back: and you should place under his shoulder the mid part of the pulp in its size, and press the minister of the shoulder to the lower part, until he raises the bone of the fork which is in the depth to the top: and then, correct the fracture, and make it equal with your fingers.
Si autem sentis sathaiatum ex Furcula, et mouetur: tunc oportet, ut findas super illud, et extrahas ipsum alsathaiatum cum facilitate.	If you feel a sharp pain from the fork, and it moves: then you should find on it, and pull out the cause of the pain with ease.
Si autem est retentum in osse, tunc ingenia in incisione eius cum uno Incisoriorum quae praeparasti ad illud, postquam tu posueris sub Furcula instrumentum quod seruat sifach: et est instrumentum ex ligno, aut ex ferro.	If it is held in the bone, then use the incision tool which you have prepared for it, after you have placed under the fork the holding device which holds it safely: and this tool is made of wood or iron.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its shape.
Assimilatur cochleari cui non est concauitas.	It is shaped like an ear which has not been closed in.
Et sit latitudo eius secundum illud quo indiges eo ex magnitudine ossis, et paruitate eius.	And its width should be according to the one you can tolerate it from the size of the bone, and its evenness.
Longitudo uero eius etiam secundum quod possibile est tibi ad operationem.	Its length, however, is also according to what is possible for you in the operation.
Et habeat duas extremitates, sicut uides: et extremitas una sit ampla, et altera stricta.	And it has two extremities, as you see: and one extremity is wide, and the other is narrow.
Si autem disruptio uulneris quod scidisti quando extraxisti sathaiatum ossis, est ampla, et securaris ab apostemate calido: tunc aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura.	If, however, the break in the bone which you made when you pulled out the cause of the pain is wide, and secures itself with the warm apposition: then add two lips of the wound with a suture.
Et si disruptio est parua, aut times apostema calidum: tunc imple uulnus cum pannis, et puluillis secundum quantitatem scissurae uulneris.	And if the break is small, or you do not have warm apposition: then fill the wound with cloth, and powder according to the size of the cut wound.
Quod si accidat apostema calidum, tunc infunde pannum in oleo rosato, et aceto, et uino, et pone super ipsum.	If an apostema becomes hot, then pour oil, rosewater, vinegar, and wine over it and place it on top.
Strictura uero ossis quando est absque uulnere, et absque sectione, est, ut ponas super os emplastrum factum ex farina molendini cum albugine oui.	Rather, when the stricture is in a bone without an injury and without cutting, you should place on it a patch made from flour that has been ground with alum.
Et pone stuppam lenem super ipsum.	And place a beam of wood on top of it.
Deinde pone spheram sub titillico eius, si indiges illa.	Then place a ball under its tip, if you can tolerate that.
Deinde accipe himematem, id est, rotam quam tenent Saraceni, quae sit longa ualde: et sit latitudo eius palmi unius, aut circiter illud.	Then take a large spinning top that the Saracens use, which is long and wide: its diameter should be that of a hand or more.
Deinde pone puluillum duplicatum super stuppam et emplastrum.	Then place a double layer of felt over the beam and the patch.
Deinde accipe astellam ex tabula subtili, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, et in longitudine similiter.	Then take an asterism from a thin board, whose width is that of three fingers, and its length similar.
Deinde inuolue eam in panno.	Then wrap it in a cloth.
Deinde inuolue pannum illum cum astella in loco alhimemati qui cadit super fracturam et locum.	Then wrap the cloth and the asterism together at the place of injury and its location.
Deinde pone alhimemati super fracturam sicut reuoluiur, et inuolue eam super collum eius, et sub titillico eius sano, et sub titillico eius infirmo: et reduc eam super omnem partem, et quomodo uides quod strictura tenet fracturam strictura decenti: et est illud, quod non occultatur super te, et totum, ut non remoueatur astella desuper os fractum.	Then place the alquimista over the fracture as if it were a bandage, and wrap it around its neck, and under its tip, healthy and under the injured tip: and let it be so that it does not cover you completely, and entirely, so that it does not move the asterism off the bone's fracture.
Et propter hoc oportet, ut aspicias infirmum in omni die.	And for this, you should see the injured person every day.
Quotiens ergo mollificatur ligamentum, et uides astellam iam remoueri: tunc rectifica illud, et stringe ligamentum.	Whenever you see that the ligament has softened, and you see that the asterism has moved again: then straighten it out, and tighten the ligament.
Deinde pone somnum infirmi super dorsum eius, et pone sub titillico eius apud somnum eius puluinar paruum in nocte, ut cum eo eleuetur adiutorium eius a latere ipsius.	Then place a soft cushion on its back, and under its tip near its pillow at night, so that when it moves it will not feel the asterism's edge.
Eleuatur ergo fractura furculae per eleuationem humeri.	Thus the fracture in the forearm is healed by elevation of the shoulder.
Aut liga brachium eius ad collum ipsius: et non soluas ligamentum, si non accidat in loco accidens ex pruritu, aut ab apostemate, usque ad duodecim dies.	Or bandage its arm to its neck: and do not loosen the ligaments unless there is an accident from itching, or from an apostema, until twelve days have passed.
Deinde renoua emplastrum, si uideris faciem eius ad illud.	Then remove the plaster, if you see his face towards that.
Et adde in strictura, et dimitte ipsum, donec restauretur et coaguletur.	And add to the tightness, and let him go, until it is restored and coagulated.
Et fractura quidem furculae stringitur et confortatur secundum plurimum in uigintiocto diebus: et quandoque fit in quibusdam hominibus in minore illo.	And indeed the fracture is bound and supported according to many in twenty days; and sometimes it happens in some people with less than that.
Â¶ De restauratione fracturae Spatulae.	De restoration of the fracture of the spatula.
Caput VII.	Chapter VII.
Raro frangitur Spatula, et in loco lato eius: et non franguntur ex ea nisi margines eius.	 Rarely does the Spatula break, and in its width place: and do not break from it except for its edge.
Quando ergo frangitur ex eo locus, et frangitur in medio eius, et non cognoscitur illud nisi per tactum: tunc secundum quod est figura fracturae conare praeparationem eius.	So when it breaks from that place, and it breaks in the middle of it, and it is not known that except for touch: then according to what is the shape of the fracture prepare the preparation of it.
Et reduc eam super figuram naturalem omni modo ingenii, quod est tibi possibile.	And reduce it to the natural form at all the skill that is possible to you.
Deinde pone super locum puluerem molendini cum albugine oui, et stuppam lenem, et pone desuper puluillum ex panno duplato.	Then place on the spot powder with chalk and a wooden board, and put a cloth on top of it.
Deinde pone super ipsum astellam latam ex tabula subtili secundum quantitatem Spatulae totius, aut ampliorem ea parum.	Then place over it a broad plate from a thin board according to the quantity of the spatula whole, or larger than that little bit.
Si uero sub astella est concauitas in aliquo locorum Spatulae, tunc aequa illam concauitatem cum stuppa leni, donec descendat astella secundum aequalitatem.	If indeed under the plate is crushed in some place of the spatula, then make it equally crushed with a soft board, until the plate descends according to equality.
Deinde ftringe desuper cum alhimemati longa, constrictione decenti, et firmitudine astellae, donec non remoueatur a loco suo.	Then wipe off from above with a long-lasting alchemist's glue, with a tightening that approaches, and the rigidity of the plate, until it does not move away from its place.
Et considera ligamentum in omni die.	And consider the ligament every day.
Quotienscunque ergo mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum, et aequa astellam si remoueatur a loco suo: et iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	Whenever indeed the ligament softens, tighten it and make the plate equal if it moves away from its place: and let him lie on his sound side.
Et Spatula quidem restauratur in uiginti diebus, aut in uigintiquinque diebus.	Indeed the spatula is restored in twenty days, or in twenty-five days.
Quando ergo completur iste numerus, tunc solue ligamentum: et tu sis in securitate.	So when this number is completed, then solve the ligament: and you are in safety.
Nam ipsa est ex ossibus quorum communitio non timetur, neque eorum solutio.	For indeed it is from the bones whose communion is not feared, nor their solution.
Si autem procedat ex osse frustum, et pungit sub cute: tune scinde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum.	If, however, it proceeds from the bone stump and pierces beneath the skin: then cut over it and remove it.
Et fac quod diximus in fractura furculae ex sedatione apostematis calidi, si accidat ex eo aliquid.	And do as we said in the fracture of the furrow from sitting down with hot, if something happens from that.
Â¶ De restauratione fracturae Pectoris.	On the restoration of a fracture of the chest
Caput VIII.	Head VIII.
Pectus quandoque frangitur in medio sui, et raro accidit illud.	The chest sometimes breaks in the middle of it, and that seldom happens.
Extremitates eius quidem plurimum franguntur, et comminuuntur ex accidentibus eius.	The extremities of it are often broken, and they are broken by its accidents.
Quando frangitur eius medium, quod declinat ad inferiora, et accidit ei dolor uehemens, et difficultas in anhelitu, et tussis: et fortasse euomit sanguinem, et declaratur concauitas in osse fracto, et non occultatur sensui, Restauratio eius est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et pone inter Spatulas eius puluinar.	When it is broken in the middle, which inclines to the lower parts, and there happens to it a very painful pain, and difficulty in breathing, and perhaps spitting out blood, and the fracture is declared in the broken bone, and does not hide the sense, The restoration of it is that it should lie down on its back: and put between its Spatula.
Deinde preme humeros eius, et aggrega costas a duabus partibus uel lateribus cum manibus: et subtiliare in aequatione eius, secundum omnem modum quo possibile est illud et conuenit, donec redeat figura ossis, secundum quod oportet.	Then press its shoulders and join the ribs from two parts or sides with the hands: and gently adjust it to the right shape, in any way possible, as it should be, unless you bring back the figure of the bones, according to what is necessary.
Deinde pone super ipsum emplastrum et stuppam, et pone desuper astellam ex tabula subtili ex salice, aut chalingi, et ex eis similibus in leuitate, postquam tu inuoluis eam in panno.	Then put over it plaster and a support, and put above it an astylar from a thin board of willow, or larch, and similar ones in levity, after you have wrapped it up in a cloth.
Deinde subtiliare in ligando eam super os fractum, ut non remoueatur: et uade cum ligatura secundum rotunditatem ad dorsum aliquotiens, et stringe ipsum strictura decenti.	Then gently adjust it by binding it over the broken bone so that it does not move: and move it with the binding according to the roundness to the back a few times, and tighten it by stricture while it is falling.
Deinde considera ligaturam in omni hora, et quotienscumque mollificatur, stringe eam: et si necessitas eius prouocat ad solutionem eius apud pruritum, uel corrosionem quae accidit in loco, aut dolorem, aut apostema: tunc propera, et solue eam, et eradica emplastrum, et rectifica quod accidit cum modo curationis eius.	Then consider the binding at every hour, and whenever it softens, tighten it: and if necessity calls for its solution when a pruritus, or corrosion which happens in that place, or pain, or fever: then approach it, and solve it, and cut away the plaster, and correct whatever has happened with the manner of its cure.
Deinde reduc emplastrum, si uides ad illud faciem: et annecte ei stricturam, donec sanetur.	Then reduce the plaster, if you see to that face: and attach it by stricture, until it is healed.
Â¶ De restauratione Costarum, quando franguntur.	When costars are broken.
Caput IX.	Chapter IX.
Scias, quod Costarum fractura non accidit, nisi in locis grossis quae sequuntur dorsum, et ex extremitatibus earum ab anteriori parte.	You should know that a fracture of the ribs does not occur unless in the places which follow the back, and from the extremities thereof toward the front.
Et non accidit eis attritio, nisi propterea, quia sunt cartilaginosae.	And it does not happen to them any weariness, except therefore, because they are cartilaginous.
Et cognitio ipsius non occultatur sensui apud inquisitionem cum digitis.	And his knowledge is not hidden from the sense of touch during inquiry with the fingers.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, ut aeques fracturam cum digitis secundum modum possibilem, donec aequetur figura, secundum quod oportet.	And the restoration thereof is so made that a broken rib with the fingers in the second way possible, until it has regained its shape, according to which it should be. Because it is necessary.
Deinde emplastra, et stringe os fractum cum astella, si indiget illo.	Then he makes an embossing, and tightly joins the broken bone with a splint, if it requires it.
Et si fractura Costarum est decliuis ad interiora: tunc accidit infirmo dolor uehemens, et punctura, sicut punctura illa quae accidit illi qui habet pleuresim: propterea, quod os pungit uelamen, et etiam ei accidit difficultas anhelitus, et tussis, et uomitus sanguinis multi: et haec est difficilis curationis.	And if the fracture of the ribs is inclined toward the inside: then it happens to the sick a bitter pain, and a pricking, such as that which happened to him who had pleurisy: for the bone pinches the wound, and also happens to him difficulty in breathing, and coughing, and much blood. And this is a difficult cure.
Et iam ingeniati sunt antiqui in ea cum ingeniis multis: et ex eis sunt qui dicunt, ut ponas cibos infirmi qui generent inflammationem et uentositatem, ut inflammetur uenter, et extendatur, et impellatur fractura ad exteriora.	And the ancient have invented for this with many devices; and of them are those who say that you should put in food which generates inflammation and ventilation, that it may inflame the belly, and be extended, and push the fracture toward the outside.
Nos uero abhorremus, ut non fiat caussa uelox ad faciendum apostema calidum, si non accidit.	But we abhor, so that it is not a cause of quick making an ointment of heat, if it does not happen.
Si autem iam accidit, tunc addit in eo.	If, however, it has already happened, then he adds it in.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: ponatur super locum uentosa, deinde sugatur cum fortitudine, et est similius ratiocinationi.	And some of them said: Let it be placed on a windy place, and then blow upon it with force, and it is similar to reasoning.
Verumtamen timetur, quod attrahat uentosa superfluitates ad locum, propter dispositionem debilitatis.	However, they are afraid that the wind will draw away the secretions toward the place of weakness because of its debilitation.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: oportet ut cooperiatur locus cum lana quae iam submersa est in oleo calido: et ponantur puluilli inter Costas, donec impleatur: ut sit ligatura aequalis quando inuoluis eam secundum rotunditatem.	And some of them said: It should be that the place is covered with wool which has already been submerged in hot oil; and let there be placed feathers between the ribs, until it is filled up; so that it is a ligature of equality when it is rolled thus according to its roundness.
Deinde curetur infirmus curatione pleuresis ex cibo et medicina.	The sick person should be nursed with food and medicine until he recovers from the pleurisy.
Quod si coartat infirmum res uehemens, quam non tolerat, et os pungit uelamen punctura laedente, et timemus super infirmum: tunc oportet, ut scindamus super locum, et detegamus a Costa fracta.	If the sick person is obstructed by a disease, which he does not tolerate, and his mouth pricks with pain while he is hurt by the wound, and we are afraid of him: then it is necessary that we should split over the place, and discover from the broken rib.
Deinde ponamus super ea instrumentum quod conseruat sifac, cuius rememoratio praecessit: et incidamus os cum facilitate, et incidamus ipsum.	Then let us put on it a tool that keeps the air away, whose memory precedes: and let us pierce the mouth with ease, and let us pierce it itself.
Deinde aggregemus duo labia uulneris, si est magnum cum sutura: et curemus ipsum cum emplastris, donec sanetur.	Then let us gather together the two lips of the wound, if it is large with a stitch: and let us cure him with plasters, until he heals.
Quod si accidat interim apostema calidum, tunc propera, et infunde puluillos in oleo rosato, et pone super locum: et curetur infirmus cum eo quod conuenit apostemati.	If, however, during that time there occurs a swelling of warm pus, then let it come close, and pour into it a bit of rosewater oil, and put it over the place: and let the sick person be nursed with it as is right for the swelling.
Interim etiam resupinetur super latus super quod dormit, donec sanetur.	At that time also let him lie on his back on the side where he sleeps, until he recovers.
Â¶ De restauratione fracturae Spondilium dorsi et colli.	The restoration of a broken spine of the dorsal and cervical spine.
Caput X.	Chapter X.
Ossibus quidem colli quandoque aduenit fractura, et raro accidit eis attritio: et similiter Spondilibus dorsi etiam.	Of the bones of the neck, when a fracture happens, and this rarely occurs, and also to the spine.
Cum ergo accidit illud alicui, et uis scire, an sanetur, an non sanetur: tunc confidera.	When that happens to someone, and you do not know if he is healing or not healing: then trust.
Nam si uides manus eius iam mollificatas, et stupefactas, et mortuas: et non potest mouere eas, neque extendere eas, neque constringere eas: et quando constringis eas cum digitis tuis, et pungis eas cum acu, non sentit illud, et non sentit in eis dolorem: tunc scias, quia non sanatur, et in pluribus dispositionibus est mortale.	For if you see his hands already softened, and stuporified, and lifeless: and can not be moved, nor extended, nor constrained: and when you constrain them with your fingers, and prick them with an aiguille, he does not feel it, and does not feel pain in them: then you shall know that he is not healing, and is mortal in many dispositions.
Quod si mouet eas, et sentit in eis constrictionem cum digitis et puncturam: tunc scias, quia nucha ossis salua est, et quod infirmus sanabitur cum curatione.	If he moves them, and feels the constriction with your fingers and the prick: then you shall know that the bones of his neck are healed, and that the sick person will recover with treatment.
Quod si eueniat Spondilibus dorsi simile illius, et uis scire, an sanetur etiam, an non: tunc considera ad pedes eius: tunc si uides quod mollificati sunt, et accidit in eis illud quod accidit in manibus: deinde quando iacet super dorsum suum, egreditur uentositas et egestio absque uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super uentrem suum, egreditur egestio sine uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super dorsum suum, et uult mingere, et non potest: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	If there occurs in him a similar thing to that of the spine, and you do not know if he is healing or not: then look at his feet: if you see them already softened, and what happened to the hands also happens to them: then when he lies on his back, he walks with a wavering step and without will: and when he turns on his stomach, he walks without will: and when he turns on his back again, and wants to drink, and cannot: then you shall know that it is mortal.
Non ergo labores in curatione eius.	Therefore do not undertake his cure.
Si uero non accidit ei aliquid ex illo, res est leuior.	If something does not happen to him from that, the matter is lighter.
Et curatio eius quod accidit ex illo est, ut coneris sedationem apostematis calidi: ita, ut ponas super Spondilem attritam oleum rosatum solum: aut cum uitellis oui assati.	And his cure, if it happens from that, is as follows: to apply oil of rosin, well rubbed, on a sponge: or when you have washed it with lukewarm water.
Pone super ipsam illud aliquotiens in die, donec quando sedatur apostema calidum: tum pone super locum unum ex emplastris confortantibus, exiccantibus, et stringe super ipsum cum ligamento: et praecipe infirmo, ut utatur quiete et tranquillitate.	Place on it from time to time in the day until it is well-healed: then place on the spot a compress that comforts, dries out, and binds tightly with the bandage: and order the sick person to rest quietly and calmly.
Nec dormiat super partem cum qua inuenit dolorem, donec sanetur.	And do not let him sleep on the part where he has pain, until it heals.
Quod si accidit apud attritionem ossis sathaiatum, aut aliquid quod iam separatum fit ex eo: tunc oportet, ut seces super cutem, et auferas illud.	If something happens to the bone that separates (the flesh), or if it is already separated from it: then you must cut off the skin and remove it.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, si est magnum, cum sutura.	Then bind together two lips of the wound, if it is large, with a suture.
Deinde cura ipsum cum aliquo incarnatiuo, ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the person with some ointment, until he heals.
Si uero frangitur postremum ossis alhausos, et est finis caudae: tunc oportet, ut intromittas pollicem manus sinistrae in anum, et aeques os fractum manu altera, secundum quod possibile est, et secunda aequatione.	If the bone is finally broken at its end and the tail is cut off: then you must insert your thumb of the left hand into the wound, and with the right hand, as well as possible, and by equal rotations.
Deinde pone super ipsum, et aufer ipsum: et cura uulnus cum curatione quae praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then place on it and remove it: and take care of the wound with the cure that has preceded, until it heals.
Â¶ De restauratione Anchae.	For restoration of the ankle.
Caput XI.	Chapter XI.
Raro franguntur ossa Ancharum.	Rarely do the bones break at the ankle.
Quod si franguntur, tunc fractura eorum non est, nisi comminutio in extremitatibus ipsorum: et scinduntur in longitudine, et declinantur ad interiora: et accidit infirmo dolor in loco, et punctura: et stupescit crus quod frangitur.	If they break, then their fracture is not, unless it is broken at the ends of the bones: and they are broken in length, and turn towards the inside: and it happens to the sick person that there is pain in the spot, and a bruise: and the leg turns when it breaks.
Et restauratio quidem eius est, ut extendas manum tuam super ipsum, donec stes super fracturam qualiter est figura eius.	And the restoration of it is as follows: to extend your hand over it, until you stand on the fracture, which is as in the figure of it.
Quod si fractura est in extremitatibus eius tantum, tunc aequa illam fracturam, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ex aequatione, donec assimiletur figurae suae naturali.	If the fracture is only in its extremities, then make it equal, as you prepare it from equality, until its figure is similar to its natural one.
Si autem fractura est in longitudine, aut iam declinat ad interiora: tunc fac iacere infirmum super uentrem suum, donec praeparetur tibi restauratio illius fracturae.	But if the fracture is in length, or has already turned towards the insides: then make him lie down on his stomach, until it is prepared for you to restore its fracture.
Quando ergo aequaueris ipsam, pone super ipsam emplastrum: deinde pone super ipsam astellam ex ligno, aut ex cute: et stringe strictura super quam non timeas permutationem fracturae, neque remotionem astellae.	When you have made it equal, then put a plaster on it; and afterwards put a wooden support or skin over it: and tightly tie the bandage so that you do not fear a change in the fracture, nor a removal of the support.
Et aequa concauitatem illorum cum eo quod impleat eam, donec capiat eam strictura secundum aequalitatem: et praecipe infirmo, ut dormiat super dorsum suum, aut super latus suum sanum.	And the equal concavity with it, so that it fills it, until he takes it by the bandage according to equality: and order the sick person to sleep on his back, or on his healthy side.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc cessa ab extensione eius, et ipsius restauratione, donec sedetur apostema calidum: et pone super ipsum quod sedet ipsum, secundum quod praecessit, deinde redi ad restaurationem eius: et stringe ipsum sicut oportet.	But if it happens to him that there is a hot swelling: then cease from extending it, and from its restoration, until it cools down: and put over it what sits on it according to what has preceded, and then return to its restoration: and tightly tie it as it should be.
Si uero accidit in osse satagie, aut comminuitur, extrahe.	But if it happens that it is broken or crushed, remove it.
Â¶ De restauratione fracturae Adiutorii.	The assistant to the restoration of a fracture.
Caput XII.	Chapter XII.
Adiutorium est illud, quod est inter cubitum usque ad caput Spatulae.	The assistant is that which is between the chest and the head of the spatula.
Si ergo frangitur, tunc restauratio eius est secundum unum duorum modorum.	If it is broken, then its restoration is according to two ways.
Quorum unus est: ut accipias lignum planum mediae grossitudinis, secundum hanc formam, quae sequitur.	One of which is: that you take a flat piece of wood of middle thickness, according to this shape, which follows.
Et ligentur in duabus extremitatibus duo ligamenta.	And bind together with two strappings in the two extremities.
Deinde suspendatur ex loco eleuato: et sedeat infirmus super sedem.	Then hang it from a high place: and let the sick person sit on a chair.
Deinde proiiciat brachium suum fractum super lignum, donec perueniat ad titillicum eius, in cuius medio sit annexa curuitas ligni.	Then he will throw his broken arm over the wood, until it reaches to its little joint, in which middle there is attached a piece of wood.
Deinde suspende desuper ipsum aliquid graue, ut extendat ipsum minister ad inferiora.	Then hang him from above with something heavy, that he may stretch himself out for the minister below.
Deinde aequet medicus fracturam manibus suis simul, donec redeat fractura, secundum quod oportet.	Then let the doctor treat his own fracture with care until it heals, as is necessary.
Et modus alter est, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et suspende manum eius a collo ipsius cum ligamento.	And another method is for the sick person to lie on their back on a mattress: and their hand suspended from their neck with a bandage.
Deinde praecipe duobus ministris, ut teneat unus eorum illud quod est supra fracturam cum manibus suis: et ut alter teneat inferius eius, et extendat unusquisque eorum ad partem suam.	Then order two servants to hold his hand above the fracture: and one to hold him below, and to stretch out each of them on either side.
Et si uis, ut sit extensio fortior, tunc stringe sub fractura cum ligamento, et supra ipsam cum ligamento alio: et extendat ea unusquisque duorum ministrorum ad duas partes suas.	And if you will, so that the extension is stronger, then tie up under the fracture with a bandage and above it with another bandage: and let each of the two servants stretch out their hand to either side.
Si ergo fractura est propinqua extremitati humeri, tunc oportet, ut ponatur unum ligamentum sub titillico, et alterum sub fractura uersus cubitum.	If then the fracture is close to the edge of the shoulder, then it should be placed, one bandage under the collar-bone and another above the fracture towards the hip.
Et similiter si fractura est propinqua cubito: tunc oportet, ut ponatur ligamentum super illum locum, et super cubitum ipsum.	And likewise if the fracture is close to the hip: then it should be placed, one bandage on that spot and another above the hip.
Deinde aequa fracturam cum facilitate absque labore, donec quando aequatur fractura secundum quod oportet, et applicatur applicatione bona: tunc stringe eam, si non accidit apostema calidum.	Then let the fracture heal easily without work, until it is healed in the way that is necessary, and applied with good application: then tie it up, if there is no swelling.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam usque ad diem septimum.	But if there is swelling, then do not tie it up until the seventh day.
Et pone super ipsum lanam succidam imbibitam in aceto et oleo rosato, donec quando quiescit apostema: tunc stringe eam: et modus stringendi eam est, ut ponas emplastrum super fracturam.	And put on the wound wool wetted with vinegar and olive oil, until when it quiets down the swelling; then tie it up: and the way of tying it up is, to put a plaster over the fracture.
Deinde pone inuolutionem ex panno nouo super emplastrum.	Then place a new cloth bandage over the plaster.
Deinde aggreget brachium super adiutorium ipsum, et ponat manum suam apertam super humerum suum.	Then he should hold his arm up with the help of an assistant and place his open hand on his shoulder.
Et pone pannum, et stringe super adiutorium brachium, ut brachium stet loco astellarum: si non prohibet te ab illo aliquid, neque alteretur super te aliquid ex osse fracto.	And place a cloth and tie it above the assistant's arm so that the arm remains in place: if he does not forbid you from doing this or anything else, nor should you move around on him.
Quod si times, quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid, tunc utere astellis: et est, ut ponas super fracturam ipsam astellam quae sit latior et fortior reliquis astellis.	That if you find yourself moving around due to the pain of a broken bone, then use crutches: and it is, that you place upon the fracture the larger and stronger crutch than the others.
Et ponas inter omnem astellam latitudinem digiti: et sit longitudo astellarum secundum fracturam cum additione trium digitorum ab omni parte.	Place the splint between all the fingers of the length: and let its length be according to the fracture with the addition of three digits from every part.
Deinde stringe super astellas strictura quam dixi in principio capituli.	Then tighten over the splints the strain that I said at first chapter.
Et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae strictior.	And it is so that your strain is stiffer on the site of the fracture than this strain that I have spoken of above.
Et quanto plus elongatur fractura, sit strictura minor.	And to the extent that the fracture becomes more elongated, let the strain be smaller.
Si ergo uides situm astellarum et stricturam, sicut diximus, in hora qua restauras membrum statim, tunc fac: et si times apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam et astellas usque ad diem septimum, sicut diximus.	But if you see the splints and the strain, as we have said, at the hour when you restore the limb immediately, then do so: but if you wait for the poultice to cool down, then let go of the strain and the splints until the seventh day, as we have said.
Deinde considera ligamentum in omnibus tribus diebus, ut non accidat in loco pruritus, aut inflatio, aut prohibeatur cibus peruenire ad membrum, propter dispositionem superfluitatis stricturae.	Then consider the ligament for all three days so that the itching does not occur in place or swelling is increased, or stops food from reaching the limb due to the tension of the strain.
Rectifica ergo illud totum, secundum quod diximus.	So then correct this whole thing, according to what we have said.
Si uero es super fiduciam, ut non accidat ex illo aliquid: tunc non soluas ligamentum, nisi post tres dies, aut plus.	But if you are not sure of it, so that nothing occurs from it: then do not loosen the ligament until after three days or more.
Et sit dormitio infirmi super dorsum suum, et manus eius super stomachum suum: et pone sub adiutorio culcitram plenam lana aequaliter.	And let her sleep on her back, and his hands on his belly: and place under the pillow a blanket full of wool that is equal.
Et considera in omni hora noctis, aut diei, ut non soluatur figura membri fracta, aut mollificetur ligamentum.	And consider every hour of night or day so that the figure of the broken limb does not loosen, nor do the ligaments soften.
Rectifica ergo illud totum uirtute tua.	So then correct this whole thing with your virtue.
Et pone cibum infirmi secundum ordinem quem praemisimus, ita ut sit cibus subtilis in primis, donec incipiat os stringi: tunc oportet, ut ingrosses cibum eius.	And place food for the nurse according to the order that we have set forth, so that there is a light meal at first, until the mouth begins to heal: then it should increase his food.
De consuetudine enim adiutorii et cruris est, ut stringatur in quadraginta diebus: tunc ergo oportet, ut soluatur, et administretur balneum, et medicetur cum unguentis quae rectificant illud.	For the habit of the assistant and the limb is that it is strained for forty days: then so let it be loosened, and given a bath, and treated with ointments that correct it.
Quod si fractura fuerit foeda, attrita: tunc non soluas ab ea ligamentum et astellas usque ad quinquaginta dies, et usque ad duos menses.	That if the fracture were rotten, ground: then do not loosen from it the ligaments and splints until fifty days, and until two months.
Â¶ De restauratione fracturae Brachii.	On the restoration of fractures of the brachial bone.
Caput XIII.	Chapter XIII On the head.
Brachium est compositum ex duobus ossibus, quae nominantur duo focilia.	The arm is composed of two bones called the two humeri.
Quorum unum est paruum: et est illud quod sequitur pollicem.	Of which one is small and that is what follows the thumb.
Et alterum est magnum, et est illud quod est positum sub paruo ab inferiori parte.	And the other is large, and that is what is positioned below the little finger on its lower side.
Fortasse ergo frangitur focile maius solum, aut paruum: et fortasse franguntur simul.	Perhaps therefore does the larger bone break alone, or the smaller one; and perhaps both break at once.
Quando ergo frangitur focile paruum superius, tunc restauratio eius est facilis, et sanatio eius est facilior.	When then does the small bone break above, then is its restoration easy, and its healing easier.
Et quando frangitur focile inferius, est fractura eius mala, et sanatio eius difficilis.	And when does the lower bone break? It is a bad fracture, and its healing is difficult.
Et deterior ea est, quando franguntur duo ossa simul.	And worse is it when both bones break at once.
Si ergo os quod frangitur est focile parum superius, tunc conuenit medico apud restaurationem eius, ut ponat extensionem paruam cum facilitate, donec aequet ipsum.	If then the bone that breaks is the small one above, then it behooves the doctor to restore it with ease, to put the little finger in extension, until it is equal with the other.
Si uero focile magnum est illud quod fractum est: tunc oportet, ut ponat stricturam fortiorem ualde.	But if the broken bone is the larger one: then it behooves, in order to put on a stronger bandage with force, until it is equal with the other.
Et oportet, ut ponat figuram manus apud restaurationem eius, et ipsius extensionem extensam super puluinar.	And it behooves, in order to give the hand its shape and position at the restoration of its bone, and to put on a bandage that extends beyond the little finger.
Et sit pollex manus ad superiora altior omnibus digitis: et sit articularis inferior omnibus digitis, uel reliquis: et infirmus sedens quadratus super seipsum, et sit puluinar coram eo, uel in directo eius, in altitudine, ut non incurrat infirmus laborem.	And let the thumb of the hand be made higher on its upper side than all the other fingers; and let the flexor muscle of each finger be made lower, or not present; and let the sitting position be square on one's self, and let the little finger face it, or stand in front of it at right angles, so that it does not incur trouble.
Deinde extendat minister Brachium ab inferiori parte, aut manu sua, aut cum ligamento.	Then let the arm be extended from its lower side, or by its hand, or with a bandage.
Et minister alius extendat desuper similiter.	And another one let extend from above.
Deinde aequet medicus os, donec reducat ipsum secundum meliorem figuram quam potest.	Then the doctor let adjust the bone until he makes it equal in shape as well as he can.
Quod si in fractura ossis sunt satagiae, tunc conare reducere omne frustum in loco suo uirtute tua.	If in the fracture of the bone are present splinters, then let you seek to reduce every splinter to its place by your own power.
Si uero apparet in eo sathaiatum separatum, et pungit cutem, et non est tibi spes in restauratione eius: tunc finde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum secundum modum quem diximus in eis quae praemissa sunt.	If it does indeed appear to you that there is a separate satheiatum, and you stab the skin, and there is no hope of restoring it: then find above it, and remove it according to the manner which we have said in those preceding.
Si autem fractura est cum uulnere, ego iam feci ad illud capitulum singulare, ergo accipe curationem illius inde.	But if the fracture is with the ulna, I have already done to that chapter a single treatment, so take care of it from there.
Quod si accidat in principio tuae restaurationis apostema calidum, tunc line pannum cum caeroto facto ex oleo rosato, et caera alba, et sit medium inter spissitudinem et subtilitatem: et stringe pannum super ipsum strictura subtili, donec quando sedatur apostema: tunc remoue caerotum, et pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum albumine oui.	That if it should happen in the beginning of your restoration to be a hot swelling, then put on cloth made hot with oil made red with saffron, and white of egg, and place between thickness and thinness: and tighten the cloth on it tightly until it is settled: then remove the eggshells, and put on a prepared plaster from dust that has been ground with albumen.
Deinde pone astellas, et sit astella quae ponitur super fracturam ipsam latior parumper, et fortior.	Then put on plasters, and let the plaster which is put on the fracture be wider a little, and stronger.
Et scias, quod numerus astellarum Brachii est sex in pluribus dispositionibus: siue sit fractura in focili uno, aut in duobus focilibus simul.	And you know that the number of plasters for the arm is six in several dispositions: whether it is a fracture in one finger, or in two fingers at the same time.
Deinde pone stricturam tuam super locum fracturae fortiorem et uehementiorem, et aliquanto plus cum strictura ad superiora fracturae, aut ad inferiora eius: aut pone stricturam molliorem strictura eius parumper, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius in principio capituli.	Then put on your plaster on the site of the fracture stronger and more tight, and a little more with the plaster according to what has preceded in the beginning of the chapter: or put on a softer plaster on it slightly according to what has preceded.
Et sint panni qui inuoluuntur super fracturam, panni lenes, humidi: et non sint duri, asperi.	And let there be cloths that are wrapped around the fracture, soft cloths, wet: and not be hard, rough.
Et sit filum quo stringitur ex lino proprie, medium inter subtile et grossum, sicut narrauimus.	And let there be a thread that is tightened with its own linen, between thinness and thickness, as we have said.
Et considera membrum et ligamentum post dies.	And consider the limb and ligaments after days.
Quod si accidat aliquid cuius rectificatio sit necessaria, sicut pruritus qui accidit membro: tunc oportet, ut embroces membrum cum aqua calefacta, donec quiescat ille pruritus, et dimittas membrum non constrictum, donec quiescat, deinde itera stricturam.	That if anything should happen for which correction is necessary, such as itching that happens in a limb: then it should be, to soak the limb with warm water, until that itching quiets down, and you remove the limb not constrained, until it quiets down, and then repeat the plaster.
Quod si strictura iam mollificata est, et os iam remotum, et similia illis: tunc rectifica illud totum uirtute tua, et considera iterum.	That if the plaster is already softened, and the bone has been removed, and similar to these: then correct it completely with your virtue, and consider again.
Nam si nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad membrum, propter superfluitatem stricturae, tunc oportet, ut mollifices ipsum parumper, et dimittas ipsum aliquot diebus, donec currat ad ipsum nutrimentum, deinde stringe ipsum.	If nutriment is prohibited from reaching the limb because of the swelling of the scar tissue, then it should be left for a little while and then tied up.
Si autem non accidit infirmo aliquid eorum quae diximus, tunc non oportet, ut soluatur, nisi post uiginti dies, aut circiter hos.	If this doesn't happen to the sick person of what we have said, then it shouldn't be allowed to heal without any problem unless after twenty days or so.
Deinde suspendatur manus infirmi ad collum eius.	Then the patient's hand should be suspended from his neck.
Et sit collum eius aequale, et custodiatur uirtute sua a motibus agitatiuis.	And the neck should be kept level and protected from violent movements.
Et fac eum dormire super dorsum suum.	And let him sleep on his back.
Et scias, quod haec fractura in triginta diebus, aut in triginta duobus diebus restauratur: et fortasse restauratur in uigintiocto diebus.	And you should know that this fracture is restored in thirty days or in twenty-two days; and perhaps it is restored in twenty-five days.
Totum illud est secundum dispositiones complexionum, et dispositiones uirtutis.	All of this depends on the condition of the skin and the strength of the body.
Â¶ De restauratione fracturarum Manus.	[On the restoration of broken hands.]
Caput XIIII.	CHAPTER XVIII.
Scias, quod pectini Manus, et nodis digitorum raro accidit fractura.	You should know that it is rare for a fracture to occur in the palm of the hand or in the knuckles of the fingers.
Et non accidit ei, nisi attritio multotiens.	And this doesn't happen to him unless there is a lot of friction.
Quando ergo accidit plantae fractura, aut attritio: tunc oportet, ut sedeat infirmus quadratus: et coram eo sit sedes secundum aequalitatem.	When, therefore, a fracture occurs in the palm or through friction: then it should be made to sit on a level seat; and a seat should be set up before him for equanimity.
Deinde pone Manum eius super eam extensam.	Then place his hand on top of it.
Deinde extendat minister ossa fracta, et aequet ea medicus, donec quando coniunguntur coniunctione bona.	Then he should make the bones that are broken straight and equal them with a surgeon's skill; until such time as they are joined together by good jointing.
Tunc oportet, ut ponat emplastrum et stuppam, si non accidat apostema calidum.	Then it should be put on plaster and a splint if this doesn't happen to cause a warm swelling.
Deinde pone astellam desuper secundum quantitatem loci: et tu iam inuoluisti eam in panno lini.	Then place the splint from above by the quantity of space; and you have already covered it with linen cloth.
Si autem fractura est ad inferiora circiter uentrem plantae, tunc fac simile spherae ex panno: et praecipe infirmo, ut coartet super eam cum planta sua fracta: deinde stringatur cum panno longo.	But if the fracture is around the lower part of the palm near the root of the fingers, then make a sphere-like shape out of cloth; and instruct the sick person to hold it with his own palm that is broken: and then tie it down with a long piece of cloth.
Et sit astella ex corio, in quo sit lenitas, ut applicetur corium cum corpore plantae: et stringe eam, secundum quod oportet.	And let it remain as a splint from the kino, in which sits the soft part, so that the kino may be applied to the plant body: and bind it, according to what is necessary.
Si autem fractura est ad exteriora, tunc oportet: ut ponas astellam desuper, et astellam aliam ab inferiori in planta: et sit manus aperta recta.	But if the fracture is on the outside, then it is right: so that you set the splint from above, and another splint from below in the plant: and let the hand be open and straight.
Deinde pone stricturam, sicut reuoluitur manus: et extende inter digitos cum ligamento.	Then put the splint on, as the hand is extended: and place it between the fingers with a ligament.
Quod si accidat fractura alicui nodorum digitorum, tunc si est pollex, aequetur secundum quod oportet.	That if a fracture should happen to any of the finger joints, then if it is the thumb, it is equal according to what is necessary.
Deinde stringatur cum planta: et si amas, pone ei astellam rectam, paruam: ut eleuetur fractura, et non moueatur.	Then tie it with the plant: and if there is pain, then put a straight splint on it, so that it may not move: so that the fracture may be kept still, and not move.
Si autem fractura est reliquis digitis, sicut medio, et indici, aut auriculari, et anulari, tunc aequetur, et ligetur cum digito sano qui sequitur eum: aut ligentur omnes secundum continuationem: et est melius.	But if the fracture is in any other of the fingers, like the middle, or the index, or the auricular, and the annular, then it is equal, and tie with a finger that follows it: or tie them all according to their extension, and it is better.
Aut pone super ipsum astellam paruam, sicut diximus in pollice.	Or put a straight splint on top of it, like we said for the thumb.
Et considera in restauratione tua, et post ipsam dispositionem apostematis calidi: et oppone cum eo quod oportet, quando accidit aliquid ex illo, secundum quod iteratur eius narratio.	And consider in your restoration, and after that position of the bones: and oppose it with what is necessary, when anything happens to it, according to what it tells us.
Â¶ De restauratione fracturae Coxae.	On the Restoration of a Hip Fracture
Caput XV.	Chapter XV.
OS Coxae multotiens frangitur, et declaratur sensui: quoniam conuertitur ad interiorem et posteriorem partem.	The hip bone often breaks, and is felt: because it turns to the inner and rear parts.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, quod stringitur ligamentum supra fracturam, et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	And the restoration of it is so that a ligament is tied above the fracture, and another ligament is tied below the fracture.
Et infirmus prostretur super faciem suam.	And the injured person stretches out on their face.
Deinde extendat omne ligamentum minister ad partem suam secundum aequalitatem: et hoc, quando est fractura in medio ossis.	Then he extends all the ligaments to his side for equality: and this, when there is a fracture in the middle of the bone.
Si autem est fractura propinqua radici Coxae, tunc sit ligamentum ad partem pectinis, ut cadat extensio ad sursum: et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	But if the fracture is near the root of the hip, then let there be a ligament to the side of the pelvis, so that it falls towards the top: and another ligament below the fracture.
Et sic similiter si est fractura propinqua genu, tunc sit ligamentum propinquum genu, ut sit extensio ad inferiora.	And so likewise if there is a fracture near the knee, then sit close to the knee ligament, so that it sits towards the lower part.
Deinde aequet medicus os utriusque manibus suis, donec reducat ipsum secundum similitudinem figurae naturalis: et coniugatur os coniunctione bona.	Then the doctor shall make both of his hands equal to the bone, until he reduces it according to the natural shape: and shall join the bone with a good joint.
Tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum et stricturam, si non accidit membro apostema.	Then it should be put on plaster and stricture if it does not happen to a member of apostema.
Quod si accidat in eo apostema: tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur apostema calidum, deinde redi ad curationem tuam.	If it happens in him an apostema: then let it be left for a few days, until the apostema is warm, and then return to your cure.
Strictura autem eius ita sit.	But the stricture of it should be so.
Oportet ut inuoluas super fracturam imema duram, id est, bindam: et dupla eam bis, aut ter: et remaneat ex ea superfluitas.	It is necessary that you roll over the fracture a hard bone, i.e., a bindum: and double it twice, or three times: and remain of it an excess.
Deinde inuolue crus, donec perueniat calcaneus apud radicem natis.	Then roll up the leg, until it comes to the heel of the borned.
Et intromitte filum longum inter Coxam et crus prope genu ad inferiora, et ueniant extremitates fili a superiori parte duarum partium.	And introduce a long thread between the coxae and the leg near the knee towards the lower side, and bring the ends of the thread from the upper part of both members.
Deinde reuolue super Crus et Coxam quod superfluit ex alimema.	Then roll up on the leg and coxae what is in excess out of the bindum.
Deinde pone super Coxam in loco fracturae ipsius astellas, et pone ex eis astellam unam super os cruris.	Then put over the coxae in the place of the fracture the stars of it, and put from them one star on the bone of the leg.
Deinde imple uacuitates inter crus et coxam cum pannis lenibus, ut aequetur strictura.	Then fill with wetting substances between the leg and the coxae with soft cloths, so that the stricture is equal.
Deinde incipe cum strictura forti a medio super locum fracturae tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor.	Then begin with the stricture strong from the middle in three rollings, or four rollings, on the place of the fracture.
Et quanto plus elongaris cum ligamento a loco fracturae, sit strictura tua minor et mollior, et lenior.	And as much as you lengthen with the ligament at the place of the fracture, your stricture is smaller and softer, and gentler.
Deinde intende ad duas extremitates fili, quod tu intromisisti inter coxam et crus.	Then bring to both ends of the thread that you inserted between the coxae and the leg.
Liga ergo cum utrisque tres astellas quae sunt desuper.	Bind then with the two stars that are above.
Deinde uade cum duabus extremitatibus fili ad inferiora, donec peruenias ad cauillam pedis.	Then move with the two ends of the thread towards the lower side, until you come to the heel of the foot.
Et cum utrisque stringe etiam extremitates astellarum a parte altera: ut non remoueatur ligamentum ex loco suo.	And bind also the ends of the stars from the other side: so that the ligament does not move from its place.
Deinde dimitte stricturam super illud, dum permanet, ita quod non accidat membro corrosio, neque apostema, neque inflatio, et similia eis.	Then let go of that which is tight on it while it remains in place so that corrosion does not occur to the member, nor apostema, nor swelling, and things like them.
Quod si accidat aliquid ex illo.	So if something happens from it.
Propera ergo cum solutione eius, et rectifica illud quod accidit inde totum, secundum quod diximus multotiens.	Then with the solution applied to it, and make straight that which has happened there entirely, according to what we have said many times.
Si uero in osse est frustum ex osse quod pungat: tunc oportet, ut aeques illud, si est tibi possibile.	But if a piece of bone pricks the bone: then it is necessary, so that the wound heals, if you can do it.
Et si non, finde super illud, et remoue illud: et cura cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio, donec sanetur.	And if not, find on it, and move it: and be careful with it whose memory is before it, until it heals.
Et quandoque stringitur haec fractura Coxae, praeter quod addantur ei astellae, sicut diximus in adiutorio et brachio.	And sometimes this fracture of the hips is bound together with staples, as we have said in the arm and leg.
Verumtamen in restauratione eius taliter fracta, non accidit infirmo claudicatio.	However, in restoring it that way which is broken, there does not happen a lame limp.
Et si restauratur sola, praeter quod applicetur ei crus alterum, tunc necesse est, ut claudicet ille cuius est, semper.	And if it is restored alone, besides that an other leg is applied to it, then it is necessary, so that he who has it always limps.
Et scias, quod Coxa stringitur in quinquaginta diebus, uel additur parum, aut minuitur parum: totum illud est secundum diuersitatem complexionum, et reliquarum dispositionum.	And you should know that the hip is bound up in fifty days, or a little added, or a little minited: all of it is according to the diversity of complexions, and the other dispositions.
Â¶ De restauratione fracturae Rotulae genu.	Regarding the restoration of the fracture of the knee-cap of the thigh.
Caput XVI.	Chapter XVI.
Scias, quod Rotulae genu raro accidit fractura, sed accidit ei attritio multotiens.	You should know that the fracture of the knee-cap of the thigh rarely happens, but it does happen to it often by wearing away.
Si uero accidit ei fractura, tunc non nisi aut fissura, aut foramen in partibus suis.	But if something has happened to it that is a fracture, then there must be either a crack or a hole in its parts.
Et est illud cum uulnere, et absque uulnere.	And it is with the ulna, and without the ulna.
Et statur super illud totum cum sensu.	And he stood on it all with feeling.
Et restauratio eius est ita, ut aequetur quod disruptum est ex partibus eius cum digitis, donec aggregetur, et coniungatur secundum quod possibile est ex aequatione et facilitate, et fabricatione.	And the restoration of it is such that it equals what has been broken out of its parts with the fingers, until it collects, and joins together according to what is possible from equity and ease, and making.
Deinde pone emplastrum ex farina sisami, uel molendini, cum albumine oui: et pone super ipsum astellam rotundam, si indiges illa: et stringe desuper strictura conueniente ad illud.	Then put on the plaster from flour and sieves mixed with albumin; and put on top of it a round cloth, if you like it: and tighten it gently above that.
Deinde considera omnes dispositiones quas narrauimus in reliquis fracturis: sicut apostema calidum, et similia illi: ita, ut opponas omni accidenti cum eo quod conuenit ei, donec sanetur.	Then consider all the dispositions which we have described in the other fractures: such as the heat apostema and others like that: so that you oppose every mishap with what is fitting to him, until he heals.
Â¶ De restauratione fracturae Cruris.	For the restoration of a fractured limb.
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII.
Scias, quod Cruri sunt duo ossa, quorum unum est grossum, et nominatur nomine Cruris: et alterum subtile, et nominatur Focile.	You should know that there are two bones in the leg, one is thick and is called the femur bone; and the other is thin, and is called the fibula.
Et accidit utrisque ex speciebus fracturae quod accidit duobus ossibus brachii: et propter illud fit restauratio eius, sicut restauratio brachii aequaliter, et operatio est una.	And it happens to both of the kinds of fracture that occurs in the two bones of the arm; and for this reason the restoration of the latter is made as the restoration of the other is equal, and the operation is one.
Quod si franguntur duo ossa simul, conuertitur Crus ad omnes partes.	If both bones are broken at the same time, the limb turns towards all sides.
Et si frangitur os subtilius, conuertitur Crus ad anteriorem partem.	And if only one of the thin bones is broken, the limb turns towards the front.
Et si frangitur os grossius, inuenis illud inferius: et est ex eis quae non occultantur tibi.	And if only the thick bone is broken, it bends downward; and it is one of these that does not show you.
Deinde administra extensionem, et aequationem, et ligationem astellarum secundum illud aequaliter.	Then administer the extension, and equalization, and tying of the ligaments according to the equal one.
Verumtamen oportet, si fractura Cruris est fractura foeda, habens sethagie multa: ut sit extensio minor, et lenior alleuiatione tua.	However, if the fracture of the limb is a bad fracture, having many wounds: let it be that the extension is less, and gentler alleviation for you.
Et in Crure quidem est ex operatione quiddam super brachium: et est, ut quando tu aequas astellas, et comples omnem operationem tuam, tunc accipe duas fascias ex ligno pini, quod administratur in fabricatione solariorum quod ponitur sub tabulis: et fiunt ex spatulis palmae: et elige ex eis quibus est grossitudo parua, et neque sint ex minutis: et sit longitudo earum secundum longitudinem Cruris a genu usque inferius.	And in the limb there is in the operation something upon the arm: and it is, as when you make the ligaments equal, and complete all your operation, then take two membranes from pine wood, which is made in the making of splints which are placed under tables; and they are made from palm leaves: and choose among them those that have a small thickness, and none of them are small: and let their length be according to the length of the leg from the knee down.
Deinde inuolue super unamquamque pannum duabus inuolutionibus secundum longitudinem eius.	Then wrap up with two pieces of cloth, each on one side, according to its length.
Et pone unam partem Cruris a parte una, et alteram a parte altera: et sint ex genu usque inferius pedis.	Place one side of the leg from one side to the other, and the other from one side to the other: and let them go down from the knee to the bottom of the foot.
Deinde liga duas fascias in tribus locis ex duabus extremitatibus et medio.	Then bind the two Fascia in three places from the two ends and the middle.
Cum enim strictura prohibetur, Crus declinat ad dextram et sinistram, et stat statione bona.	For when the constriction is forbidden, the leg leans to the right and the left, and stands in good position.
Et iam quidem administretur cunabulum ex ligno secundum longitudinem Cruris, et ponatur in eo Crus, ut conseruet ipsum a motu.	And now let the wooden splint be made according to the length of the leg, and let it be placed in it so that it keeps it from moving.
Et plurimum quidem oportet, ut facias illud in fractura quando cum ea est uulnus proprie.	And it is necessary above all, so that you do this when the fracture has been healed by itself.
Deinde considera Crus in omni die, et stude cum eo studio ultimo ab apostemate, aut inflatione, aut reliquis aliis.	Then consider the leg every day, and take care with it with the last effort from inflammation or any other thing.
Si ergo accidit aliquid ex illis, tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur, si Deus uoluerit.	But if something of that happens, then oppose it with him when something needs to be done, until it is healed, if God wants it so.
De fractura ossium Pedis, et Digitorum.	Of the fracture of the bones of the foot and fingers.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter 18.
Calcaneo quidem non accidit fractura penitus.	The heel has not occurred a fracture inside.
Ossibus uero Pedis accidit quandoque fractura, et Digitis parum etiam accidit fractura: et non accidit eis nisi attritio in pluribus dispositionibus.	But of the bones of the foot has occurred when a fracture, and of the fingers a little also has occurred, and it has not occurred to them except for rubbing in many cases.
Quod si accidit ossibus Pedis fractura, et uides illa ossa sublimari super se adinuicem, tunc ponat infirmus Pedem suum super terram praeparatam, sicut ambulans.	Which if a fracture has occurred in the bones of the foot, and you see those bones moving far from each other, then let the sick put his foot on the ground prepared, like a walker.
Deinde sta tu, et pone Pedem tuum super illud quod eleuatur ex illis ossibus: postea preme, uel calca eam: et aequa ipsam, donec redeat in locis suis.	Then stand you, and put your foot on that which raises from those bones: then press it, or trample it: and make it equal, until it returns to its place.
Deinde pone emplastrum, et stuppam desuper: et pone sub uentre Pedis tabulam paruam, cui sint duo capita plana.	Then put a plaster on him from above: and put a piece of wood under the foot from below: and put beneath the navel a plate with two flat heads.
Deinde stringe eam cum Pede strictura decenti, postquam tu inuoluis eam cum pannis, et reliquis quibus indiget.	Then tighten it with the leg when it is going down strictly, after you have wrapped it with rags, and with the others with which it needs to be tightened.
Cum ergo praetereunt ei tres dies, aut quatuor, tunc solue ligamentum.	But if they pass three or four days, then loosen the ligaments.
Nam tu inuenies ossa aequata, siue sint fracta, aut sint dislocata.	If the bones are broken or dislocated, reduce them carefully.
Operatio ergo in eis est, sicut uides.	Operation therefore is, as you see.
Si autem franguntur aliqui digiti, tunc restaura eos, et aequa ipsos secundum quod narraui tibi in restauratione digitorum manus.	But if some of the fingers are broken, then restore them and make the bones equal as I told you in restoring finger hands.
Deinde pone digito tuo astellam secundum longitudinem digiti, et sit latior eo parumper: deinde pone sub Pede hanc tabulam quam narraui tibi, et stringe eam strictura decenti.	Then place your hand with a pin according to the length of the finger and make it a little wider; then put under the foot this plate that I told you, and tighten it by a firm holding.
Si uero quod frangitur ex ossibus est duo, aut tria, aut plus, tunc pone super omnem digitum astellam suae quantitatis, inuolutam in panno lini: et stringe tabulam in inferiori Pedis: et sit stans super unum capitum tabulae extra uentrem Pedis, ut teneat retentione bona.	But if what is broken is more than two or three bones, then put over each finger an astilet of its own quantity, wrapped in a cloth: and tighten the plate on the foot's bottom: and stand on one side of the plate outside the foot's navel so that it holds fast by good holding.
Et conuenit tibi, ut non obliuiscaris, quin consideres omnia quae dixi tibi in reliquis fracturis ex accidentibus quae diximus: et oppone omni accidenti cum eo quod oportet.	And it is convenient for you, that you not forget, but consider all that I told you of the other broken bones by the accidents which we mentioned: and oppose to every accident with what is necessary.
Â¶ De fractura Vuluae mulieris, et ossis pectinis, et uirgae uiri.	Regarding the fracture of a woman's vulva, and of the ribs, and of a man's testicles.
Caput XIX.	Chapter 19.
Quando frangitur Vulua mulieris, tunc fac eam sedere quadratam.	When the vulva of a woman is broken, then make her sit square.
Deinde inclina eam ad partem dorsi ipsius parumper, et teneatur retro.	Then tilt her slightly toward the back of her own, and hold her back.
Deinde impleat obstetrix Vuluam eius coto, donec impleat eam: et fiat in Vulua ex eo sicut sphera.	Then fill the woman' vulva with cotton, until she is filled up: and let it be in the vulva from that like a ball.
Deinde concutiatur mulier, et eleua dorsum eius paulatim.	Then shake the woman, and rub her back slowly.
Illud enim cotum egreditur, donec fiat ante portam Vuluae sicut sphera, et os fractum redit.	For that cotton will go out, until it is before the woman' vulva like a ball, and the broken mouth comes back.
Deinde pone puluillum super dorsum eius.	Then put on her back a little downy thing.
Quando ergo uult mingere, remoueat cotum cum facilitate, deinde mingat: et reduc ipsum secundum modum, quo intromisisti ipsum in primis: deinde redeat ad puluillum suum primum.	But when she wants to urinate, let the cotton move with ease, then let her urinate: and reduce it according to the way that you put it first: and then bring back to her own downy thing first.
Faciat illud septem diebus, aut circiter, os ipsum enim restauratur.	Let him wait seven days, or at most a week; for the bone itself is healed.
Et si uis, accipe uesicam ouis, et stringe super foramen eius cannulam arundinis, et intromitte uesicam totam in Vuluam eius.	And if you wish, take a wisp of hay and tightly plug the hole with an arrow-head, and insert the whole wisp into his cavity.
Deinde suffla in cannulam cum uirtute, donec infletur uesica intra Vuluam, fractura enim redit.	Then blow into the tube with force, until the hay is bent inside, for it is because of the fracture that it bends.
Deinde impleatur cum coto, et stet aliquot diebus, secundum quod narrauimus, donec sanetur.	Then fill it with poultice, and let it stand a few days, as we have said, until it is healed.
Et quando frangitur os Pectinis uiri, aut mulieris, tunc administra in restauratione eius, et ipsius aequatione illud quod narrauimus in osse Anchae.	And when the hip bone of a man or woman breaks, then administer to it the restoration that we have spoken of for the hipbone of Anchae.
Et non occultatur rectum in his fracturis propinquis, quae parum contingunt, praecipue cui est quiddam studii, uel usus.	And do not hide from those who are nearby, who are few in number, especially from one who is studious or has some use.
Et intellige librum meum istum multum, quoniam fractura ipsa significat tibi in pluribus dispositionibus uiam rectam in restauratione sui, et strictura sui: intellige ergo.	And understand my book well, for the fracture itself signifies to you many things concerning the straightness of your own will in the restoration of its health, and the tightness of it. Understand therefore.
In Virga autem uiri quando frangitur, accipe guttur anseris: et intromitte uirgam in ipso.	But when the hip bone breaks, take a goose's throat; and insert the hipbone into it.
Deinde pone super ipsum inuolutionem ex panno, et inuoluatur, et dimittatur tribus diebus, aut circiter eos, et sanabitur, si Deus uoluerit.	Then place over it a patchwork of cloth, and let it be bandaged up, and let it stand for three days or about that time, and if God wills, it will heal.
Â¶ De restauratione fracturae ossium, quando est cum uulnere.	Of the restoration of broken bones, when it is with an arrow.
Caput XX.	Chapter XX
Conuenit ei cui accidit fractura cum uulnere, praecipue si est magnum, sicut os coxae, aut adiutorii, aut simile illi, ut properes, et phlebotomes ipsum statim: si attestantur tibi conditiones phlebotomiae, sicut praemisimus.	It is fitting for him who has suffered a fracture with an arrow, especially if it is a large one, such as the hipbone or the bones of the limbs, or something similar to that, as you think proper, and do not delay: if you are aware of the signs of bleeding, as we have said.
Quod si uulnus effluit sanguinem, tunc oportet, ut properes ad abscisionem eius, ita ut puluerizes super ipsum zegi tritum: si non est tibi praesens aliud.	Now if the arrow bleeds blood, then you should, as you think proper, cut off its ends so that it may become powdery on top of the bone: if there is not another present for you.
Deinde incipe restaurare fracturam in illo eodem die: et non postponas illud, si non accidit apostema.	Then begin to restore the fracture on that very day; and do not postpone it, unless an aphemia occurs.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte restaurationem eius usque ad diem nonum, donec sedetur apostema.	If, however, an aphemia becomes hot, then cease the restoration until the ninth day, until the aphemia cools down.
Et non appropinques ei in die tertio, et quarto omnino, nam tu faceres ei accidere accidentia mala.	And do not approach it on the third day and especially on the fourth; for you would make bad accidents happen to it.
Si autem os fractum est eminens super cutem detectum: tunc oportet, ut coneris reducere ipsum, et aequare ipsum manibus tuis cum facilitate et extensione parua.	If, however, the broken jaw protrudes above the detected wound; then you should seek to reduce it with ease and a small extension.
Si autem non praeparatur extensio eius, et ipsius aequatio manibus tuis: tunc reduc ipsum cum isto instrumento.	If, however, the extension of it and its alignment with your hands have not been prepared; then reduce it with this instrument.
Et est instrumentum quod fit ex ferro, cuius longitudo est quantitas septem digitorum, aut octo: et eius latitudo est secundum quantitatem uulneris.	It is an instrument made of iron, whose length is the quantity of seven fingers or eight; and its width is according to the amount of the wound.
Et propter illud necesse est medico, ut accipiat ex eis tria, aut quatuor secundum quantitatem qua indiget ad illud ex curatione in omni specie fracturae.	And for this it is necessary that the doctor take from them three or four according to the amount needed for his cure in any type of fracture.
Et sit rotundum: et sit in eo grossitudo parua, ut non duplicetur apud compressionem super ipsum in hora operationis: et sit acutae extremitatis, cui sit margo in extremitatibus suis.	And let it be round; and let there be little thickness so that it does not break under the pressure on the top during the operation: and let its sharp ends have a rim at their ends.
Et sit superius eius ad grossitudinem ex medietate eius usque ad inferiora.	And let its upper part be of little thickness, from the middle to its lower end.
Et haec est forma eius.	This is its shape.
Oportet in Hac Operatione, ut ponatur extremitas eius acuta curuata super extremitatem ossis eminentis: et impelle ipsum cum eo uice una, donec quando redit os et aequatur quadam aequatione.	In this operation, the sharp end of it should be placed on the top of the prominent bone; and push it with a certain force all at once, until when the jaw moves and aligns in some way.
Conare ergo aequare extremitates fracturae adinuicem.	So consider how you align the ends of the fracture opposite each other.
Quod si extremitates eius fracta est subtilis, et non accipit eam instrumentum accaeptione bona, tunc opotet, ut incidas extremitatem illius ossis, donec instrumentum potestatem habeat eius.	If its ends are slender, and the instrument does not accept them well; then you should seek to hit one of its ends with a blow, until the instrument can obtain a grasp on it.
Si uero non potes reducere eos cum eo quod narrauimus omnino, tunc incide ipsum cum eo quod conuenit ei ex Incisoriis quae diximus: aut serra ipsum cum una serrarum quocunque modo possibile est tibi.	If you cannot reduce them with the one we have described at all, then hit it with something sharp that is convenient for you; or cut it with a saw in any way possible for you.
Deinde rade illud quod remanet in osse ex asperitate et corticibus minutis.	Then remove what remains in the bone from hardness and small bark.
Cum ergo reducitur os, et inuenit infirmus post reductionem eius dolorem uehementem laedentem, tunc scias, quod os non rediit ad locum suum naturalem.	When therefore the bone is reduced, and remains after the reduction a painful and annoying pain, then know that the bone has not returned to its natural place.
Fac ergo illud.	Do therefore that which follows.
Nam tu confers infirmo iuuamentum magnum, cum completur restauratio tua quam facis ossi.	For you have a great impediment to the injured part when your restoration, which you make, is completed with the bone.
Tunc submerge pannum in uino stiptico, nigro.	Then dip the cloth in black strychnine wine.
Et proprie si est in aestate.	And especially if it is in summer.
Et non ponas super uulnus caerotum, neque aliquid in quo sit oleum: ut non faciat accidere in ipso putredinem et corruptionem.	And do not place on the bone of the skull, or anything where there is oil: lest it cause corruption and decay in itself.
Deinde administra astellas in hora complementi tui a restauratione ossis.	Then administer the medicine at the hour of your restoration of the bone.
Et dimitte uulnus detectum: ita, ut incidas cum forficibus foramen in inuolutionibus secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And dismiss the detected bone: so that you may fall with the hooks into the second hole according to the quantity of the wound.
Et caue omni cautela, ne stringas uulnus cum fractura.	And with all caution, do not tie the bone when it is fractured.
Multotiens enim fecerunt istud stolidi medici: et fecerunt accidere super infirmos suos aut mortem, aut corrosionem, aut zuchem, id est, saniem.	For many have done this foolish thing of the physicians: and they have caused to happen on their injured persons or death, or corruption, or rot, that is, illness.
Et sit strictura tua mollis, lenis, diuersa stricturae fracturarum reliquarum.	And be your tightness soft, gentle, diverse from the tightness of the fractures of the other remains.
Quod si uulnus est malum, aut est uulnus magnum, et times super ipsum quaedam accidentia mala quae narrauimus, et inuenis dolorem in loco suspensum: tunc non oportet, ut ponas super ipsum astellas.	That if the bone is ill, or is a great bone, and you have some bad accident which we have described, and hanging pain in the place: then it is not necessary that you should place on it stars.
Et fac eis inuolutiones ex pannis duris in loco astellarum, et stringe ipsum cum eis.	And make them solutions out of tough cloths in the place of the stars, and tie it with them.
Cum autem est post diem unum, aut dies duos, et uides uulnus iam incipere, ut in eo generetur pus: tunc aufer desuper ipsum pannum quem posuisti super ipsum cum uino.	When however is after one day, or two days, and you see the bone begin to generate pus, then remove from above it the cloth which you placed on it with wine.
Deinde administra licinia, et unguenta cum quibus de consuetudine nostra est, ut medicemur uulnera: sicut unguentum tetrapharmacon, et similia illi.	Then administer leeching, and ointments with which we usually heal wounds, such as the tetrapharmacon ointment, and similar to it.
Et conuenit tibi, ut soluas ligamentum.	It is right for you to release the ligaments.
Et considera uulnus in omni die mane et uespere, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	And consider the wound every day morning and evening until it heals, and it will heal.
Et oportet, ut praeparetur membrum taliter, ut currat ex eo pus ad inferiora cum facilitate.	And it is necessary that the limb be prepared so that the pus comes out from below with ease.
Quod si praetereunt uulneri dies multi, et non consolidatur, neque abscinditur pus ab eo: tunc scias, quod illic sunt satagie ossis parua.	If many days pass without the wound healing and it does not close and the pus does not come out: then you should know that there are small bony knots.
Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.	Why should you ask about the wound with doubt?
Quot uero ex illis alsatagie sunt separata, remoue ea, et extrahe ipsa.	How many of those small knots are separated, remove them, and pull them out.
Et quae ex eis sunt non separata, et pungunt membrum, et faciunt accidere dolorem, conare incidere ea, et auferre ea omni modo quo possibile est tibi illud.	And which of those small knots are not separated, and poke the limb, and cause pain, try to hit them, and remove them in any way possible for you.
Quod si accidat uulneri zuchen, aut ekileten, id est, estiomenus, aut species alia corruptionis et putrefactionis: tunc oportet, ut opponas unicuique ex eis cum eo quod conuenit ei ex curatione, cuius praecessit narratio in capitulo suo.	If the wound swells or becomes red, that is to say, there is a feeling of heat, or another type of corruption and putrefaction: then you should oppose each one with what comes to it from healing, which was mentioned before in its chapter.
Et ex eo in quo oportet ut stet sermo meus, et cui facias praesentem mentem tuam quando frangitur os, et eminet super membrum, sicut os coxae, et adiutorii, et similia eis ex membris magnis, est, ut non praesumas attractionem eius, multotiens enim accidit ex illo mors, imo dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat.	And from that in which it is necessary for my speech to stand, and which you should bring to mind when a bone breaks, and comes out above the limb, such as the hip bone, and assistants, and similar bones of the large limbs, that is not to say that you expect attraction from them, because many times death occurs from them, but leave them until they rot.
Fortasse enim cadet per se post uiginti dies, aut triginta.	Perhaps they will fall down by themselves after twenty or thirty days.
Tunc ergo cura uulnus, si uidetur tibi: et sinon, dimitte ipsum.	Then therefore take care of the wound if it is yours: and otherwise, leave it.
Â¶ De curatione Nodationis in uestigio fracturae.	On the healing of a break in the bone.
Caput XXI.	Chapter 21.
Multoties accidit haec Nodatio in uestigio sanationis fracturae.	Many times this surgery has occurred in the wound of healing a break.
Praecipue, quae est prope iuncturas: et foedatur ex ea figura membri.	Especially, what is near joints: and it is fed from that part of the limb.
Et fortasse prohibet membrum ab operatione sua naturali.	And perhaps prohibits the limb from its natural action.
Considera ergo tunc, si nodatio est recens: administra in ea medicinas quae stipticitatem habent, sicut aloe, et olibanum, et myrrha, et sarcocolla, et acacia, et similia eis.	Consider therefore then, if the fall is recent: administer to her medicines which have a constricting effect, such as aloe, and olive oil, and myrrh, and sarcocollus, and acacia, and similar ones.
Ita, ut accipias ex istis quasdam, aut omnes eas: et confice eas cum uino stiptico, aut cum albumine oui, aut cum aceto: et pone eas super nodationem in stuppa, et stringe eas super ipsam strictura bona.	Thus, so that you receive from these certain ones, or all of them: and bind them with a stringy medicine, or with egg white, or with vinegar: and place them on the swelling on the stump, and tie them tightly over the good constriction.
Et dimitte stricturam, nec soluas eam diebus multis.	And release the constriction, do not separate it after many days.
Deinde solue eam, et itera aliam, donec remoueatur nodatio.	Then remove it, and repeat another one until the swelling goes away.
Aut stringe super ipsam laminam plumbi decenter.	Or tie a lead strip at an angle over the spot.
Plumbo enim est proprietas remouendi omne quod timetur ex membris.	Because lead is a property that removes whatever scares the body part.
Si autem nodatio iam in lapidem conuersa est, et stricta est, et festine prouocat necessitas ad auferendum eam: tunc finde super eam ex superiori parte eius, et incide superfluitatem eminentem: aut rade eam cum quibusdam rasoriis, donec remoueatur: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	But if the swelling has already turned to stone, and is tight, and urgent necessity calls for its removal: then find on top of it a small piece, and cut off the protuberance: or saw it with a few blades, until it comes off: and take care of it, until it heals.
Â¶ De curatione quando restauratur, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, non secundum naturam suam.	As for the cure: when it is restored, and the limb remains after it, not in its natural shape.
Caput XXII.	Chapter XXII.
Quando restauratur fractura ossis, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, debile: tunc non fit illud nisi propter caussas multas.	When the fracture of the bone is restored, and the limb remains after it, feeble: then it is not done for no reason at all.
Quarum una est, multitudo solutionis ligamenti et ligationis eius non secundum quod oportet: aut propter superfluitatem stricturae ligamentorum, donec prohibeatur nutrimentum currere ad membrum: aut propter multitudinem embrocationis superfluae in non sua hora: aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore infirmi, et debilitatem eius.	One of these is a multitude of solutions of ligments and of their ties not following what is required: or because of the excess of constriction of the ligaments, until it is prevented from the supply of blood running to the limb: or because of the multiplicity of ointments applied at an inappropriate time: or because of the scarcity of blood in the body, and its weakness.
Et curatio illius est, cibare infirmum, et tenerum facere corpus eius, donec multiplicetur sanguis in eo.	And its cure is, to feed the sick, and to make the body strong, until there is an increase of blood in it.
Et administra balneum.	And administer a bath.
Et intromitte gaudium et laeticiam super eum.	And bring joy and happiness upon him.
Deinde pone picem super membrum: ut attrahat pix ad ipsum nutrimentum multum.	Then put the knife on the member: so that the knife attracts much food to itself.
Et assiduet embrocationem eius cum aqua tepida, donec currat nutrimentum, et redeat ad figuram suam naturalem.	And he will intensify his emulsion with warm water until the nutrition has passed, and return to his own natural shape.
Â¶ De curatione ossium fractorum quando restaurantur tortuose.	Curing broken bones when they are being healed with twists.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter 23: The Head.
Quando accidit membro iam restaurato post sanationem eius tortuositas, et eminentia ossi fracto, aut nodatio: et foedatur per illud forma membri, uerumtamen membrum non prohibetur ab operatione sua naturali: tunc non oportet ut recipias sermonem eius, qui existimat, ut frangatur membrum denuo.	When it happens that a member has been restored after its healing of curvature, or prominence of bone, or misshape: and the nourishment is given through that shape of the member, however natural the member's action may be: then you should not prevent him from giving his speech, which he imagines, to break the member again.
Et iam fuerunt multi stolidorum medicorum et restauratorum, qui fecerunt illud in terra nostra.	And there were many stiff-necked doctors and healers who made that known on our land.
Et haec quidem operatio est uituperabilis ualde, perducens ad mortem, uel timorem magnum, ut scilicet sit mortalis.	And this operation is most wonderful, leading to death or great fear, as if it were deadly.
Verum si claudicatio et nodatio sunt recentes: tunc oportet, ut embrocetur cum aqua tepida, in qua decoctae sint herbae mollificantes, sicut folia alteae, et radix eius, et mellilotum, et illis similia.	But if the claudication and misshapen-ness are recent: then it should be emollient with warm water, in which have been boiled softening herbs, such as leaves of willow, and root of mistletoe, and mallow, and similar.
Et fiat ei emplastrum cum emplastro mollificatiuo, sicut dyachilon decenter factum.	And let him make an emulsion with a softening poultice, like a poultice made from the roots of dandelion properly prepared.
Aut sumatur mucilago radicis alteae, et concutiatur cum adipe gallinae, aut oleo sisamino: et emplastretur cum eo.	Or let him be cooked with the mucus of the root of willow, and mixed with chicken fat, or oil from sesamum: and let him be poulticed with it.
Aut sumantur ficus pingues, et terantur cum fimo columbino, et similibus eis quae nominantur ex medicinis diminuentes consolidationem.	Or let them be cooked with fig leaves, and pressed with columba flour, and similar things that are called by medical names to decrease consolidation.
Et quandoque soluitur nodatio cum fricatione assidua, antiqua, et leni, quae fit cum manibus humidis.	And when the misshapen-ness has been released with frequent, ancient, and gentle friction, which is done with wet hands.
Et administretur motus membri ad omnem partem in horis omnibus.	And let the member's motion be given to all parts in every hour.
Si autem tortuositas iam antecessit, et fortis facta est, et conuersa est in lapidem, et prouocata est necessitas ad curatonem eius cum ferro: tunc oportet, ut secetur superius eius, et soluatur continuatio ossis, et incidatur quod superfluit ex nodatione aut osse cum Incisoriis subtilibus: et administretur facilitas in illo cum sollicitudine et studio.	But if the curvature has already preceded, and it is a strong one, made to be hard, and provoked to require cure with iron: then let the upper part of it be cut off, and the continuity of the bone be healed, and let whatever excess there is from the misshapen-ness be removed with very fine incisions: and let ease be given to it with care and attention.
Â¶ De sermone in Dislocatione.	On the Dislocation.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter on dislocations.
Dislocatio est exitus alicuius iuncturarum a loco suo.	A dislocation is the departure of a joint from its normal position.
Quare prohibetur a motu suo, et foedatur figura membri.	Why does it interfere with its natural motion, and ì ì´ë ë©¤ë²ì ëª¨ìì ë³ê²½í©ëê¹?
Et facit accidere super infirmum dolores, et laesiones uehementes.	and causes pain and severe injuries.
Quando ergo accidit alicui dislocatio, tunc oportet festinare ad restaurationem eius: neque tardet eam omnino.	When a dislocation occurs, then one should hurry to restore it: nor should one delay at all.
Nam si tardatur, apostematur locus, et fortasse cum eo reductio dislocationis.	For if delayed, the site may become stiff, and there is a chance of reducing the dislocation with it.
Propter illud ergo non oportet, ut moueatur, neque extendatur in hora apostemationis eius.	Therefore, one should not move or stretch at all during the restoration period.
Quoniam multotiens facit accidere spasmum, et dolores laedentes.	For it often causes a spasm to occur, and painful injuries.
Verum quando accidit illud, tunc oportet, ut properes ad phlebotomiam infirmi.	But when this occurs, then you should, to make sure the blood is removed from the injured area.
Deinde dimittatur, donec quiescat apostema.	Then it is dismissed, until the stiffening subsides.
Deinde embrocetur membrum cum aqua calida et oleo.	Then the member is soaked with warm water and oil.
Deinde reducatur cum facilitate.	Then reduce it with ease.
Et curetur omne membrum cum eo cuius rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And take care of each member, restoring it to its original place.
Ego quidem iam ordinaui capitula dislocationis, etiam secundum quod praecessit in fractura, a superiori parte corporis usque ad inferiorem eius.	I have already arranged the chapters on dislocations, as well as those following, from the upper part of the body to the lower.
Â¶ De cura dislocationis Mandibulae inferioris.	Chapter on the care of a dislocated jaw (mandible).
Caput XXV.	Chapter 25.
Parum dislocantur duae Mandibulae nisi raro.	The two jaws are rarely dislocated.
Et dislocatio ambarum fit secundum unum duoru modorum.	And the dislocation of the upper jaw occurs in two ways only.
Aut enim remouentur a locis suis remotione parua, et mollificantur parumper.	Or, indeed, they depart from their places by a small distance and become slightly looser.
Aut dislocantur dislocatione integra, completa, donec mollificentur ad partem pectoris, donec currat saliua infirmi, et non possit tenere eam, neque possit claudere os suum, et inuoluatur lingua eius cum sermone.	Or they are completely dislocated, and become looser towards the chest, until the saliva is removed by the injury, and he cannot hold it closed, nor close his mouth, and the tongue rolls with speech.
Quando autem dislocatio eius est parua, tunc redit in pluribus dispositionibus per se cum paucitate.	When, however, the dislocation is small, then it returns of its own accord with a few movements.
Si uero est dislocatio completa, integra: tunc oportet, ut administretur reductio eius uelociter, et non tardetur penitus: et est, ut teneat minister caput infirmi: et intromittat medicus pollicem manus suae unius in radicem Mandibulae dislocationis inter os eius, si dislocatio est a parte una.	If the dislocation is complete and intact, then it should be treated promptly with reduction, without delay: and it is necessary that the nurse holds the head, and the doctor inserts his thumb of one hand into the root of the dislocation between the mouth and tooth, if the dislocation is on one side.
Aut intromittat duos pollices suos simul, si dislocatio est a duabus partibus.	Or he should insert both thumbs at the same time, if the dislocation is on two sides.
Et reliqui digiti manuum eius sint extra, quibus aequet.	And the other fingers of his hand are outside, which equalizes it.
Et praecipe infirmo, ut mundificet Mandibulas suas, et absoluat eas ad manducandum ad omnem partem.	And order the sick person to clean their teeth and eat with all parts.
Et medicus aequet Mandibulam, et impellat Mandibulam, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And the doctor equalizes the jaw, and pushes it back to its place.
Quod si difficilis sit reductio eius, praecipue si sunt ambae Mandibulae simul: tunc administra uaporationem cum aqua calida, et oleo, donec fiat facilis reductio ambarum: neque tardes reductionem ambarum omnino, sicut diximus.	That if the reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are dislocated together: then he should administer steam with warm water and oil until the reduction becomes easy: and do not delay the reduction of the jaws at all, as we have said.
Cum ergo redeunt et aequantur, et clauditur os infirmi, et non mollificantur: tunc pone super eas puluillos pannorum, cum ceroto quod sit factum ex cera: et oleo rosato.	When they are therefore closed and equalized, and the mouth is shut, and do not relax: then place on them soft cloths, with a pad that has been made of wax: and oil of rose.
Deinde ligetur cum facilitate cum ligamentis mollibus.	Then bind it together easily with loose ligaments.
Et sit somnus infirmi super dorsum suum: et caput eius sit stans inter duo puluinaria, ut non moueat ipsum ad dextram et sinistram: neque conetur, uel cogatur masticare aliquid: imo ponatur cibus eius sorbitio lenis, donec quando remouentur dolores, et nodatur Mandibula: tunc comedat quod uult, et administretur illud cum facilitate.	And let him lie on his back: and his head should be placed between two cloths so that he does not move to the right or left: and he should not be forced to chew anything: but soft food should be given to him to eat, until such time as his jaw no longer hurts, and it is closed: then he can eat what he wants, and administer it easily.
Non laboret super operationem oris sui apud comestionem et potum, et oscitationem, donec nodetur Mandibula, et sanetur.	He should not work on the operation of his mouth during digestion and drinking, and whistling, until such time as the jaw is closed, and healed.
Quod si difficilis fiat reductio duarum Mandibuiarum, quando dislocantur in hora aliqua, et non conuertuntur ad loca sua: tunc multotiens accidunt inde febres, et soda assidua: et fortasse soluitur uenter infirmi, et fortasse uomit choleram puram.	That if the reduction of both jaws is difficult when they are dislocated at some time, and do not return to their places: then often occur there fevers, and frequent farts: and perhaps a swollen belly, and perhaps pure cholera.
Cum ergo uides illud: tunc scias, quia est perditio, et multotiens moritur ille cui accidit illud in decem diebus.	For this reason you see that loss; for if you don't know, it is a loss, and he often dies who gets this in ten days.
Â¶ De reducione dislocationis Furculae, et extremitatis humeri.	The Reduction of the Dislocation of the Furcula and Extremity of the Humerus
Caput XXVI.	Chapter 26: The Head
Furcula quidem non dislocatur ex latere intrinseco, propter continuationem suam cum pectore.	The furcula does not dislocate from its inner side, because it continues with the chest.
Et dislocatur quandoque ad exteriora: et declaratur illud sensui.	And it dislocates sometimes towards the outside; and that is felt by touch.
Et restauratio eius est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat brachia sua.	And its restoration is such that he lies on his back and extends his arms.
Deinde coarta locum cum palma tua coartatione forti, nam ipsa redibit.	Then gird your hand with the garter; for it will return by itself.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stringe eam.	Then place a pad on it, and feathers, and tighten it.
Extremitates uero eius quae sequuntur cubitum, et continuantur cum eo, non dislocantur, nisi raro.	The extremities, however, which follow the bed and continue with him, rarely dislocate.
Quod si dislocatur die aliquo: tunc oportet, ut reducatur et aequetur secundum quod diximus, et quod praeparatur tibi.	If it dislocates on one day: then let it be reduced and made equal as we have said, and let you be prepared.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam.	Then place a pad on it, and feathers, and tighten it.
Et praecipe infirmo, adhaerere tranquillitati et quieti, donec sanetur.	And tell the sick person to adhere to rest and quietness until he is healed.
Et cum hac eadem curatione reducitur extremitas Humeri, quando separatur etiam a loco suo.	And with this same cure the extremity of the humerus is reduced when it separates from its place as well.
Â¶ De reductione dislocationis Humeri.	The Reduction of the Dislocation of the Humerus
Caput XXVII.	Chapter 27: The Head
Scias, quod Humerus non dislocatur, nisi secundum tres modos.	You should know that the humerus does not dislocate unless by three ways.
Quorum unus est, ut dislocetur ad partem titillici ad inferiora.	The first is that it dislocates towards the upper arm towards the lower side.
Secundus est, ut dislocetur ad partem pectoris.	The second is that it dislocates towards the chest.
Et fortasse dislocatur ad superiorem partem Humeri: et illud fit raro.	And perhaps it dislocates towards the upper part of the humerus, and that is rare.
Et non dislocatur ad posteriora, propter spatulam.	And it does not dislocate from behind, because of the scapula.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora, propter neruos.	And it does not dislocate from the front, because of the nerves.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur et egreditur ad inferiora uersus titillicum: praecipue in illis, quorum carnes sunt paucae.	It dislocates and moves towards the lower side towards the titillus; mainly in those who have little flesh there.
Quoniam egrediur in eis uelociter, et ingreditur uelociter.	For he who enters them quickly exits and quickly enters.
In illis autem quorum carnes sunt multae, est econtrario illius, scilicet quia egreditur cum difficultate, et ingreditur cum difficultate.	But in those whose flesh is abundant, the opposite holds, that is, because he exits with difficulty and enters with difficulty.
Et fortasse accidit quibusdam hominibus percussio, aut casus, et apostematur Humerus apostemate calido, et putatur propter illud, quia iam dislocatus est.	And perhaps it happens to some men that they are struck or fall and dislocated their shoulder. They say that because it is already dislocated.
Oportet ergo, ut experiaris illud, donec stes super certitudinem eius, et tunc procedas in curatione eius.	Therefore, let you experience that thing until you are certain about its status, and then proceed to treat it.
Et cognoscitur dislocatio, quando est ad inferiora uersus titillicum: et distinguas inter Humerum dislocatum, et humerum sanum.	And be known the dislocation when it is towards the lower side of the joint: and distinguish between a dislocated shoulder and a healthy one.
Nam tu inuenis inter eos diuersitatem manifestam, et inuenis in capite Humeri concauitatem, et sub titillico apud tactum caput humeri quasi ipsum sit ouum: et non potest infirmus reducere manum ad aurem suam, neque mouere eam omnibus motibus.	For you will find a great difference between them: and in the head of the arm there is an ache, and under the touch almost as if it were itself; and cannot bring the hand to its ear, nor move it in all movements.
Et similiter, si dislocatur uersus pectus, aut ad sursum: tunc inuenis manifestum tactum, neque occultatur.	And likewise, if it is dislocated towards the chest or upward: then there is a clear feeling of touch, and it does not hide itself away.
Et huius quidem dislocationis fit facilis reductio, quando est recens, aut infirmus est puer.	And of this dislocation, its reduction is easy when it is young or a weak boy.
Et reductio eius est, ut eleuet minister manum suam ad superiora.	And its reduction is, so that you lift your hand up toward the sky.
Deinde pone tu pollices tuos sub titillico eius, et eleua iuncturam cum fortitudine ad sursum ad locum suum: et minister eleuet manum suam, et extendat eam ad sursum.	Then put your fingers under its touch and join them together with strength upward to their place: and lift your hand up and extend it downward.
Deinde ponat eam inferius, ipse enim redit uelociter.	Then put it down again, for himself he returns quickly.
Si autem non redit per illud quod diximus, et sunt a principio quo accidit dislocatio dies multi: tunc oportet, ut balneetur infirmus in aqua calida, et administretur embrocatio quae mollificat et lenit, sicut si decoquantur radices alteae, et foenugraecum, et mellilotum in aqua, et administretur.	But if it does not return by that which we have said, and there are many days from the time of dislocation: then let the infirm person bathe in hot water, and apply an ointment that softens and soothes, such as if they were cooked the roots of aloe, and foenugraecum, and melilotum in water, and it is applied.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et ponatur sub titillico eius sphera et lana, quae sit aequalis inter lenitatem et stricturam.	Then the infirm person shall lie down on his back: and a ball and wool be placed under its touch, which is equal between the soft and the tight.
Deinde ponat medicus calcaneum suum super spheram, et eleuet caput humeri cum uirtute, et attrahat manum infirmi ad inferiora.	Then let the physician put his calcaneum on the sphere, and he shall raise the head of the humerus with force, and draw the hand of the nurse downward.
Et minister alius teneat caput infirmi, ut non moueatur ad inferiora: ipse namque redit statim.	And another shall hold the head of the nurse so that she does not move downward: for he will immediately return to his stand.
Et si uis, reduc eum secundum modum hunc: et est, ut facias esse praesentem uirum qui sit longior infirmo, et stet a parte lateris, et intromittat humerum suum sub titillico infirmi: et eleuet titillicum eius ad superiora, donec sit infirmus suspensus in aere.	And if you wish, reduce him according to this manner: and it is so, that you may make the man who is longer ill present, and stand at his side, and introduce his humerus under the hand of the nurse: and lift up her hand to the upper part, until he be suspended in the air.
Et minister alius trahat manum infirmi ad inferiora uentris eius.	And another shall hold the hand of the nurse downward toward the thigh of the patient.
Si autem infirmus est leuis: tunc oportet, ut suspendatur cum eo aliquid aliud, ut grauet ipsum: nam redit dislocatio statim.	If the man is light: then it shall be necessary that something else should hold him up with it, so that he does not fall down: for he will immediately return to his dislocation.
Et reducitur etiam secundum modum alium: et est, ut figatur in terra lignum longum, cuius caput sit rotundum figura: sicut manica mortarii: quod non sit grossum, neque subtile.	And he shall be reduced also according to another manner: and it is so, that he is placed on the ground a long wooden piece, whose head is round in figure: as the handle of a mortar: which neither is too coarse nor too fine.
Deinde ponatur sub infirmo postquam ponuntur super caput ligni panni lenes: et infirmus sit stans secundum longitudinem ligni.	Then let it be placed under the patient after that they are placed on the head of the wood, and the cloth made of soft fabric; and let the patient stand according to the length of the wood.
Deinde extendatur manus eius ad inferiora a parte altera, et extendatur corpus eius ab altera parte cum fortitudine: nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then shall his hand be extended downward from the other part, and shall his body be extended from one side with force: for the joint returns to its place with velocity.
Quod si difficilis sit eius reductio per omnia quae diximus, tunc utere hac cura: et est, ut accipias lignum cuius longitudo sit quantitas duorum brachiorum, et eius latitudo quantitas quatuor digitorum, et grossitudo eius quantitas duorum digitorum: cui sit caput rotundum, ut alleuietur introitus eius in profundum titillici, secundum hanc formam.	That if his reduction is difficult by all the things which we have said, then use this cure: and it is so, that you take a piece of wood whose length is two times that of the arm, and whose breadth is four times that of the fingers, and whose thickness is two times that of the fingers: and whose head is round, that it may ease the entrance into his depth according to this form.
Deinde ligentur super caput rotundum panni lenes, ut non laedat lignum infirmum.	Then let them bind on the round head with soft cloth so that they do not wound the wood on the patient.
Deinde ponatur sub titillico infirmi, ut extendatur manus, aut brachium super lignum usque ad inferiora: et ligetur lignum super adiutorium et brachium et extremitatem manus.	Then place the nurse under the tickle, so that the hand is extended, or the arm over the wood until it reaches the lower part: and tie the wood on the support and the arm and the end of the hand.
Deinde ponatur brachium super gradum scalae per latitudinem, et extendatur manus ad inferiora, et dimittatur reliquum corpus suspensum a parte altera.	Then place the arm over the steps across the width, and extend the hand towards the lower part, and dismiss the remaining body suspended from the other side.
Iunctura enim ingreditur statim.	For the wound to be sewed immediately.
Cum ergo completur introitus eius secundum quemcunque modum possibile est: tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico spheram aequalis quantitatis ex lana.	When this entry is therefore finished in whatever way possible: then you should place a ball of equal size made from wool under the tickle.
Deinde pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum olibano, et albumine oui super humerum totum, sicut reuoluitur desuper.	Then place the prepared plaster made from ground stone with incense and albite on the whole shoulder as it turns away upwards.
Deinde stringe sub titillico strictura decenti: et reuoluatur ligamentum super emplastrum desuper: et annectatur manus eius ad collum ipsius, et dimittatur, neque moueatur manus eius septem diebus.	Then tighten the knot under the tickle as it goes down: and wrap the ligament around the plaster upwards: and attach her hand to her neck, and dismiss it, and do not move her hand for seven days.
Et oportet, ut ponatur cibus infirmipaucus, donec confortetur membrum: quoniam est uelocius ad sanationem eius.	And you should place a meager diet for the member until it is healed: for it is faster to heal with it.
Deinde ponatur amplior post septem dies, aut quinque, et ex ercitetur cum motu.	Then place a broader one after seven or five days, and exercise it with movement.
Si ergo firmatur et non mollificatur, tunc iam sanatus est.	But if it remains firm and does not weaken, then it is healed now.
Si uero iunctura dislocatur multotiens, propter humiditatem quae accidit ei, aut propter caussam aliam: tunc oportet, ut administretur in ea cauterium cum tribus foraminibus, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo de cauterio.	But if the wound dislocates many times, because of the moisture that occurs with it, or for any other reason: then you should administer a cauterization with three holes, as was mentioned in the chapter on cauterization.
Quod si fiat hoc totum, et soluatur ligamentum post septem dies, et non confirmetur iunctura, et reducatur emplastrum et strictura super ipsum aliquotiens, et non firmetur, et cadat, et non possit eleuare ipsum ad superiora: tunc scias, quod nerui eius qui sunt ad caput humeri, iam incisi sunt, aut extensi, aut mollificati: et scias, quod iunctura nunquam figetur in loco suo.	If all of this is done, and the ligament is loosened after seven days, and the wound does not close with the plaster and the knot many times, and does not firm up, and falls down, and cannot raise it upwards: then you should know that the nerves which are in the shoulder have been cut or stretched or weakened: and you should know that the wound never closes in its place.
Dislocationis autem quae fit uersus pectus et mammillam, aut ad posteriora reductio, fit cum impulsione et extensione cum manibus: donec redeat, et administretur in ea reliqua strictura et cura, donec sanetur.	But the dislocation which happens towards the chest and the nipple, or to the rear, is caused by a push and an extension with the hands: until it stops, and administer a remaining knot and care, until it heals.
Quod si accidat post sanationem grauitas in membro, et tarditas in motu eius, tunc utatur infirmus balneo multotiens, donec leniatur illa grauitas, et redeat ad naturam eius primam.	If it should happen after recovery of the strength of a member, and delay in its movement, then let the sick person use the bath often, until that strength is relieved, and return him to his natural state first.
Â¶ De curatione dislocationis Cubiti.	On the Treatment of Dislocation of the Elbow.
Caput XXVIII.	HEAD XXVIII.
Scias, quod iunctura Cubiti dislocatur cum difficultate, et similiter redit cum difficultate etiam: et ipsa quidem dislocatur ad omnes partes, et praecipue ad anteriorem, aut ad posteriorem.	Know that the elbow joint dislocates with difficulty, and likewise returns with difficulty to all parts, especially to the front or back.
Et eius dislocatio non occultatur tibi: quoniam est cadens sub uisu, et sub tactu, secundum quamcunque figuram dislocetur.	And its dislocation is not hidden from you: for it falls under your sight and under your touch, according to whatever figure it dislocates.
Et quando coniungis cubitum dislocatum cum sano, declaratur tibi illud manifeste.	And when you join together a dislocated elbow that has recovered its strength, it becomes manifest to you.
Concauatur enim iunctura, et non potest duplicare brachium, neque tangere cum eo humerum suum.	For the dislocation is twisted, and it cannot bend the arm, nor can it touch the shoulder with it.
Et oportet, ut properes, et reducas dislocationem statim, antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And you should reduce the dislocation at once, before it experiences a hot swelling.
Nam si accidit ei apostema calidum, difficilis fit eius reductio: et fortasse non sanatur omnino, praecipue quando est ad posteriora.	For if it happens to that elbow joint that a hot swelling occurs, it is difficult to reduce it; and it may be that it does not heal at all, especially when it is dislocated towards the back.
Est enim deterior omnibus speciebus dislocationis, et uehementioris doloris eis: et multotiens descendit cum ea mors.	This is worse in every respect to dislocation, and more painful to the arm: and often dies with it.
Et restauratio eius quando est ex eis quae possibile est reducere, est, ut extendatur manus eius cum duabus manibus: et brachium eius sit expansum, et manus medici sint supra cubitum et sub eo, et ipse impellat iuncturam cum pollicibus manuum suarum simul, aut cum radice palmae suae, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And when its restoration is from among those that can be reduced, it extends its hand with both hands: and the arm is spread out, and the fingers of the hand are placed above the elbow joint and under it, and he pushes back the dislocation with his thumbs of his hands simultaneously, or with the base of his palm, until he returns to his place.
Aut uero dislocatio est ad anteriora: tunc redit ita, ut duplicet manum cum manu sua, donec percutiat cum radice palmae suae cubitum qui est dislocatus.	Or, on the other hand, the dislocation is towards the front: then he returns so that he doubles his hand with his own hand, until he strikes against the base of his palm the elbow joint that has been dislocated.
Quod si non obedit dislocatio ad reductionem, tunc administra extensionem uehementem, fortem ualde: et est, ut extendant brachium duo ministri: et teneant ipsum duo ministri etiam, ut non remoueatur apud extensionem.	If the dislocation does not submit to reduction, then administer a sharp extension, a strong rub: and it is as if two ministers extend the arm: and they hold him also, so that he does not move during the extension.
Deinde reuoluatur brachium ad omnem partem postquam inuoluitur super manum eius pannus duplicatus longus, aut ligamentum latum.	Then the arm is to be rotated back to its full extent after it has been enveloped with a doubled-over cloth or wide bandage on his hand.
Et quando tangit medicus manu sua iuncturam, inungat ipsam cum oleo: ut sit illud ex eis quae adiuuant in lubricitate iuncturae cum facilitate.	And when the doctor touches with his own hand the joint, he should dip it in oil: so that it may be from those which help in the lubrication of the joint by ease.
Deinde impellat iuncturam impulsione uehementi, donec redeat.	Then he should push the joint with a sharp push, until it is released.
Et post reductionem eius oportet, ut ponatur super ipsam emplastrum, in quo sit stipticitas, et exiccatio cum albugine oui: et stringatur strictura decenti.	And after the reduction of it, it should be placed on it a plaster, in which sits the clotting, and drying with alum: and let it be tightened by tightening while healing.
Et suspendatur brachium a collo infirmi: et dimitte diebus aliquot.	And hang the arm from the neck of the nurse: and let it be left for several days.
Deinde soluatur.	Then unfasten.
Si ergo firmatur iunctura in loco suo, tunc solue ligamentum ab ea, et dimitte ipsam.	If then the joint remains fixed in its place, then loosen the bandage from it, and let it be left.
Et si uides iuncturam non bene stringi, tunc itera emplastrum, et ligamentum, et dimitte ipsam diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	And if you see that the joint is not tightly tightened, then repeat the plaster, and the bandage, and let it be left for several days, until it is tightened.
Deinde solue ipsam.	Then unfasten it.
Si autem accidit ei grauitas post reductionem iuncturae, et dispositio sit in motu: tunc administra humectationem in balneatione, et fricationem subtilem, et compressionem, donec liniatur, aut pone super iuncturam iliati, id est, natem arietis pinguem.	If however it has happened to him that he is light after the reduction of the joint, and the disposition is in movement: then administer moistening in bathing, and subtle rubbing, and compression, until it is healed, or put on top of the joint an ileum, that is, a piece of chamois leather.
Deinde ligetur, et dimitte ipsam super eam die et nocte.	Then tighten it, and let it be left on it day and night.
Deinde aufer eam, et intromitte ipsum in balneum.	Then take it off, and let him enter the bath.
Cum ergo sudat, tunc frica iuncturam fricatione temperata.	When however he sweats, then rub the joint with moderate rubbing.
Deinde itera super ipsam aleliati uice una, et secunda, et tertia cum introitu balnei, donec leniatur.	Then repeat on top of him a piece of chamois leather once, and twice, and third time at the entrance to the bath, until it is relaxed.
Et si uis, pone super ipsam stercus uaccinum, humidum, calefactum cum butyro, et stringe super ipsum.	And if you want, put on top of him a heap of fine mud, moist, heated with butter, and tighten over him.
Fac illud aliquotiens.	Let it be done several times.
Ipsa namque lenitur, et redit ad dispositionem suam.	It is healed, and returns to its own disposition.
Â¶ De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.	De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.
Caput XXIX.	On the treatment of dislocations by Al-Mahassari
Mahassem manus multotiens dislocatur, id est, iunctura quae est inter brachium et manum.	If the wrist is dislocated, that is, the joint between the arm and the hand is disconnected, then...
Et reductio dislocationis eius est facilis.	And reducing the dislocation of it is easy.
Econtrario reliquarum iuncturarum.	Contrary to the remaining joints.
Verumtamen oportet, ut uelocitas sit in reductione dislocationis eius in hora in qua dislocatur, antequam apostemetur locus: aut accidat in eo apostema calidum.	However, it is necessary that the speed be in the reduction of the dislocation at the time when it is dislocated, before the measurement is taken: or happens in that measure warmth.
Et reductio dislocationis in eo est, ut ponas Mahassem manus infirmae super tabulam, et extendat minister manum eius: et ponat medicus palmam suam super eminentiam iuncturae, et impellat eam, donec redeat.	And reducing the dislocation is, so that you put Al-Mahassari's weak hand on a table, and extends his assistant hand: and puts the doctor's palm on the eminence of the joint, and pushes it until it returns.
Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manus, tunc sit positio manus eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manus eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manus medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.	However, it is necessary that you consider whether the palm has already reached the stomach of the hand: then put the weak back of the hand on a table with extension and reduction: and if the dislocation is going to the back of the hand, then the position of the hand should be inside the table, that is, the interior part of the hand should be placed on the table, so that the doctor's palm rests on it.
Si ergo redit statim, bonum est: et si non, tunc stringe eam cum emplastro sedante apostema: et dimitte ipsum, neque iteres illud.	If then he returns immediately, it is good: and if not, then bind it with a plaster while the Apostema is resting: and let go of it, and do not return to it.
Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manus, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi, aut attriti.	For if it does not bear, and you cannot reduce it, after a few days, the joint remains according to its torsion: and does not hurt the weak man, unless the hand is softened, and he cannot grasp anything: then know that the nerves have been cut off, or rubbed.
Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.	So there is no skill in it, except that it is bound with a bandage close to its danger.
Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.	And perhaps it doesn't matter.
Cum ergo non redit Almahassem, tunc pone super ipsum emplastrum, quod narrauimus.	But since Al-Mahassari does not return, then put the plaster on him, which we have described.
Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitetur manus.	He should then be strung up and left for five days; afterwards he should be unstrung and left, and his hands exercised.
Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidat in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.	But if he is deprived of movement and something heavy happens to him: then make him soft with warm water and sometimes rubbing, until he becomes soft.
Â¶ De curatione dislocationis Digitorum.	The cure for dislocation of the fingers.
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30 on the head.
Quando dislocatur ex eis Digitus ad omnem partem, uel ex eis Digitus ad dorsum palmae, aut uentrem eius: tunc extende Digitum, et impelle dislocationem pollicibus tuis, donec redeat.	When a finger is dislocated completely, or one of the fingers is dislocated towards the back of the hand, or the thumb is inside it: then extend the finger and push with your thumbs until it returns to its place.
Deinde sustenta caput Digiti, et suspende ipsum uersus partem ad quam dislocatur, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	Then support the head of the finger and hang it on the side where it is dislocated for two days.
Deinde suspende eum, et extende ipsum, donec aequetur rectus in illo die suo.	Then hang him up and extend him, until he becomes straight again on his own day.
Cum ergo fuerit nox, liga ipsum secundum narrationem ipsam: et non cesses soluere ipsum in die: et exerce eum cum motu: et liga ipsum in nocte.	When it is night, bind him according to the above narrative: and do not stop from unbinding him on that day: and exercise him with movement: and bind him at night.
Fac illud diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	Make those days a few, until he is strangled.
Et similiter fac cum eo, si dislocatur ad uentrem manus: et liga eum ad partem ipsam, et fac cum eo operationem tuam primam, donec sanetur.	And also do the same with him if he is dislocated towards the palm of the hand: and bind him on that side, and perform your operation on him, until he heals.
Et similiter fac cum eo quando dislocatur ad reliquas partes.	And also do the same with him when he is dislocated in other parts.
Â¶ De curatione dislocationis Spondilium dorsi.	The cure for dislocation of the spine of the back.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 31 on the head.
Quando accidit alicui Spondilium dorsi, aut colli dislocatio completa, aut remouentur Spondiles multae a locis suis: tunc non est in ea curatio, quoniam mors properat infirmo.	When something like this happens to someone: there is no cure for it, because death approaches the sick.
Et signum illius est, quod egestio infirmi egreditur absque uoluntate, neque potest tenere eam: et multotiens mollificantur ex eo quaedam membra eius, aut duo crura eius, aut duo brachia ipsius, aut unum eorum: aut remouetur Spondilis una de loco suo.	And a sign of this is that the sick person leaves the bed of their own will, and cannot hold on to it: and often some limb of theirs weakens, or two limbs, or two arms, or one arm: or one of the spines leaves its place. Or one of the spines is dislocated from one of its places.
Multotiens enim remouetur, quod multotiens fit remotio earum ad quatuor partes.	Many times, therefore, they are removed, as many times is the removal made towards the four sides.
Illa ergo quae remouetur ad posteriora, nominatur Gibbositas.	Those which are moved towards the rear, then, are called Girdles.
Curatio uero eius est, ut consyderes tunc, si Gibbositas accidit a puericia: tunc non est in ea curatio, neque ex ea est sanatio omnino.	The cure, however, is this, that you should consider then, if Girdles occur from infancy: then there is no cure at all from it, nor is there any healing at all from it.
In illa autem quae accidit a casu, aut percussione, aut similibus illis, iam dixerunt antiqui modos curationis sermone prolixo.	But in that which occurs from accident, or blow, or similar things, the ancient doctors have long ago spoken of the methods of cure.
Cuius plurimum non redit cum proficuo.	Whose much does not return with profit.
Ego uero iam abbreuiaui ex illo, cuius parum excusat a multo eius ex propinquitate mea ad intentionem: et expositione mea qua exposui illud, et formaui instrumentum eius diuerso modo ab eo quo ostenderunt illud, et exposuerunt ipsum.	I have, however, abbreviated from that, of which little excuses its much nearness to me with regard to my intention: and my exposition of it, which I exposed, and formed a different instrument from him from which they showed it, and exhibited itself.
Dico ergo, quod in gibbositate quae accidit ab anteriori parte, non est ingenium, neque sanatio ex ea.	I say, then, that in the girdle which occurs from the front part, there is no art nor healing from it.
Et similiter in illa quae fit ad duo latera etiam.	And similarly in that which occurs on both sides also.
Et non curatur ex eis, nisi illa quae accidit in dorso proprie, cum eo quod ego narro: et est, ut extendatur infirmus super faciem suam super podium aequale prope parietem: et expandatur sub eo stramentum humidum, ut non laedatur pectus eius.	And they are not cured from them, unless that which occurs in the back own, with what I am telling you: and it is, so that he extends himself on his face on a level platform near the wall: and he expands himself under him a damp cloth, so that his chest is not injured.
Deinde ponatur lignum rectum fixum in fouea in terra, in extremitate podii, circiter caput eius: et lignum aliud circiter pedes eius in extremitate altera podii: et minister teneat lignum, et sit non firmatum in fouea.	Then a straight piece of wood is placed in the mud on the ground at the end of his foot, about his head: and another piece of wood around his feet at the other end of the other foot: and the servant holds the wood, and sits it not fixed in the mud.
Et minister alter teneat alterum.	And the other servant hold another.
Deinde inuolue super caput infirmi, et sub titillicis eius ligamentum lene, firmum: et extende extremitatem ligamenti ad lignum quod est apud caput eius: et liga ipsum in eo.	Then he turns himself about on his head, and under his chin with a soft ligature firmly: and extends the end of the ligament to the wood which is by his head: and ties it on him.
Deinde stringe ligamentum aliud supra anchas eius, et supra genua ipsius, et apud cauillas eius.	Then he tightens another ligature above his shoulders, and above his knees, and at his heels.
Deinde aggrega ligamenta omnia, et liga ea in ligno altero quod est apud pedes eius.	Then secure all the ligaments, and tie them to another piece of wood which is at his feet.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem ligni ligamentum, et non remoueantur duo ligna ex locis suis in quibus sunt fixa: uerumtamen non sint firmata, sicut diximus.	Then all the attendants should stretch out to the timber of the ligaments, and not remove the two timbers from their places where they are fixed: verily, however, they are not fixed, as we have said.
Et medicus ponat palmas suas super Spondilem cum fortitudine, donec redeat: aut ponat super eam tabulam.	And the doctor should place his palms on the spine with strength until he has recovered: or he should place it on the panel.
Deinde annectat super tabulam pedes suos, donec redeat.	Then he attaches his feet to the panel until he has recovered.
Si autem non redit per hanc curationem, tunc accipe tabulam cuius longitudo sit circiter tria brachia.	But if he does not recover with this treatment, then take a panel whose length is about three arm-lengths.
Et caua in pariete de quo diximus quod est prope infirmum, locum in quem ingrediatur extremitas tabulae.	And fasten one end of the panel to the wall that we have mentioned, which is near the sick man, at the end into which he should enter.
Deinde pone medium tabulae super Spondilem.	Then place the middle of the panel on the spine.
Et ponat pedes suos medicus super extremitatem alteram.	And the doctor should place his feet on the other end.
Et stringat bene, donec coartetur Spondilis, et redeat ad locum suum.	And tighten it well, until the spine is compressed, and return to his place.
Deinde si uis, operare cum torno quod inuoluitur cum manu tua: et est, ut figas in terram apud caput infirmi in postremo podii duo ligna, quorum longitudo sit brachii unius: et apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.	Then if you wish, operate with a turning saw that is turned by your hand: and it is, so that you fix in the ground near the head of the patient the two timbers whose length is that of an arm: and near the head of him at the other foot the two timbers.
Et sit longitudo quae est inter omne lignum palmus unus: et iam factum est in omni loco foramen, in quo currit tornum: et firmetur lignum omne in terra multum, ne moueatur omnino.	And the length that is between every piece of timber should be a palm: and there is made in every place a hole, in which the saw runs: and all the wood should be firmly fastened in the ground so that it does not move at all.
Et intromittatur lignum rotundum: et est tornum in quo reuoluitur ligamentum in duobus foraminibus duorum lignorum.	And the round timber is inserted: and there is a saw which turns around in two holes of the two timbers.
Et in extremitate eius est foramen, in quo firmatur lignum, cuius longitudo est palmus cum eo quod reuoluitur: et in duobus lignis aliis est similiter illius.	And at the end thereof is a hole, into which the timber is fastened, whose length is with that by which it turns round: and there is also such a hole in the other two timbers.
Deinde stringe ligamenta quae strinxisti in pectore infirmi torno quod est apud caput eius: et ligamenta quae strinxisti in cruribus eius in torno quod est apud pedes eius.	Then tighten the ligaments that you have tightened inside the patient's body with a turning saw that is at his head: and the ligaments that you have tightened in his legs with a turning saw that is at his feet.
Deinde stet apud omne tornum minister, qui torqueat manum suam cum licinio, cum quo reuoluitur tornum: et medicus aequet Spondilem, secundum quod diximus.	Then let the attendant of every turn stand with his hand turned by a lever, with which he turns the turn: and the doctor is equidistant from Spondile, as we have said.
Haec est forma torni, quae sequitur.	This is the form of the turning table, which follows.
Deinde postquam redit Spondilis, et aequatur locus, tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum exiccatiuum cum albumine oui.	Then, after Spondile has returned and equidistant position is reached, then it should be placed, dried plaster with albumen .
Deinde stuppam.	Then stand.
Postea pone supra emplastrum astellam ex tabula, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, aut circiter eos.	Then place above the plaster a plate from the table, whose width is three fingers wide, or about them.
Et longitudo eius quantitas quae capiat locum Gibbositatis, et super partem Spondilis sanae.	And its length the quantity which takes up the place of vibration, and on the sound side of Spondile.
Deinde ligetur cum ligamento quod diximus.	Then bind with a strap, that we have said.
Et utatur infirmus nutrimento subtili, donec sanetur.	And use delicate food for nourishment until he is healed.
Quod si remaneat quiddam eminentiae in loco in fine sanationis: tunc oportet, ut administrentur medicinae quae mollificant, et leniunt, cum administratione tabulae quam narrauimus tempore longo.	That if anything remains of excellence in the place at the end of recovery: then it should be administered medicine that softens and softens, with the table which we described during a long time.
Et iam administratur in illo lamina plumbi.	And now is administered into that lead layer.
Et quandoque accidit eminentia in postremo Spondilium dorsi: et putatur per eam dislocatio, et est illud os quod iam eminet.	And when it happens that a failure occurs at the end of the back of Spondile: and it should be considered by this dislocation, and it is the opening which it already emits.
Quare non oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei cum hac medicina: fortasse enim accidere faciet mortem.	Why it should not be made to him with this medicine: for perhaps will happen make him die.
Â¶ De curatione Anchae dislocatae.	Of the cure of a dislocated shoulder.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter 32.
Scias, quod iuncturae Anchae, et iuncturae humeri, non accidit, nisi dislocatio tantum: neque accidit eis quod accidit reliquis iuncturis ex remotione parua, et concauitate.	You should know that the shoulder joints of the arm, and the shoulder joint of the upper arm, do not occur, except by a dislocation; and they do not occur to them what occurs to other joints from a small distance, and because of their position.
Et iunctura quidem Anchae dislocatur secundum quatuor partes.	And a dislocated shoulder can be located according to four parts.
Quod est, quia dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	Because it is dislocated forward and backward.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur ad interiora: et parum dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	And much more dislocations occur inward; and little dislocations occur forward and backward.
Et curatio dislocationis eius ad interiora, est: quia quando tu coniungis crus infirmi sanum cum infirmo, est longius: et est genu eius eminens plus quam sani, et non potest infirmus duplicare pedem suum apud inguen: et est locus qui sequitur inguen apostematus apostemate calido, propterea, quod caput coxae iam peruenit illic.	And the cure of its dislocation inward is: because when you join the cruris a healthy nurse with the sick, it is longer: and his knee joint eminens is more than the healthy, and cannot make the sick double his foot near the hip: and there is a place that follows the hip that is heated, so that the head of the hip has already reached it.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad exteriora est, quod sunt accidentia eius contraria istis accidentibus.	And his sign is that which happened to him, if it was a dislocation to the outside, that are his opposite accidents from these accidents.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad anteriora, est, quia expandit crus sanum secundum complementum: uerumtamen non duplicat ipsum absque dolore qui est in genu: et si conatur ad ambulandum, non potest super illud ad anteriora: et retinetur urina eius, et apostematur inguen eius, et apud ambulationem est calcatio eius super calcaneum.	And the sign of him to whom a dislocation has occurred in front, that is because it spreads his healthy leg according to the complement: however, he does not double himself without pain who is in his knee: and if he tries to walk, he cannot go over that one to the front: and he holds back his urine, and he farts behind him, and when he walks he stumbles over his heel.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad posteriora est, ut non expandat genu, neque possit duplicare ipsum antequam duplicet inguen: et est crus eius etiam breuius altero: et inguen est mollificatum, et est caput coxae apud locum ilii.	And the sign of him to whom a dislocation has occurred in back, that is because he does not spread his leg, nor can he double himself before he doubles his knee: and it is shorter the other leg: and his knee is soft, and the head of the femur is at the place of it.
Reductio uero huius dislocationis specierum est, ut consyderes tunc, si dislocatio est uetusta, quae iam antiquatur cum habente ipsam.	The reduction of this dislocation is that you should consider then, if the dislocation is old, which has already been healed with the owner of it.
Deinde si tu administres reductionem eius, et remanet secundum dispositionem suam: tunc non est in ea curatio omnino.	Then if you administer the reduction of it, and remains after its own disposition: then is not at all cure.
Non ergo oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei penitus.	Therefore it should not be supposed that he is perfect.
In illo autem cuius dislocatio est recens, et est ex una specierum quatuor dislocationis: tunc propera ad hoc, ut uoluas iuncturam, et extendas ipsam ad interiora et ad exteriora, et moueas eam dextra et sinistra: fortasse enim redit, et non indiget alia cura.	But in that one whose dislocation is recent, and it is from the four kinds of dislocations: then draw near to this, so that you join him, and extend it towards the inside and towards the outside, and move it with your right and left: perhaps it will return, and does not need another cure.
Si autem non redit hoc modo, tunc oportet, ut praepares ministrum fortem, et extendat crus eius ab inferiori parte: aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento, quod ligetur super crus eius supra genu: et minister alius extendat manum eius desuper, ita ut intromittat manus suas sub titillicis eius.	But if it does not return in this way, then you should prepare, a strong instrument, and extend his leg from the lower part: or with his hands, or with a ligament that binds above his leg: and another minister extend his hand from above, so that he puts his hands under his toes.
Deinde stringat cum ligamento leni super radicem coxae, et teneat extremitatem ligamenti alterius.	Then tie it up with a soft ligament over the root of the pelvis, and hold the end of the other ligament.
Et sit extensio eius aut ab anteriori parte inguinis ad partem furculae, aut a posteriori ad partem dorsi.	And sit extension of it or from the anterior part of the groin to the part of the fork, or from the posterior to the part of the back.
Et sit extensio eorum omnium uice una, donec eleuetur infirmus cum corpore suo a terra, et remaneat pendens.	And let all these extend one way by turn, until you lift up the sick man with his body from the ground and let him hang.
Et haec enim species extensionis est species communis specierum quatuor.	For this reason is this kind of extension a common species of the four kinds of extensions.
Si ergo redit dislocatio cum eo quod diximus, est bonum: et si non, tunc necesse est omni speciei illud quod dicam de curatione propria.	But if this return of dislocation with it that I have said, is good, and if not, then it is necessary that all the kind that I say about cure is his own.
In reductione quidem eius propria quando dislocatio est ad interiora, oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super latus suum sanum.	In reduction however of him when dislocation is to the inside, it should be, that the sick man should lie on his sound side.
Deinde ponat ligamentum super radicem coxae, in eo quod est inter caput coxae, et locum qui est sub inguine.	Then put the ligature over the root of the hip, in so much as it is between the head of the hip, and the place which is under the groin.
Deinde extende ligamentum ad sursum a parte inguinis ad altiorem partem corporis, ad partem furculae.	Then extend the ligature to the top from the part of the groin to the higher part of the body, to the part of the fork.
Deinde accipiat minister alius fortis brachia eius, et minuat locum grossum coxae infirmae, et extendat ad exteriora extensione uehementi.	Then take another strong minister his arms, and decrease the big place of the sick hip, and extend to the outer extension strongly.
Iam enim redit ad locum suum.	For he has already returned to his place.
Et haec species est facilioris reliquis speciebus curationis, qua reducitur hoc membrum.	And this kind is easier than the remaining kinds of cure, which this member is reduced.
Si autem excusatur super te, et non obedit tibi ad introitum cum hac specie curationis omnino: tunc oportet, ut ligentur duo pedes infirmi simul cum ligamento forti, leni, super duos calcaneos, et super duo genua: et sit longitudo cuiusque a compare suo quantitatis quatuor digitorum: et sit crus infirmum extensum plus altero quantitate duorum digitorum.	But if he is excused on you, and does not obey to the entrance with this kind of cure at all: then it should be, that two nurses should bind the feet strong, weak, over the two heels, and over the two knees: and let be the length of each from his compeer quantity of four fingers: and let be the width of the sick man extended in two quantities of two fingers.
Deinde suspendatur infirmus super caput ligni, quod sit in domo: et sit longitudo eius a terra quantitas duorum brachiorum.	Then hang up the sick man on the head of the wood, which is in the house: and let be the length of him from the ground quantity of two arms.
Deinde praecipe iuueni forti, ut muniat caput coxae: et suspendatur cum infirmo inuenis alius: et impellat iuuenis alius, muniens coxam cum fortitudine, nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then command a strong youth to support the head of the hip: and hang up with the sick man in another one: and push forward another youth, supporting the hip with strength, because the return is to its place with speed.
In reditione autem eius propria, quando est dislocatio ad exteriora, oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super podium, secundum quod narrauimus in habente gibbositatem.	In reduction therefore of its own, when it is dislocation towards the outside, it is necessary that the sick man lies on his back, according to what we have narrated in having a gibbosity.
Et stringatur ligamentum super crus eius, infirmum proprie, et super pectus eius.	And tie up ligaments over its leg, the sick one himself, and over its chest.
Deinde ponantur duo ligna, unum apud pedes eius, et alterum apud caput ipsius.	Then two pieces of wood are placed, one at his feet, and another at his head.
Deinde ponatur lignum additum in medio podii, fixum bene: super quod inuoluti sint panni humidi, ut non laedat infirmum: et sit lignum inter coxas eius, ut non attrahatur ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then a piece of wood is placed in the middle of the foot, firmly fixed: over which are laid wet cloths so that they do not harm the sick man; and let the wood lie between his thighs, so that it does not attract towards the lower ones by extension.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem suam, et medicus aequet reductionem manu sua.	Then all the ministers extend to their side, and the doctor adjusts the reduction with his hand.
Si ergo obedit ad reuersionem, erit bonum.	If he therefore submits to the reduction, it is good.
Et si non, pone super ipsam tabulam, et preme ipsam, sicut diximus in gibbositate, aequaliter.	And if not, place over it the board, and press it, as we have said in the gibbosity, equally.
Verumtamen oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	However, it is necessary that the sick man lies on his healthy side.
Et quando dislocatio est ad anteriora, tunc oportet, ut extendatur crus infirmi uelociter: et est secundum hanc eandem narrationem super podium: et ponat medicus palmam manus suae dextrae super inguen infirmum.	And when the dislocation is towards the front, then it is necessary that the leg of the sick man be extended quickly: and this same narrative is told on the side: and the doctor places his right hand palm on the hip of the sick man.
Deinde coartet ipsum cum manu altera, et cum illa coartatione pone ipsum extensum ad inferiora ad partem genu.	Then he should hold him with his left hand, and with that holding place he should put him extended towards the lower side of the knee.
Et si dislocatio est ad posteriora: tunc non oportet, ut extendatur infirmus ad inferiora, et sit eleuatus super terram: imo oportet, ut sit positus super rem duram, sicut oportet, ut fit etiam si dislocatur ancha eius ad exteriora, secundum illud quod diximus de accubitu eius super duas anchas: et est super faciem eius, et ligamenta extensa: secundum quod diximus nuper.	And if the dislocation is towards the back: then it is not necessary that the sick man be extended towards the lower side, and that he sit raised on the ground: but it is necessary that he be placed on a hard thing, as also it is necessary for him who dislocates his thigh towards the outside, according to what we said about his lying on two thighs: and let him be face up, and the ligaments extended: according to what we have just said.
Et oportet, ut administretur compressio cum tabula etiam super locum ad quem egreditur iunctura, cum completur reductio secundum quod oportet.	And it is necessary that the compression with the board be administered also to the place from which the joint departs, when the reduction has been completed, according to what is necessary.
Et signum reditionis eius non occultatur tibi: et est, ut extendas duo crura infirmi: et quando uides ea aequalia, et infirmus stringit crus suum, et expandit ipsum absque excusatione: tunc scias, quia iam redit membrum, secundum quod oportet: tunc coniunge duas coxas, et pone emplastrum, et stringe cum imemati, id est, rota: ita, ut non moueatur ancha ad aliquam partium: et adhaereat infirmus quieti tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	And the sign of his recovery shall not be hidden from you: and this is, that you stretch out two legs of the patient; and when you see them equal, and the sick man ties up his leg, and extends himself without excuse: then know that now the limb has returned, as it should: then join the two hips together, and put on a splint, and bind with bandages, that is, rotate: so that its width does not move to any part: and let the sick man rest for three or four days.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et emplastrum, et compara crus cum altero: tunc si uides ea aequalia in statu, tunc scias, quod dislocatio iam firmata est: absolue ergo infirmum ad ambulandum.	Then loosen the ligaments, and the splint, and compare the legs together: then if you see them equal in position, then know that the dislocation is now set: so let the sick person walk.
Et si uides aliquid mollificationis: tunc redi, et emplastra illud, et stringe illud secundum stricturam tuam primam: et dimitte illud etiam tribus diebus.	And if you see any softening: then go back, and put on the splint, and bind it according to your first order: and let him also be at rest for three days.
Deinde solue illud et fac ipsum tardare in ambulatione super utrumque aliquot diebus, donec confortetur bene.	Then loose that, and let the patient walk a little on each side for a few days, until he is well comforted.
Â¶ De dislocationis Genu.	Of the dislocation of the knee joint.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter XXXIII.
Genu dislocatur secundum tres modos.	The knee may be dislocated three ways.
Dislocatur ad exteriora, ad interiora, et ad inferiora, scilicet ad posteriora.	By the outward, inward, and downward way, that is to say, by the rearward.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora.	And it does not dislocate forward.
Et signum dislocationis eius, est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut applicet crus suum ad coxam suam.	And the sign of the dislocation is, that you command the sick person to apply his leg to his hip.
Si autem non adhaeret cum coxa: tunc scias, quod Genu est dislocatum.	If he does not apply it to the hip: then know that the knee joint has been dislocated.
Et restauratio omnium modorum dislocationis eius est, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum, ita ut iam extendat crus suum si potest super illud, et adhaeret dorsum tuum ad faciem eius: et pone pedem eius inter pedes tuos.	And the restoration of all kinds of dislocation is, that you let the sick person sit upright, so that he may extend his leg over it if he can, and rest his back against your chest: and put his foot between your feet.
Deinde adhaerere fac Genu eius cum palmis tuis, et recta eas inter digitos tuos super Genu eius.	Then you should fasten the knee of the patient to your palm, and make them straight with your fingers over the knee joint.
Deinde applica cum palma tua duo latera Genu eius cum fortitudine.	Then apply with your palm two sides of his genitals with strength.
Et minister alius extendat pedem eius, donec redeat Genu ad locum suum.	And another minister extends his foot, until he returns to his place the genu.
Et signum reditionis est, ut adhaereat crus cum coxa in lenitate, non laboriose.	And the sign of the restoration is that it adheres to the thigh with the hip in a gentle way, not laboriously.
Deinde emplastra ipsum, et adhaerere fac crus cum coxa.	Then bind him up, and adhere the thigh to the hip.
Deinde liga ea simul cum uitta tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then bind them together with sutures of twine for days, or four.
Deinde solue ea.	Then dissolve them.
Et non utatur infirmus ambulatione aliquot diebus, donec sanetur.	And do not let the patient walk for a few days, until he is healed.
Si autem recusatur tibi reductio eius, tunc administra extensionem fortem cum ligamentis, quorum praecessit narratio in curatione anchae, donec redeat.

Â¶ De curatione dislocationis Calcanei.	The cure of dislocation of the calcaneus.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter IIII.
Calcaneus quandoque remouetur remotione parua, et quandoque dislocatur secundum complementum.	The calcaneus is sometimes reduced with a small movement, and sometimes dislocated after the second compliment.
Et dislocatio eius fit, aut ad interiora, aut ad exteriora.	And the dislocation of it is done, or towards the inside, or towards the outside.
Et signum dislocationis eius est, quod uides Calcaneum inflatum, procedentem ad partem ad quam dislocatur.	And the sign of dislocation of it is that you see the calcaneus swollen, proceeding to the side to which it is dislocated.
Curatio autem remotionis eius, est facilis reditionis: et est, ut extendatur cum facilitate cum manibus, et aequetur, donec redeat.	But the cure of the reduction of it is easy; and is, that he be extended with ease with hands, and be smoothed out, until it returns to its place.
In curatione autem eius quando dislocatur secundum complementum, oportet, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum: et teneat ipsum minister fortis ualde a posteriori parte dorsi eius, in medio ipsius.	In the cure of him when it is dislocated after the second compliment, you should make the patient sit straight up: and hold him by a strong minister strongly from the back part of his waist, in the middle of it.
Deinde tene tu cum manu tua dextra pedem eius a superiori parte eius, et cum manu tua sinistra ab inferiori parte pedis eius loco cauillae.	Then hold with your right hand your foot from the upper part of it, and with your left hand from the lower part of the foot where the heel is.
Deinde trahe pedem ad tecum manu tua dextra.	Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand.
Deinde cum sinistra duabus uicibus.	Then with two fingers of your left hand.
Deinde extende cum sinistra, et impelle pectus pedis cum dextra uersus crus absque labore.	Then extend with ease, and push the chest of the foot towards the hip without labor.
Fac illud bis, sicut narrauimus.	Do this twice, as we have narrated it.
Deinde impelle pectus pedis ad crus in uice tertia, et tu trahis cauillam.	Then press the chest of the foot to the leg in the third place, and you tear the joint.
Si ergo redit in uice una, aut in duabus secundum hunc modum, et uides pedem aequatum, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera operationem super ipsum: quoniam ipse redit.	If then he returns in one juice, or in two the second way, and you see the foot even, it is good: and if not, then repeat the operation on himself: for he will return again.
Si autem prohibetur tibi reductio eius cum eo quod narrauimus: tunc fac iacere infirmum super dorsum suum super terram, et fige paxillum in terra firmatum ualde, ut cadat inter coxas eius: et tu iam inuoluisti super ipsum pannum, ut non laedat infirmum.	If however it is forbidden to you the reduction with him that we have described: then make him lie on his back on the ground, and fasten the splint firmly on the ground so that it falls between his thighs: and you have already wound the cloth around him so that it does not hurt the sick.
Deinde accipiat minister coxam eius: postea extendat minister alter pedem, aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento quod liget super collum pedis.	Then let the servant take the foot of him: then the other servant extends the leg, or with his hands, or with a bandage that binds over the neck of the foot.
Deinde extendat omnis minister contra extensionem comparis sui: et paxillus sit stans inter duas coxas infirmi retinens eum, ut non attrahatur corpus eius ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then let all the servants extend against the extension of their own: and the splint be standing between the two thighs of the nurse while she holds it, so that his body is not pulled towards the lower part by the extension.
Deinde aequet medicus dislocationem manibus suis, et minister alter teneat crus sanum ad inferiora.	Then let the doctor adjust the dislocation with his hands, and the other servant hold the leg healthy from below.
Nam dislocatio redit cum uelocitate.	For the dislocation returns with velocity.
Quando ergo redit dislocatio, et declaratur tibi sanitas reditionis eius: tunc pone emplastrum et stuppam, et stringe ipsam cum ligamentis firmiter, et liga pedem cum ligamento ad crus.	When however the dislocation returns, and it is declared to you that the return of it is healthy: then put on a splint and padding, and tighten it with bandages firmly, and tie the foot to the leg with a bandage.
Et oportet, ut caueas uel timeas de neruis, qui sunt supra calcaneum posterius, ut non sit ligamentum super eos uehemens, et laedat eos.	And it is necessary that you should beware and fear the nerves that are above the heel at the back, so that the bandage does not press on them painfully, and hurts them.
Deinde dimitte ipsum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then let go of him after two days, or three.
Quod si mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum: deinde solue ipsum in die tertio, aut quarto: et prohibe infirmum ab ambulatione quadraginta diebus.	If however the bandage becomes soft, tighten him up: then let go of him in a third or fourth day: and forbid the sick one from walking for forty days.
Si uero conatur ambulare ante illud spacium, non fit securitas quin dissoluatur super ipsum dislocatio, et corrumpatur, et non recipiat post illud curationem.	If however he tries to walk before that space, there is no security except that the dislocation be dissolved on him, and it is corrupted, and does not receive after that cure.
Quod si accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc oportet, ut administres in sedatione eius illud, in quo praecessit narratio nostra in alio loco ex curatione, et embrocationem, donec remoueatur.	If it happens that he has a hot apostema: then you should give him sedatives and embrocations until it goes away.
Â¶ De dislocatione Digitorum pedis, et cura.	On the dislocation of fingers of the foot, and their treatment.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter 25. On the dislocation of fingers of the foot
Oportet, ut aequetur quod dislocatur ex eis cum extensione pauca absque labore: et illud quidem non est difficile, imo est facile.	It should be treated with little extension without effort; and this is not difficult, indeed it is easy.
Si autem dislocatio est in quibusdam nodis dorsi pedis: tunc oportet, ut faciat sedere infirmus pedem suum super locum aequalem terrae, aut super tabulam: et est stans sicut ambulans.	If the dislocation is in the toes of the back of the foot: then he should make the injured foot stand on an equal place of the ground, or on a board: and it is as steady as when walking.
Deinde tu sta, et pone pedem tuum super illud quod eminet ex illis iuncturis.	Then you shall stand, and put your foot upon that which protrudes from them, the joint.
Deinde calca illud cum pede tuo cum uirtute, donec redeat, et uideas ipsum iam aequatum, et non appareat in loco eminentia.	Then step on it with your foot with force, until it turns, and does not appear to be out of place, and does not project in the spot.

Â¶ De speciebus dislocationis cum uulnere uel fractura.	On the species of dislocation with a sprain or fracture.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter 36. On the species of dislocation with a sp
Quando accidit aliquid ex illo, et conaris curationem eius, et ipsius restaurationem, multotiens succedit mors: et propter illud non oportet, ut praesumat super curationem eius, quod est huiusmodi, nisi qui est prudens in arte longi usus, misericors, pius, tardus, non audax, neque praesumptuosus: et ut utatur in incaeptionce medicinis quae sedant apostemata calida tantum: et dimittat infirmum diuino iudicio.	When something of this kind has happened, and he is inclined to the care of it, and to its restoration; death often succeeds many times, and therefore it is not necessary to be hasty in his treatment, which is of this kind, unless he is prudent in the art, compassionate, merciful, slow, not brave, nor presumptuous: and that he uses in the beginning of medicines which sedate hot poultices only: and lets the sick man rest by divine judgment.
Nisi uideas, aut speras salutem a perditione cum lenitate aegritudinis, et in quo apparet quiddam spei.	Except you hope for salvation from destruction with gentleness of sickness, and in which there appears some hope.
Conare ergo reductionem eius statim in principio rei, antequam accidat apostema calidum.	Therefore, he must begin the reduction immediately at the start of the affair, before the appearance of the apoplexy [i.e., fever].
Si ergo redit membrum, secundum quod uolumus, tunc administra regimen quod sedat apostema: et cura uulnus cum eo quod conuenit ei ex unguentis desiccatiuis.	If then the limb returns [to health], according to what we have ordered, then administer the treatment that calms down the apoplexy: and care for the wound with the same thing that suits him when it comes out of the dried ointment.
Quod si dislocatio est cum fractura, et accidunt in osse satagiae separatae, tunc conare ablationem earum, et fac in illo quod diximus in aegritudinibus simplicibus ex eo quod praecessit in locis earum.	That if the dislocation is with a fracture and happen in the bone of the separated places, then try to remove them, and do in it what we said in the simple illnesses from because it preceded in those places.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, et custodi teipsum ab introitu in uiam timoris: secundum quod praecessit praedicatio mea tibi.	And be careful according to your ability, and guard yourself from the entrance into a path of fear: according to my prediction for you.
Nam illud est melius tibi apud Creatorem tuum, et magis permanens ad gloriam tuam, et magis saluum tuo corpori apud illos in tuo tempore.	For that is better for you with your Creator, and more enduring to your glory, and more safe to your body there with them at that time.
