Of the swelling that cannot mature/suppurate/come to a head
When someone has an illness that is called "adubelati", and it is slow to mature/suppurate/come to a head either because of the excess matter it produces or because of the patient's age when he is decrepit (that is to say, too old) and he has little blood, or because of the weather/season;
and you want to hasten its maturation/suppuration:
then cauterize around it with many small cauteries by pricking/puncturing;
afterwards leave it like that.
For it will hasten to mature/suppurate/come to a head.
And if you want to pierce it completely with the cautery, then heat the cautery which has this shape:
And place your hand in the middle of this disease called “adubelati” until the cautery has pierced the core, and let the cautery be such that the patient feels it from the outside in such a way that the flow of pus is facilitated/released. 
Afterwards treat it until it is completely healed.
