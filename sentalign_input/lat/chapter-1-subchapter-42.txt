On cauterization for back pain.
Chapter 44.
Sometimes pain occurs in the back from many causes, either from an accident, or from an impact, or excessive evacuation, and similar things, from the infusion of cold and moist matter: and in fact, cauterization is only used in this specific case, which results from the infusion of cold matter.
Therefore, after evacuating the patient with stinking pills, and similar treatments, three lines should be made on the back, where the pain is, according to the width of the affected area itself, marking five cauterizations on each line with ink, or more according to the patientâ€™s ability to endure it: and the cauterization is to be performed with a pointed cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize with three cauteries, or four, with the middle key-shaped cautery, in this manner.
