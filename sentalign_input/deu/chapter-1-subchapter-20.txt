Chapter Twenty:
On the Cauterization of Teeth and Softening of the Gums.
When the gums are softened by moisture and the teeth are loose, and treatment with medicine does not help, rest the patient's head on your knee, and heat the cautery. The form of the cautery should be such that you place the cannula over the tooth and insert the heated cautery quickly, holding it until the patient feels the heat reach the root of the tooth.
Then remove your hand and repeat the cauterization a few times as needed.
Then the patient should fill their mouth with salt water, hold it for an hour, and then spit it out. This will firm the loose tooth, tighten the softened gums, and dry out the moisture.
