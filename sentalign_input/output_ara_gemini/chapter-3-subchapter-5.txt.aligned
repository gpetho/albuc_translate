The clavicle is most often fractured from the front at the end of the shoulder.	The collar-bone is very often broken from the end of the humerus anteriorly, and the fracture of it may be in one of three ways.	0.6285497
Its fracture takes one of three forms: either it breaks and splits in two without producing fragments, which is the easiest to reduce; or fragments occur in the fracture, which is more difficult to reduce; or the fracture is accompanied by a wound.	It may be broken and separated into two without splintering; this is the easiest to repair. Or else splintering occurs, which is most difficult to repair. Or it is a compound fracture.	0.7764708
The procedure in it, if the fracture is without a wound, is to bring two assistants, one of whom stabilizes the arm next to the fractured clavicle and the other extends the neck toward the other side.	When it is a simple fracture the operation involves having two assistants present; one of them to hold steady the arm adjacent to the fractured clavicle, and the other to stretch the neck in the opposite direction.	0.8331566
Then you straighten the fracture with your fingers until its shape becomes as it should be, and there is no protrusion or curvature in it.	Then level the fracture with your fingers until it is reduced to its proper form and there is neither prominence nor concavity.	0.85406077
If you need more extension, it is appropriate to place a ball of rags or wool under the patient's armpit, its size being according to your need, and you extend and raise the clavicle and press the ball with your hand until the fracture is straightened as it should be.	If there is need of still greater extension, place in the armpit of the patient a ball of cloth or wool made to a suitable size; and stretch and lift up the clavicle and squeeze the roll with your hand until the fracture is set in the proper way.	0.89670545
If you are unable to pull the end of the clavicle outward because it has gone deep, it is appropriate for the patient to lie on his back and a medium-sized pillow be placed under his shoulder, and the assistant presses his shoulder downward until the clavicle bone that is deep rises up, then at that time, fix the fracture and straighten it with your fingers	If you are unable to draw the extremity of the clavicle outwards on account of its being depressed, the patient will have to lie on his back and there must be put under his shoulder a medium-sized bolster. The assistant is to press the shoulder down until the depressed collar bone is elevated, and then you can set the fracture and even it out with your fingers.	0.9013604
If you feel that a fragment of the clavicle has broken and has started to move, it is appropriate to make an incision over it and remove that fragment gently.	If you feel a splinter separated from the clavicle and movable, you must cut down upon the splinter and gently remove it.	0.80379057
If the fragment is trapped in the bone, be clever in cutting it with one of the cutters that you have prepared for this purpose, after the instrument that protects the peritoneum, which is an instrument made of wood or iron, has been placed under the clavicle, and this is its image:	If the splinter sticks to the bone, you must contrive to cut it with one of the chisels you have prepared for that, having first put beneath the clavicle the instrument to protect the membrane; an instrument made of wood or iron, of which this is the figure.	0.7779692
It resembles a spoon without a curvature, its width depending on the size of the bone you need, and its length depending also on what allows you to work, and let it have two ends, as you see, one end wider and the other narrower.	It resembles a spoon but without a hollow. It should be as broad as you need, having regard to the size of the bone, and as long as you can use at operation. As you see, it should be provided with one wide and one narrow extremity.	0.8258774
If the tear in the wound that you made when removing the bone fragment is wide, and you are safe from a hot swelling, bring together the lips of the wound with stitches.	If the opening you made when you extracted the splinter of bone be wide and you feel safe against an abscess, suture the edges together.	0.7901886
And if the tear is small, or you fear a hot swelling, pack the wound with bandages and pads according to the extent of the wound's opening.	But if the opening be small or you fear an abscess, pack the wound with material and pads proportional to the opening.	0.7854061
If a hot swelling appears, soak the bandage in rose oil and vinegar or wine, and apply it on it.	If an abscess occur, soak the dressing with oil of roses and vinegar or wine and apply.	0.894534
And the key to it all is that the splint does not move from the broken bone, and therefore it is necessary that you check the patient every day, so whenever the bandage loosens and you see that the splint has moved, fix that and tighten the bandage.	The whole point is that the splint should not slip from over the fracture; so you should examine the patient every day, and whenever the bandage has loosened and you see the splint has shifted, then put it right and tighten the bandage.	0.89423895
Then make the patient sleep on his back and put a small pillow under his armpit when he sleeps at night so that his arm is raised from his side, so the clavicle fracture is raised by raising the shoulder, or tie his arm to his neck.	Make the patient sleep lying on his back, and at night when he is asleep place a small bolster under the axilla so as to raise his arm from his side, for with the raising of the humerus the fracture of the clavicle will be elevated. Or bind his arm to his neck.	0.88585943
And do not loosen the bandage unless there is an incident in the area, such as itching or swelling, until twelve days.	Do not loosen the bandage for twelve days unless there arise at the place any pruritus or swelling.	0.81524885
Then renew the poultice if you see reason for that, and repeat the tightening, and leave it until the clavicle fracture heals and sets.	Then renew the plaster if you think it necessary, and bandage again and leave until the fracture of the collar-bone is set and knits.	0.77631664
And it becomes stronger and firmer than that in twenty-eight days, and it may be in some people in less than that.	The majority of these cases are firm and strong in twenty-eight days, though in some people it takes less.	0.72061837
