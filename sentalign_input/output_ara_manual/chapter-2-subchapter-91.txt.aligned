On the Excision of a Varicose Vein.	On the extraction of the Medina vein.	0.63887244
This vein develops in the legs in hot countries like the Hejaz and the lands of the Arabs, and in hot, barren countries of little fertility, and sometimes it develops in other places of the body besides the legs, and it is generated by putrefaction that occurs under the skin.	This kind of vein occurs in the leg in hot countries such as the Hejaz and the lands of the Arabs and in hot arid infertile countries. It also often occurs in other parts of the body beside the legs.	0.87761885
Just as it occurs inside living bodies, worms, pumpkin rot, and worms generated between the skin and flesh. And the sign of the beginning of the occurrence of this vein is that a severe inflammation occurs in the leg, then the place swells up, then the vein begins to emerge from the place of that swelling.	The origin of it is a corruption taking place beneath the skin in the same way that round-worms and worms and gourd-worms arise in the inward parts of the body; also the worms that are generated between the skin and the flesh. The sign of the beginning of the occurrence of this vein is a violent inflammation in the leg; then the place swells up and blisters; then the vein begins to extrude at the blistered place as if it were a plant-stem or an animal.	0.83875924
As if it were the root of a plant or animal, so when its tip appears, it should be wrapped around a small piece of lead weighing from one dirham to two, and tied, and the lead left hanging from the leg.	When its extremity has appeared it should be wound and tied round a little piece of lead, from one to two drachms in weight, which you leave hanging from the leg.	0.7306684
And whenever something comes out of it, you wrap it in the lead and tie it. If it becomes very long, cut off some of it and wrap the rest, and do not cut it off from its root before it all comes out, because if you cut it, it will contract and enter the flesh, so it causes swelling and putrefaction in the place, and a bad ulcer.	Then as fast as any of it issues from the leg, wrap it in the lead, and if there be plenty of it cut off part and tie the rest of it; do not cut it right down until it has all come out; for if you cut it right down it will contract and draw back into the flesh and produce at the place an abscess and suppuration and a bad ulcer.	0.8627767
Therefore, it should be managed and pulled little by little until it comes out completely and nothing of it remains in the body. And from this vein in some people may come out what is five or ten spans in length.	Therefore it should be treated gently, and drawn out slowly until the very extremity of it emerges and not the least bit of it remains in the body. In some cases the vein comes out five or ten spans in length; indeed I have heard of one twenty spans long that came out from a certain man.	0.8619859
And I have heard that it came out of a man twenty spans. If it breaks for you while you are treating it, insert a probe into its hole and pack it with a long packing along with the body until all the matter in it is emptied, and try to purify the place with medications for days.	If it breaks during your treatment of it, then pass a probe into the hole and open it up with a long incision longitudinally, until all the contained matter is evacuated; and try to make the place suppurate with medicines for a few days, then treat as an abscess.	0.72783744
Then treat it with the treatment for swellings. This vein may have many branches, especially if it appears in the joint of the leg or in the leg itself, so it develops many openings, and a branch emerges from each opening, so treat it as we mentioned in the division and with what preceded.	Sometimes also this vein is found branching, especially when it appears at the joint of the foot or on the foot itself; and in this case there are many openings and a branch comes out of each. The treatment is as mentioned above in the section.	0.7933881
