O, son, since I have completed for you this book, which is the last of the science of medicine,  by its completion I have reached its end, and through its expositions and declarations, it seems to me that I should fulfill my duty to you with this treatise, which is a part of the operation with the hand, that is, surgery.
Because the operation with the hand is almost completely absent in our region and in our time, to the point that the knowledge of it is greatly diminished and its vestiges are lost; and there remains of it only some small descriptions in the books of the Ancients, which are mostly altered and have led to errors and hesitation, so that their intentions are obscured and their strength and art are weakened.
And it seems to me that I should revive it by the ordering of this treatise, following the path of exposition, declaration, and abbreviation; and so that it comes with the forms of the cautery irons and other instruments of the work, as may be by addition of the explanation and by preparation for it, which is a necessary matter.
But the reason why a skilled artisan with his hand is not found in our time is that the art of medicine is long, and its practitioner must first be trained in the science of anatomy, which Galen mastered, so that he knows the arrangement of the members and their forms, and their connection and separation; and he should have knowledge of the bones, nerves, and muscles, and their number, and their arrangement; and of the pulsating and quiet veins, and the places of their origin.
And for this reason Hippocrates says that with one name much is said, but little in the work, and especially in the art of the hand.
But we have already spoken of this at the beginning of this book; for whoever is not knowledgeable of what we have said about anatomy is not exempt from falling into error, by which men will die, as I have seen many of them, because some are trained in this science and practice it without knowledge and without experience.
For I saw a foolish and unskilled physician incise a scrofulous abscess in the neck of a woman, and he incised some arteries of the neck, so that a great deal of blood flowed until the woman fell dead in his hands.
And I saw another physician who undertook to remove a stone from a man who had grown old, and the stone was large, and he came to him and extracted that stone with a piece of the bladder, so that that man died on the third day.
And I was called to extract it, and I saw that because of the size of the stone and the condition of the patient I knew that he would die.
And I saw another physician who received a stipend from a duke of our land for surgery, and it happened that a black slave who had a fracture in his thigh came to him; and the physician, through his ignorance, extracted the fracture, above the wound, with cushions and splints with strong constriction, and did not allow the wound to breathe [to heal properly].
And then he unbound it according to his desires, and then he bound it again, and then he left it for some days and ordered that we not unbind the bandage; and it remained so until the thigh and foot became suppurated, and it came to ruin/destruction [the leg was lost].
And I was called to him, and I prepared to unbind the bandage, and tranquility was achieved and thus a lessening of his pains.
But however, corruption was already confirmed in the limb, so that I could not restrain it, and the corruption did not cease to spread in the limb until the patient perished.
And I saw another physician who perforated a cancerous abscess, and it was ulcerated for several days, until the malignancy of it was magnified by its lord [the condition worsened significantly].
The reason is that a hot cancer is pure melancholic humor; therefore, it should not be approached with iron at all, but should be in a limb which suffers that it is completely stopped/obstructed.
And for that reason, sons, it is necessary for you that the operation by hand be divided into two parts: that is, into an operation which is associated with health, and into a work in which there is danger in the most favorable conditions.
And I have already explained this in every part of this book where operations occur that involve error and fear; therefore it is necessary for you to observe this and to avoid that, so that fools do not find a way to speak and dishonor you.
Therefore, take up your instruments with diligence and with God's protection, and treat your patients with happiness and firmness.
And use the best method, by the grace of God, leading to health and laudable success, and avoid terrible illnesses of difficult healing, and keep your instruments from that which makes you fear, so that hesitation in your faith and in your name does not overcome you: for it is more conducive to your glory, and higher in the world and behind your holiness.
Galen already said in some of his admonitions: Do not treat a bad illness, lest you be called a bad physician.
And I have divided this book into three chapters.
Begins the division of the book, and first of the first part. The first chapter deals with the head down to the feet, the forms of instruments and the tools of cauterization, and what is necessary in the operation.
The division of the second part. The second chapter, of suction and perforation, and of cupping glasses, and of wounds, and of the extraction of arrows and similar things, all chaptered and ordered according to the forms of the instruments.
The third chapter, of restoration and dislocation, and of the treatment of sprains and similar things; a chapter ordered from head to foot, and of the forms of the instruments.
It is necessary that I speak of the benefits of this cautery and of its harms, and in what constitution cautery is prohibited.
Therefore I say that the discourse on the benefits of cautery and its harms is a long and prolix discourse, and subtle in its science, and secretly hidden; and many wise men have already spoken of it, and they have disagreed about it, and a little of their discourse suffices for me, I fear prolixity.
And therefore I say that cautery benefits all complexions universally, whether with matter or without matter, except for two complexions, which are cold complexions without matter.
In the hot and dry complexion with matter, there is disagreement; for some say that cautery is beneficial to it, and others say the contrary, that cautery is not suitable for an illness which is characterized by heat and dryness, because the nature of fire is heat and dryness, and it is unsuitable that a hot and dry illness should be healed with that which is hot and dry.
And I refute him who says the contrary, that benefit is done by cautery in every hot and dry illness that occurs in the bodies of men, for when you compare the body of a man and its humors to the complexion of fire, you find the body of man cold.
And I say, in support of this argument, that experience has revealed this to me on several occasions.
However, it is not fitting that this should come from someone who has already been exhausted and exercised in the chapter on cautery through previous practice, and has known the diversity of the complexions of men and the disposition of illnesses within themselves, and the causes of those illnesses, and their accidents, and the span of time of those illnesses.
But in the other complexions, there is no fear for you, and especially in cold and humid illnesses, for all physicians have agreed on those, and are not in disagreement about the benefit of cautery in them.
And know, sons, that the secret of healing by cautery with fire, and its goodness, is superior to cautery with a burning medicine, because fire is simple, its action does not reach beyond the member which is cauterized, and does not harm another member adjacent to it except with slight harm.
But the action of burning medicine reaches even those members which are distant from it, and easily brings about in the member an illness difficult to cure and easily causes death.
But fire, by its sublimity and the goodness of its substance, does not do this except that it flows away. And it is known to us through experiment and long service of study in the art concerning the truth of the causes; and therefore I am excused from the length of the discourse. And if it were not that it is not permissible to reveal to you in this brief writing my secret concerning fire, and the quality of its operation in bodies, and its expulsion by which it expels illnesses, with a philosophical demonstrative discourse, which would be difficult for your minds.
And know, sons, that they disagree about the time in which it is convenient to perform cautery, and they consider springtime the best time.
And I say that cautery is convenient at all times, because the harm caused by the accidental time is submerged in the benefit of that which is achieved with cautery, and especially if the cautery is for pains or necessary pains, strong and urgent, which do not tolerate delay, because it is feared that greater harm will come than the slight harm introduced by the time.
And this does not occur to you, O sons, this is not considered except by the vulgar people and foolish physicians, that is, that for that illness which is healed by cautery there is no remission at all times, and they assume that consequence.
And the cause is not at all as they think for that reason, because cautery is nothing other than a kind of medicine which alters the complexion and dries the humors which are the cause of the pains.
But however, cautery is superfluous over medicine because of the speed of its effectiveness and the power of its operation and the greatness of its lord (or master).
And it is possible that his illness returns at some time, according to the complexion of the patient and the location of his illness, and his strength, and that which is prepared in his body from the aggregation of superfluities in him, and that which has reached him in his acquisition of food and similar causes; unless the illness in which cautery is administered is a subtle illness in a member with few superfluities and humors, such as cautery of a tooth for pain and similar to that, it is possible that that pain does not return to him, but this happens rarely.
And a more common saying is that cautery is the last resort of medicine, and this is a true saying, not in the sense that they understand it, for they believe that it is not a cure that benefits with medicine or with anything besides cautery.
And the reason is contrary to that; and the intention that cautery is the last resort of medicine is only when we administer methods of cure in certain illnesses, and those medicines do not help, and then at the end of the process, one administers cautery, and it benefits that condition. And therefore from here it is clear that cautery is the last resort of medicine, not according to the understanding of the common people and many foolish physicians.
And the ancients said that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron, and they did not say this except for the preciousness of gold and the excellence of its substance.
And they said that the place of cautery does not scar, although this is not entirely true, for I have already proven this and found that it does not do so except in some bodies but not others, and cautery with it is good and better than with iron, as they said; however, when you do cautery with fire with gold, it is not clear to you, because it is ignited according to the quantity you want due to the hardness of the gold, and because it prepares to receive cold; and if you apply fire to it, the gold melts from the fire, and some flakes fall into the fire so that the artisan is bothered by this.
And for this reason, cautery with iron is done more easily and more appropriately for the right operation.
And I have already ordered this chapter on cautery according to chapters, and I have ordered those from the head down to the feet, so that I may easily give the enquirer what he wants.
The first chapter.
This cauterization counteracts the humidity and coldness affecting the brain, the accidents of which are twofold:  a cause of excessive and profuse rheumatic flux, called coryza, flowing from the head to the parts of the eyes and ears; much sleepiness; toothache; throat pain; and universally all illnesses that come from coldness, such as paralysis, sudden illness, apoplexy, and similar diseases.
The method of this cauterization is this: first, order the patient to be evacuated with a purgative medicine, purifying the head, for three or four nights, according to the patient's strength, age, and constitution.
Then order him to shave his head with a razor, and then have him sit between your hands on a low bench and place his hands on his feet.
Then place the root of your palm against the area above the root of the nose, between his eyes. However, when your middle finger has reached that place, mark the spot with a pen, and then ignite the olive-shaped cautery, of which this is the form:
Then place it on the spot marked with the pen, in such a way that it descends, your hand being gradually tightened, and you turn it.
Then lift your hand slightly and observe the area, and if you see some quantity of the head of the bone uncovered, like the size of a grain of barley, then raise your hand; and if not, return your hand with that iron, or with another of them if it is cooled, until that which I have told you is seen of the bone.
Then take a little salt and dissolve it on the area and leave it for three days.
Then place on it cotton soaked in wine and leave it there until the burn scab is destroyed. Then treat the area with tetrafarmicon ointment until it is healed.
And it is said that when the wound remains open, it is better to leave the arm that way, because it is better and more beneficial.
And some of them say that the elbow should be cauterized to the bone, and the cautery should be held there until some part of the bone's surface is hardened/burned.
Then scrape away what has been burned from the bone, and then let it be treated/healed.
And others say that with the cautery, penetrate to the back, until it first deeply penetrates the bone, until the bone is charred, and this is the method for a small alphecat (likely referring to a specific type of wound or ulcer): And they believe that vapors from the head exhale from that place.
And let the wound be kept open for a long time, and then let it be healed until it is consolidated/closed.
But I have not seen these two types of cautery at all, except in some men, as a way of fear; and leave that, it seems to me, better is health when it is; because the head is weakened by the solution of its continuity, as we have testified in the other members, and especially when the patient's head is of a fragile nature.
And the first type of cautery is safer and better in my opinion; and use that and work with that for health.
Chapter Two.
Of the cautery of the head.
When chronic and prolonged pain occurs in the whole head and this is prolonged in the patient, and he uses leeches and cupping and head purges and plasters and poultices and cauteries and ointments and the like, and especially if he has already been cauterized with a cautery which we have recounted and none of those things benefits him, then consider whether the patient's head is of strong constitution by nature; and if it is not fragile and finds much great cold, then cauterize that with another cautery a little below that one. And then cauterize that above the horn of his head with a cautery until the scab is parted. Incise the scab and let the bone be uncovered to the extent we have recounted, and cauterize that with a cautery in the rear part of the head in the place which is called the vessel — and this is the place where a cupping glass is placed. And lighten your hand in this, and do not uncover the bone, for the patient thereby finds much great pain, different from the pain of all other cauterizations of the head.
And I would say this cautery in its place, because it is necessary that the cautery with which the horns of the head and the occiput are cauterized is a more subtle cautery than that with which the middle part of the head is cauterized; and this is its form.
Chapter Three.
Concerning the cauterization of recent (or non-chronic) migraine.
When a sharp pain occurs in the part of the head, or a spreading pain within the eye, let the head be evacuated with purifying medicines, and let the other treatment be administered, which I have described in the sections on diseases; and if all this does not help, then cauterization there is done in two ways: either cauterization with a sharp burning medicine, or with iron.
But cauterization with a burning medicine is that you take a clove of garlic, and peel it and cut off the ends from both sides. Then incise the location of the pain in the temple with a lancet until a place is made there under the skin, until it is hidden.
Then bind it tightly with a compress for continuous constriction, and leave it for the space of three hours; and then unbind it and remove the garlic, and leave the wound for two or three days, and then place on it cotton soaked in vinegar until the place becomes inflamed.
And then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if you wish, do this with some burning medicines which I have written in the twelfth treatise on burning medicines.
But cauterization with iron in this manner: ignite the cautery, of which this is the form:
and it is called *claus clavilhs* (likely a description of a specific cautery tool), because its head is like the shape of a nail, in which there is a certain curvature, and in the middle of it is a small eminence.
And then place it on the location of the pain, and hold your hand — so that the burning, which is below, is not hardened — and rotate the iron little by little with speed.
And if the quantity of what is burned by the specific heat is about half of it, and lift your hand so that the artery which is beneath is not burned, so that there is no flow of blood.
And then soak cotton in salt water and place that on the location, and leave it for three days; and then place cotton moistened with butter, and then cure with ointment until it is healed.
And if you wish, cauterize with the tip of a surgical instrument like a cautery, and be careful not to cut an artery in this specific, not-ancient, type of headache (migraine).
Chapter four.
Concerning the cauterization of chronic migraine.
When you treat migraine with what we have said in the preceding treatment, and what we have said in the divisions of illnesses, and the treatment does not help, and sometimes the illness is not sufficiently addressed by what we have said about the first cautery with medicine or the cautery with fire, then it is necessary that you heat the cauterizing knife until it is white-hot, then mark the painful area with a line whose length is half a finger, or thereabouts; and place your hand for a moment and press until you incise the artery and reach the bone.
However, it is necessary for you to be careful of the continuation of the jaw, which is moved during mastication, and that the muscle is not injured, and the nerve that controls it, and that spasm does not occur.
And if it is about the care and caution of the flow of blood from the artery that is incised, for in its incision there is danger, and especially to him who ignores what he does and is not studious and experienced; and leaves the operation to him at the beginning.
And I will come with a reminder of the treatment of accidental blood flow from the artery according to its manner, in its place in this book.
And if you see that this illness is not relieved by this cautery and the patient's body is tolerable, cauterize that in the middle of the head as we have recounted, and treat the wound until it is healed.
And if you wish, administer the cautery which we have mentioned in the chapter on the constriction of the artery with a cautery having two blades; this cauterization is better and more suitable.
Chapter 5.
Concerning the cauterization of earaches.
When pain in the ear occurs due to cold and is treated with laxative remedies and with the other treatment that I have described in the division, and the pain is not relieved, then apply the cautery immediately.  This is the one called "puncta," of which this is the form:
And then apply the puncture, then the cauterization, and let it be carried around the whole ear as a wheel is turned, or in the circumference of each part if the pain is in a specific part. Extend the cautery from the root of the ear little by little, after you have marked the spot with a probe.
And if the cautery requires ten punctures in the whole ear, or in whichever part, then afterwards treat the spots until they are healed.
Chapter 6.
Concerning the cauterization of a sprain.
A sprain which is cured with cauterization is only one of the types which arise from phlegm, as we have said in the divisions of illnesses.
Avoid cauterization of the type that arises from dryness or from spasm of the nerve.
When you treat that type of sprain with leeches and purgatives and gargles, and your treatment is not effective, then you should cauterize the patient with three cauteries:  one at the root of the ear, the second a little below the temple, and the third at the junction of the two lips.
And place your cautery on the opposite side of the affected part, because softening (or alleviation) only comes to the part that appears healthy.
And the form of cauterization is that you cauterize it with the cautery at the very tip of the ear, a little above the temple, and another in the temple; the length of which should be according to the length of the thumb, and hold your hand with the cautery until the amount of half the thickness of the fingernail is burned.
And this is the form of the cautery, and it is a type of cutlery, the form of which is shown above/before. (This implies a diagram or illustration was present in the original text.) However, it is more subtle to do it a little like this; and it is necessary to cut away some of the superfluous thickness.
And then care for the area with what has been previously described until it is healed.
Chapter 7.
Concerning the cauterization of chronic apoplexy.
When apoplexy is chronic and you treat it with what we have said, and your medication is not effective, and the patient does not have a fever, then cauterize them with four cauteries: on all the corners of their head; and with a cautery in the middle of the head, as we have said; and with a cautery on the neck. And the manner of cauterization is done as described above.
And it is already cauterized above the mouth of the stomach; and it is further back; and then let it be treated with what follows.
Chapter 8.
Of cauterization for forgetfulness, done by flame.
So that large enemas and purifying pills are given to the patient at the beginning.
And then shave the patient's entire head and apply to their neck a plaster of the kind described in the treatise on plasters.
And apply that several times, for that is a manner of cauterization. And do this according to the same order which I have already mentioned.
And if he is healed by these means, it is good; and if not, then make for him three cauterizations on the back part of his head, which descend from the uppermost part of the head to the lowermost part of the neck. And place between each cauterization the width of a finger, and then care for the cauterization with what has been prescribed.
But if you add to it and the patient tolerates it, then make a cauterization in the middle place; and if you want a greater addition [or stronger effect], then cauterize that over the two temples.
Then treat that until it is healed; and let the cautery be olive-shaped according to the form given before.
Chapter 9.
Concerning the cauterization of paralysis and the softening of the whole body.
As you proceed with the purification of the head with leeches and with what we have said; and then shave the patient's head, and then cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head, and with a cautery over both temples of the head, and with a cautery on the back part of it, and with three cauteries over the vertebrae of the neck.
And if it is necessary in the illness of softening of the body to find it and the patient tolerates it and the illness is severe, then cauterize it with four cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, and lastly with a cautery until it is numb from the burning, and raise your hand. And then treat it until it is healed, and this should be an olive cautery.
Chapter 10.
Concerning the cauterization of epilepsy.
An epileptic is not cauterized unless that epilepsy is due to phlegm.
And therefore it is necessary that you purify his brain at the beginning with herbs and with the other treatment which we have described in the section when the patient is strong and can tolerate the purging of medicines.
And if it is a child who cannot tolerate medicines, then administer gargles and masticatories that purify the brain, before that for many days, with improvement of the diet.
Then shave the head of the patient, and cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head according to the previous method, and with another cautery on his occiput, and cauterize on each temple of his head. And if the patient is strong and can tolerate it, then cauterize him with the cauteries which I have mentioned, having paralysis and softening of the body over the vertebrae of the neck and the vertebrae of the back.
And let the cautery be olive-shaped, as has been previously described.
But if the patient is a child, then apply a small cautery according to this method.
Chapter 11.
Concerning the cauterization of melancholy.
When the causes of melancholy are corrupt humors and a thick phlegm, then cauterize it with the cauteries which we have mentioned in the treatment of paralysis.
And if the cause of melancholy is a superfluity tending towards melancholy, and the patient's body is humid, then give him something to drink that cleanses his brain, according to what has preceded in the division [of treatments].
Then shave the patient's head, and then make a properly-made poultice for him, and apply that poultice to the middle of his head.
And the patient should be seated and held firmly on all sides.
Then apply a liniment; and it is most fitting to use old sheep's fat. And heat that [liniment/ointment] over the fire with moderate warmth, the amount of which the said sufferer can bear when it is applied to him. Then pour that [liniment/ointment] onto the middle of his head within the circle [previously made], and leave it there until it cools.
And do this to the patient once a week, along with his other good treatments, until he is healed; or if you wish, cauterize that area by making small punctures according to his need, but you should hold your hand with a cautery thus prepared: this is a kind of cautery that moistens the brain evenly.
Then apply that cotton soaked in sheep's fat or goose grease.
Chapter 12.
Concerning the cauterization of water descending into the eye.
When the onset of water in the eye is evident to you through the signs which I have mentioned in the division, then begin and give the patient a drink that will purify his head, and keep it free of all humidity.
And make him sweat in a bath for several days.
And then order him to shave his head, and cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head; and then cauterize it with two cauteries on the two temples if the onset of the flow of water is in both eyes, or on one side if the onset of the water is in one eye.
Incise with a cautery all the veins and arteries which are below the occiput; and let the cauteries be far apart in the width of the temples.
And beware of a flow of blood when it is cauterized; and if you see a flow of blood from it, stop it with any medicine which is possible for you.
And I come with wisdom which is in the extraction of arteries and with the excision of them and the caution of blood flow.
And sometimes it is cauterized in the neck below the two bones with two cauteries placed apart.
Chapter 13.
Concerning the cauterization of old tears (or, Concerning the cauterization of chronic ulcers/sores).
When the tears from the eyes are old and persistent, and through the veins and arteries which are in the manifest location of the head, and it is verified that this is a superfluity of cold phlegmatic humors, then cauterize that with the cautery which we recounted in the first chapter concerning water falling into the eyes, and with a cautery in the middle of the head, and with two cauteries in the neck below the two temples, and with two cauteries in the neck below the two bones. And if it requires additional treatment, then cauterize that in all parts of the corner of the eye above the edge of the eyebrow with a small cautery.
Chapter 14.
Concerning the cauterization of nasal odor (or, Concerning the cauterization of a foul-smelling nose).
When you treat this with what we have said in the division and your treatment is not effective, then you prepare and give the patient decoctions to drink for three nights; and then shave his head, and cauterize it with a medium-sized cautery, with an olive-shaped cautery. And then cauterize that with a clove-shaped cautery, with two cauterizations above the two eyebrows, slightly below the hairline.
And beware of burning too deeply, that you do not incinerate it (or, that you do not damage it excessively).
And of the clove-shaped cautery, this is the form/shape.
Chapter 15.
Concerning the cauterization for the softening/relaxation of the eyelids.
When the eyelid is softened by illness or by humidity, then cauterize that eyelid with a lunar cautery; and this is its form:
And if you cauterize that, [do it] above the two eyebrows a little, with two cauteries in each part, and let them be elongated towards the temples. And let the length of each cautery be according to the size of the eyebrow.
And do not press too hard with your hand and the cautery, but only so that a third part of the eyelid is hardened/cauterized.
Chapter 16.
Concerning the cauterization of the eyelid of the eye when the hairs are turned inward and prick the eye.
When the hairs of the eye are turned inward so that they prick the eye, cauterization in such cases is done in two ways, for cauterization is either done with fire or with a corrosive medicine.
If you cauterize it with fire, instruct the patient beforehand to shave their eyelashes as if they were cleaning them, until they are long and strong; and if they prick the eyelid at their root, then you should bind the patient's eyes with a bandage so that they are not hurt until the eyelashes grow back.
Then, when they have grown and strengthened, place the patient's head in your lap, and then mark on the eyelid of their eye with a probe, a mark that is in the shape of a myrtle leaf, and let the beginning of the mark be near the hairs.
And then apply lint soaked in egg white or in gum arabic to the eye.
And then heat the cautery, whose form is this.
And then cauterize over the shape you have marked, little by little, in several times, until the surface of the skin, which is like a myrtle leaf, is completely burned.
And a sign of the success of your work is that you see the eyelid of the eye already contracted and the hairs around it raised from the puncture of the eye.
Then raise your hand and leave it for three days, and then apply lint with a bandage until the scar is healed. And then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
But if some matter returns through the skin near its origin and the eyelid is softened, then apply the cautery again in the same way as you did initially.
But if the hairs are under the eyelid, then cauterize that area until it is raised to its natural place and is even, and the hairs do not touch the eye.
But cauterize with a burning medicine; this is to instruct the patient to pluck the hairs until they are lengthened and evened, and then a myrtle leaf-shaped bandage of cloth should be applied.
Then take known soap and quicklime, about an ounce, or whatever, and mix these ingredients well, and do this quickly so that it does not get cold; then spread this mixture on the cloth which is made in the shape of a myrtle leaf, and place this on one or both eyes; and place under the eye cotton soaked in egg white, and the patient's head should be in your lap.
And place your finger on the medicine and press it slightly, but do not move it until the patient feels the bite of the medicine, for the bite is like that of fire.
And so when you perceive that he feels the bite, then release the medicine and rub it with your finger; when the bite ceases, then remove the medicine and wash the eye with water; then consider if you see that the eyelid is raised as it should be after being cauterized by fire or incision, for then it is well; and if not, return to applying the medicine to the place where the medicine has not yet been applied and does not blacken until your work is even and the eye is contracted.
Then place cotton with a bandage on it until the scab from the cauterization is eradicated, and then treat it with healing ointment or another until it is healed.
And it is necessary for you, during your operation, to guard with vigilant diligence that nothing of the medicine falls into the eye, and if the eyelid is softened after a few days and some of the hair-like matter remains in the eye, then repeat your medicine on the place which is softened in the eyelid, and precisely as you did at the beginning, and then cover it until it is healed.
And this is the method for myrtle leaves.
And know that the eyes of men are diversified according to their size and smallness, and therefore your cauterization is done accordingly.
And the path of rectitude shall not be hidden from him who studies this art.
Chapter 17.
Concerning the cauterization of a fistula in the tear duct of the eye.
When you treat a fistula with what we have said in the divisions of diseases and your treatment is ineffective, then you must cauterize it in this manner: instruct the patient to place their head on your lap, and let a minister hold the patient's head between your hands in such a way that their head is not moved or shaken.
Then place cotton soaked in egg white or gum arabic on their eye.
Then heat the cautery, whose form is as follows:
which should be concave, like the shape of a cane or a vulture's feather, at the end with which the cauterization is performed.
And if you wish, let it be penetrating to the other end. And if you wish, let it be shaped like a probe.
However, the concave one is better for your work.
Then press the fistula if it is open, and draw out the pus and dry it. And if it is not open, then open it and extract the rottenness from it.
Then place on it the cautery, which should be well ignited, and hold your hand a little below the cautery, from the eye to the side of the nose, so that your hand does not err or the patient is disturbed, and then place the cautery on the granulation of the eye and destroy it.
And so if at the beginning your cautery penetrates the bone, it is good; and if not, then repeat the cautery once or twice, if necessary; and leave it like that for three days, and then place on it a cotton ball with a drying ointment until it is healed.
But if ten days have passed and it is not healed, then place on it a sharp corrosive medicine until the bone is uncovered and scraped as is appropriate in its chapter.
And there is another method of cauterizing a fistula which some ancient physicians described:  Find the location of the fistula and open it, and then place in that fissure a thin, slender tube which fits its form. And pour into it one ounce of melted lead; and hold your hand with a cloth with good retention, and do not disturb the patient so that the melted lead does not reach the patient's eye; and it is necessary that you place on the patient's eye cotton soaked in egg white or water, because the lead will adhere to the location of the fistula and heal it by a marvelous healing.
And if the fistula is healed with what we have said of the cautery and the treatment, it is good; and if not, then it is necessary to administer a nasal probe and reduce the fistula to the body of the nose as it should return to its proper place.
Chapter 18.
On the cauterization of the fissure of the well (likely referring to a body orifice or wound).
Many times fissures occur on the lips, and mostly on the lips of children.
Therefore, if you treat those fissures with what we have said in the sections and your treatment is not effective, then ignite a small, knife-like cautery according to this form that is shown:
And let its concavity be according to the subtlety of a knife.
Then carefully place that instrument in those fissures until the cautery reaches the bottom of the fissures.
Then treat that with cerots until it is healed.
Chapter 19.
Concerning the cauterization of a fistula in the mouth.
When in the root of the uvula, or in the palate, or in the roots of the teeth, an abscess develops, then breaks, becomes chronic, and pus flows, forming a fistula, and if you treat it and the treatment is not effective, then you should apply a cautery according to the size of the fistula.  Then place the heated cautery into the opening of the fistula, holding it with your hand until the heated iron reaches the bottom, and do this once or twice at the back; then treat it with what we have said about treatment until it is healed.
And so, if the wound is closed and heals, it is good; but if not, then it is necessary to open the area and remove the corrupted bone, as will be described in its chapter.
Chapter 20.
Concerning the cauterization of teeth and the softening of gums.
When the gums are softened by moisture and the teeth are loose, and you treat them with medicines without success, then place the patient's head in your lap, and then heat the cautery, the shape of which will be described later, in such a way that you place the small cup over the tooth and quickly insert the heated cautery into it, holding your hand briefly until the patient feels the heat of the fire reach the root of the tooth.
And then remove your hand, and then repeat the cautery a few times as needed.
And then let the patient fill their mouth with salt water and hold it for an hour, and then spit it out, because the loose tooth is fixed, the softened gum is tightened, and the corrupt moisture is dried out.
Chapter 21.
Concerning the cauterization of toothache.
When toothache is due to coldness, or there is cold or worms in it, and you don't achieve a cure with medicine, then cauterization is done in two ways: either cauterization with a cow's hair cautery, or cauterization with fire.
Cautery with hair is that you take cow's hair and boil it in an iron spoon, and then take cotton and wrap it around the end of a probe, and then dip it in the boiled hair, and apply it to the aching tooth quickly until it is cooled.
And then repeat this several times until the virtue of the fire reaches the root of the tooth.
And if you wish, submerge wool or cotton in the aforementioned hair, and place that on the aching tooth, and place a glowing iron on top of it until the iron reaches the bottom of the tooth's cavity.
However, cauterization with fire is that you use a small tube of brass or iron, and there should be some thickness in its body so the sharpness of the fire does not reach the patient's mouth.
Then heat the cautery to the desired temperature, and place it on the tooth and hold your hand there until the cautery cools; and do this several times because the pain will be lessened either that day or the next.
And it is necessary that, by the application of this cautery, the patient fill their mouth with good wool and hold it for an hour, and then spit it out; and this is the method of cauterization.
And cauterize with whichever extremity you wish, as is possible for you.
And this is the form of the cannula:
Chapter 22.
Concerning the cauterization of extrophulos (likely referring to a type of skin eruption or swelling).
When extrophuli are caused by phlegm and cold humors and are not responsive to digestion by medicines, and you wish to digest them lightly, then you ignite the cautery, the shape of which is as follows: having two open ends so that the smoke escapes from one end of the cautery, and place this ignited instrument on the abscess once, and again if it is needed, until it reaches the bottom of the abscess.
And if the abscess is small, then apply the cautery according to the size of the abscess, and then leave it for three days and apply a cloth soaked in boiled water over it until that which the fire has burned is softened.
And then treat it with ointment and bandages and cloths until it is healed.
Chapter 23.
Concerning the cauterization of hoarseness and constriction of the throat.
When humidity comes upon the lung's channel, and especially when this is accompanied by coldness of constitution, then it is necessary that the patient be evacuated at the beginning with laxative medicines, and then cauterize that area below the root of the throat in the affected location.
And be careful not to reach the throat with the cautery, nor burn the uvula, but only a little.
And cauterize that area with another cautery near the juncture of the neck at the back of his last vertebra. And his cautery should be a small nail, following the previous manner.
And then treat that with what has been previously prescribed until it is healed.
Chapter 24.
On the cauterization of lung disease and cough.
When cough and lung disease are caused by cold humors, and the patient has no fever or consumption (tuberculosis) and the disease is chronic, then cauterize with two cauteries on the clavicle in the previously mentioned places – the left and right sides – and with another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two nipples; and let the cautery be a small nail according to the previous method.
And if you wish, let your cauterization be done with points using the cautery that is called a puncta (puncture), the form of which is described in the section on earache puncturing.
And let the points be placed close to those; and then treat it with the same things as are prescribed before until it is healed.
And let the cautery have three prongs, for cauterization is done with this: with one application you can make three cauteries according to this method:
Chapter 25.
Concerning the cauterization of the testicle, which is the head of the spermatic cord.
When the head of the spermatic cord is dislocated because of lubricous humors and is not fixed in the moment of its return from its dislocation until it is in its accustomed place of return, and then by a small movement it is dislocated again as it happened, as we have testified, then it is necessary that you first reduce the dislocation; and then the patient should be turned on his back or on his healthy side; and then raise the cord which is in the inner part of the testicle to the upper parts with the fingers of your left hand, if the joint is dislocated in the inner parts.
And then heat the cautery having two heads; and this is its form:
And then cauterize the cord until it penetrates from one side to the other; and the cauterization will then have the form of four cauterized heads.
And sometimes it is adjusted according to this count, and therefore there are eight cauteries.
And then place on the cautery cooked porridge with salt, and then keep the patient calm, and the limb should not be moved for some time until it is healed.
And if the dislocation is in the upper parts and this is done late, then cauterize over the muscle with a nail-shaped cautery or with many pointed cauteries, because the joint is strengthened, the humidity is removed, and the patient is healed.
Chapter 26.
Concerning the cauterization of the stomach.
When cold and many humors enter the stomach, exceeding its capacity and multiplying, and if you continue the treatments and do not help, then the patient should lie on his back, extend his arms and legs, and then cauterize him with three cauteries: one cautery under the feet, the amount of one finger, using a nail-shaped cautery, and two cauteries below on both sides of the cautery, so that a triangular figure of cauteries is created;  and space them so they do not touch, lest they cause putrefaction.
And if the depth of the cautery is two-thirds the thickness of the finger.
And let the shape of the cautery be according to this form without addition. And if you wish, cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form; and this should be a cautery in the form of a circle according to this form:
And let the stomach be cauterized punctually where this cautery is feared: that is, you mark points on the stomach with a probe according to the amount you want, and then cauterize those points; and then treat it with the previously described treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 27.
Of the cauterization of the cold liver.
When pain arises in the liver due to coldness, humidity, or excessive flatulence, such that it is thrown out of its normal fullness by superfluous egress, and the patient is treated with what we have said and it does not help, then the patient should be laid supine on his neck, and mark with a probe three cauteries according to this form and this same amount on the liver under the hypochondria, where the decubitus of a man is perceived.
And let the space which is between each cautery be according to the thickness of a finger, and let the cautery be according to the length of a straight finger.
And do not press too much with the cautery.
And if the amount of what is burned is the amount of half the width of the little finger, and no more should be applied; and if the patient is standing on his feet; and if he is not standing, then let him lie down, having already spread his thighs, and raise his arms.
And it is possible for you to cauterize these areas with a knife-shaped cautery, when you have subtlety and prudence in the art.
And beware that you do not proceed too much in the cauterization, and let the width of a whole finger be burned so that the whole body is burned and it reaches the intestines, for the finger here is slender; and know this.
Chapter 28.
Of the perforation of an abscess of the liver with a cautery.
When an ulcer or abscess develops in the liver and you want to know if that abscess is in the flesh of the liver or in its tunic, then if it is in the flesh of the liver, the patient finds heaviness and pain without sharpness.
And if it is in the tunic of the liver, the pain is very sharp and sometimes it fatigues the doctors in its treatment.
Therefore, the patient should be turned onto his side; and then mark the location of the abscess with a probe; and then heat the cautery, which is shaped like a ploughshare, the form of which was shown on the previous page. And cauterize with that cautery until all the pus is consumed, until it reaches the bottom, until healthy blood comes out.
And then treat it with the treatment for other abscesses until it is healed.
And it is not fitting that this method of cautery be used except by one whose study in the art of medicine is extensive, and in whose hands many illnesses have been treated;  but this, with some experience, should be attempted in this operation, yet leave this to us, and it is better.
Chapter 29.
On the cauterization of pleurisy.
The ancients said that cautery of the roots of birthwort for cold pleurisy, according to this method, is effective, and it is this: that you take of the roots of long, dry birthwort a root one finger-length long which is found, and let it be of the thickness of a finger.
Then immerse that in oil and heat it in the fire, and then cauterize with one cautery in the place which is between the continuation of the clavicle and the neck; and with two small cauteries below the chin, slightly inclined towards the part which is below the beard, and with two cauteries in that which is inclined between the fifth rib and the sixth, inclining slightly towards the back parts; and with another cautery in the middle of the chest; and with another above the stomach; and with three cauteries of the back parts; and with one cautery in the place which is between the two shoulders, and with two cauteries on the two sides of the chest, below the cautery which is between the two shoulders.
And it is not necessary that you grasp your hand with the cautery, but rather let it be in the manifest handle in work.  (A more natural English translation might be: "And you should not hold the cautery with your hand, but rather use the handle provided.")
And some ancients said that some men use a cautery of iron similar to a ray and ignite it, and put it in the place which is between the ribs, until it reaches that abscess and is purged healthy, as we have said in the abscess of the liver.
But this perforation with cautery is not without danger, for one may quickly kill the tissue in the place, creating a fistula which is not easily healed.
Chapter 30.
Concerning the cauterization of the spleen.
When you treat the illness of the spleen with what we have said of treatment in the division and your treatment is not effective, then cauterization is appropriate in three ways, all of which are correct. One is to make three or four cauteries lengthwise according to the length of the spleen, following the pattern of the liver cauteries, the form of which has been previously described.
And let the width between each cautery be the breadth of a finger or a little more, and the manner of cauterization should be the same as that which we described for the cauterization of the liver.
And do not press your hand with the cautery; and let the patient be lying on his back.
And another way of cauterizing is to ignite the cautery having two points, which method we described in the chapter on muscle dislocation, and raise the rib which is over the spleen where the patient's left side lies.
And let your elevation, with which you raise the rib, be according to the length of the body, so that cauteries are made according to the width of the body.
Then insert the two points, very hot, into that space so that with them you penetrate the rib on the other side.
And then extract the cautery; and thus four cauteries are made.
And if you wish, cauterize with a cautery having three points.
And then you treat the cautery until it has stopped discharging pus for many days, for this is more important than the other preceding causes in the cure.
Chapter 31.
Concerning the cauterization of a dropsical patient.
Cautery is not applied in dropsy, except in a certain [specific, particular] case.  (The "3" likely indicates a footnote or marginal note in the original, which is impossible to translate without seeing the original manuscript).
When you treat a dropsical patient with the methods of treatment which we have mentioned in the division and your treatment is not effective, then it is necessary that you cauterize them with four cauteries in a circle around the navel, and with one cautery above the stomach, and with another cautery above the liver, and with another cautery above the spleen, and with two cauteries between the vertebrae of the back, and one cautery on the right foot, and with another cautery above the stomach. And the depth of the cautery should be proportionate to the thickness of the skin.
And then leave the cautery open so that it discharges pus for a long time.
And do not remove the cautery from the patient before it is necessary, because two intentions should be combined, and healing should be hastened with help.
The shape of the cautery with which the abdomen is cauterized should be nail-shaped, as its form is described above, and that with which the back is cauterized should be olive-shaped, as its form is described above.
Chapter 32.
On the cauterization of the feet and thighs.
When the feet are afflicted with dropsy and are filled with yellowish water, it is necessary to cauterize the feet on the back of the foot, in the space between the little toe and the ring finger. Raise your hand with the cautery and do not twist it; and then raise your hand, and do not completely remove it, for the yellowish water will drain.
The cautery is according to this shape:  Then make two cauteries on both thighs, and on each thigh a cautery should be made with the knife-like end of the cautery. And let the cautery be according to the length of the thigh: one below the knee and the other in the middle of the thigh; and on each thigh two cauteries.
And leave the wound open without treatment for a long time so that some water drains from it.
And then treat it with those things which we have mentioned.
Chapter 33.
Concerning the cauterization of the abdomen.
When the abdomen is cold and damp to the point that it weakens the vital functions, that is, the digestive and retentive functions, which are in the stomach and intestines, and this is treated with methods of healing and doesn't improve, and sometimes the patient suffers and needs cauterization to stimulate the vital forces, then cauterize it with a large cautery on the stomach, as previously described in the cauterization of the stomach, with a circular cautery and with four small cauteries in a circle around the navel, with a thin, pointed cautery; and with a cautery on the flank, on a large aloes, or with two cauteries.
And if sometimes the humors are excessive and the patient tolerates it, then cauterize it on the groin and on the intestines, and quickly apply two cauteries near the stomach and near the inguinal regions, for this is a perfect and beneficial cure of which you will not be mistaken.
Chapter 34.
Concerning the cauterization of chronic hemorrhoids.
When there are chronic hemorrhoids in the nature of thick, cold humors or corrupted moistures, and they are treated with what we have said in the division and the treatment does not improve, then cauterize with three small, triangular cauteries just below the spine of the two [presumably, referring to the sacrum/coccyx area], and with a cautery above the navel, done in two applications.
And if you suspect that the patient's stomach is cold and their food is not digested, and you see their face is inflamed, then cauterize the stomach with a large cauterizing iron as previously described; and with one cautery iron on the liver, and with another cautery iron on the spleen—using a nail-shaped cauterizing iron—and leave the cauterization open for some time, and then treat the patient until they are healed.
Chapter 35.
Concerning the cauterization of an abscess, near its excision.
When you excise an abscess, then you immediately apply a cautery that resembles a ray (or spoke). Then insert that heated cautery into the excised abscess, and lastly place your hand there until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which the blood flows.
And do this once or twice, for if the abscesses are numerous, then cauterize each of them as we have recounted, and then treat them with ointments until they are healed.
And if you cauterize with a large cautery on someone, it is slower in helping.
Chapter 36.
Chapter 36.  On the cauterization of fistulas that are formed naturally in the body's parts.
When nature does not heal the ailment which we have described in its place, and the patient is frightened by it, let it be healed with cautery.
Therefore, when someone has a fistula in the natural area of the body, and it is old,  it will be flowing with pus and corrupted humors. Therefore, what is most appropriate is to probe it with a thin probe, and then know the quantity and depth of it with the aforementioned probe.
Then ignite the cautery which is similar to a ray (or, a pointed cautery). And then place that ignited cautery into the fistula, according to the depth indicated by the probe.
And repeatedly apply the cautery until those corrupted tissues are burned, once or twice or three times, depending on your assessment of the need.
And beware of burning nerves and veins; or if the fistula goes towards the bladder or the intestine, then beware of all those areas; and do not do this unless the fistula is in fleshy tissue and you believe it is not penetrating deeply.
And then care for the area until it is healed.
And if the area is sealed, and the matter has been excised from it, and remains so for a long time, then know that it is completely cured.
And if the matter has not been removed, then know that it is penetrating or in the bone itself that is corrupted, or that it comes from those causes, which will be recalled in their proper place (in the later part of the text).
Chapter 37.
On the cauterization of ulcers.
When in ulcers pain arises from cold or excessive inflammation, and because of this the patient's body is weakened, then it is necessary to cauterize that over the ulcers with a cautery, on each ulcer with a nail-shaped cautery, the preparation of which will be recalled later.
And quickly cauterize again a little lower, so that three linear cauterizations result, and thus they will be more helpful in the healing.
Chapter 38.
On the cauterization of the bladder.
When weakness and softening occur in the bladder due to cold and humidity, such that the patient cannot retain urine, then cauterize that in the lowest part above the bladder, where the hairs of the pubis begin, and cauterize with one cautery on the right side, and with another on the left side.
And let the length of each cautery be according to the size of the walnut; and cauterize that with a cautery in the lowest part of the back, or with two cauteries if necessary.
And let the cautery be a nail-shaped instrument, as is appropriate.
Chapter 39.
On the cauterization of the hand.
When cold and dampness come to the hand, and because of this conception is prevented, and her menses are corrupted, and their onset is delayed, and pain occurs at their arrival, then it is necessary that the place be cauterized with three cauteries in the circuit of the navel, as we have said in the cauterization of the bladder; and with a cautery above the lowest part of the back, or with two cauteries, and let the cautery be nail-shaped.
Chapter 40.
On the cauterization of a dislocated hip.
When mucous humors are poured into the area of the hip, and are the cause of its displacement, and a sign of this is that one thigh is longer than the other when they are compared. And the location of the dislocation is found where it protrudes.
Then it is necessary that you cauterize the patient over the area of their hip with a circular cautery, after you have marked with a probe the circumference of the area as it is dislocated, so that the area falls within the middle of the circle.
And let the cautery be of the kind previously described for the cauterization of the stomach.
And if this cautery is not at hand, then cauterize it with three cauteries using a large olive-shaped cautery.
And let the cautery be made according to the size of the thickness of the entire bone; and then care for it until it is healed.
Chapter 41.
On the cauterization of the sciatic vein.
When pain comes in the hip area, and it is caused by cold and dampness, the patient is treated with what we have said and do not disagree, and this is ancient practice, then you must purge the patient of thick humors with foul-smelling pills or artificial pills or similar; and then cauterize it.
And the manner of cauterization in that case is according to two methods: either cauterization with burning medicines, or cauterization with fire.
Now, according to two known methods, one of which is to cauterize that area on the patient's hip with three triangular cauteries according to this form; and make them of good depth. And let the space which is between each cautery be the amount of the width of a finger, whether the cautery is olive-shaped or large.
But sometimes let the cautery be in the middle of the place, on the head of the hip, so that there are four cauteries.
And if you wish, cauterize with the circle whose form precedes in the cauterization of hip dislocation, so that it is a continuous circle and burns the thickness of the whole hip.
And this is the manner of cauterization in sciatica when the pain is adherent to the hip and is not extended to the thigh.
But if it is extended to the thigh, then cauterize that with two cauteries on the thigh, on the place to which the patient points as the location of the pain; and with one cautery on the buttock, four fingers slightly below the left side.
And if the cautery is knife-shaped, let the depth of the cautery be according to the thickness of the hip.
And if the patient indicates that the pain extends to the area near the toes, then cauterize there where indicated with a cautery for three or four points, or more if necessary.
And if the patient indicates the pain to be below the buttock towards the thigh, then cauterize there with a knife-shaped cautery.
And be careful in all cauterization that you do not go so deep with the cautery that you burn nerves or cause great injury, and that because of this you do not cause harm or contraction to the patient.
And I have seen one and another of those whom I cauterized on the ankle and went too deep in the cauterization, and the leg became swollen until the swelling reached the foot, and the whole foot was perforated and corrupted. And then a strong diarrhea occurred, and then death.
And if the pain is in two places at once, cauterize each according to this manner.
And the wise ones say that in the cauterization of an ankle, a cautery of this kind is used:  make a circle of iron whose circumference is half a palm; and let its opening be according to the thickness of a date pit or slightly less.
And within that circle let there be another, a third; and let the space which is between them be the quantity of a hazel nut; and let those circles be open on two sides; and let the length of those irons be a hazelnut or two, and make in those iron margins decently prepared in the circles; and this is its form:
Then let it be heated in the fire until it glows red and throws off sparks, and then let it be placed on the part of the ankle, the patient lying on their side. Therefore cauterize that with three round cauteries at once.
Then leave that for three days; then plaster it with a bandage and leave the wound open for several days; and then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
Albucasis says: O, son, we have used this type of cautery little because of the fear of looking at it, and because we have found few who dare to look upon it.
But of the good cauteries to him who suffers them, and find with that its place. (This translates more literally than perfectly. A better, more natural-sounding translation might be: "But such cauteries are good for those who endure them, and thus one finds the affected area.")
But cauterization with burning medicines is that you make two circles having a perforated handle in which you insert the  iron door latch; let the length of the walls in the height be two nuts or whatever those are. (This is a difficult sentence due to the archaic language and possibly some technical terms that aren't completely clear.  The translation attempts to capture the meaning but some ambiguity remains regarding the description of the instrument.)
And if the space which is between each is the quantity of the thickness of the finger; and let them be opened below and above, and let them contain themselves between each other according to this form: (This describes a surgical procedure, likely involving incisions. The "form" is left undefined, requiring further context from the surrounding text or a diagram.)
Then place the patient on their side, over the affected part of the hip, and press your hand on the area of the hip; and then take warm water and pour it between the two circles, and let the heat be gentle and gradual, and hold it for about an hour, and let the patient endure the biting and burning — for this produces a burning sensation like fire — until the burning ceases.
Then lift your hand with the instrument and wipe the warm water from the entire hip with fresh water.
Then leave it for three days and apply a bandage until the blackness of the burn is removed, and leave it for a few days, and pus will drain from it; this is the final treatment.
Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if the pain extends to the thigh or leg, apply a similar water bath as was done for the hip.
And this is the method of the warm water treatment, and I have already written about it in the treatise on the rectification of medicines. Take alkali and quicklime, an equal part of each, and crush them and put them in a new pot, the bottom of which is perforated with a small hole, according to the amount that should go into the ray.  (Note: "ray" here likely refers to a specific instrument or device, the exact nature of which is unclear from this sentence alone).
And place another inverted pot below the bottom of the pot, and pour over the alkali and quicklime fresh water that covers them by a finger's breadth, and then when you have pressed them with your hand with good compression, allow the sharp water to descend from above into the inverted pot below.
Then collect all that water, and pour it over fresh quicklime and alkali, for then it will be a very strong solution, which is used in many medical operations and in cauterization of other members, because it acts like fire.
And some of the medicines with which cauterization is also done are:  honey,  vinegar, and quicklime with soap, so that they are mixed together.
And Gualia recounted from an ancient man the operation and cure by which pain of the hip and sciatic vein is cured, and greatly praised the effectiveness of it, saying that no other cure was needed, and that it was healed in one go as recommended, because very quickly that person entered the bath and was immediately free of it.
And it is so that [some] green hellebore should be taken, and if green is not found, a fresh fig should be taken; and it should be well crushed with a little grease and placed on the hip where the pain is, or on the thigh, or on the leg, and bound on.
And it should be left on for three hours, or for as long as the patient feels a burning sensation.
Then put that person in a bath, and when their body is reddened, expose them to the sun, for the pain ceases and they are healed.
And know that one should not use cautery with these medicines except after the evacuation of the body.
However, Dioscorides says that when the varicose vein is cauterized with a goat's horn, it will greatly benefit him; and the cautery should be applied in this manner: wool should be taken and soaked in old oil, and placed between the arches of the foot and the ankle bone.
Then take a dry goat's horn and burn it in a fire until it becomes charcoal; and then place it on the wool and leave it there until it is extinguished. Then repeat this, and do not cease doing this until the sensation of the burning reaches the ankle and the pain subsides.
And this method of cautery is called cautery of the cow.  (Note:  It's likely a misspelling or a regional variation; "vacas" means cows in Spanish, but the context suggests it's related to the goat horn.)
Chapter 42.
On the cauterization of toothache.
Sometimes toothache is caused by various reasons, such as a fall or a blow, or excessive evacuation, and by similar causes, by the infusion of cold and humid matter.
And cautery is only suitable for that single type which is caused by an effusion of cold matter.
Therefore, after evacuating the patient with purging pills and similar remedies,  make incisions on the tooth where the pain is located, three lines according to its width, marking with ink five cauterizations per line or more, depending on the patient's tolerance and constitution.
And the cauterization should be done with a pointed cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauteries using a nail-shaped cautery according to this form:
Chapter 43.
On cauterization at the beginning of gibbosity (or hunchback).
Often this illness happens to small children; and a sign of its beginning in children is that it happens to their structure in the hip with elevation and movement.
And you will find in the last vertebra of the back and neck that it begins to rise above the other vertebrae.
And therefore when you see this and want to prevent it, then cauterize that with a cautery that is circular according to this form: so that the cautery takes in the whole part of the vertebra equally.
And if you wish, cauterize in the circumference of the vertebra with the pointed cautery two or three lines. And let the points be close to each other.
And then care for the place until it is healed with what we have said.
But beware that cautery is not administered in swelling that is caused by a spasm of the nerves.
Chapter 44.
Of the cauterization of gout and joint pain.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors which are infused into each member of the body, then when pain comes in the feet, it is the custom of physicians to call this properly gout.
And so if gout caused by cold is cured with a method of cure and the pains are not removed, then cautery removes them.
And it is so that you cauterize that near evacuation in the area of the joint of the foot with many cauteries.
And let the cautery be olive-shaped, of which this is the form:
And if it is necessary that a puncture be made on the surface of the foot, then do it with a pointed cautery. And if the pains rise into the knees or other joints, and this often happens, then cauterize that on each knee with three or four cauteries on each side with this olive-shaped cautery.
And if many cauteries are necessary, then cauterize it and do not press too hard with your hand with the cautery beforehand; let it only be around the thickness of a finger.
And if the pains rise into both knees, then apply the cautery which we have described in its chapter.
And if the pains are only in the hands, and it is called  (a type of) hand pain/rheumatism, then puncture in the circle of the knuckles as they curve, puncture in those two lines.
And if the pains remain in the fingers, then puncture in the circle of the knuckles on each finger and on the palm of the hand.
And if the pains rise in a few days to the hips or muscles, then cauterize them in every part of the affected area.
And do not neglect the patient's good regimen and the reception of medicines, for if a good regimen is followed and the inflammation is evacuated with this cautery, he will be healed, God willing.
Chapter 45.
On the cauterization of ruptures.
When a rupture occurs in the groin, with the intestines protruding before the scrotum, and this is just beginning, then you should order the patient to cease eating that day and to use soothing remedies so that the tear in his abdomen may close.
Then hold the patient between your hands over his abdomen, and instruct him to hold his breath until the hernia or intestines are retracted.
Then return that [the hernia/intestines] with your fingers and gently push the rupture against the pubic bone, noting that the extremity of it should resemble half a circle in the upper parts of the body.
Then heat the cautery, whose form is this:
until it is very red and throws off sparks. Then return the intestine or hernia to its cavity, and place your hand over the area so that the intestine does not protrude.
And you have already opened the space between the patient's thighs and placed a cushion underneath; and let another servant be on their legs, and another on their feet, who should hold their hands.
Then place the cautery on that mark with your hand, holding the cautery straight, and hold it there until you reach with it the bone of the hip joint in the middle of the thigh; and repeat with it another time if you did not reach the bone on the first attempt.
And observe carefully the protrusion of the intestine during your cauterization, so that you do not burn the intestine, lest death or other great harm come upon the patient.
And know that if you do not reach the bone with the cautery, your operation is not complete/successful.
And it is necessary that the cautery for children be small, according to their size and age.
Then care for the cauterized area for three days with a poultice until the burn scar is healed.
And then treat it with other ointments until it is healed.
And the patient should lie on their back for forty days until the area and wound are sealed/healed.
And it is necessary that you give him nourishment according to the length of his treatment, which will cleanse his belly, and that the intestine does not protrude due to the effort of healing.
And then, when he wants to get up after about forty days, apply a properly made bandage, and keep it on for another forty days.
And let him be reduced in work and in the repletion of food and drink, and in vehement voices, for when he uses this regimen of entire healing, he will be completely healed.
And I will say the treatment for ruptures in the other parts of the belly; and so, at the beginning, if you want them not to spread, then cauterize the rupture with a round cautery according to its size.  And let that which is exuded from the cautery be as much as a third part of it; and then treat it with what we have said, and it is suitable/appropriate.
And already some earlier authors have said that a rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery according to this shape, since it is marked with a probe/tent:
and a line is placed which goes across the widest part of the rupture, and another line above it; and place your hand with a nail-shaped cautery, but the first cautery is lighter and better.
Chapter 46.
On the cauterization of torsion (or twisting).
When in some member, due to a fall or blow, pain arises and persists for a long time and does not yield to treatment with medicines, then it is necessary to cauterize with a pointed cautery.
And let the cautery be for each member according to its size and smallness, and its strength and weakness, and the location of the twisting and pain.
Therefore, if it is healed by the first cautery, it is good; and if not, then repeat the cautery on it; for it is customary for those pains to be punctuated from one member to the next adjacent member, wherefore it is necessary that you treat these with cautery until the patient is healed.
Chapter 47.
On the cauterization of leprosy.
Lepers are sometimes treated with cautery with great benefit, especially if the type of leprosy is caused by putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy.
And so, if you wish to cauterize that, consider whether the leprosy is spreading and whether it can be cured with what we have said in the division; and if it does not diminish, nor ceases, and you fear that the corruption will encompass the whole of his body and his entire complexion, then cauterize him on the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the head, and the second lower, near the forehead at the hairline; and two more on the temples (two horns); and one at the back, on the nape of the neck.
And finally, with the cautery, press your hand slightly inward so that a small impression is made on the bone, and the crusts are removed, so that the expulsion of thick vapors is alleviated from it; and cauterize over the spleen as is necessary.
And if the leprosy is already spread over the patient and manifestly appears, then you must cauterize him with those cauteries which we have mentioned on the head; and with a cautery on the tip of the nose, and with two cauteries on the two cheekbones, and with two cauteries on two vertebrae of the neck, and with six cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, and with one large one on the vertebrae near the coccyx, and one on the coccyx, and with two on the hips, and one on each hip, and with two on the buttocks, and one on each buttock, and with two on the knees, and with two on the muscles, and with two on the ankles of his feet; and cauterize him on all the joints of the fingers of the hands and feet, and on each heel of his feet, and on the knuckles of his hands.
And beware of the nerves which are on the heel, that you do not burn them.
And sometimes it is cauterized with one cautery on the pubic bone and with another on the stomach opening, and another on the liver.
And know that the more cauteries you apply, the more helpful and beneficial it is; and know that the patient feels no pain from the cautery, as they do from wounds, because his body is already numb.
And the cauteries should be large or small according to the limbs and joints, as is prescribed by the types of instruments.
And then treat the cautery with cooked barley flour mixed with honey and with other treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 48.
On cauterization for numbness/stupor.
When a limb is numb or asleep and has been treated with medicines, oils, and plasters, and is not healed, then you cauterize that numb limb with cauteries according to the size or smallness of the limb.
And let your cautery penetrate the thickness of the skin a little. And then treat that with ointment until it is healed.
And sometimes some numbness is cauterized which extends to the hands and feet, and to the vertebrae of the back, near the origin of the nerves which move that limb, and the numbness is relieved.
But do not attempt this except one who is learned in the anatomy of the limbs and the origin of the nerves moving the whole body.
Chapter 49.
Concerning the cauterization of albaras, which is morphea.
When albaras is chronic and you do not apply any medicinal ointments to it, then you cauterize it with a cautery iron a little, according to the size and nature of the affected area, until the whiteness and its color are relieved, and its color is changed.
Then treat it with barley and lentil flour with rose oil and arugula leaves, and with pigeon's blood or hen's blood—of each an equal part, and all mixed together—then apply a linen cloth over the area until it is healed.
Chapter 50.
Concerning the cauterization of cancer.
When cancer is beginning and you want to remove it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery iron around its circumference as it is swollen.
And the wise men say that it should be cauterized with a pointed cautery iron in the middle; but to me this is not advisable, for I fear that it will become ulcerated, and I have already seen this happen several times.
And it is more proper that it be cauterized around its circumference with a circle, as we have said, or with many cauteries.
Chapter 50.  (Assuming a chapter numbering system where L = 50 in Roman numerals)
Concerning the cauterization of swellings (or abscesses).
When a swelling is delayed in maturation, and this is due to the superfluity causing it, or to the age of the patient, because they are old and decrepit, with little blood, or because of the time of year, and you wish to hasten the maturation of the swelling; then cauterize around its circumference with many small, punctate cauteries; and then leave it, for it will hasten maturation.
But if you wish to perforate it with a cautery, then you heat the cautery, of which this is the form: and place that in the middle of the swelling until it penetrates the skin.
And if the cautery is in that place which is lower down, so that the body of the arm may be relieved; and then cure it until it is healed.
Chapter 52.
Concerning the cauterization of corrosives.
A corrosive is a corruption moving in the limb, which corrodes it like fire consuming dry wood.
Therefore, if you see this corrosive in a place that has suffered cauterization with fire, then you should ignite very small, and large (according to what is suitable for the place where) nails as cauteries in the place where the corrosive is.
And then cauterize it completely until you eradicate all the corrosion and none of it remains.
And then leave it for three days, and apply crushed salt mixed with oil to the cauterized areas until all the scabs and all the corruption are eradicated.
And then treat it with flesh-generating ointments.
But if after three days you see that healthy flesh has grown where there is no corruption, that is good; but if not, then repeat the cautery on what remains in the corrupted areas.
And corrosion is sometimes treated with a sharp medicine, for that serves in place of cautery. But however, cautery with fire is of quicker help.
And I have already described the treatment of it with sharp medicine in the division, and therefore take that when you have need of it.
Chapter 53.
Of the cauterization of wounds and other similar things.
Many times there happens in the parts below the foot a disease that is called a wound, and it is a large, penetrating cause which injures the foot; and cautery in these cases is done in two ways, that is to say cautery with fire and cautery with hot water.
But cautery with fire is that you heat the concave cautery resembling a vulture's beak, which should be made of iron according to the size which contains the wound in its entirety, and should be of fine edges.
And then place that heated iron on the wound, and then move your hand with the cautery in a circle around the wound until the cautery reaches the depth of the wound. And leave it there for three days until it begins to shed eschar. And then plaster it with crushed wild mallow mixed with salt, and leave the plaster on it for one night, for this will eradicate it from its roots.
And then treat the area with a flesh-generating ointment until it is healed.
And if it is not healed, and this often happens on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet, then you should administer cautery with water in those cases.  Take a cannula of bronze or iron or a vulture's quill, and place it over the wound; then pour a small amount of hot water into the cannula, and hold your hand; and you rotate it with the compression of your hand completely, and let the edge of the cannula be pressed into the root of the wound, and the hot water will find its way to the root of the wound; and let the patient endure the sting of the hot water for a while, about an hour, and then remove it, for the wound with its roots will be eradicated.
And do this with those [wounds] and then with the others until you have treated all of them that are in the body.
And then treat those [sores] after the roots of the wounds are eradicated with those ointments which generate flesh.
Chapter 54.
Concerning the cauterization of tremor.
When someone suffers from tremor due to cold in the nerves, or from a fever of cold origin, or from a similar cause, then you should cauterize them with four or five cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, between each vertebra with one cautery; and with a cautery on their feet, and on their stomach, with an olive-shaped cautery.
And his tremor will subside, and hasten the healing of the cold illness.
Chapter 55.
Concerning the cauterization of accidental blemishes on the body.
When blemishes appear on the body, and there are pustules and fissures caused by thick, corrupted matter; then at the beginning, as it appears, it should be cauterized over the head of the fistula with a fine cautery, with a myrtle stick whose end is heated in a fire; or with a long root of erestologia; or with a lenticular cautery.
And sometimes the cautery is also suitable at the beginning of its expulsion, according to this manner; and they are not believed [to be effective], and the superfluity is broken up by doing this, and heals from them.
However, it is necessary that this be done near an evacuation with phlebotomy.
Chapter 56.
Chapter 56. On the cauterization of a bleeding flux caused by an arrow wound.
Many times there is a flux from an arrow wound which is incised around the wound, which comes from outside, or around the incision of an abscess or cauterization of the limb, and similarly, and it is difficult to stop this.
Therefore, when this happens to someone, then you press with your hand on the orifice of the arrow wound, and place your finger on it tightly many times until the flow of blood stops under your finger, and it does not come out.
And then put small and large olive cauteries in the fire, many in number, and blow on them until they are very hot.
And then take one of these, small or large depending on the location and wound where the artery is broken, on that vein quickly after you have removed your finger, and hold the cautery there until the bleeding is stopped and restrained.
And if the blood is expelled from the orifice of the artery when you remove your finger and remove the cautery, then take another cautery quickly from the cauteries which are prepared in the fire, and do not cease to do this one after another until the bleeding is restrained.
And be careful not to burn the nerve that is there, and that another harm comes to the patient.
And know that when blood flows from the artery, it is not possible to restrain that blood, especially when the artery is large, except in one of four ways: either with a cautery as we have said, or with extraction if it is not extracted, for when it is extracted, the extremities are better burned and the blood is restrained, or that it be tied with thread or with a ligature by strong constriction, or that medicines be placed upon it whose virtue is to restrain blood; and they should be tightened with a cushion with a decent constriction.
But that which administers decent restriction with a ligature and with constriction with cloths or by the application of burning substances and the like, does not confer [its effect] except slowly.
But if this happens to someone and the physician or medicine is not present, then gently open with the index finger over the orifice of that vein as we have said, and attend to the great constriction of it until the blood is stopped from the superior part of the wound, and the finger should not be removed from over the artery; and over the artery let it be sprinkled with very cold water of great coldness until the blood is congealed and thickened; and then consider what need there is of a cautery or medicine.
Of incisions and perforations and cupping and of phlebotomy and of wounds and their similars.
We have already discussed in the first chapter every illness in which cauterization with fire and with burning medicine is suitable, and its occasions and causes, and the necessary instruments with the forms of the cauteries; and I have ordered the chapters from the head to the feet.
And I will proceed in this chapter in the same manner, so that the one seeking this will be relieved, then about that which he will have requested.
And before I begin this, it is necessary, son, that you learn that in this chapter is that which is terrifying in the first chapter on cauterization.
And because it is necessary that there be great caution, for in the operation which is in this chapter, many times there is an evacuation which is with blood, with which life is sustained, from the opening of a vein or incision on an abscess, or opening of a wound, or purification of a wound, or extraction of an arrow, or incision of a stone, and their like. And with all of these are accompanied fear and trembling, and in the worst of them, death.
And I warn you that this hesitation should not fall upon you, for sometimes there falls upon you the handling of men with many kinds of illnesses. And of them there is some who are angry with their illness and death is light upon him, and this because of the vehemence of what he finds in his illness, and because of the length of his illness, and with the illness is a fear which signifies death.
And of those there is one who gives you his wealth and says, you hoping with that for health, and his illness is pernicious.
Therefore it is not fitting that you consent to that which comes to you of which this is the manner; and your caution should be greater than covetousness and your greed; and do not presume any cause for this except through certain knowledge which verifies this to you, and to which follows praiseworthy success.
And use in the cure of all your patients prognostication and indication of him to whom health is returned, for in that is to you help in the acquisition of fame and memory, of praise and of glory.
O, sons, may God inspire in you His understanding and not deny you guidance and protection, for that is in His hand.
And I have ordered this chapter, distinguishing it by chapters as preceded in the chapter on cauteries, from the care of the head to the feet, so that that which you ask of this and of which you have need may be relieved for you.
Chapter One.
Of the treatment of the water which is contained in the heads of children.
Know that this illness often happens to children during childbirth and when the midwife constricts the child's head without skill.
And sometimes it happens for a hidden cause which is not known.
But I have only seen this illness in children; and in all those whom I saw, death followed, and thus it is, in my experience, a fatal affliction for them.
And I have seen that a child whose head was filled with water, and his head was always thus enlarged until he could not support himself because of the size of his head, and moreover the humidity increased until he died.
And this humidity is either collected between the skin and the bone, or it is collected under the bone on the brain.
Because if the humidity is between the skin and the bone and the abscess is small, then you should make an incision in the middle of the head with a fissure in width, and the length of the fissure should be about two finger-widths so that the humidity can drain, and this is the shape of the spatula:
And so if the humidity is more increased and the abscess is larger, then there are two fissures in this manner:
And if the humidity is under the bone, the sign is that you see the sutures of the head open on all sides and the water is squeezed out when you compress it with your hand from the inside, and this is not hidden from you. You should make an incision in the middle of the head with three fissures in this manner:
And then extract all the humidity from the incision; and then tighten the fissures with cloths and lint; and then bathe it from above with wine and oil until the fifth day, and then untie the bandage and treat the wound with tents and ointments, and tighten the head evenly; and let the patient eat dry food with little moisture until the member is strengthened and healed.
And there is another method of incision, that you consider where the magnitude of the abscess and the collection of water appear, for sometimes it is more in the occiput, or in the front part, or on the right, or on the left; and therefore aim with the incision where the abscess and the accumulation of water appear, and do it as best you can.
And observe that you do not cut the artery and cause a flow of blood, and the patient dies from that blood flow with evacuation of humidity.
Chapter Second/Chapter 2.
When someone suffers from cataracts or rheum in the eyes or in the feet, and this is chronic, and the cure is not obtained through medicines, then the final cure in this case is the incision of those two arteries.
And therefore it is necessary that, when you wish to incise them, the patient raises his head, and you should rub the area with a rough cloth so that the arteries appear, and the patient's neck should be constricted with some cloth; and you should consider where the vein pulsates; and the locations of each [artery] in the areas near the ears are compressed, and are thus hidden except in some men.
And then mark the artery with a probe, and then incise each one with the sharp point of a scalpel with an incision extending to the bone, and let this be done along the width of the head.
And if you wish, insert the scalpel under the artery and sever it at the incisions above.
And let the length of the incision be about two fingers, because when a vein is incised, the blood comes out with a pulsating flow, which spurts out frequently.
But if the artery does not appear to the touch, then it is necessary that you measure from the ear the distance of three fingers, and then mark it with a probe, and cut to the bone.
And the amount of blood that should be let is about six ounces, and you should quickly let out more or less, and all this depends on the strength of the patient and the fullness of their artery.
And then examine the wound, and if any part of the splinter remains on the bone, then incise it so that a hot abscess does not develop.
And then bind the wound with lint and linen bandages, and then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
Chapter 3.
Concerning the extraction of arteries which are in the temples.
When someone suffers from chronic migraine or sharp headaches, due to acrimonious humors and a quality in the tissues of the temples, or if it is an old and severe headache similar to these, and it is treated with medical methods of cure and this does not help, then we must try in these illnesses the extraction of the arteries in the temples, or their cauterization as we have shown.
And the manner of the operation and extraction of these is that the patient shaves the hairs which are on the temples; and look for the artery appearing in the temple because it is shown to you by its pulse, and it is hidden except in a few people by the force of cold.
And if it is hidden from you, then the neck of the patient should be constricted with some cloth; and then rub the area with a rough cloth or evaporate the area with warm water until the artery appears to you manifestly. And then you take the spatula of which this is the form: And then you scrape the skin with that [spatula] easily until you reach the artery; and then put on it ointment and extract it to the superior parts until you extract it from the skin and uncover it from the tunics which are beneath it, from every part.
But if the artery is subtle, then wrap it with the end of the [surgical] hook, and then incise a part of it according to the quantity by which its ends are lengthened and contracted, and blood will not flow, for if they are not incised, the blood will not rise at all.
And then evacuate from one to three ounces of blood.
And if the artery is large, then it is necessary that you tie it in two places with strong double silk thread or with cords of linen, and do not allow it putrefaction before the consolidation of the wound and the occurrence of blood flow.
And then incise the superfluity which is between the two ligatures; and do this at that time or at another time.
And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery to the bone with a knife-cautery until its ends are incised, and it will suffice for that same operation.
And it is a better procedure unless the patient has a fever or is of a hot complexion; because cautery is among those things that help to dry out humors, and therefore it is better in this case.
And it is necessary after the extraction of the arteries that you clean the place with old cotton, and that suitable powders are placed on it, and then it should be treated with dry medicines that promote the growth of flesh and with dressings until it is healed.
And if, while you are operating again, bleeding occurs from the artery, then you must attend to staunching that blood, either with a cautery, or by filling the place with cotton, and pressing with your hand until the bleeding is stopped. And if none of those remedies are at hand, then place your finger on the area until the blood clots, and bathe the place with very cold water until the sharpness subsides, and it is constricted as needed.
And what is lighter in the extraction of an artery is that you cauterize the vein with this cautery having two blades, after you have marked the two places with a probe, and apply each, very hot, until they reach the bone and incise the vein in two places, so that what is between the extremities is elongated, because they are not completely consolidated with this cautery.
And this is the form of the cautery:
And let the sharpness of the two blades be equal. But however, if it has less sharpness than two knives it is better, because if it is sharp like two knives close to each other, it will not cut the flesh quickly.
Therefore, since in those [cauteries] there is some thickness, the heat of the fire is retained in them and the flesh is cut lightly.
And this method is better in every respect and gentler.
And let the space which is between the two blades be the amount of the thickness of a finger.
Chapter Four.
Of the treatment of sharp and acrid eye inflammations.
When there are acrid tears, and it is the inflammation of those veins which are on the surface of the head, and you don't find any cause for treatment with medicine, and sometimes the patient's face reddens and they feel in their forehead a crawling as if it were the crawling of ants, and their eyes are swollen, moist so that the hairs around them are matted, and the eyelids are inflamed by the acridity of the tears, the ancients used various methods in the treatment of this condition, and they called this treatment "spassa.
And it is that you command the patient to shave the hairs which are on their forehead, and then incise three fissures on the forehead, equally distant according to the length of the forehead. And if the length of the fissure reaches two fingers: one fissure should be equally distant from the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second according to the length a little from the movement of the muscles which are in the tear duct, and the third on the other side.
And be careful of the incision of the arteries which are on both sides, and lengthen your hand from the continuation of both jaws. And if the space of each incision is the quantity of three fingers adjusted.
And if you have a piece of prepared sponge or dried cloths ready with which to dry the blood.
And then introduce a spatula with two sharp ends, of which this is the form of its incision: which is from the part of the temples to the second incision. Excoriate with that [tool/spatula] the whole area which is between the two incisions, with the scalpel which is on the bone, and then do this from the middle incision to the second incision. And then withdraw that spatula and introduce into the first incision again another instrument which is called a curette, sharp on one side and not sharp on the other.
And place the sharp edge of that [curette] against the flesh attached to the bone, and the blunt edge towards the bone, and push it in until it reaches the middle fissure, and sever with it all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes.
But let the incision be continued to that appearance of the bone, and then do this in the middle fissure to the other fissure.
And after a quantity of blood has flowed, press the places of the congealed blood clots.
And then place in each fissure a piece of old linen, and put on these powders soaked in wine and oil and vinegar, and see that a hot abscess does not develop.
And on the third day, untie the bandage and administer a large infusion of warm or tepid water, and then treat it with basilicon ointment with rose oil and others until the wounds are healed.
Chapter 5.
Chapter 5: On the treatment of tears due to cataracts and those descending into the eyes from the inner parts of the head.
When someone experiences sharp and persistent cataracts, and the patient's eyes appear small and weakened, and their sight is impaired, and the eyelids are ulcerated and their skin shed, and there is sharp, throbbing pain in the forehead and consequent sneezing, then know from these symptoms that the cataracts and matter originate from many veins proceeding from the inner parts.
And the best treatment in such cases is this: order the patient to shave their forehead, and then make an incision in the middle of the forehead, a small one in width (and begin the incision from the left temple to the right temple; let the incision be between the bones; and extend your hand from the temples' lacerations, which are made sore by chewing), until the bone is exposed.
Dry all the blood with a sponge or a dry cloth, and then fill the space between the two lips of the incision with old cotton or linen cloths. And then bind it above with powders boiled in wine and oil so that a hot abscess does not develop.
And when you unbind it and see that the abscess has diminished, then it is necessary to scrape the bone until new flesh begins to grow, and then treat it with a drying regimen which promotes the growth of flesh, thus: if you take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony and mix them, and from this make a plaster, and apply it to these wounds to encourage the growth of new flesh.
Chapter 6.
Concerning the treatment of what falls into the ears.
Every cause that falls into the ears is one of four types, for it is either a mineral stone or something similar to a stone, such as iron or glass, or it is from a plant, such as a seed or a bean, or it is a fluid substance such as water and sour wine and things similar to them, or some animal.
And so when a stone falls into the ear or another similar cause of those things which do not soften or grow in the ear, and expose the ear to the sun, and if you see the stone, then instill into it some violet oil or sesame oil, and then proceed with its extraction, and induce sneezing with a suitable remedy, and close the nostrils before the onset of sneezing. And then place some pieces of cloth or wool around the ear, and pull the ear upwards at the top, for many times it is expelled with these actions.
And if it is not expelled, then proceed with its extraction using the instrument called a slender ear-picker, of which this is the form:
And if it is expelled with the picker, it is good; and if not, then proceed with its extraction with a slender probe of little doubling.
And so if it is not expelled by this, then make a small tube of brass and insert the end of the tube into the opening of the ear and seal around the tube with wax and softened oil so that nothing is open but the tube. And then extract it with your breath with strong suction, for many times this has been done as we have recounted.
But if it is not expelled in this manner, then take a small amount of lit flax or a wick prepared for catching birds, and place that on the end of a rod, and then carefully wrap a decent cotton around that. And then insert that into the opening of the ear easily, and then dry the ear of its moisture.
And so if it is not expelled by all the means we have recounted, then you should consider cutting it out before it becomes a hot abscess or spasm.
And the manner of cutting it out is that you first bleed the patient from the cephalic vein and extract blood according to the patient's strength, and then hold the ear between your hands and turn the ear upwards, and make a small incision at the root of the ear below the cartilage in the well-prepared place. And let the incision be crescent-shaped until you reach the stone; and, the stone found, remove it if you can with appropriate instruments; and then close the incision quickly, and treat it until it is healed.
And if the thing causing the problem in the ear is a growth that is growing and swollen, then administer its treatment and extraction; but if it does not yield to such treatment, then take finely powdered litharge according to this method: and use that for the excision of the growth that has fallen into the ear.
And do not do this when you think that it is already moistened by the vapor of the ear, and apply it on small pieces of cloth, and then remove them with tweezers or a delicate instrument, or with an incision as we have said, for its extraction is thus eased.
But if water has entered the ear, the patient should use sneezing as a first resort, and fill their ear with some old cotton, and lie down on the ear into which the water has entered; and if it is expelled by this, it is good; and if not, then take several heated stones and pebbles, according to the length of the finger, and heat them slightly in the fire, and let the patient insert one of these into the opening of their ear and jump on one foot on that side and strike with another stone upon the stone that is inside the ear. Therefore, do not cease this with the stone until all the water is expelled.
Therefore, do not cease this with the stone until all the water is expelled. And if the water is not expelled in this way, take some paper or a wick, and place one end of it in the ear and apply the other end to a fire until the majority of it is burned.
And then put in another wick and do this several times until all the water is expelled, and remove it with a cannula as described above for the extracting stone.
But in the extraction of a creature entering that ear, if it is small, such as a fly or similar, cure it as we have said in the division; but if it is of large size, which appears to the sense of sight, then administer its extraction with forceps and hooks, and its cause is lighter than all the other causes that fall into the ear.
But in the extraction of a worm generated in the ear, when you cure it with what we have said in the division and in the treatise on distillations and your cure does not succeed, then you should expose the ear to the sun.
And then, if any cause of the worms appears there, extract it with forceps or with fine hooks; but if no cause appears, then take a cannula that is narrow below and wide above, of which this is the form: And insert the narrow end into the ear according to the amount the patient can tolerate; and then suck with it with strong suction, and do this many times until all the worms are expelled.
But if it does not obey you in this way, then you plug and close the circumference of the cannula with wax as we have said; then administer distillations which the ancients have already proven in the cure of worms, and you will find this in the treatise on distillations.
And let your effusion, with which you pour the medicinal oils into the ear, be with this instrument, of which this is the form: And make it of silver or bronze, narrow below, in which there is a small hole, and flat above.
And then let it be such that it pushes what is in the cavity of the cannula continuously where it will be necessary. And if you wish, take a ray (possibly referring to a thin, flexible instrument) and wrap its extremity decently with cotton, and then drop oil into the concavity of the ear, or juice of some herb, or whatever you wish of these medicines into the cannula — and that is in the ear — and then introduce the ray with cotton on top and press with your hand that, with a moderate compression, until the oil is expelled into the concavity of the hearing and the patient feels the oil inside.
And what is poured into the ear should already be warmed a little with fire. And be careful that the substance which you instill into the ear is not too cold, for ear medicines do not tolerate that.
Chapter 7.
On the treatment of ear obstructions.
Sometimes children are born without perforated ears, and this also happens to some adults, an obstruction in the ear canal due to injury or flesh growing there; and this obstruction sometimes occurs in the entrance of the ear canal, which prevents hearing, and sometimes it is in the outer parts.
And that which occurs at the entrance, which prevents hearing, is in most cases difficult to cure.
And in the case where hearing is possible, you should expose the patient's ear to the sun and examine it. And then, if you see an apparent obstruction, open it with a fine spatula, which has this form:
If its end is narrow, one side being sharp and the other not; and the spatula should be two finger-widths wide so that it does not injure the ear.
And then, if the obstruction is due to flesh grown in the ear or its canal, then remove that with fine hooks and incise it vigorously until all the flesh is removed.
And if the obstruction is in the lobe of the ear, then take a fine, thin probe and heat it slightly with fire, and then insert it into the ear canal.
And then, if you have felt an obstruction with what the patient easily finds, due to difficulty in hearing, gently force the obstruction; and be careful not to injure the nerves of the ear.
Then, place in the ear a piece of linen according to the size of the opening, which you have wrapped in Egyptian ointment; and do this for some days until you are sure of the healing of the wound; or take a wick and soak it in rosewater and sprinkle it with finely crushed seeds and use it; and if you see the ear is already abscessed, then you must remove the wick and replace it with another wick which you will wrap in a cerate made with rose oil, until the abscess is completely drained; and then treat it until it is healed.
But if bleeding occurs, then submerge a sponge or cloth in cold water and place it on the ear, and use the other treatment which restricts the flow of blood, which is described in the treatise on distillation.
Chapter 8.
Concerning the treatment of a stye which develops on the eyelids.
Styes which develop on the eyelids are sometimes moist, sometimes dry.
Therefore it is necessary that you hold them with forceps or with tweezers, and incise them with a spatula from their roots, and then place a poultice on the affected areas.
But if pain with bleeding occurs, then cauterize them with a fine lenticular cautery.
And the best cauterization is near the incisions, and often they return when some cause remains from their roots; and when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
Chapter 9.
Treatment of swelling that comes to the eyelids of the eyes.
Often there develops in the eyelids of the eyes a certain growth which resembles a swelling in its firmness and hardness, and because of its size it is called a swelling.
And it is an accumulation of thick moisture in the eyelid, below and above.
Therefore, the operation on them is that you consider then if the swelling is proceeding in such a way that it appears from the eyelid and is spread throughout; and its cause is light.
Then make an incision on it lengthwise, and then peel it off entirely easily until it comes off, and then suspend it with a hook and excise it.
And if the wound is large, then you close it with sutures; and treat it until it is healed.
And if it is small, you will not suffer harm from it because the ointment heals and closes it.
And if the growth is leaning toward the inner parts of the eyelid, beyond the inner surface, then raise the eyelid and suspend the growth with a hook,  without making an incision, and press it from all sides; and if the eyelid is lengthened by the incision, that harms nothing.
Then, after the incision, wash the eye with salt water; and treat the area with a healing agent until it is healed.
Chapter 10.
Concerning the treatment of a growth on the upper eyelid.
A growth (or excrescence) is a grey mass which is generated in the membranes of the upper eyelid, and especially affects children, it obscures their eyes and causes them to have watery eyes. And they cannot look at the brightness of the sun because tears well up in them.
And therefore you see them lying on their faces all the time, and sleeping on their faces; and the eyelids below their eyebrows are moist, which already have a swollen covering, and the imminence of a growth is apparent in the eye; and that when you press the area with your fingers, you feel the growth within.
And a certain manner of operation is this: the patient rests their head on your lap, and you place a cloth between you and them, and make a circle of it according to the size containing the whole growth, and place that over it and press with your fingers all around so that the growth is gathered in the middle of the circle, and then make an incision in the middle of that swelling with a sharp lancet, the incision being no larger than that made in bloodletting.
But in the incision it is necessary that you cut completely through until you reach the growth, for in most cases the growth yields to the incision as a white fatty substance.
Then extract it with cloths which you have wrapped around your fingers at the edges and roll it between your right and left hand until it is completely removed.
And be careful not to go too deep in the incision so that with the lancet you do not reach the eye and injure it.
But if the growth does not appear at the beginning of the incision, then continue the incision a little gently until the growth appears; and then extract it as we have said; and then soak cloths in wine and vinegar, and place them on the area and compress it with powders.
And some crush salt and place it in the cavity of the incision so that it absorbs the remaining moisture.
And then care for it until it is healed.
But if a hot abscess occurs at the site, then treat it with emollient plasters until it is healed.
Chapter 11.
Of the ways of touching the eye.
When in the eyelids of the eyes, hairs grow beneath the natural hairs and are ingrown, then these harm the eye and cause various diseases, such as constant tears and softening of the eyelids and membrane, until this becomes a cause of destruction of the eye, which is called a  "tactinir" of the eye. It is treated in four ways: either by cautery with fire; or with a sharp medicine as previously stated in the chapter on cautery; or the tactinir is treated by incision and suture; or by tubes, as I shall explain.
Therefore, it is necessary that you place the patient's head in your lap; then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand, and if it is turned, it is good; and if not, insert a needle into that which is closest to the part below the eyelid, and make the needle penetrate upwards, and this should be — near the edge of the eyelid from which the hairs grow — near the hairs, and pull the hair upwards with the eyelid, and turn it with the ray [of light].
Then make an incision in the inner part of the eyelid below the ingrown hairs with a sharp instrument from the larger tear duct to the smaller tear duct; and then extract the hair and place small pieces of cotton or cloth under the eyelid, and then bind it over the eyelid with a bandage, and let it be like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
However, the shape should be according to the amount of elevation of the eyelid, for this varies among men, for some it is necessary that a large amount be incised from the eyelid according to the extent to which the eyelid is softened.
Then make an incision with the instrument along the two lines which you have marked, beginning from the larger tear duct to the smaller tear duct. And if your incision is near the natural hairs, let it be like the thickness of a king's [hair].  (The meaning is slightly ambiguous here; "rey" likely refers to a royal's hair, implying a very fine cut.)
Then place the ointment in one of the two corners of the wound, and then scrape it all, and then join the two lips of the wound with glue or fine wool thread, and wipe away the blood, and apply what is superfluous of the threads to the two eyebrows with some sticky substance, if you wish to do so, and if not, do not worry.
Then leave the suture of the threads for three or four days, and then treat it.
And if you wish, leave the wound without sutures, and treat it with something that dries and constricts, because the eyelid is raised by the sealing of the wound and its healing; but suture is better, and this is what the ancients said, to be precise.
However, let there be diligence on the part of the surgeon, and it is a good operation, and let there be no fear in him/her.
And there is another way to treat it, which is to mark on the eyelid a figure like a myrtle leaf, and then raise the eyelid with three ointments, separated and combined according to this form:
But if this is not possible, to hold the ointments, and this is not equal, then take a needle on which there is thread and place it in the middle of the figure, and insert the other thread near the larger lacrimal duct, and the second thread near the smaller lacrimal duct, and adjust the threads between your fingers with equality, and then with those, raise your hand with equal elevation, raise the whole eyelid on which it is marked, as we have recounted.
And then join the two lips of the wound with suture, and treat it until it is healed.
But if an abscess occurs near your incision or fissure, treat that abscess with a plaster and something similar, and with ointment.
And sometimes it happens to the eyelid that its hairs are inverted; then you should use what we have said about incision; however, suture in each case is more skillful.
To bind with splints is according to this form: and it is that you should turn back the eyelid and incise the figure that is inside as I have recounted; and then skillfully make two splints or two thin rods, whose length should be according to the length of the eyelid and whose width should be less than the width of the space. And you have already incised at the ends of each part, where you have the threads.
Then carefully add each [splint] with subtlety over what is superfluous of the eyelid's skin, and bind the splints to each part with a strong binding, and leave it for some days, because the growth, due to the binding, will die and dry up and will rot until it falls off by itself.
But if it is delayed, then break it with forceps, and then cure the wound until it is healed.
Then, once it is solidified, the eyelid is raised and the hairs do not prick.
And this is the form of two splints which you will make according to this form: and have the quantity of length and width neither more nor less.
Chapter 12.
Chapter 12. Of the elevation of prickly hairs in the eye with a needle when the hair is hard.
When there are unnatural, hard, rough, and prickly hairs in the eyes, then the operation is that you take a fine needle, and place on it a fine silken thread and lion [possibly referring to lion's hair or a type of fine thread], and carefully adjust its ends so that you do not injure the eye in any way. And let the length of the threads be the quantity of a palm's width.
And then you prepare another short, fine thread below it, and tie its ends if you wish.
And then have the patient place their head in your lap, and be near the sun so that your work is illuminated, for it is a subtle and delicate operation.
And then insert the needle into the root of the offending hair, which needs to be removed, and make it penetrate the eyelid quickly until you extract it above the natural hair.
And then pull the hair out and insert it into a container, and let the hairs be one or two or three and no more.
And then pull your hand with it until the hair is extracted with tweezers from the eyelid along with the natural hair.
But if it is pulled with tweezers and the hair is not removed, you will pull the tweezers downwards with the thread which you have composed with it, until the tweezers are removed from the wound above.
And examine it with the vision of the eye, for then you will remove the tweezers and the thread, and then clean and close the wound, and leave it closed for two or three days, until the hair adheres to its place and good flesh grows over it.
And if the hair is shorter, then you attach a long hair from the natural hairs, and it is elevated with that, or you leave it until it is lengthened by some space, and then you elevate it.
Chapter 13.
Concerning the treatment of a stye which appears on the upper eyelid.
When a stye appears in the eye, and it is a contraction of the eyelid when it is contracted upwards, or to the right or left side, due to poor consolidation of a wound or incision or cautery, and it is called lagophthalmos, and this stye is either natural or accidental, and it is caused by the consolidation of a wound or incision or cautery, or similar poorly healed conditions.
The method of operation is that you should incise that consolidation and separate its lips, and place between them a small piece of linen cloth, and bind them until they are healed.
And it is not advisable that you use treatments that dry or constrict; for if you do that, the stye will return worse than it ever was before.
Use on it things that soften, such as fenugreek, and apply a poultice with the water in which mallows and linseed have been boiled, or diachylon ointment, which should be liquefied with some oil, and soak the linen cloth in it, and treat it with that.
And the key to your treatment is that you should strive with all your skill that it does not consolidate in a different way than it was at the beginning.
And this operation, which we have described, is nothing but a correction of the stye so that it does not return to its previous form.
Chapter 14.
Concerning the treatment of a stye which is formed on the lower eyelid.
This stye, which forms on the lower eyelid—which is truly called a stye—is of two kinds: one natural, the other accidental.
But the accidental one is caused by a wound, or a cut, or cautery, or other similar things.
And the method of its operation is that you take a needle with double thread, and insert it into the flesh, passing it from the left lacrimal duct to the right lacrimal duct, until the thread reaches both ends of the flesh.
Then stretch the flesh upwards with the needle and sew it with the needle, and incise it with a wide spatula. And if the eyelid then returns to its proper shape, it is good; but if not, take a splint and place it in the split, and with it reshape the eyelid, and sew the two fissures in the lower eyelid.
And let the ends of the two fissures be at two angles of the incision, which you have made so that they meet, and let an angle be made of them so that when they are brought together, a figure is made of them.
And this figure is the Greek letter: Lambda (Λ).
Then remove the flesh on that side, the amount that is the width of the sharp lower eyelid.
And then join the separated parts and sew them with wool thread; and then treat them with what we have said of emollient medicines and poultices until it is healed.
And if an abscess develops through a fissure, suture, or cautery, then you should make a flat incision on the skin of the eyelid as previously described. And then separate [the wound] with a poultice between two lips, as we have said.
In summary, concerning the treatment of an abscess whether above or below, the operation should proceed as prepared for the form of the abscess, which presents in many different forms.
And the skillful surgeon always prepares the instruments in every way possible so that he may restore the form to its natural state, or close to it, and the patient, according to what suits him in terms of the operation and the instruments, in the best conditions.
Chapter 15.
Of the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or to the cornea.
When this consolidation occurs in such a way that the eyelid is solidified above with the white of the eye, and its natural movement and function are impeded, then you must insert the tip of a probe under the eyelid and raise it, or spread it with an unguent.
And then you incise the adhesion with a fine spatula, which should not be sharply pointed for the incisions, but rather somewhat blunt, so that the patient is not disturbed during the operation, and move the spatula so that it does not injure the eye with its sharpness.
And let your incision gently separate that adhesion until the eyelid is returned to its natural form and the adhesion is completely healed.
And then you put salt water in the eye with which you wash it; or distill into it honey dissolved in water.
And then separate the eyelid from the eye with a small, blunt instrument, and place wool soaked in egg white on the eye, and then on the third day use consolidative remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 16.
Concerning the incision of the nail and the fleshy eminence of the tear ducts.
Know that a nail is of two types, for it is either nervous, and is similar to hard, fine horn; or it is non-nervous, similar to congealed white moisture, which when an iron touches it, or is forced to take hold with an instrument, is cut and the instrument is not embedded in it.
And both types do not begin except from the larger tear duct until it grows little by little to cover the sight and prohibits light and the movement of the eye.
But the manner of operating in its incision is that the patient places his head on your lap, and then open his eyes, and raise the eyelid with your hand, and then grasp the nail with a small, double-ended instrument and extend it towards the upper parts. Then take a needle and insert into it a horsehair, or ox hair, or cow hair, or similar, or strong thread, or double the end of the needle little by little and place it in the middle of the nail, and penetrate it with the needle, and tie the nail with thread; and extend it to the upper parts, and scrape with the hair the side of the nail which covers the pupil. And thus you follow it with the hair into the back of it.
And then you incise the remainder at the root of the tear duct with a thin spatula or with small scissors, and leave the flesh of the natural tear duct so that through the incision of that, a continuous flow of tears does not occur.
And sometimes the nail, with only the instrument extended, or with thread, as we have said, and then it should be scraped with a lion spatula, of which this is its form:
And be careful that with the spatula you do not touch the cornea and that a rupture occurs in it, and that the pupil is perforated.
Then, after the incision, put a little crushed salt or a powder made of cyclamen into the eye, and leave it there until the next day; and then treat it with what is appropriate until it is healed.
And if the nail is not sensitive and you cannot insert the needle, nor is it fixed to the nail bed with the instrument, then many times this type of nail is cured with medicines, and is healed in the manner I have recounted in the division [or section].
And if you wish to incise it, then you open the patient's eye and take a thin lion spatula of sharp steel, according to this form: with subtlety.  (Or: delicately; with precision) And if you see that it is rarefied and is congested and rooted there, then instill into the eye from your syringe a powder made of cyclamen, or with rue, or with crushed salt, and occlude the eye until the next day.
Then repeat the operation on it until all that is in it is removed, unless, on the contrary, a hot abscess forms in the eye; for then you leave it alone, and treat the abscess first until it is healed.
And then repeat your operation on it with reason until it is healed. (Or: ...until it is cured; ...until it is made whole)
The prominence of the lacrimal flesh, if it harms the eye greatly, should be suspended with a hook; and incise it on one side, and do not extend the incision lest you cut the flow of tears.
Then instill into the lacrimal duct rue and cyclamen powder until it is healed.
Chapter 17.
Concerning the incision of a stye and that which is born of flesh adhering to the eye.
Sometimes in the eyes of some, red flesh is grown, and it is raised until it covers the pupil, or approaches or presses upon the eyelids and strongly closes the eyelids at the outer parts and it is similar to a rose of a balustrade (or, a rose-shaped growth).
But the operation is that the patient places his head on your lap; and then open the eyes of that one and collect all that flesh with instruments convenient for that, and hold that with forceps or with scissors; and then incise the flesh at the beginning until all is finished with the lancet, and guard the eye that you do not injure it during your operation.
And let your incision, with which you incise those things, be with a spatula which we have recommended in the incision of the nail, or with small scissors with which hair is collected, according to how the form of it will come to this chapter.
Then when your incision is completed and all that flesh is removed, then fill the eye with crushed salt, or instill into it red powder similar to that of corrosive medicines, and place over the eye externally a cotton compress with egg white until it is secured from hot abscess.
And if some cause of inflammation remains and hot blood is seen, and you fear a hot abscess, then leave the eye and treat that abscess with that which will yield that abscess, and then repeat the operation on it until it is healed, and similarly do with the fleshy growth which happens in the eye of this kind.
But however, you should avoid all treatment of the fragile eye by natural or accidental means, working with iron, and do not put your hand to any of these operations until you see that that member can tolerate that operation.
Chapter 18.
Concerning the collection of pus in the eye.
Pus is a collection of red veins which are hardened on the eye and impede vision by their action, and they weaken the eye over a long period of days.
Therefore, it is necessary at the beginning that you consider if the eye in which there is pus is strong and has no other disease than pus; then you collect that pus.
And it is that you command the patient to place his head in your lap, and then suspend those veins with an oncia or two, according to your judgment; and let that oncia be of subtle doubling according to this form:
Or two oncias gradually in one piece according to this form:
And then those veins should be collected with fine forceps, with subtlety, and wipe away the blood little by little, until you see those veins being removed from the eye and are retracted.
And beware that you do not injure the eye with the ends of the spatula; and if your operation is at midday before the sun, and you are very firm in your operation, that you only incise those veins.
And when you have completed it, then you distil into the eye verdigris or rue so that with its sharpness it corrodes what has been removed from the eyelid.
But if this is not possible for you, collect everything at that time, and then you plaster it all with something that soothes his pain, and leave it for a few days until his pain is soothed and the risk of a hot abscess is avoided.
And then repeat on him according to the same manner until he is healed.
And this is the form of the forceps:
Chapter 19.
Concerning the reduction of a deviated nose.
When you treat a deviated nose with cautery or with a sharp, burning medicine, as narrated previously, and it is not healed, then there is no other remedy than to make incisions on the abscess before its maturation, and to extract all the humidity which is within it and the pus, until the bone is uncovered.
And so, when the bone is uncovered and you see corruption or blackness in it, then you scrape it with an instrument of which this is the form:
And it is named a rasp, and it should be made of Indian iron, and its head should be round, like a chisel, which should be pointed by filing or sharpened by subtle sharpening (as is shown in the following form).
And place that [rasp] on the corrupted part of the bone, and then rotate it between your fingers, and press your hand little by little until you know that the corruption is scraped away.
And this should be done several times, and then restore the place with drying and astringent substances.
Then, if the place is consolidated and good flesh has grown there and the body of the wound is closed and remains so for forty days, and it is not renewed and is not festering and no accident happens to it, then you will know that it is healed.
And if not, then there is no other way but to reduce the fissure to the shape of the nose, and according to this method:  that is, that you uncover the underlying bone with an iron instrument or a sharp medicine, and when the bone is uncovered, then you take a trephine of this shape:
Let the extremity of the iron trephine be triangular, and its shaft be slender and tapering towards the extremity, like this.
And then place that [trephine] on the bone, and let it be near the lacrimal duct; and extend your hand a little from the eye, and then rotate your hand with the trephine until it penetrates all the bone, and the patient will feel this because they will feel air escaping when you move your hand.
Then restore the area with styptic and drying medicines as you have been taught.
Then, when the flesh grows and the area hardens, the matter which flowed to the outside parts returns to the nose, therefore this is easier on the patient.
Chapter 20.
On the reduction of the protrusion of the eye.
When the eye protrudes entirely and is not injured by a wound, diminution, or weakening, then you should reassure the patient and watch over them. Then apply cupping glasses to the neck without scarification and suction for good evacuation; and then apply to the eye an ointment which is made from acanthus, aloe, incense and sarcocolla, and then firmly attach the plaster to the eye with many powders.
And the method of the powders is that you take many lion cloths, and each cloth should be folded into four layers; and make many of these.
And then place those one upon the other according to the amount that the eye requires. And then bind them tightly with a hard cloth with a firm bandage; and repeat the cupping with suction without scarification; and then remove the cupping glasses and leave the eye bandaged day and night.
But if meanwhile the ligament is weakened, then it should be bound very tightly.
And then remove the bandage during the day and night, as we have said.
And if sometimes the eye is already reduced, it is good, and if not, then repeat the plaster with the powders and the bandage and the cupping until it is healed.
Chapter 21.
Concerning the incision of the prominence of the uvea. (Uvea here refers to the uvea of the eye)
When a rupture occurs in the uvea, and it protrudes beyond the eyelids like a grape, and the person's appearance is marred by it, and you wish to incise it, then the operation is as we have recounted, that you insert the needle into the root of the uvea from the lower part to the upper part, and then place another needle with double thread from the lacrimal side, and make that penetrate and release the first needle according to its position; and then incise the area of the double thread and lift with that the part of the uvea in the circumference of the needle, and tighten that tightly.
And then remove the needle and place on the eye wool infused in egg white and allow the thread to adhere to the uvea.
And then treat the eye with something that will comfort it until the wound is healed.
And sometimes gather from all sides with a circle of cloth around the eye a large prominent area, and then it should be perforated with a fine spatula that reaches the pupil of the eye, and the albuminous humor will run, and the eye will descend and enter immediately. (This refers to a procedure likely involving draining fluid from the eye).
And then tighten it until it is healed.
Chapter 22.
On the treatment of alconati.  (This likely refers to a specific ailment or condition, the exact nature of which would require further context from the treatise.)
This illness, which is called alconati, is nothing but a swelling which is located in the eye, similar to descending water, but it is not that. (The description suggests a watery swelling or discharge in the eye, different from a simple watery discharge.)
But the method of working on it is that you make the patient sit on a prepared and straight seat, and then take their head in your hands on both sides and manipulate it until you see the swelling descend to the lower parts, and then it should be dried so it doesn’t descend, and the light should be obstructed, and the patient should see things as they were seen. (This describes a procedure for treating the eye swelling, involving positioning the patient, manipulating the head to encourage drainage, and controlling light exposure.)
And if it does not descend downwards, know that it is water. (This indicates that if the swelling doesn't drain, it's diagnosed as being purely watery in nature.)
But if the descent of the swelling is not prepared with what we have said, then make the patient sit between your hands and then take a thin spatula and use it on the eyelid, carefully around the juncture of the conjunctiva with the cornea in the limbus (towards the empty space), until the swelling is expelled. (This describes an alternative procedure using a spatula to manually remove the swelling if the initial method fails.  The "empty space" likely refers to the area where the swelling is visible.)
Then, once it is expelled, you instill warm water into the eye in which you have mixed honey, or water in which you have already boiled fenugreek and honey. (This describes post-procedure treatment involving instilling a honey and/or fenugreek solution into the eye.)
And then it should be treated with other remedies until it is healed. (This indicates further treatment is needed to complete the healing process.)
Chapter 22.
On the treatment of the watery discharge from the eye.
We have already discussed the types of watery eye discharge in the division and which ones should be perforated, declaring this according to the health condition. (This refers back to a previous section describing different types of eye discharge and appropriate treatment based on those types.)
Then you should have the patient sit between your legs on a chair and bind their healthy eye, tying it tightly.  (This describes positioning the patient and temporarily occluding the unaffected eye.)
And then place your left hand near the eyelid of their eye, if the eye with the watery discharge is the left eye; or with your right hand, if the eye is the right one. (This explains which hand to use depending on which eye needs treatment.)
And then with your right hand, take an almond, if the eye is the left one; or with your left hand, if the eye is the right one. (This instructs the physician to use the opposite hand to hold an almond, presumably to apply it as part of the treatment.)
And then place the end of the almond near the cornea, along the width of the iris in the white of the eye, on the side of the smaller lachrymal duct, and then gently press the almond and rotate your hand with it. (This describes the precise application of the almond to the eye.)
And then penetrate the white of the eye and feel that the almond has reached the empty space/cavity. (This indicates the almond should be pushed into a specific area of the eye.)
And it should be that the path of the almond to the preon (presumably a landmark) is the measure of the space which is from the pupil to the end of the blackness (iris), and that is the cornea of the eye; for you will see with this pupil through the clarity of the corneal tunic.  (This is a complex sentence describing the proper distance to apply the almond. "Preon" is likely a medical term not easily translatable without further context.)
And then place the almond into the place where the water (presumably aqueous humor) is, and then you draw it down one time and then another, and if the water descends immediately, then you see the patient whose sight is immediately restored, and the almond in their eye. (This describes the manipulation of the almond to drain fluid, leading to improved vision.)
And then rest a little; then if the water has descended, then you repeat that again before the almond is removed. (This advises a period of rest and potential repetition of the procedure.)
And then when it is dried and does not descend, then you extract the almond easily, and gently rub with your hand, and then dissolve a little clear rock salt in water and with that wash the eye inside; and then place outside the eye cotton or tow or wool infused in rose oil and egg white and bind the eye with this.  (This describes post-procedure care including removing the almond, washing the eye, and applying a soothing ointment.)
But we and those of our time place over that a comminuted (crushed) mixture with egg white. (This indicates a different method or addition to the treatment using a crushed substance and egg white.)
And if the almond does not obey you upon entry into the eye due to its hardness — for there are some men whose eyes are very hard — then it is necessary that you take the spatula which is named alberid, of which this is the form: (This explains an alternative approach if the almond is difficult to insert due to the hardness of the eye.  It introduces a specific instrument, the "alberid," for the procedure.)
And then perforate that joint with it, and do not thrust your hand into the hole, and it is only that you make a subtle path for the almond. (This describes the use of the alberid to create a small opening, advising against excessive force.)
And then introduce the almond as we have said. (This is a simple instruction to proceed with the almond insertion, referring back to earlier instructions.)
And for the completion of your work, let a sleeping place be prepared for the patient, decently made, in which he sleeps on his back in a dark room, and let all movements be prohibited. (This outlines post-procedure care: rest in a dark, quiet place to promote healing and prevent disruption.)
And place him in such a position that his body is aligned, and he does not turn his head to the right or left at all.  (This further emphasizes the need for stillness and proper positioning during recovery, ensuring the patient remains aligned and doesn't move their head.)
And let the bandage remain according to its disposition until the third day. (This instructs to leave the dressing undisturbed until the third day.)
And then unbind it in that dark room and avoid exposing it to strong light; show him some things, and then reapply the bandage until the seventh day. (This describes a gradual process of loosening and removing the bandage,  limiting light exposure, and then re-bandaging at a later date.)
And it is not fitting that you do this at the hour of the cures or immediately after the infusion. (This indicates that the procedure described should not be performed during or immediately after other treatments or medication.) Furthermore, it is necessary that you avoid this because the water may easily rise due to great and vehement observation/scrutiny. (This suggests that close observation or examination of the affected area might cause a problematic reaction, possibly the water rising, so the procedure should be handled carefully and with minimal observation.)
But if a hot abscess occurs, then it is necessary that you unbind the wound before the seventh day and rectify it with something that cures the abscess. (This provides an exception to the previous instructions: if an abscess develops, the bandage should be removed earlier and the abscess treated.)
Then you blindfold him and place a cloth or mask over his face, by which his sight is regulated, leaving him in a dark room for some days. (This describes a treatment involving blindfolding the patient and keeping them in a dark room for a period of time.)
And then he should be moved from that place gradually and should think about the causes of his ailment.  (This suggests a gradual transition out of the dark room and a focus on the potential causes of the illness, perhaps as part of a broader healing process.)
And know that in surgery, the student is not excused from seeing some things, and then you should be bold/confident in the operation. (This indicates that even students should observe certain procedures and that the practitioner should have confidence in their surgical skills.)
And it has come to us from some of those who are in Artach, and someone said that they made a fire in Ayrac, a perforated vessel, with which the water is sucked up. (This describes a reported procedure involving fire and a perforated vessel, possibly for water purification or a medical treatment; the exact meaning of "Artach" and "Ayrac" is unclear without further context.)
However, I have not seen anyone in our land who has perfected this, nor have I read this in any of the books of the ancients; and it is possible that this is new/novel. (The author expresses skepticism about the reported procedure, stating they haven't seen it practiced locally or documented in established medical texts.)
And these are the forms of the types of vessels so that whoever is ignorant of them may know them:
And they should be made of brass or iron, specifically, and their ends should have this triangular subtlety, the sharp end like this, which is the form. (This describes the construction of the vessels, specifying the material and a triangular shape with a pointed end.)
Chapter 24.
Concerning the treatment of rotten flesh in the nose.
When various fleshy growths appear in the nose, some of which resemble a very small scorpion, or a polyp fish; and this illness is called polyp because it resembles that fish in appearance. And from it is cancerous flesh, ulcerated, of dark color; and from it is what is lion flesh, not of dark color. (This describes different types of flesh growth: cancerous, ulcerated and dark, and another, "lion flesh", which is not dark).
Therefore, in the case of these flesh growths that are not malignant or cancerous ("lion flesh"), you should make the patient sit between your hands and place them in the sun, open their nostrils, and gently touch those growths with your finger. Then extract that [growth] from the outer parts, and then cut away what you have grasped of it with a sharp, thin spatula, from one side until you know that all the flesh has been removed;  if any part remains from which excision is possible, then you shall scrape that with one of the fine instruments easily until nothing remains of it. But if it bleeds profusely or is a hot, inflamed abscess, then apply what is necessary; or if it is one of the malignant abscesses, then you should incise and cauterize it until the bleeding stops and all cavities are removed.
Then let there be poured into the nose, near the incision, strong wine and water or wine. But if the nose is open and no moisture proceeds from it to the palate, then know that it is healed.
But if the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then you know that inside there is rotten flesh in the deeper bones of the nose to which excision has not reached.
Then it is necessary that you introduce a linen thread into it, to which some thickness has been added, and tie knots on it, placing between each knot the amount of a finger or less, and instruct the patient to introduce one end of the thread into the nose with a rod or with any other instrument that is possible for them.
And after this has been done, let them draw in its scent until it reaches the nasal passages and is expelled through their throat, for often children at school do something similar, and it is an easy thing for whoever wants to do it.
Then place the two ends of the thread, one end protruding from the nose and the other remaining inside the nose, and then apply sawdust mixed with the knots that are on the thread, and do this until you know that the flesh is now together with the knots of the thread.
Then remove the thread, and immediately after the extraction of the blood, apply a poultice to the nose, and do this for three days or more until the ointment has corroded all that is rotten flesh.
And finally, at the end of the treatment, place a lead cannula in the nose for a few days until it is healed.
But if you need more healing than this requires, use that (other method/remedy).
And this is the form of the instrument, a head-purger, with which oils and medicines are distilled into the nostrils:
And make this of silver or bronze, which should resemble a small open lamp, like a small shell, and the spout similarly.
And if you wish, make a closed cannula like a tube, and the cannula of the head-purging instrument should be flat and open; to which there should be a handle at the back, with which you hold it when you heat in it the oil or water that you want, from the juices and from the suctible substances.
Chapter 25.
Of nasal polyps in the extremities of the nose.
Many times a polyp grows in the extremities of the nose, and it is magnified and increased in some days, to the point that it greatly obstructs the patient's breathing.
And for that reason it is necessary that you incise it at the beginning of its appearance, and eradicate the whole thing. And then place on the location either a cautery or a burning medicine which will stay in place.
But if its incision is delayed until it is magnified, then consider if it is hardened, hard, of a dark color and of little feeling; then do not touch it with iron, for it is a cancerous abscess; because many times to him who incises this abscess happens great harm from that which it had.
And if the abscess is of a light touch and is not of a dark color, and sometimes incision is possible throughout, then evacuate the patient and incise it without fear, and treat the area with that which dries and constricts until it is healed.
Chapter 26.
Chapter 26. Of the suturing of the nose, lips, and ear when their continuity is broken by a wound or similar injury.
Know that when a solution of continuity occurs in one of these cartilages, you should place little confidence in that operation except in certain men.
Therefore, when this happens to someone, consider if it is a fresh wound with its own blood, and then you should join the two edges of the wound with sutures, and afterwards treat it until it heals.
And if the edges of the solution of continuity are already separated, and each is healed, then you must scrape each part of its apparent surface until blood comes out. Then join the two edges with sutures and tighten them, and over them sprinkle dragon's blood and crushed [ingredients], and place over the powder a piece of diachylon plaster, or some other of the consolidating plasters, and leave it bound for two or three days, then unbind it and change the plaster and leave it until the threads are shed by themselves, and then treat it with ointment until it heals.
But the manner of suturing is that you close the solution of continuity either with needles, as we have recounted in the suturing of the abdomen, or close the solution of continuity with thread, as has been shown to you.
Chapter 27.
Of the extraction of those things which come into the two edges in the inner parts.
Many times there appear in the inner parts of the labia of men certain hard abscesses similar to the kernels of cherries, and some of them are smaller and some are larger.
Therefore it is necessary that you turn back the labia and incise each of those hardnesses on all sides, and then fill the place of the incision with crushed sage until the bleeding is stopped, and then it should be washed with sharp vinegar and the place treated with something styptic, until it is healed.
Chapter 28.
Concerning the incision of the flesh grown in the gums.
Very often there grows on the gum a fleshy growth which the ancients called an albulus; then it is necessary that you lift that up with a hook or hold it with forceps and incise it down to its root, and let the pus or blood flow.
And then place on the area crushed sage or other styptic or drying powders.
And if that flesh returns, then incise it a second time, and cauterize it, for then the cautery will prevent it from returning.
Chapter 29.
Concerning the extraction of teeth with iron.
When on the surface of the teeth, both the inner and outer parts, and between the gums, there are rough, sticky crusts, and sometimes they are blackened and become yellow or green, so that the gum is affected by this corruption and the teeth become loose.
And therefore it is necessary that you make the patient sit between your hands and place his head on your lap, and scrape the teeth on which those crusts and similar substances appear, until nothing remains of them, and this removes the blackness, yellowness and other things until they are cleaned.
Then if this which is in the beginning of the treatment is removed, it is good; and if not, then you repeat the treatment on those teeth on the next day and the second and the third until you arrive at the final result that you desire.
And know that the teeth require many instruments of diverse forms and shapes according to what is prepared for your operation. And because the instrument with which the tooth is scraped on the inner part is different from the instrument with which it is scraped between the teeth, according to other forms, and these forms of instruments should be prepared by you, which you will see immediately:
Chapter 30.
On the extraction of teeth.
That you cure the tooth of its pain with all skill and delay its extraction, for there is no cause that supplants its sight when it is extracted, for it is a sublime substance in which there is an excuse for its extraction.
But when the patient is forced to have that tooth extracted, you must be firmly certain which tooth is aching, for many times the pain deceives the patient and they believe it is in a healthy tooth, and you extract that one, and then the pain does not cease until the diseased and aching tooth is extracted, for we have already seen this through the operations of barbers.
Therefore, when you are certain which tooth is aching, and you know it well, then you should scarify around the tooth with a spatula in which there is some virtue, until it is loosened from the gum on all sides, and then remove it with your fingers, or with delicate forceps, beginning little by little until it is completely loosened.
And then apply strong, large forceps for a good grip or firm hold, and place the patient's head between your knees so that you hold them well and they do not move, and then pull the tooth straight in such a way that you do not break it, nor cause the patient greater pain.
And then, if it is not removed, then take one of those instruments, and place it under it on all sides with ease, and force its removal in the same way as was done at the beginning.
But if the tooth is broken or decayed, then you should fill that hole with cloth and bind it tightly with a thin, fine thread so that it is not broken during the time you are grasping it with forceps.
And you must carefully open [the gum] with scarification around all parts of the gum, and take great care that you do not break it and leave a part of it behind, and it will return to the patient with an affliction greater than their initial pain.
And beware that you do not do what some ignorant barbers do in their haste and audacity in extraction, without administering what we have recounted; for many times they cause great illnesses in men which are more difficult to cure, and their roots remain, all or some of them, or that they extract it with some bones of the jaw, as we have witnessed many times.
And then, after its extraction, the mouth should be washed with warm wine or sour wine with salt.
And if bleeding results from this, as often happens, then crush some quantity of sage and sprinkle it on the wound, and if this sage does not work, cauterize [it].
The shape of the forceps and fine tongs with which the tooth is grasped at the beginning should be of long extremity, short and thick handle, so that they are not bent when you have to work with them.
And let them be like tongs with a thick handle so that when you squeeze with them they are not bent; let the extremities be short.
And let them be made of Indian iron, skillfully made with straight ends, and at the ends of those let there be teeth, of which the ones interlock with the others and tighten by strong constriction; and sometimes the ends of these have the form of the beak of a bird called a *ciconia* (that is, a stork), and they are of strong constriction.
Chapter 31.
Of the extraction of teeth and the removal of broken jawbones.
When you must extract a tooth which is broken and some cause remains, then you must place a cotton compress soaked in a potion on the area for a day or two until the area is softened; and then insert tongs or pincers, the ends of which resemble the beak of a bird called a *ciconia* or stork, the shape of forceps:
Let their ends be made inside like a file or rasp.
And if it does not yield to you thus with these forceps or pincers, then you must dig around the root and remove all the flesh and insert the instrument which is called an *atali*, that is, a small lever of which the shape is this:
And let it be of short, somewhat thick extremity, and let it not be bent so that it is not broken.
Therefore, if by this the root is removed, it is good; and if not, help yourself with these other instruments, of which these are the forms: the form of the first instrument is of a triangular extremity in which there is some thickness:
The form of the second instrument is that it be triangular and of a more subtle extremity.
And now having been aided by this instrument having two prongs, of which this is the following form: and with other instruments which precede in tooth scraping; for help is done with this instrument which resembles a large hook, and this is the form:
of the triangular, curved or short extremity, which should have some thickness, and should not be bent so that it is not broken.
And know also that the instruments for loose teeth are similarly made to the other instruments.
But the wise and subtle artisan in the art finds for himself, according to what the operation and the diverse illnesses signify to him; for there are illnesses for which the ancients did not describe nor provide a proper instrument, because of the forms of diverse species.
But if the bone of the jaw or of the other bones of the mouth is broken, or if it is possible, then let it be cured in its place with what is convenient for it from among the instruments and forceps which we have described in the extraction of tooth roots, and help yourself with a splint, of which this is the form:
And let there be some thickness in it little by little, and let it be tightened or held with the mouth so that it does not escape or flee until the bone is completely set; and then restore the place with medicines convenient for that.
But if there is a small rottenness in the bone, then scrape away that rottenness and its blackness, and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 32.
Concerning the treatment of teeth that protrude above the others.
When teeth protrude beyond their natural alignment, distorting their shape, especially in women and particularly older women; then you must consider: if a tooth is next to another tooth, and neither extraction nor filing is possible, then extract it; but if it is not attached to another tooth, then you incise it with an instrument of which this is the form; and it is similar to a boar's tusk, and should be made of Indian iron with a very sharp tip.
And let your incision, with which you incise it, be done over several days because of the hardness of the tooth, and so that no other tooth is injured.
And if the protruding tooth is suitable for filing, then file it with an Indian iron file of which this is the form:
And let the entire file be of Indian iron and very smooth; and let it have very fine points, like a file with which needles are made, with which the tooth is filed little by little over many days with ease, so that no other tooth is damaged or broken. Then smooth it at the end, and scrape it with some scrapers.
And if it is a tooth of which a part is broken and hurts the tongue, then it is necessary that you smooth it until the roughness of that fracture is removed and leveled, and is filled so that the tongue is not injured and speech is not impaired.
Chapter 33.
Concerning the restoration of damaged teeth with gold or silver wire.
When the front teeth suffer concussion and loosening from a blow or fall, and the patient cannot bite on what he eats, and you have treated this with styptic medicines, and your treatment has not been effective, then so that they do not fall out, contrive that they are fastened with gold wire and not silver, because silver turns green and almost powders after a few days, but gold is never changed.
And let the wire be of such fineness and thickness according to the amount that can fit between the teeth; and the manner of binding is that you take the wire and pass the double of it between two healthy teeth, and then let it grow with two twists of the wire between two damaged teeth, or if one or several, until the thread reaches the healthy tooth on the other side. And then repeat the weaving to the point where you began, and tighten with your hand gently and skillfully until it is firm.
And let your tightening, with which you fasten the wire, be such that it does not slip from the roots of the teeth.
And then cut off the superfluous ends of the wire with forceps or scissors, and smooth those ends in each place with a file, and bend them and hide them between the healthy tooth and the damaged tooth, so that they do not injure the tongue. And then leave it thus tightly bound.
But if it is loosened or broken, tighten it or them with another wire in the same manner at all times.
And this is the form of the teeth and the figure of the straightening of two healthy teeth and two damaged teeth, thus sometimes these are bound:
And when it is done that one or two teeth return to their proper places, and are grown back as we have recounted, and that they remain fixed.
And this is only done by good and skilled artisans.
And sometimes some material from cow bones is used, and it is made into the shape of a tooth, and it is placed in the place where the tooth is missing, and it is fastened as we have said, and it remains and serves for a long time.
Chapter 34.
Concerning the incision of the ligament which is in the tongue and prevents speech.
This ligament, which is under the tongue, is sometimes natural, with which one is born, or accidental and occurs due to a wound which has already healed.
And the operation is that you open the patient's mouth, their head being in your lap; and lift their tongue, and carefully incise that nervous ligament to the extent that the tongue is freed from its restriction.
But if in that area there is some hardness or knot, and this is due to the healing of a wound, then you should apply an unguent and incise that area to the extent that you have incised the ligament and the knot is dissolved.
And be careful that no fissure is made in the depth of the flesh and that you do not cut too deeply and cause a flow of blood.
And carefully wash the area of the incision with warm water or with wine vinegar or with cold water; and then place under the tongue a linen cloth; that is to say, a cloth which the patient keeps under the tongue every night so that it does not heal again.
But if bleeding occurs, place crushed vitriol on the area; but if the bleeding persists, then cauterize the area with a lancet-shaped cautery which is suitable for this. And then treat it with the other remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 35.
On the extraction of a ranula from under the tongue.
Sometimes an abscess similar to a small tumor occurs under the tongue, preventing the tongue from its natural function; and it quickly becomes enlarged until it fills the mouth.
And the operation is that you open the patient's mouth, sitting in front of the sun, and examine the abscess.
And if you see it is dark or black in color, hard, and the patient feels no sensation in it, then do not touch it, for it is cancerous.
And if it is tending towards white, and is moist, then you place an oncia (ounce, possibly referring to a surgical instrument) there, and incise it with a fine scalpel, and incise it completely; and if blood flows during your operation, then you apply crushed vitriol to it until the bleeding is stopped.
Then return to your work until you have completely removed it, until it is washed with sharp wine and salt; and treat it with the other appropriate treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 36.
Concerning the extraction of an abscess from both ears, and of that which is located in the throat, and of other abscesses.
When a swelling occurs in the throat, these are glands which are gathered together like cotton, which protrude outwards and are called the tonsils; when you treat them with what we have said in the division [previous section of the text] and it is not healed, then consider if the abscess is hard, dark in color, and insensitive; then do not touch it with an iron instrument.
And if it is red and the root is large, then do not touch it with iron because of the flow of blood; rather, let it mature, and then you will either extract it, or it will break open by itself.
And if it is white, soft, and its root is thin, then it is one that ought to be incised.
And the operation for it is that you consider, before your operation, whether the abscess has already been calmed by complete rest, or if it has diminished in any way; and then have the patient sit before the sun, and their head should be in your lap, and open their mouth, and the assistant, taking it between their hands, should press down the tongue with a very fine instrument, of which this is the form:
And let it be made of silver or bronze, and let it be thin like a knife.
Then, as you press the tongue with that [instrument] and the abscess is shown to you, and you have looked at it carefully, then take an oncia [ounce] and insert it into the tonsil, and draw it outwards as much as you can. Also, if you pull out something from the membranes, then immediately incise it with an instrument of which this is the form:
Also, if you pull out something from the membranes, then immediately incise it with an instrument of which this is the form: and it resembles forceps, however its ends are curved, so that the opening of each of them is opposite the other, very sharp, which should be of tempered iron.
But if this instrument is not at hand, then incise it with a spatula of which this is the form: And let it be sharp on one side, not sharp on the other side.
And after you have incised one side, incise the other in the same manner of incision, and after the incision, let the patient gargle with cold water.
But if there is a flow of blood, let him gargle with a decoction of pomegranate rind or myrtle leaves and similar styptic substances until the flow of blood is restrained, and then cure it until it is healed.
And sometimes other abscesses appear in the throat besides those near the two ears, and incise those as I have said in the incision of two sides equally.
And I once treated a woman with an abscess which had formed in her throat, which abscess was tending towards a dark color, with little feeling, which had already closed her throat, and the woman breathed with a narrow passage, and I had already forbidden her to eat and drink water, and she was near death if she had lasted another day or two.
And the abscess had grown so much that it had made two openings through which it exited.
Then I treated it with a fistula, and I inserted a probe into one of the openings, and I pulled it, and a large portion was drawn out, and then I incised it from where I understood it came from the other opening, and then I opened its mouth, and I compressed its tongue, and then I placed the probe into that abscess.
And then I excised a large part of it, and only a little blood flowed from it. Then the woman's throat was completely cleared, and she immediately began to drink water, and then she took food, so I did not cease to incise that abscess many times over a long period, and another abscess succeeded it, which I incised until it was eliminated.
Then I cauterized her throat, then I stopped the bleeding; and then I walked around and I didn't know what God would do about it then.
Chapter 37.
Concerning the incision of a boil when it is abscessed.
When catarrh descends to the uvula, and it is abscessed and elongated, then it is called a perpendicular [abscess]; and if it is thick and round in the lower part, then it is called a buba (or swelling).
But when it is treated with what we have said in the division, and your treatment is not effective, and you see that the cauterized abscess has already been removed and it is subtle, then you should incise that which is round and aggregated; and if it is of that length, and is bloody, of a dark color or black, and there is no feeling in it, then you should delay the incision, because in that case there is danger for the patient.
And when you see it according to the manner I have described, its whiteness and length,  make the patient sit and press down their tongue with an instrument which follows its shape, and then place the lancet on the uvula and draw it down and incise it with one of the two instruments mentioned in the incision of the tonsils.
And you should not incise it except what is within the natural limits without addition, for if you incise more, you will impair their speech.
And after the incision, use what we have recommended in the incision of the tonsils, and treat it until it is healed.
But if the patient is frightened by the incision, you should use caution in cauterizing it without causing fear, and the method of cauterizing it is only with a sharp instrument; and you should place the patient's head in your lap, and then press down their tongue with the instrument we have mentioned, and then take the water which we have mentioned in the chapter on cauterization, and apply it with a live coal, and do not apply it too thickly nor thinly, and with it fill the concavity of the instrument which has this form:
Let the end of it be concave, in which the medicine is placed, like the concavity of a spoon, and place the instrument with the medicine on the uvula, and let the patient lie on their side so that the saliva or mucus from their mouth flows out because of the intrinsic medicine, so that nothing of it descends into their throat and harms them.
And then take your hand with the medicine, and press it against the uvula for half an hour until you see it become blackened and dried up by the action of the medicine.
And if you wish, take cotton and wrap it around the end of the spoon, and soak the cotton in the medicine, and insert the spoon with the cotton in a cannula from above so that the cotton adheres to that cannula, and do this as many times as it takes to achieve what you want from the cauterization of the uvula, and then leave it so that it will dry and fall off after three or four days.
And if you need to reapply the medicine, reapply it, and after the cauterization, clean the area around the uvula with cotton soaked in wine, and cleanse with it what remains around it from the medicine, and let it be washed with cold water, and let it be treated externally with an embrocation, and internally with gargles until it is healed.
And this method of treatment is safer than incision and less frightening.
Sometimes the uvula is cured with a method more subtle than cautery or incision, for it is cured with fumigation in this manner: take calamint, hyssop, oregano, rue, dried Arabic gum, chamomile, and similar herbs, and mix all these ingredients, or some of them, in a pot, and let them be submerged in sour wine, and boil; and let the pot be well sealed with suitable lute, and let there be a hole in the middle of the pot's lid, over which is placed a concave brass instrument in this manner; it should be made of silver or brass.
And let the end [of the instrument] be inserted into the patient's mouth so that the vapor may reach the uvula through the cannula, until the uvula is sufficiently fumigated.
And then repeat this several times until it is dry, and be careful not to perform this treatment at the beginning of the development of an abscess, for it would increase the abscess too much, and you should not do that, but rather you should cauterize the abscess at its beginning.
But if you do not have this instrument at hand, then take a cane and attach a broken eggshell to its end, so that the patient's mouth is covered, for the eggshell prevents the vapor from burning the mouth.
And this treatment is good for health.
Chapter 38.
On the extraction of thorns and that which adheres to the throat and other causes.
Many times, a fish bone or some other thing adheres to the throat.
Then it is necessary that you extract what is apparent of those things, on which the sight falls, after you press the tongue with an instrument in front of the sun, so that that which is in the throat may be shown to you.
And that which does not appear and is hidden from you in the throat, you must make the patient vomit before the food is digested in the stomach, for very quickly the thing attached to the throat will be expelled by vomiting; or let the patient swallow a piece of turnip or lettuce root or a piece of dry bread; or let him take a piece of dried sea sponge, and bind it tightly with thread, and then let the patient swallow it, for when it arrives at the place where the thorns are, it will extract them, and then they will be expelled. And also, take an eel and bind it tightly with thread, and let it be inserted and quickly extracted; or take a leek and quickly insert it and quickly remove it.
But if they are not expelled by those methods which we have mentioned, then use a lead instrument according to this form:
And let it be somewhat thicker than a finger, and at its extremity let there be a concavity which you may easily introduce into his throat.
And let him have his head raised up, and be careful not to touch his throat bone, lest it cause him pain; and with that, push the bone or thorn, or let the physician do it with his hand.
But however, it is better that the patient himself insert it, because of his knowledge of the location of the lodged cause, and push it down, and pull his hand with the instrument upwards, all this according to the amount prepared for him, until it is expelled.
Chapter 39.
On the extraction of a leech attached to the throat.
When a leech is medicated with what we have said in the division of treatment with medicines and it does not work, then consider [applying] to the patient's throat a leech, provided that you have compressed his tongue with the instrument which we have recommended to you.
Therefore, if you see the leech, extract it with a small hook or with delicate, appropriate gestures.
And if it is not possible for you to extract it with that, then take a concave cannula and insert it into the patient's throat, and then place a heated iron in the concavity of the cannula, and do this several times (until the leech is dead and detaches from the throat), and abstain the patient from water all day.
And then take a vial full of cold water, and open his mouth into it, and wash the mouth with it; and do not swallow anything from it and agitate the water every now and then with your hand, because the leech, as soon as it feels the water, falls off.
But if it is not expelled by what we have recommended, then fumigate the patient with cymene or with asafoetida, using the instrument which we have recommended in the fumigation of the uvula.
Do this, so that it will fall out.
And another method of operation in the fumigation of this is that you take a pot in which there are burning coals, and the pot is covered with a lid in the middle of which there is a hole, and the end of the instrument is placed in that hole; and then let the fumigation come from above; and let the patient put his mouth to the end of the cannula, and close his mouth so that the fumigation is not expelled until you know that the fumigation has reached the leech, for the leech will immediately fall.
And if it does not fall off, then you repeat the fumigation many times, and restrain the patient from drinking, and eating salty things and garlic, and not drinking water, and thus it is necessary that with this regimen it will be expelled.
And this is the form of the instrument with which a leech is extracted from the throat when it is seen; and it is similar to forceps, as sometimes, except that it has some curvature in it: which is placed in the throat, and its end is similar to a stork's beak, which is curved, in which there is a roughness from filing, so that, when it grasps something, it does not let go.
Chapter 40.
In which is the sum of the discourse on the appearance of abscesses and on their incision.
Abscesses are of many species, of many kinds, according to what is recalled of them, of each in this book.
And they are diverse in their perforation and incision in two ways, of which one is by the species of abscesses in themselves; and because of what we understand of the humidities.
And the second way is according to the locations in which they occur in the body, for an abscess occurring in the head is different from an abscess occurring in the buttocks; and an abscess in a fleshy location is different from an abscess occurring in a joint; and each has its own judgment for operation.
And moreover, there are some abscesses which should not be perforated except near the maturation of the pus within them or their completion.
There are other abscesses which should be opened when they are raw, and are not matured according to their completion, such as abscesses that are near the joints, for when an abscess is near a joint, its being is prolonged until it can consume what is in its circumference, and very quickly the ligaments or nerves of that joint are corrupted, wherefore a cause of contraction of that limb is made; or it is an abscess near a principal member, and if you delay its perforation until it is matured, it will harm the principal member; or it is near the buttocks, therefore perforate that which is not matured; and it should not be perforated raw, of uncompleted digestion, except that which is near the buttocks, so that its pus may not spread and be elongated to the inner parts of the buttocks, and a fistula be made, or that it be made in such a way that it is not healed. But you must know the time for the perforation of the abscess, and that is when it is matured.
And you will know that it is matured when there is a lessening of the pain and cessation of the fever, and also a diminution of the redness and pulsation, and the acuteness of the head of the abscess, and the other signs.
And because it is necessary that you know that the perforation falls in the place lowest in the abscess and from which the cure of the swelling comes.
And the perforation should always be along the length of the flesh or body, if the abscesses are in the parts of the hands or feet, and away from the tendons, the cords of the nerves, the arteries; and, finally, in all even places where there is no reflection; for in those that are reflected, use perforation according to that member.
But when the abscess is in a fleshy place, then it is better that you delay its perforation until its digestion is completed according to what we have said; for if you perforate it before that, the course of its pus and much filth is prolonged, and quickly its lips are hardened and its depth increased.
But some abscesses are perforated according to the width of the flesh or body due to necessity, or according to what the member requires.
And it is necessary that you administer a small perforation in small abscesses, and in large abscesses a large and wide perforation, or many incisions, according to the diversity of the size of the abscesses.
And others are abscesses in which it is necessary that the boil be hollowed out and incised, when it is made like bread and is ripe, as happens in cases of buboes and boils.
And some of those are incised with a three-angled incision; and others are incised in the shape of a myrtle leaf, like the abscesses of the armpits.
And there are those in which a round incision and a crescent-shaped incision are administered, and similar ones.
But that which is not like the aforementioned superficial abscesses, it is necessary that you perforate it with a superficial, or only planar, perforation.
And when the abscess is large and has collected much pus, it is necessary that you perforate it and do not try to extract all the pus at that time; having extracted a part of it, then bandage the abscess until the next day, and then extract a larger portion, and do this many times according to gradation until it is completely evacuated.
And especially if the patient is of weak constitution, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an elderly person in decrepitude, because the animal spirit is often dissolved with the egress of pus, and the patient dies very quickly, and you must operate on them carefully.
Therefore, observe this chapter with great caution, and concerning the perforation with which you perforate these abscesses, you must cleanse the wounds and consider then if the wound of the abscess is small, or if it is a planar incision, then you apply lint or old linen to it; and if the abscess is large, and the fissures of the perforation are many, then it is necessary that you place a wick in each opening until they meet.
And if in the abscess a part of the flesh is excised or you have hollowed it out in the circumference, then it is necessary that you fill it with old linen or thread made from linen cloth, as when you have extracted splinters or roots, without humidity; and bind it until the third day; and then proceed and treat it with the necessary ointments until it is healed.
But if bleeding occurs during your operation, then apply cold water and sour wine in which you moisten a linen cloth, and place this over the bleeding area many times.
But if the bleeding persists, then it is necessary that you administer the regimen and treatment and powders which I have described in many places in this our book and in other sections.
But if it is in winter, and the location of the abscess is a place of many nerves, then it is necessary that you mix powders in warm wine and oil, and apply those to the area.
And if it is in summer, and the areas are fleshy, then it is necessary that you apply powders mixed with water and oil or with wine and oil, and all this should be cold until the third day, as we have said, and then it is necessary that you open the abscess and clean it and administer to its treatment what is suitable for it until it is healed.
And this is what is necessary for the knowledge of the treatment of abscesses universally, but according to the method of distinction I have already described each abscess and its treatment method in specific chapters.
Chapter 41.
Concerning the incision of abscesses which appear in the back of the head.
In the back of the head, small abscesses, and they are a kind of nodes which contain membranes that are attached to their surfaces; and their forms are varied.
And some of them are purulent, and those contain a humidity resembling pus. And some of them contain a humidity resembling dust, and similar to them; and some of them are stony, hard.
And in the incision of all, and in the extraction of those, there is no fear, as the extraction of these does not cause contrary effects.
And the operation in the incision of these is that you explore them with an instrument whose shape is like this, which is called a probe, until you know what it contains.
For if what it contains is humidity, then incise it lengthwise with a superficial incision according to this form:
And begin the incision from line B to line G. Then, when the humidity is evacuated, you should scrape that skin which contained the humidity, and do not leave any of it at all, because the expelled matter will return if any of it remains.
Then submerge a pledget in Egyptian ointment, if it is available, and if not, in salt water; and fill the wound with it and leave it there until the next day, for with this you corrode all that remains of that membrane.
And then repeat applying the pledget with Egyptian ointment a second and third time if needed, until you are confident that there is no remaining part of that membrane; then heal the wound with ointment until it is healed.
And if the abscess contains fatty nodules, then you should incise it according to this form: with an incision having the form of a cross, and insert forceps between the two lips of the incision and scrape it from all parts, and exert your strength in extracting the tunic which contains it.
But if the arrowhead opposes you, then do what I have told you first.
And similarly proceed in the case of a stony abscess in incision and treatment as we have told you; and incision on a stony abscess is easier, because it has little blood and little moisture.
And sometimes some of these abscesses, which are in the head in some men, have absolutely no moisture; the reason for which is that I incised an abscess on the head of an old woman and found the abscess like a dull, rough, white stone, which could not be broken, and if anyone were struck with it, it would hurt them.
But in other accidental abscesses in the head besides this one, this is not the chapter, such as the abscesses which come to the heads of children and behind the roots of the ears, but the incision of all these should be a superficial incision.
And make the perforation of those from the lowest part of them so that the body may be relieved of the pus in the lowest parts.
And then treat those with what is suitable for that treatment.
Chapter 42.
Chapter 42. Of the incision of scrophulas which happen in the neck.
Often these abscesses occur in the neck and in the armpits and in the groin; and sometimes they happen in other parts of the body.
And those that happen in the neck, and many that are generated among them, and every scrofula of these is within its own tunic, and just as in the nodes and abscesses of the head, as we have recounted.
And the types of these scrophulas are many, for some of them are stony, and some of them contain humidity, and some of them are malignant which do not obey cure.
Therefore, in that which you see of good disposition to the touch, of which the color that is manifest is close to the color of the flesh, and is softened in every part, and is not attached to the nerves of the neck, nor to the veins, nor to the artery, and is not deep, you should incise that with a superficial incision from the upper part to the lower part of the body, from line G to line B, and scrape it from every part, and extend the lips of the flesh with hooks, or with many hooks if you have need of them, as we have said in the abscesses of the head, and extract it little by little.
And it is most cautious that the vein or nerve is not incised.
And let the scalpel not be too sharp, lest you injure your hand with the incision, or that you disturb the patient, and that you incise what is not necessary to incise; for if you should incise a vein or artery and prohibit you from your operation, then place on the wound crushed vitriol or other powders which stop the flow of blood, and bind the wound, and leave it until the acuteness of the abscess rests and the wound is softened and begins to be purulent. When the blood is cut off.
Then return to your operation until you have completed it.
And then investigate with your index finger if there is any cause of the other small scrophulas, then incise those and cleanse them.
And if there is a large vein at the root of the scrofula, then it is necessary that you do not incise that scrofula at its root. Afterwards, it is necessary that you tie it with strong doubled thread and that you leave it until it falls off by itself without harm.
Then fill the wound with old linen which you have already submerged in Egyptian ointment, and then care for it.
And if you incise the whole scrofula, then it is necessary that you adjust the two lips of the wound and stitch it immediately so that no superfluity remains.
But if you see that superfluity remains because of the size of the scrofula, it is necessary that you understand how to incise its root, and extract it, and administer suture and what has been said.
And as for those scrofulas that contain humidity, perforate it with a superficial perforation where the place of its maturation appears to you, and position the perforation so that it is the lowest part of the body, as we have said.
Then administer a perforation, perhaps with ointment and similar things, so that it corrodes what remains of the corruption. And then, when you see the wound already cleansed, then you cure it with a flesh-generating ointment until it is healed.
Chapter 43.
Concerning the incision of the head of the abscess accidentally within the throat.
The ancients described this incision in the abscess, but no one in our land has been seen to have performed it.
And this is the description/writing of the speech/discourse of those (ancients).
But in men having a hernia, the extraction of the abscess head must be avoided, because no benefit is done by it, since all the veins and major (blood) vessels of the patient are there.
But in those who have abscesses located in the mouth or throat or in both ears, when the illness is not in the (respiratory) canal, it is necessary to use the incision of the abscess head to avoid the loss which is caused by perforation (leaving it untreated).
Therefore, when we want to do this, we should incise the abscess head below the three circles of the abscess's circles, or four with a small incision in width in the area between two circles as regards quantity, so that the incision is in the soft tissue, not in the cartilage; and this location is suitable for incision because it is devoid of flesh and its blood vessels are distant.
And if the physician is timid, then it is necessary that he extend the throat's membrane with a hook, and then split the membrane until reaching the canal, but he should avoid the blood vessels if he sees any of them there.
And then incise the soft tissue as we have recounted; and the incision of the canal is indicated by the inflammation which has come from it with what is broken in it, and by the loss of voice.
And leave the wound open for some time.
Then, when the hour is reached in which perforation is feared, bring together the two lips of the wound's membrane, and sew that alone without the cartilage.
And then administer medicines that produce flesh until it is healed.
And Albucasis says that the sum of the discourse which we have recounted, is an exposition not only that you see that some of these abscesses have already obstructed the throat of the patient, and the patient has come to death, and his breath is cut off; and some go to incise the epiglottis so that the patient may breathe over the site of the wound for some respiration, and be saved from death.
And for this reason I order that the wound be left open until the malignancy of the disease is consumed; and its malignancy lasts for three days; and then I order the wound to be sewn, and cure it until it is healed.
And this I have seen with my own eyes, that a servant took a knife and put it to her throat and incised with it a part of the windpipe, and I was called to her treatment, and I found the groan as it is groaned by the dying, and I uncovered the wound and found the blood which had issued from the small wound.
Then I was convinced that she had not incised a vein or artery, and the wind was escaping from the wound, and I cured it until it was healed.
And there happened to the servant nothing but hoarseness in her voice, and after a few days she returned to a better state of health.
And now I say that in the section of the tonsil there is no fear.
Chapter 44.
Chapter 44. Of incision upon an abscess which occurs in the throat externally, and is called a throat hernia.
This abscess called throat hernia is a large abscess according to the complexion of the body, and is very common in women.
And it is of two types, for it is either natural or accidental.
And the natural one is not possible to cure.
And the accidental one is of two types, of which one resembles fatty nodes, and the other type resembles an abscess which is formed by the knotting of an artery, and in this one there is danger. And one should not act presumptuously with iron (surgery) except in the case of a small one (abscess). And you should probe and investigate it with your finger, and if you find it similar to a fatty node, and it is not connected to any of the veins, then you should incise it like the nodes, and extract it with that which contains it from the skin and bursa; and if not, then its entire being should be examined, and then treat the area with what is necessary for healing until it is healed.
Chapter 45.
Concerning the incision of types of nodes.
There are many types of nodes, and I have already described all their types in the division (of chapters).
And it is necessary that I recount here the difference between a node and an abscess, as there might be doubt.
Therefore I say that with an abscess there is heat and fever and intense pain until the boiling of the superfluity is settled; and putrefaction is complete, then the fever, pain, and heat cease.
But with a node there is neither heat nor fever nor pain, and it contains that leonine [lion-like]  cyphax which is in its own sac.
And it is according to the color of the body, and its beginning is like a swelling and is formed like a vesicle, be it larger or smaller, and they are of two types, for they are either fatty and contain humidity, and the colors of the humidity are many, as I said in the division (of chapters).
Therefore, when you arrive at the treatment of a node, you must remove it and investigate it at the beginning with an instrument which is called an intromes, according to how its form will appear in the chapter which is near this one.
And the manner of investigating abscesses and all nodes is that you take this instrument and insert it into the most humid place which you find in the abscess, and you will turn your fingers with it little by little until you know that the instrument has already penetrated the pus.
Then place your hand around it according to the size of the abscess, and then extract the intromes and consider what has come out in its wake.
And if the running humidity, whatever its color, is expelled, then you should incise it with a superficial incision as I have said in the case of other abscesses.
And if you find no humidity in the wake of the intromes, then you know it is fatty.
And dry it out with an incision in the shape of a cross, according to this form: as I have shown you, and suspend it with hooks, and easily scrape away the pus from all sides, and keep the skin or sac, if you can, over it and extract that matter with the node (or knot/swelling).
But if it is broken during the operation, it is not possible to extract all the matter, and this often happens, and then you extract it in pieces until nothing remains.
Because if anything remains, little or much, the swelling will return in the same manner.
And if you see that some small part remains, then fill the wound with some sharp corrosive powders and bind the wound, and place a warm poultice over it that will suppurate, and treat it with another treatment until it is healed.
And if it is a large swelling, then you sew the two lips of it together and treat it with that which causes it to form flesh (i.e., promotes granulation and healing).
But if a pulsating or non-pulsating vein is nearby, then you consider it and fill the area with crushed vitriol and leave it tightly bound for two or three days until the wound dries and the boiling of the blood subsides; and then return to incise what remains of the swelling.
Chapter 46.
Of the forms of instruments necessary in incision and perforation.
Of those [instruments], the forms are of three types: some are large, some are medium, and some are small.
The form of the large instrument is this:
The form of the small instrument is this:
Let them be made of iron, or of alfold [a type of metal or alloy], with suitably rounded ends, so that they may easily enter the abscesses.
And these are the forms of the instruments, and they are called albered, and one of them is called berid.
And they are of three types, for of them there is a large, a medium, and a small one.
The form of the large instrument, its form is:
The form of the medium instrument, its form is:
The form of the small instrument, its form is:
It is fitting that they be used for those abscesses, and discharges, and fistulas, and buboes, because among these are those from bones and other causes.
And they are made round, large, smooth, like large needles with which saddles are sewn, and they are made of gilded bronze, or of bronze, or of iron, or of silver. And the best are those made of gilded bronze.
And the instruments are made of black lead, which are suited to opening fistulas in the cavity of which reflections are made, so that they may be reflected by their lightness with those reflections.
And they are of three types, for some of them are long, others medium, and others short, according to the size of the fistula's width and its stricture.
Shape of the large lead instrument:
Shape of the medium lead instrument:
Shape of the small lead instrument:
The shapes of the hooks are of many types, for some of them are simple, which have only one curve, and they are of three types: large, small, and medium.
And of them there are hooked instruments, and they are of three types.
And of those there are hooks having two curves, and they are of three types.
And of them there are [hooks] having three curves, and they are of three types.
And all these are necessary in their place.
Form of a small simple hook, its form:
Form of a large hook having two curves: Form of a medium hook having two curves: Form of a small hook having two curves:
Form of a large hook having three curves:
Form of a medium hook having three curves:
And these are the forms of the scalpels with which the nodes and abscesses are cut and scraped, and they are of three types, for of these there is a large, a medium, and a small one.
Form of a large scalpel:
Form of a medium scalpel:
Form of a small scalpel:
The extremities of those [scalpels] with which the incision is made are sharp, and the other extremities are not sharp, and they are not placed in such a way, except that it is done carefully in the scraping of the nodes, fearing the incision of a vein or nerve, and by these means the patient is healed and finds a little tranquility through the cauterization which he finds after the scraping of the abscess.
And these are the forms of the cauteries, and there are three types: large, medium and small, as you see.
They are made of bronze and are similar in shape to a ray, with which alcohol is made.  (Note:  The reference to alcohol here is likely inaccurate, given the timeframe.  It may be a misunderstanding or a different substance entirely.)
And it is at the pointed end, secretly hidden with spatulas, and in that way it runs to the inner and outer parts, whenever you wish, as you see.
The shapes of spatulas, which are hidden among the fingers during the perforation of abscesses and the patient does not perceive them, are of three types: large, medium, and small. And these are the shapes of those:
The shapes of cupping glasses with which the flow of blood is stopped, and there are three types: large, medium, and small; their shapes are:
They should be made of bronze or copper, round with some length, and they should be thin.
And it is necessary that you have these types of cupping glasses: large, medium, and small, so that with them you can stop the flow of blood quickly if necessary, and then when you don't initially have medicine.
However, do not use them to draw blood from every part of the body, but only in fleshy places, such as the fleshy parts of the legs and thighs, and in the fleshy parts of the arms, and of the breasts and abdomen and groins, and similar fleshy, moist parts.
And sometimes other small instruments are made, similar to small bladders, according to this shape; through which blood is drawn when it is done by phlebotomy, or by incision of a vein or artery.
And sometimes they are made round according to this shape:
Chapter 47.
On the treatment of the breasts of men which resemble those of women.
Sometimes the breasts of some men are inflamed due to excessive sleeping, as they begin to become hairy, and then the breasts are inflamed, and resemble the breasts of women, and remain as festering, whitish swellings.
And for someone who has this, it is necessary that you incise those with a lunate incision, according to this shape, from line B to line G, and then scrape away all the thickness, and then fill the wound with incarnative medication, and then join the two lips of the wound with sutures, and treat it until it is healed.
But if the breast droops downwards and is softened by its size, as happens in women, then let it be incised in two of its upper parts, with two incisions similar to a lunar shape, each of which should be contained within the other at the end of each, so that the larger line contains the smaller one according to this shape of line B and line G. And then scrape the skin which is between the two lips of the wound, and remove the fat, and administer what we have said about the suture and the powders which are necessary in the treatment until it is healed.
And if you do not complete the incision of what needs to be incised because of the patient's discomfort and bleeding, then you should fill the wound with lint soaked in corrosive ointment and leave it until it corrodes the remaining fat, and then treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 48.
Concerning the perforation of abscesses that come under the nipple.
These abscesses that appear under the nipple are a type of hard scrofula, which contains a sac-like skin.
And some of these contain humidity; and those that contain humidity should be incised with a lunar section according to this figure: from line G to line B. And when all the pus in the abscess has been evacuated, then you fill it with old lint and leave it there until the next day.
Then the lint should be removed and treated with a suitable ointment until it is healed.
And if the abscess is of the type of nodes and scrofula, then you incise it as we have said in the section on scrofula similarly.
But if the wound is extensive so that putrefaction occurs, then apply cautery as we have previously described.
Chapter 49.
Concerning the incision of abscesses that occur from archery or from a vein.
When an artery is broken, and the surrounding flesh is consolidated, then often an abscess occurs. And the signs by which it is known that inflammation and abscess are from an artery or vein are these: because when the abscess is from an artery it is long and deeply situated in the body; and when you press the abscess with your fingers, you feel in it a sort of grating/creaking sound.
And that which is from a vein is round and superficial on the body.
And incision of this abscess is dangerous, especially in that which is under the armpits, and in the groin, and in the neck, and in many places of the body; and if it is very large, then its treatment with iron should be avoided; and that which is in the extremities, or on the head, should be avoided [i.e., incision should be avoided].
But concerning that which is there because of inflammation of the opening of the artery, make a longitudinal incision in the flesh; and then open the incision with forceps and approach the artery, and free it from the surrounding tissues until it is uncovered.
Then place a needle on it and make it penetrate to the other side, and tie the artery with double thread in two places — a procedure which I have shown you in the extraction of two arteries which are in the temples.
Then puncture the place which is between two ligaments with a spatula until all the blood that is there comes out, and the abscess is dissolved.
Then administer treatment where pus is generated until the ligaments fall away; and then treat it with ointments suitable for this until it is healed.
And if it is an abscess caused by a severed vein, then it is necessary that you hold with your hand as much of the abscess as is possible with the flesh, and then insert the needle below the place which you have held under your hand, and make it penetrate; and let there be a double thread in it so that you extract it from the other side, and then tie the abscess with a good ligature as I have told you in the ligature of a grape in two parts with two ends of the thread.
But if you fear that you will pull out the thread, then insert the thread with that needle below the entire abscess below the incision of the first needle, and tighten the your threads in four places.
Then dry the abscess in the middle of it until, when what is in it has come out, then you incise the superfluity of the flesh, and leave what is tied there.
Then place on it a poultice which you have soaked in wine and oil, and then administer the treatment which is done with warm applications and ointments until it is healed.
Chapter 1 of the abscess which happens because of a twisted nerve.
Just as an abscess happens in an artery and in a vein, similarly an abscess happens in the nerves when it happens by percussion or happens by excessive work, and similarly.
And it is made mostly in the locations of the joints or of the heel, or in any place where the joints are injured.
And the abscess is serious, and it resembles the color of the other body parts, and it is in the largest of its dispositions without them, and when it is constricted with vehemence, the patient feels a kind of numbness there.
And the abscess is not aggregated in the front of the body, and therefore it is below the collarbone, and it is injured in every part and does not go to the front or back parts.
Therefore, that which is in the joints should not be invaded with iron, because contraction will quickly occur.
But that which is in the head or on the forehead, incise it with a spatula. But if it is a small abscess, then grasp it with forceps and cut it away from the root.
And if it is large, then you suspend it with a hook, and flay it, and then remove it; and close the wound with sutures, and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 50.  (Assuming a chapter numbering system)
Concerning the incision of an abscess which occurs in the area that occurs in the abdomen.  (A more natural English rendering might be: "Concerning the incision of an abdominal abscess.")
It happens to some men many times in their bellies and in other parts of their bodies, those things which are called fungi, by similarity to fungi, of which the root is subtle and the head is large; and indeed, the lips of these are inverted, and some are small, and some are very large.
And I have seen one, and in his belly were two such things which were very similar to fungi, and there was no difference between them, white, with thin roots.
And indeed the lips of these were inverted and split open, and a moisture flowed from them constantly.
Therefore I incised them and found in one about eighteen ounces, and in the other about six ounces.
And the operation in the incision of them is that you consider then if the patient is humid, and the color of the growth is white, humid, with a subtle root; then you incise it with a broad spatula, and let there be cauteries in the fire in your presence, for many times from the section of it much blood is expelled; and if the blood overcomes you, cauterize it.
And if you see the patient fearful and timid, beware of incision with iron; but then take freshly made lead plaster, and bind it to the growth, in the manner which we have described; and leave it for two days.
And then adjust the tightness of the lead thread; therefore, do not cease to tighten the lead strongly around the growth, until it is severed and falls off by itself without effort.
But if the growth has a thick root, then in its incision there is some cause for fear and dread, and especially that which is in the belly.
But it is possible that you incise half of it, and then cauterize it so that it does not return.
And then care for it until the wound is healed.
And beware that you do not presume to incise a growth which is of a dark color, with little feeling, and little bleeding, for that is undoubtedly cancerous.
And I come with the reminder of cancer concerning this.
Chapter 52.
Concerning the treatment of a protrusion of the umbilicus.
A protrusion of the umbilicus is caused by many things; either by a fissure of the membrane which is over the belly, and from it the intestine or bowel, as happens in other ruptures; or by blood which flows from a vein or artery as previously mentioned, or by wind constricted there.
But if it is due to a fissure of the membrane and a protrusion of the intestine, then the color of the swelling is similar to the color of the body; and it is soft without pain, and appears in various locations. And if it is due to the exit of the bowel, then its location is as we have recounted, with more vehement variety, and when you press it with your fingers it is hidden, and soon returns; and it is quickly in its place, and is greatly increased by the entry of a bath and strenuous work.
But if it is due to humidity, then it is soft and is not hidden when you press it with your hand, nor is it constricted, nor does it grow.
And if it is due to blood, then the swelling appears with these signs, inclining to blackness.
But if it is due to raw flesh, then the swelling is heavy, large and hard, and is fixed in a certain amount.
But if it is due to wind/gas, then touching it is soft.
And the operation in this case is that you consider then if the swelling of the umbilicus is due to arterial blood, or venous blood, or due to wind/gas; then you must be prohibited from its treatment, because in that there is fear and danger, as I have taught you in the chapter in which I discussed swellings from arteries and veins.
And if the swelling of the umbilicus is due to the intestine or the membrane, then you must order the patient to hold their breath and lie down; and then mark with a probe around the entire umbilicus, and then order them to lie between your hands on their back, and then surround with a wide spatula around the umbilicus over the area which you have marked with the probe; and then extend half of the swelling upwards with a large inch; and then bind it around with strong thread or with a bandage, in a proper manner of binding.
And then open the middle of the extended swelling over the ligature and insert your finger into that opening and seek the intestine; and if you have found it and held it by the ligature, then you cautiously extract and push the intestine back into the interior of the abdomen.
And if you have found the membrane, then take that with tweezers; and incise its superfluities.
But if it is contrary to your [knowledge of] artery or vein, then circumcise that area, and then return to your operation; and take two needles and put on those two strong threads and insert the two needles into the circle which you have made around the swelling in the manner of a cross, which you should make penetrate; and then tighten the swelling into four parts over the needles.
And if you wish, remove the needles and leave the place until the extended flesh dries and falls off by itself; or incise it when it is thinned and dried, and then treat it with whatever ointments are necessary until it is healed.
And if the prominence of the umbilicus is of flesh growing there or due to humidity, then it is necessary that you concavate the abscess as we have said and extract the blood or humidity which you find there, and then treat it with what is necessary and which will consolidate the area.
Chapter 53.
On the treatment of cancer.
We have already spoken, in the division, of the types of cancer and in what manner it is possible to treat it with medicines, and that it is advisable to avoid treatment with iron so that it does not become ulcerated; and we have spoken of cancer and the great care in its treatment.
And the ancients said that sometimes cancer is in a place where its eradication is possible, such as cancer which is in the breasts or in the groin and similar members, to extract it all, and especially when it is small in the beginning.
But when it is old and large, one should not meddle with it, for I have never been able to cure anyone of it, nor have I seen anyone else who has succeeded in doing so.
And the operation on it, when it is located as we have said, is that you proceed and purge the patient and draw out some black bile, and then bleed him, if a clear plethora is found.
Then prepare the patient for the operation where it is located, and then apply to the wound ointments which are suitable for it; and then scrape away from all sides with a sharp spoon until no trace remains of its roots. And let the blood flow, and do not stop it lightly, and press the places, and wipe away all the thick blood with your hand or with whatever instrument is available to you.
But if you find the flow of thick blood contrary [to your wishes] from an incision of a vein or artery, then cauterize it until the flow of blood stops, and then treat it with the other treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 44.  (Assuming a standard chapter numbering system)
On the treatment of dropsy.
We have already recounted, in the division, the types of dropsy of water, and the signs of each type, and their treatment with medicines.
And that which is cured with iron is only the species of ascites, and iron is not applied to the species of tympanites or the species of anasarca, for that is mortal.
And when you have treated this type of tympanitic dropsy with medicines and your treatment is ineffective, then consider: for if the patient has already acquired debility, or has another illness along with this dropsy, such as a cough or abdominal pain, and similar things, then be careful not to treat them with iron, for there is danger in that.
But if you see the patient with exuberant strength, and with no other illness except dropsy alone, and neither a child nor an old person, then the manner of operating on them is that you raise the patient between your hands, and the attendant gently presses their abdomen with their hand, driving the water towards the area below the pubic bone, and then take a pointed lancet in this manner:
Let it be two-edged, long, with a sharp point like a lancet; but nevertheless let there be some shortness in it, little by little, so that in the operation with it you do not penetrate into the intestine and injure it.
And then consider if the generation of the dropsy is from the intestines, for then it is necessary that you, with the incision, distance yourself from the navel by the amount of three fingers towards the lower parts, to the right of it above the pubic bone.
But if the generation of the dropsy is due to liver disease, then your incision should be to the left of the navel by three fingers.
And if its generation is due to the spleen, then your incision should be on the right side.
And it is not fitting that your incision be on the side on which the patient wishes to lie, lest the superfluities flow to that weak place.
And then perforate the entire peritoneum with the instrument, and then insert it into that incision, and raise your hand with the spatula between the peritoneum and the diaphragm, and you should scrape that; and if it is the amount of a fingernail or thereabouts.
And then perforate the diaphragm until the spatula reaches the empty place, which is the location of the water. And then extract that and insert an instrument of which this is the form: and it is similar to a fine silver cannula; it is made of silver or bronze or latten, which at its lower part has a small hole, and on its sides there are three holes: two on one side and one on the other; and its end is incised in the manner of a feather, like this:
And at its uppermost end is a ring, because when the instrument reaches the water, then that immediately descends upon the instrument, therefore evacuating the water in a moderate amount, for if you evacuate more than is necessary at once, the patient will quickly die from the dissolution of their animal spirit, or they will suffer syncope which is near to death.
But evacuate according to the strength of the patient and according to what the patient's condition indicates to you by the strength of their pulse and their general well-being.
And then extract the instrument, and retain the water, the reason being that it is immediately retained by the chain which covers the hole that is on the cup, which I have described to you how to pierce in that manner.
And then repeat the procedure with the instrument the next day if you see the patient tolerating it, and extract a small quantity of water, and do this for a few days cautiously, and guard against error so that only a little water remains.
But if you fear for the patient and leave a large quantity of water, then treat them with burial in warm sand, and induce sweating in a bath, and expose them to the sun for a long time; and treat them with drying medicines until they are healed.
And cauterize the stomach, spleen, and liver after the extraction of the water, as I have recounted in what precedes.
Chapter 45.
Concerning the treatment of children born with imperforate urinary tracts.
Sometimes a child is born from its mother's womb and the opening of its urethra is not perforated (or is narrow or not in its proper place).
Therefore it is necessary to treat it with perforation immediately after birth, using a very fine instrument, according to this method:
And then place a thin lead pin in the opening and leave it there for three or four days.
And when it wants to urinate, it should be stimulated, and it will urinate; and then replace the pin.
And if you do not place the lead pin, it is possible that the urine which goes to that place will not allow it to close.
But that in which the opening is narrow should be treated with a lead pin, as we have said, for several days until it is widened.
But those in whom the opening is not in its place, so it is said, the cause of which is that in those who are born and the opening is below the end of the penis, so that they cannot urinate normally until they lift the penis with their hand upwards; and this is not a generative defect, because the semen cannot reach the womb in a straight line, and it is a very prolonged illness.
And the manner of the operation is that the patient should be placed on his back, and then extend the head of his penis with your left hand with a strong pull, and incise the head of the penis at the location of the foreskin with a sharp instrument, like a feather incision, or that you shave a part, so that the middle of it comes to resemble the head of the penis and that the opening falls in the middle as needed.
And beware of bleeding during your operation, for that often happens; and stop the bleeding with something that will staunch it, and care for the wound until it is healed.
Chapter 56.
Concerning phimosis, which occurs in the foreskin at the head of the penis, and of corruption, blackness, and adhesion of the foreskin to the head of the penis.
This phimosis often occurs on the penis and is an excessive growth of fleshy tissue.
And of that, one is malignant and the other is not malignant.
For the non-malignant type, you should suspend it with a fine thread and excise it until it is entirely removed; then place on that wound a cotton ball soaked in Egyptian ointment; and afterwards, treat it with diafinicon ointment until it is healed.
And if the phimosis is malignant, of a dark color, then you should apply cautery after incising it and its root.
But if the phimosis is on the prepuce of the glans penis that is uncircumcised, and one part of the phimosis is inside the prepuce and the other part is outside, then you should remove the part that is inside first until it is healed; and then you treat the outside part, because if you treat both at the same time, there is a risk of damaging the prepuce.
And if you find in the genitals and prepuce blackness and corruption, then you should excise everything that is already blackened and beginning to corrupt or already corrupted; and then apply to that area a poultice of honey, mixed with ground pomegranate rind and crushed and sifted herbs.
And then treat it with other appropriate remedies until it is healed.
But if there is a flow of blood, then apply lunar cautery according to this method:
Because cautery is helpful for two conditions at once, that is, for the flow of blood and for the wound when it is corrupted (infected).
And if the head of the penis is corroded and completely destroyed, then you should insert a lead cannula into the meatus of the prepuce so that the patient can urinate through it.
In the adhesion of the prepuce to the head of the penis (and this adhesion only occurs in one whose prepuce is healthy, and circumcision has not been performed; and when adhesion occurs due to a wound or abscess), you must scrape with a blunt spatula until the bond is dissolved and the head of the penis is freed from all parts.
And if it is difficult to separate them delicately, then you must scrape with a spatula some of the head of the penis and the prepuce, and this is because the prepuce, when thin, is easily perforated by its slight thinness.
Then separate the prepuce from the head of the penis with a very fine linen cloth, which has been soaked in cold water, so that they do not adhere again.
And then let it be treated with styptic wine until it is consolidated (healed).
Chapter 57.
Of the cleansing of children and the treatment of what happens to those circumcised.
Circumcision is not a solution of continuity like other wounds; however, since it is of our operation and our will, and since it is properly performed on infants, it is necessary that we assign to it the best operation and the easiest method leading to health.
Therefore, I say that the ancients did not describe circumcision in any of their books, because they did not use it in their laws, and it is only because we have acquired it through experience, which is why I have found most of the artisans and barbers use circumcision and cleansing with a lancet and with forceps; and they use ligation with thread and incision with the fingernail.
And I have tried all these methods and I find no better cleansing with forceps, with ligation with thread, than cleansing with the fingernail, because many times the inner layer escapes above, because the foreskin has two layers, and the inner layer remains, and is easily forced to another incision and certain pain. And with cleansing which is done with an awl, and is digital, which cobblers use, the incision of the tip of the penis is not assured, because it easily enters the hole.
But in the operation with a fingernail, it easily becomes rusty and corrupts your operation. And the foreskin of a child is short by nature, and many times it is born in such a way that it has no need of cleansing, and I have seen this.
But of the cleansing that is done with forceps and ligatures with thread, the goodness, experience has shown me, because the forceps are of proportional incision, for that reason the sharpness that is above is like the sharpness that is below; and thus as you press your hand, two sharpnesses are proportional, and you incise according to a comparison at one time; and compression of the thread is made with a shape containing the foreskin of the penis from all sides, with which no error is made at all.
And the manner of the first operation is that you make the child lie down, especially if it is of those who understand a little, that you do nothing but tie the thread around its penis only, and that you leave it until the next day.
And then make it happy in every way possible for it, that which it receives in its understanding. And then make the child lie still between your hands, prepared and not moving; and hide the forceps in your hand or under your foot, so that the child does not see them nor any other instruments.
And then put your hand to his penis and blow on the foreskin, and pull it back until the head of the penis is revealed, and then cleanse it of whatever dirt is adhering to it.
The shape of the forceps for circumcision, this is the shape:
Let one end be blunt and the other sharp, so that the nail head does not come out, and let the length of the two points be like the length of two thumbs equally.
But the error in circumcision is that you too quickly remove the entire inner foreskin, or part of it, from below the incision.
Therefore, it is necessary that you stretch that [skin] with your fingernail before the suppuration of the area and that you incise it equally.
And if you cannot hold it with your fingernail, then pull it with a hook and incise it.
But if three days have passed, and what is swollen remains under the inflamed penis, then you should leave it until the hot abscess subsides, and carefully scrape it, and incise it as you see fit.
And be careful of the head of the penis, for it will harm him if you [damage it].
And then treat it with that which consolidates the wound, from the powders which we have recommended in the treatise on powders.
And if it is incised beyond measure from the scrotum and it extends to the upper parts, this will not harm him.
And moreover, treat it with what we have said until it is healed.
Chapter 58.
Concerning the treatment of urine retained in the bladder.
Retention of urine in the bladder is caused by obstruction by a stone, or by congealed blood, or by pus, or by flesh, and similar to those things that we have mentioned in the methods of treatment in the division.
And if it is not dissolved with what we have said and the cause is vehement in the patient, then it is necessary to administer extraction with an instrument which is called a syringe, of which this is the form: Let it be of silver and subtly hollowed, like a bird's quill, with a thin and long shaft, similar to a palm and a half in length, which has a slender tube in its head.
And the manner of drawing out the urine with this is that you take a doubled bladder and tie wool or cotton to its extremity with a good binding; and introduce the extremity of the bladder into the lower part of the syringe, and cut with scissors if there is any excess wool, but introduce it into the tube forcefully. And then lubricate the syringe with butter and egg white.
And make the patient sit on a chair, and rub his bladder and penis with moist oils, olive oil and rosewater.
And then gently introduce the syringe until it reaches the root of the penis; and then bend the penis upwards towards the navel; and then push the syringe inside; and then push it until it reaches the bladder, and this will cause the patient to feel that it has reached the empty space, and it is not done according to this order, but the opening goes in a tortuous way.
And then extend the bladder with the wool little by little, because the urine will soak the wool.
Then remove it and do this for urine treatment, and use a syringe; do not cease doing this and using the syringe until the bladder is emptied and the patient finds relief.
Chapter 59.
Concerning the quality of bladder clysterization with a catheter and similar instruments suitable for this.
When an ulceration or abscess occurs in the bladder, or blood clots in it, or putrefaction is constricted there, and you want to instill waters and medicines into it, then it should be done with an instrument which is called a catheter, and this is its form:
except that its extremity is blunt, that is, closed. And in that [extremity] are three holes: two on one side, like eyes.
At the beginning, there is a concave place, into which that which is to be expelled is placed, and it should be according to the quantity that fills that [concavity], without addition, so that when something is drawn from the humors by the suction, it is drawn, and when expelled, with that [same suction], it is drawn, and when it is expelled far, as a catheter does with which naphtha is sucked in naval battles.
Therefore, when you want to draw out humors from the bladder, introduce the end of the catheter into the humidity, and draw with it that which is pushed upwards in the parts, because the humidity is drawn into the concavity of the catheter.
And then introduce the end of the catheter into the urethra as we have recounted in the syringe; and then expel the humidity with that which you expel, because that humidity arrives at the bladder immediately, and the patient feels it.
The form of the subtle catheter with which the bladder is catheterized, and this is its form:
And let it be made of silver or tin, of which the uppermost part should resemble a small feather, and below it a slender, hollow tube.
Then take a goatskin bladder, and place in it the liquid you wish to instill into the bladder; and then tie it tightly between two [ends] with strong double ligature, and warm that liquid over the fire.
And then introduce the end of the catheter into the penis.
And then squeeze your hand on the bladder with the liquid with gentle pressure until the patient says that the liquid has reached the bladder.
But if you do not have a bladder at hand, then take a piece of parchment and make a circle from it; and perforate it throughout its roundness; and then insert strong thread into those holes, so that it is tightly bound; and then apply the circle so that it is sealed, after you place in it what you want of liquids, oils, and waters.
And then you tie that to the instrument and do with that as you have done with the bladder, and express with your hand until the liquid reaches the bladder.
Chapter 60.
Of the extraction of a stone.
We have already mentioned in the division the types of stone and their cure with medicines, and the difference between a stone generated in the kidneys and a stone generated in the bladder, and the signs of that.
And we have spoken of the stone in which one operates with the hand and incision.
And the stone generated in the bladder properly is that which is lodged in the bladder.
And I am narrating that with manifest exposition and abbreviation.
Therefore I say that the stone generated in the bladder mostly comes to children; and of its signs it is that the urine that is expelled from the bladder is similar to water in its thinness, and sand appears in it; and the patient rubs his genitals, and often cries out in pain, and is restless; and with this, the anus protrudes in many of them.
And the healing of children from this is easy until they have reached fourteen years; and it is difficult to cure in the elderly. But in young people it is moderate because it is between those [extremes, i.e., easier than in the elderly, harder than in children].
And of that [stone] in which the stone is larger, the cure is easier; and if it is small, it is contrary to that [i.e., more difficult].
Therefore, concerning the cure of this, it is necessary at the beginning that we cleanse the patient with a clyster which removes all the waste that is in his bowels; for this waste sometimes prevents the detection of the stone through examination.
Then let the patient be taken with his feet up and be massaged and moved around so that the stone descends to the bottom of the bladder, or that it may move from its position sometimes.
Then make that [patient's] body between your hands prepared, and his hands should be below his thighs, so that the whole bladder is made to incline downwards.
And then search for it and all that is outside.
Therefore, if you feel the stone in the space [bladder], then you should immediately prepare for an incision upon him.
And if it does not descend completely under your touch, then it is necessary that you lubricate your index finger of the left hand with oil, if the patient is a child, or the middle finger if he is a grown young man, and insert it into his anus. And search for the stone until it is under your finger. And bring it back little by little towards the neck of the bladder.
And then press on it with your finger, and expel it outwards towards the place where you will make the incision.
And instruct the assistant to press on the bladder with her hand; and instruct another assistant to extend the genitalia upwards with her right hand, and with her other hand to hold back the perineum which is below the genitalia, in the area where the incision will be made.
And then insert a well-sharpened spatula, of which this is the form: And incise what is between the anus and the genitals, not in the middle, but towards the left thigh; and let the incision be over the stone, and your finger should be in the anus, and let the incision be transverse, so that the outer incision is wide and the inner incision is narrow, according to the size of the stone which it is possible to extract, and no larger, for your finger which is in the anus will easily compress the stone against the incision, and it will be expelled without difficulty.
And know that some stones are angular and jagged, which makes their extraction difficult because of this.
And of those that are like a smooth acorn, and are round, the extraction is easily done.
Therefore, if it is one that is angular and jagged, adjust it in the fissure.
And if it is not thus expelled, then you must press upon it, or squeeze it with a suitable instrument, the end of which is like a file with which you press on the stone, and it does not escape; or that you introduce underneath it a fine instrument with a curved end.
But if you cannot succeed with that, then enlarge the opening a little, and if you see a flow of blood, staunch it with crushed vitriol.
But if the stone is more than one, then initially you place your hand at the opening of the bladder, and then incise upon it; and then push it a little further; and similarly do if there are many more than two.
And if the stone is very large, then it is unwise to incise it with a large incision, for two things may befall the patient: either death, or continuous urinary incontinence, because the area is not entirely consolidated (healed).
But administer its expulsion until it is removed, or work on breaking it with forceps until you extract it in pieces.
Then, when you have completed your operation, fill the wound with aloe and dragon's blood powder, and bind it tightly. And place over that a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or in rose oil and cold water, so that a hot abscess may be reduced.
Then lay the patient supine on his back, and do not untie the bandage until the third day.
And when you have untied it, bathe the area with water and much oil, and then treat it with diafinicon ointment and basilicon ointment until it is healed.
But if in the wound there occurs a hot, burning, corrosive abscess, similar to blood frozen in the bladder, and because of it urine is prevented (and this is known by the passage of blood with urine), then insert your finger into the wound and extract that blood, for if it remains it will provoke corruption of the bladder and putrefaction.
Then wash the wound with sour wine, water, and salt, and with a poultice of whatever is suitable for its healing until it is healed.
And it is necessary during the entire treatment that you bind both thighs and adjust the medicines which are placed on the area.
And if the stone is small and is in the meatus of the penis, and is lodged there, and the flow of urine is obstructed, then treat it with what I recommended before resorting to incision, for many times because of this treatment incision has been accused; and I have already proven this, and that is that you take a smooth iron borer, of which this is the form:
of triangular sharpened end, fixed in wood.
Then take gall, and bind the penis below the stone with it so that it does not return to the bladder.
Then insert the iron into the penis, perforating easily until the borer reaches the stone. And rotate the borer with your hand on that stone little by little, and you will enlarge the perforation until you make it penetrate from the other side; for the urine will immediately be released.
Then press your hand on what remains of the stone on the outside part of the penis, because that is broken, and it is expelled with the urine, and the patient is healed.
But if this cure is not suitable for you for some reason that prevents it, then tie one gall below the stone, and another gall above the stone. Then incise upon the stone in that penis between the two ligatures. And then extract it. Then untie the ligature and clean the congealed blood which is made in the wound.
And it is not necessary to ligate with gall below the stone, except so that it does not return to the bladder; and the other ligature above, because when the gall is untied near the extraction of the stone, the urethra returns to its place and closes the wound.
And for this reason it is necessary for you, when you ligate the gall above, that you elevate the urethra to the upper parts, or that it return by your action, and close the wound as we have said.
Chapter 61.
On the extraction of a stone from women.
Stones are rarely generated in women.
But if a stone is found in any of them, then its cure is difficult, and is forbidden by many methods.
One of these [methods] is because a woman very quickly becomes a virgin again.
And the second is because you will not find a woman, be she chaste or married, who willingly reveals herself to the physician.
The third is because you will not find a woman who knows this art well, especially the operation with the hand.
And the fourth is that the location of the incision for a stone in women is far from the location of the stone itself, wherefore a deep incision is necessary, and in that there is danger.
But if necessity compels you to this, then it is necessary that you take a female physician who is skilled, and few such are found.
But if you are deprived of that, then seek a cautious and subtle physician, or present a matron well-versed in the matters of women, or a woman who has some understanding of this art.
Therefore, present that woman, and command her to do everything that you order, from the initial examination for the stone;  the reason is that if she is a virgin, she should insert her finger into the woman's rectum and search for the stone.
Therefore, if she finds it,  constrict it beneath her finger, and then command her to incise it.
But if she is not a virgin, then command the matron to insert her finger into the vagina of the patient and search for the stone, while placing her left hand on the bladder and compressing it with good pressure.
Therefore, if she finds it, then she should gradually draw it from the opening of the bladder to the lower parts, using all her strength, until it reaches the root of the thing.
And then incise it near the midpoint of the vagina above the root of the thing, wherever it is positioned, and center the stone in that area, and her finger should not be removed from the stone, holding it beneath.
And the incision should be small at first; and then insert a probe into that incision, and if the stone is felt, then adjust the incision according to the size that she knows the stone will be extracted from.
And know that the types of stones are many: for some are small and large, and smooth and rough, and long and round, and having branches.
Therefore, you should know how many types there are of it, so that you can signify what you wish.
And if you see a flow of blood, apply crushed vitriol to the area and keep it there for an hour until the bleeding stops, and then return to your operation until the stone is removed.
And make sure you prepare with you the instruments which are mentioned in the extraction of stones in men, so that you are aided by them in your operation.
And if you see a flow of blood, and you know that the expulsion of blood is from the artery that has been incised, then place powder on the area and bind it tightly with powder and a descending bandage, and do not repeat this; and leave the stone and do not extract it, for the patient will quickly die. And then take care of the wound.
Then, when the sharpness of the blood has subsided after a few days, and the area is dry, you return to your operation until the stone is removed.
Chapter 62.
Concerning the incision of a strangulated hernia.
A watery hernia is nothing but an accumulation of humidity in the white scrotum, which is below the genitals containing the testicles, and is called the scrotum.
And sometimes it is in the very membrane that nature prepared for the testicle, so that it seems that there is another testicle; and this is the spermatic cord between the white scrotum that we have mentioned, and this is merely a swelling.
And the generation of this hernia is due to weakness which affects the genitals, so that this matter is poured into them, and sometimes it happens due to a blow inflicted on the genitals.
And this humidity has many colors, for its color is either tending towards yellow or bloody, or red, or black and foul-smelling, or a watery white, and this is most common.
And the signs by which it is known where this accumulation of water is are these: for if it is in the white scrotum which we have mentioned, then the swelling is round, tending slightly towards length, like the shape of an egg, and it surrounds the testicle, for the humidity contains it on all sides.
And if the humidity is in the very membrane, then the swelling is round near the testicle, and therefore one thinks it is another testicle.
And if the humidity is between the cord of the genitals and the white scrotum, then it falls below the seam.
And if you wish to know the color of the humidity, then you test the color of the humidity in the swelling with a probe, the shape of which is known beforehand; and according to what has come out on the probe, judge what is inside.
Therefore, when we come to its treatment with iron (cautery), then it is necessary to command the patient to be bled if that is possible for you, and see his body is full (plethoric).
Then let him be supine on his back on something slightly raised, and place many cloths under him.
And then sit on his left side, and command the assistant to sit on his right, who will extend his finger to one of two sides, to the cord of the genitals and to the part of the navel.
And then take a broad spatula and split the cord of the genitals from the middle downwards along its length almost to the pubic bone.
And let the incision be made straight, equally distant from the line that divides the skin of the genitals, until it reaches the included white fat.
And peel away that [fat], and observe, and be careful not to cut into it; and your peeling with which you peel it away should be gentle, suspended and subtle, scrutinizing with the peeling as much as is possible for you.
And then pierce the water-filled cyst with a wide perforation, and extract all the water.
And then separate the two lips of the incision with hooks, and extend the cyst upwards; and do not touch the cord of the genitals that is included, and incise the cyst in the way that is possible for you. And incise it in its entirety or in pieces, and especially its thin layer, for if you do not carefully scrutinize its incision, there is no certainty that the water will not return.
But if the egg [testicle] protrudes from its cord during your operation, then when you have completed the incision of the cyst, return it inside, and then join the two lips of the cord of the genitals with a suture, and then treat it like other wounds until it is healed.
And if you find the testicle corrupted by another disease, then it is necessary that you tie the vessels which are on the spermatic cord, and remove the testicle, and then treat it as we have said.
But if the fluid is collected in two separate areas, then know that there are two hernias; therefore incise that area in the same way as you did the other; and if it seems to you to be one operation, then you perform it.
And then you wipe away the blood, and insert into the incisions wool soaked in oil or rose oil; and place on top more wool which you have soaked in wine and oil, and spread this over the genitals and the wound of the belly; and place on top folded cloths and powders, and bind these on top with a bandage which is according to this form:
And then two cloths should be taken and filled with carded wool in this manner; and the ends should be made with which it is bound with cotton or moistened wool, and should be secured with a ligature in the waistband of the breeches, and one end should reach from the buttocks to the two [groin areas], and the second should reach to the area of the perineum, and two ends on the two thighs below, and two other ends on the two ankles, and the entire binding should be adjusted in the waistband of the breeches.
And sometimes this hernia is treated artificially with cautery instead of incision with an iron; and it is that you take a thin, knife-like cautery and that you incise with it the skin of the genitals, and it is ignited as we have recounted until the white cyst containing the fluid is exposed, and then you take a cautery according to this form: and it is similar to the Greek letter.
And then perforate the cyst with it, and ignite it until all the moisture is expelled.
And then extend the cyst with forceps, and scrape it with forceps, and scrape it with a thin, ignited cautery; and incise it as much as possible until you eradicate all of it; and beware that the fire does not touch the egg [testicle].
And know that this operation is safer and involves less blood loss, and better than operation with incision.
But if an abscess forms contrary to expectation during incision or cauterization, or there is excessive bleeding, then you must treat whatever opposes you in this, with the treatment that suits it, as described.
But if the patient is fearful and does not expect a second operation because of its horror, then administer perforation as I have recommended here; and that is when you are certain, by what we have said concerning the signs, that the hernia is watery.
Then you should make the patient sit on some elevated seat, then perforate the abscess at its lowest part with a broad lancet, and make the perforation according to the length of the body.
And let the opening be wide enough that all the water runs out.
And then place a cotton cloth over the area and bind it, and leave it so that the remaining water drains out. And then care for it until the wound is healed.
But if there is resistance to the outflow of water at that time, you should perforate it: and this is done only because the white panniculus in the orifice of the wound creates resistance and prevents the egress of water, then you should put into the wound a probe or instrument with which water is extracted from dropsies, the form of which is described before; or adjust a small opening in the compression of the wound.
And know that the water returns, and is accumulated again after about six months or thereabouts; and when it is accumulated, then let it be perforated in the same manner, for the patient will thus pass his days.
Chapter 63.
Concerning the incision of a fleshy hernia and its cure.
Know that in the incision of this hernia there is fear leading to harm in most cases; therefore, in my view, its removal and salvation by that means is better.
And I am recalling the operation in that case and the types of abscesses.
Therefore, I say that abscesses arise in the genitals, which are composed of flesh, and this is caused by many things: either by an acute, sharp superfluity, which is poured into the genitals, or by percussion (a blow).
And the color of the abscess is according to the color of the flesh, and no pain is found in it, and it is a serious abscess.
And very quickly is a stony abscess formed, whose color is dark, and there is no feeling in it.
And sometimes it is caused by a knotting of the arteries, and by the inflammation of them as it is already perceived by the recollection of it, or by inflammation of the veins.
But that which is caused by inflammation of the arteries is known by the dispersion of the abscess when we compress it with our fingers; and it is not fitting that one touches it.
But that which is caused by inflammation of a vein is not dispersed by any means through compression with the fingers.
And it is possible that an incision is made on this type [of abscess] and on the other flesh; and it is that you incise the skin of the genitals, and then extend the testicle upwards, and extract it from the white sheath, and free the suspensory ligament, and tie it, and incise the suspensory ligament until you free it from every part of the parts of the testicle.
Therefore, if the testicle is already consolidated with those inflamed areas, then it is necessary that you extract the testicle and incise it.
And if there is adhesion between some part of the sheath, or between that which is between the vessels, then it is necessary that you free all that adhesion and incise it with a circular incision.
But if there is a growth of flesh at the place of adhesion which is behind, then it is necessary that you incise all that is there, and extract the testicle as we have said.
Then, when your operation is completed, fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine; and then treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
Chapter 64.
On the treatment of a hernia that is of the scrotum (or, a scrotal hernia).
A scrotal hernia is an abscess enveloped by some covering similar to a sac, with softening of the testicles, and it makes movement, exercise, and walking difficult for the patient.
And in the treatment of this illness, it is necessary to fear what preceded it (i.e., the cause of the illness).
However, we must describe the operation in the same way as the first (operation).
And I say that you must make the patient sit on a raised seat; and then gently push the suspensory ligament of the testicles downwards; and then hold the scrotum with your fingers, along with the vessels that are close to the penis; and have another assistant hold those, and stretch them vigorously.
And then incise with a broad, sharp scalpel with a transverse incision directly over the vessels, until the vessels are exposed.
And then scrape the entire area as we have told you in the extraction of arrowheads that are in the temples.
And then insert a double-threaded needle into them, and tie it at the first point where you made the incision, and tie it again at the other end. And then incise them in the middle with a straight incision along the length of the body, and extract what is accumulated of fetid and corrupt humors.
And then treat the wound with the same treatment as other wounds in which you want healing to be engendered, so that the vessels which nourish one of the two genitals may not be injured, for that is not good.
But if you injure all the vessels, then it is necessary that the testicles be removed or that the testicles be severed along with the vessels, so that they are deprived of all nourishment by the incision of the vessels, and that they be atrophied, or that they be severed so that they receive no nourishment.
Chapter 65.
On the treatment of intestinal hernia.
The occurrence of this hernia is due to a rupture that happens in the peritoneum extended over the abdomen, part of the abdominal muscles, so that the intestines protrude from that rupture to some of the intestines.
And this rupture is either of the peritoneum or of its extension, and these two types occur for many causes:  percussion, jumping, shouting, lifting something heavy, or similar things.
And the sign of this, when it is due to the extension of the peritoneum, is that it happens gradually over a long time, and not suddenly, and it is a swelling that gradually develops towards the front because the peritoneum compresses the intestine.
And the sign of it, when it is due to a rupture of the peritoneum, is that at the beginning it causes sudden, intense pain; and there is a visible swelling below the navel, and this is due to the protrusion of the intestine, and its body, through the parts outside the peritoneum.
And sometimes the omentum is expelled along with the intestine, and this hernia is called an intestinal zirbal hernia.  (Note: "zirbal" appears to be a term specific to this text and its meaning needs further investigation within the context of medieval medical terminology).
And sometimes it is caused by flatulence, and sometimes a tear occurs in the intestine, and it is retained there, and this is very harmful to the patient, and sometimes it causes severe pain, especially when pressed.
And in the treatment of this type of illness, using iron is dangerous, therefore, cauterization should be avoided in this case.
And the method of operating on this is that you instruct the patient to reduce the intestine with their hand to the inside of its cavity if it obeys its return, and then it should be bent over at the waist between your hands, and raise their legs.
Then hold the cord which is the spermatic cord in the upper part, and incise the spermatic cord completely lengthwise; then insert into the two lips of the incision hooks, as you need to open the incision with them.
And if the incision, according to the amount that is possible for you, allows the testicle to be expelled.
And then scrape away that layer of tissue which is beneath the spermatic cord, until the hard white tunic of each part is exposed.
Then you insert your finger into what is the testicle, into that which is between the white tunic, which is beneath the cord of the testicle, and between the second tunic, and break up with it the adhesions that are in the posterior part of the testicle.
Then gently pull the spermatic cord outwards with your hand, and with this, stretch the white tunic upwards with your left hand, and elevate the testicle with the tunic towards the incision; and instruct the assistant to extend the testicle upwards and you dissolve the adhesions behind with complete resolution.
And search with your fingers that there is no part of the intestine enveloped in the hard white tunic. But if you find any such thing, then push it back into the abdomen below.
And then incise in the part below the spermatic cord, by the incision from which blood and pus will flow, as we have recounted in what we have said.
Then apply wool soaked in oil and place it on the wound; and apply the ligature which we have described (and sometimes the white tunic is cauterized, which we said is near the incision to prevent bleeding, for this often occurs), and leave the ligature until it falls off by itself.
But if its falling off is delayed, then let it be bathed with warm water, and keep it there until it falls off as we have said.
Then treat the wound with the other treatments for wounds until it is healed.
Chapter 66.
Concerning a windy hernia (ventosity/flatulence hernia).
In this hernia, I have not seen anyone who has dared to treat it with iron.
And the first ones said that it is done in the same way as we have recounted in the hernia that is with blood; which is that you tie the vessels near the incision on that side carefully; and then dry the area in the middle around the abscess with what opens it, until the vessels collapse.
And treat the wound as we have said until it is healed.
Chapter 67.
Of the rupture that is made in the inguinal region.
Sometimes a rupture occurs in the groin as we have said, and the area swells.
And do not allow the intestines to descend into the genitals; and if they do, it is a small amount; and they return at all hours.
But if the time is prolonged with this, a fixed fissure is made in the scrotum until the intestine descends into the scrotum; and this happens because of the extension of the scrotum which is in the groin as we have said, which causes the scrotum to be stretched, and then it is softened and the area is inflamed and swollen.
And its cure is with cautery, as has been previously described.
And sometimes it is cured with an iron according to this manner:  the patient lies on their back between your hands, and then dry the area of the rupture of the swollen abscesses with a cut of the width of about three fingers.
And then tighten the white scrotum that is under the tailbone until it is uncovered/exposed.
Then take the iron and place it on the swollen part of the scrotum, and press it towards the pubic region/the front of the abdomen.
Then sew the two prominent areas on the end of the scrotum, and join one to the other with a suture.
Then remove the end of the iron, and do not completely incise the scrotum, nor extend the cut to the testicle, or anything else like that as I will let you know in the treatment of intestinal hernia.
Then treat it with the treatment for wounds, and if you have incised the tissues, clean it and restore the wound until it is healed; because the scrotum is contracted and the protrusion/hernia is not reduced.
And cauterization is better in this place, because it is closer to health/healing.
Chapter 68.
Concerning the softening of the swelling of the testicles.
Many times the swelling of the testicles in some men is softened because the flesh that is between them is softened, and its appearance is deceiving.
Then it is necessary for the one who is charged with his cure to make the patient lie on his back, and to incise all the swelling which is softened above the natural swelling; and then to join the two lips with a suture.
And if you wish, sew up at the beginning the excess of the softened swelling with three or four stitches and with a firm suture.
And then incise between the sutures; and then treat it with the treatment for other wounds until it is healed and the threads fall out.
Chapter 69.
On castration.
Know that castration is forbidden in our law, but because of this it is incumbent on me to mention it in this book; and its mention is necessary only for two reasons. The first is so that it may be within the knowledge of the physician when questioned about it, that he may know the treatment should it happen. And the second reason is that very often we have need of the castration of other animals for our benefit from them, such as horses, goats, pigs, and similar animals.
And therefore I say that castration is done in two ways: either by abrasion, or by incision.
But in that which is done by abrasion, the method of operation is that we should immerse the animal in warm water until its genitals are softened and relaxed and hang down. And then grasp them with your hand until they are resolved and do not appear beneath the touch.
But in castration done by incision, it is necessary that you hold the animal and grasp the scrotum of its testicles with your left hand.
And then tie the suspensory ligament, and incise each testicle with one cut until both testicles are separated.
And then incise them after you have skinned each one. And do not place any substance on those of the cyphus (presumably referring to a part of the body), except the subtle cyphus which is on the vessels.
And this manner of castration is better which is done by crushing, because strong crushing leaves little substance of the testicles behind, so that the animal does not desire copulation.
And then care for the wound until it is healed.
Chapter 70.
Concerning the treatment of hermaphroditism.
Hermaphroditism in men is of two kinds: one is where there appears in the space between the testicles, that which is between the two testicles, a woman's vulva-like shape, in which there is hair.
And sometimes urine flows from that which is in the space between the testicles.
But in women, there is one type: and it is that the woman's vulva, above the pubic area, is like two male testicles, somewhat smaller on the outer part, like a man's foreskin and two testicles.
And the treatment is of three kinds: two for men and one for women. And it is necessary that you incise those tightened tissues until the swelling subsides, and then treat them with the treatment for other wounds.
And in the second type in men, from which urine flows that is in the space between the testicles, there is no cure or operation for it.
Chapter 21.
Concerning swelling and prominent flesh due to causes in women.
A very strong swelling is caused by natural causes until it is pressed and reduced; and sometimes it is magnified in some women so much that it is spread like in men and interferes with intercourse.
Then it is necessary that you hold back the excess swelling with your hand or with ointments and incisions.
And do not overdo incisions, especially near the root, so that a flow of blood does not occur.
And then treat it with wound care until it is healed.
But a born-flesh growth is flesh that grows in the womb of the mother until it fills it, and it quickly emerges outwards resembling a tail (and for this reason some first called this "tailed illness"); therefore, it is necessary that we incise it as we incise a swelling, and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 72.
On the treatment of sciatica.
Sciatica is when the woman's vagina is not perforated, or the opening is small. And it is either natural or accidental.
Accidental is due to a preceding illness, and that is caused either by insufficiently formed flesh or by a thin or thick septum.
And it is formed either in the front of the mother, or in her sides, or in her upper part, or in her lower part, and it prohibits conception and childbirth, and strongly inhibits menstruation.
And the diagnosis of this is made by examination of the womb; if the obstruction is apparent, it is straightforward; but if it is not apparent, then you should look for it with your fingers or with a probe.
But if the obstruction is due to a thin septum, and is close to the two labia, then you should cut and break it up.
And you should place powders on the two labia, and then place your index fingers of both hands together.
And the woman should be on her back, her thighs spread, and then forcefully spread the two labia until that thin septum is broken and the obstruction is opened.
Then take wool and soak it in oil and place it on the area, and wash it with warm water daily so that the incised area does not heal.
But if the septum is thick and dense, then you should incise it with a broad spatula or with a myrtle leaf.
But if the obstruction is due to flesh, then lift it with a hook, and incise it.
And have with you the medicines that stop the flow of blood without biting, such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and incense, mixed with egg white.
Then administer a wide lead cannula so that the wound does not heal too quickly.
And keep it there for a few days and apply some dry poultice.
And then it should be treated with another consolidation cure until it is healed.
And sometimes it happens in the mother's birth of other flesh [likely referring to a difficult birth or a complication], and then it is necessary to incise in this manner. But if this is due to a phlegmonous abscess, to the phlegmonous abscess which is in the mother, no harm should be done with iron in any way.
Chapter 73.
Of the treatment of hemorrhoids and a boil or red swelling that occurs in the vulva of women.
Hemorrhoids are a swelling of the openings of many veins, from which much blood continuously flows; and when hemorrhoids are old, they become boils.
And I have already mentioned in the division the types of these and their symptoms, and I will say thus which ones receive treatment and which ones do not receive treatment.
Therefore I say that hemorrhoids and boils, when they are in the rectum of the mother and do not appear externally, then in those cases no treatment should be done with iron [i.e., cautery or surgery].
But those which are at the opening of the rectum, upon which one feels [them], are those that are treated.
And it is necessary that you place the woman in a cool place and then extend the boil with forceps, or with a rough cloth, and incise them at the roots.
And then sprinkle upon those wounds, to stop the flow of blood, one of the styptic powders without biting [i.e., causing further pain], such as acacia and similar ones.
And then bathe her feet for an hour, and then place them in cold water.
And if the flow of blood persists, then have her sit in a decoction of pomegranate leaves and bark,  walnuts, and similar things.
And then take barley flour and mix it with honey and sour wine and make a plaster with this and apply it to his back.
And if the blood is [already] stopped, good; and if not, apply two cupping glasses, to the breasts without scarification.
And then take wool and soak it in coriander juice or comfrey juice or wallflower juice with red wine and apply it to the area; and then treat the area with ointment until it is healed.
And treat that until it is healed.
Chapter 74.
Concerning the perforation of the esophagus, an accident in the mother.
Many kinds of abscesses occur in the mother, such as cancer, and stony abscesses, and ulcerating ones, and those that are swollen and herpetic, and fistulas, and hemorrhoids, and fissures, and boils, and other abscesses. And I have already discussed these illnesses and their types and their signs, and their treatments in the division (or section).
And it is fitting that I speak in this treatise of a burning abscess which occurs in the mother, when it is among the abscesses that collect pus. And if you wish to know in what manner the operation is performed with iron (a cautery).
Then you must consider if the pain of the abscess at its beginning is acute, with percussion (possibly meaning throbbing), and phlegm, and fever, and sometimes redness, and if it affects the feeling (sensation). Then do not treat it with perforation, and cure it with that which helps maturation until the acuteness of the symptoms ceases.
And then you must make the woman sit on a stool that has two supports; and let her recline on her back and adjust her feet to the part below her belly, and let her thighs be spread, and place her arms below her knees, and bind each with a suitable bandage.
And then the midwife follows from the right side and provides the instrument with which the orifice of the womb is opened, the form of which will come in those things that are done next.
And it is necessary, when you wish to administer this instrument, that you place with the ray (possibly referring to a light source or the direction of insertion) the cervix of the woman's womb, and that which of the instrument is inserted into the womb should not be more than the cervix of the womb and harms the patient. But if the instrument is larger than the cervix of the womb, then it is necessary that you place powders on the texture of the cervix of the womb so that the entry of any instrument into the cervix of the womb is prevented.
And it is necessary that you place the turning device that runs in the instrument from the upper side, and that the person administering it holds the instrument and rotates the turning device until the orifice of the womb is opened.
And when the wound appears, and is touched by the hand and is soft and moist, then it is necessary that you dry that place with a clean linen cloth.
And when the pus is evacuated, then it is necessary that you place in the wound a wick soaked in rose oil or green oil in which there is some astringency; and place the caulking in the section in the cervix of the womb.
And place outside the womb and over the vulva clean wool soaked in water in which mallows have been boiled.
And afterwards it should be cured for about two days with an ointment which is suitable for this, until it is healed.
And sometimes the womb and the wound are washed so that it is cleansed with water and honey, and afterwards with water in which the root of lilies or of long birthwort has been boiled, and afterwards return to the ointment.
And if the wound is deeply embedded in the closed womb, then you must be forbidden from treating it with iron, taking care of it with that which we have said in the division (section).
Chapter 75.
To teach midwives in what manner living embryos should be treated when they are expelled against nature (i.e., prematurely or abnormally).
It is necessary that the midwife know at the beginning the form of natural childbirth by its signs, and it is that when you see the woman straining downwards and desires to smell the air, and in addition is lightened by that which is above her from the birth, and hastens the expulsion of the embryo, then you know that this birth is according to the natural form, and it is the expulsion of it head first, and the afterbirth with it either suspended or hanging from the umbilicus.
Therefore, when you see those signs, then it is necessary that her belly be compressed so that the embryo descends easily because when it descends head first, the afterbirth descends with it, and it is cleansed of those superfluities with good purification.
But that which is other than this birth is unnatural and unfavorable, for when the embryo is expelled feet first and its body is expelled before its head and its feet, and one of its hands, or its foot, or its head and its hand, or its belly, and quickly is turned over upon its neck, and similar to its unfavorable forms.
Therefore it is necessary for the midwife to be wise and subtle in all these matters, and to guard herself against error and deception.
And I am showing all the forms of these, and what skill is needed in them so that it may be signified by this and may be established upon this.
When the fetus is expelled head first by natural exertion, and this is strenuous for the woman and the birth is difficult, and sometimes her strength is already weakened, then have her sit, or have the women support her, and evaporate her genitals with cooked fenugreek and moist oils.
Then the midwife inserts a small spatula between her labia and tears the secundina with it, or scrapes it with her fingernail until the moisture within it is removed. And press the woman's belly until the fetus descends.
But if it does not descend, then the woman should be enemas with mallow and fenugreek mucilage.
And then order her, during the enema, to be compressed and make her sneeze with a sternutatory; and hold her mouth and nose for an hour, for the fetus will be expelled immediately.
And if both hands of the fetus are expelled at the beginning, then you must reduce them gently little by little. But if it does not obey the introduction, then place the woman on a stool and raise her legs, and then shake the stool on the ground; and the woman should be held so that she does not fall from the shaking.
And if the hands are not returned inside and the fetus dies, then incise them and extract the remains of the fetus, or tie the body to its hand with a cloth and extract it carefully, for it will be expelled.
When the fetus is presented feet first, then you must push it upwards, and then gently turn the fetus, and then grasp it, and then take one foot and extend it little by little.
But when it has emerged between the thighs, then you command her to strain, and make her sneeze forcefully, for it will be expelled if God wills it.
And if it is not expelled by what we have recounted, then you return the fetus little by little until you place it in its natural position, for then it will be expelled with ease.
And if it is prevented by everything we have recounted, then take mallow mucilage and dissolved gum, and pound everything well in a mortar, and then apply this to the woman's vulva, at the lowest part of her belly. And then make her bathe in lukewarm water, up to the hypochondria (the area below the ribs).
And when you see that the lower parts of her are softened, then make a fumigation of myrtle for her and apply it to her. And when she has had the fumigation for an hour, then make her sit on a chair, and then make her sneeze and hold her mouth shut, and lift her up, and press the lowest part of her belly with gentle compression, for the fetus will be expelled immediately.
Thus [grasp] the fetus laterally, holding it with one of your hands. Try to reduce [the dislocation] with your hand; but if you cannot reduce it, then raise the woman and have her walk. (This likely refers to a dislocated limb, likely a shoulder or hip, where movement might help reposition it).
And if she cannot walk, then make her lie on the bed, and shake her limbs with a vigorous shaking, and then administer emollient remedies, which I have already recommended (or recounted) as mucilages.
And if childbirth has begun, then make her sit on a stool, and then work on the reduction of [presumably a prolapsed organ or difficult presentation], and grasp the fetus according to its natural position, and make the woman sneeze and instruct her to push until it is expelled.
Thus [grasp] the fetus above the neck, spreading your hands, and its face is towards its mother. It is necessary that the midwife hold the hand of the fetus and then gently rotate it, and extract it easily.
And when it is grasped, then place on the neck of [the baby] that which we have recommended: oil and mucilages.
And then instruct her to cough gently, and when you have done this, then make her sit on a stool and instruct her to lean to her right side, and then instruct her to push; and make her sneeze with a [sneezing] potion. The prepared fetus exits on the side.
When the horror of the mother subsides in this manner, consider, and then you incise the secundine with your fingernail until it is emptied of its moisture.
And if the fetus is suspended over the face and neck, then you incise it at the umbilicus, so that it is not retained and dies.
And then push the fetus into the inner parts until you place it as needed, and tell the woman to push herself a few times, and it will be expelled easily, God willing.
The exit of twins or multiple fetuses. Know that twins are often born, and sometimes three or four are born, but this is rare and late in happening; but if it so happens, it is by nature and they may not live.
And although they are multiples, they share one afterbirth, and are separated by a membrane; distinguish them by the umbilical ligament of each one. And sometimes they are expelled as if it were a single fetus by easy natural birth, and sometimes they are expelled by difficult birth as we have recounted.
And if some of them are difficult to deliver and lead to what we have said about unnatural positions, then treat them as we have recounted.
And if the midwife is skillful and does this with ease and skill, and with patience, and is ingenious according to the position presented, she prepares the method leading to a successful outcome.
A remembrance of that which is formed in the womb from embryos and is aborted.
Sometimes one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and even ten or more are formed in the mother.  It has indeed been verified by me that one woman aborted and expelled six, and another ten, all formed, which was ascertained by the measurement of the glorious wise men (doctors).
And all this must be within the knowledge of the midwife, because it quickly resembles that, and therefore she must oppose it with what is necessary.
Chapter 76.
Of the extraction of the fetus when it is dead.
When you treat a dead fetus with what we have said in the division of medication and it has not yet been expelled, and you are forced to operate with your hand, then you must consider if the woman is of sound constitution and is not afflicted by any of the accidents which make loss of life feared for her.
Then it is necessary that the woman be placed on the bed on her side, and her head inclined downwards, and her hips raised.
And the assistant should hold her from two sides or she should be tied to the bed so that her body does not extend during the extraction of the fetus.
And then you moisten the mother's vulva with humid oils and with mucilage of mallow, fenugreek, and linseed.
And then let the midwife anoint her hand with those oils and mucilages, and then gently insert her hand into the mother, and then search with her hand for the place where the umbilical cord is attached to the fetus.
And convenient places for this: then you consider if the fetus is positioned to descend head first, and then you grasp the umbilical cord at its eyes, or neck, or mouth, or palate, or under the chin, or at its clavicle, or in the areas near the ribs, or under the hypochondria.
But if the descent is feet first, then at the heel, or in the middle of the back.
And it is necessary that you hold the umbilical cord with your right hand, and place its curvature in that space which is between the fingers of your left hand, and insert your hand gently and grasp the umbilical cord in one of those places which we have mentioned, until you reach the empty space (presumably the vagina).
And then place and apply another umbilical cord, or a third if necessary, so that there is equal traction, and there is not extension only along its straightness.  (In other words, apply multiple cords to avoid pulling only in one direction and potentially damaging the umbilical cord or fetus).
Rather, it should be moved in all directions, so that its exit is eased, just as it is done in the pulling of a tooth.
And it is necessary in this that which is between them that the extension be softened; and if any part of it is retained, then it is necessary that the midwife lubricate some of her fingers with oil and expertly insert them and loosen that which is retained. (This refers to the process of childbirth and easing the passage of the baby.)
Therefore, if the part of the fetus is expelled, then the umbilical cords should be moved to a higher position; and do this until the entire fetus is expelled.
But if one hand emerges before the other, and it is not possible to reduce it because of its constriction, then it is necessary that a cloth be wrapped around it; and then extract it until the whole is expelled, and incise it either at the joint of the hand or at the elbow. (This describes a difficult childbirth where a hand is protruding before the baby's head and needs to be addressed surgically.)
And thus you should proceed with the other hand and with both feet.
But if the head of the fetus is large, or there is constriction during its emergence, or there is accumulated water on its head, then it is necessary to insert between the fingers expectorant spittle and split the head and extract the water, or to uncover it with an instrument that is named "alundat", the form of which will come with the forms of the other instruments in the chapter which is near this one.
And similarly proceed if the fetus has a naturally large head: and then it is necessary to incise it with a scalpel, or to grasp it with the alundat as we have said; and then extract the bones with forceps.
And if the head is out but constricted below the clavicle (furcula), then it should be incised until the fluid which is in the chest is poured out.
But if it is not complicated, nor resists delivery, then you should incise the head immediately as much as is possible for you.
And if the lower abdomen is abscessed or dropsical, then it is necessary that you perforate it until the fluid within drains.
But if the fetus is presenting feet first, then its extraction is easy and its direction towards the mother's birth canal is straightforward.
But if it is constricted around the abdomen and feet, then it is necessary that you extract it with a cloth which you will have wrapped around your hand, and that you incise the abdomen and feet until that which is within them flows out.
But if the other limbs are obstructed and the head is turned, then the midwife inserts her left hand; but if the mother's birth canal is open, then she inserts her hand into the womb, and searches for the head with it, and draws it with her fingers towards the mother's birth canal, and then inserts into it one or two fingers, and pulls it out with them.
And if the mother's birth canal is constricted by a hot abscess which harms her, then it must not be disturbed; instead, it is necessary to administer a softening of the affected parts using moist, oily substances. And administer plasters; and bathe the patient in waters that soften and moisten.
And if the fetus is lying on its side, then if possible, it should be rotated: and what we have said about a live fetus should be administered.
And if that is not possible, then it should be cut into pieces, and extracted.
And it is necessary that no part of the afterbirth be left inside.
And when you have completed all your work, then administer what we have said concerning the treatment of hot abscesses that might occur in the mother.
And if bleeding occurs, then bathe in styptic waters and administer the other treatment.
And I have already seen a woman in whose womb a dead fetus was, and soon after that, she became pregnant again, and soon after that, the fetus died again. It happened to him that for a long time there was an abscess in his navel; and it swelled until it burst open, and began to discharge pus.
And I was called to his care, and I treated him for a long time, and the wound did not heal.
Then I applied to him some plasters of strong attraction, and I drew out from him a bone, and after a few days, I drew out another bone; and I was greatly astonished, since there should not be bones in the belly.
And then I considered that they were bones from the dead fetus.
Then I cleansed the wound, and extracted from him many bones, the woman being in her menses, and he lived in this manner for a long time, discharging a little pus.
And I did not consider this to be strange, but because in this there is skill and help, that the skillful physician administers with his hand for healing.
Of the forms of the instruments that are necessary to extract the fetus.
Form of incision with which the mother is opened:
This is the form of a constrictor in which the lips are held together, to which constriction there are two incisions at the two ends of two poles (or rods). However, this incision should be more subtle than a constrictor, and be made of ivory or boxwood.
And let the width of each rod be about two fingers, and the margin of each of the two be about one finger, and the length of each is a palm and a half; and in the middle space between the two rods there are two attachments of the same wood which are already fixed, of which the length is half a palm and a little more, and the width of each is about two fingers, or a little more.
And these two attachments are inserted into the mouth of the mother so that it is opened with them when you turn the two aforementioned incisions.
Another form similar to that one, but more subtle and lighter:
Let it be made of ivory or boxwood, similar in appearance to forceps. However, at its extremity there are two attachments like those you see, and the length of these attachments is about a palm, and the width of each is two fingers.
And when you want to open the mother with these, then you make the woman lie on the bed with her legs hanging down, open what is between her thighs. Then open your hand with the instrument, just as you do with scissors, according to the amount you want to widen the opening of the mother, until the woman does what you want.
The form of vertigo which the ancients described:
The form of the impellent with which the fetus is expelled:
The form of the obstruction by which the large head is held back.
And it resembles forceps which have teeth at the end, like tongs, and sometimes it is made long like forceps in this shape, like tongs, which have teeth like saw teeth with which it is incised and held back. The form of a slight obstruction:
The form of a hook having a spine/point:
The form of a hook having two spines/points:
The form of a spatula having two ends with which the head is severed.
The form of two broad spatulas.
All those instruments are exercised, and when the types of those are more multiplied and prepared by the artisans, then it is easier in its operation and more valued by men for its quantity.
And do not neglect those instruments, whatever they may be, which you have prepared, for the necessity of them is not excusable.
Of the extraction of the afterbirth.
When the afterbirth is retained after childbirth, then you should command the patient to hold her breath, and then make her sneeze forcefully, and press your hand over her mouth and nostrils, and if by this it is expelled, it is good.
And if not, then you take a pot and pierce a hole in the lid and place herbs in it, opening the mother's mouth, such as rue, and rue, and anise, and chamomile, and dried Arabic gum, and cassia lignea, and centaury. All these herbs, or some of them, should be submerged in water in the pot, and place that over the fire.
And then place a reed tube in the mother's mouth, and hold it there until the vapor reaches the mother's womb.
And then make her sneeze as we have said, and the afterbirth will be expelled quickly.
But if this treatment remains ineffective and it is not expelled, then you instruct the midwife to submerge her left hand in sesame oil or mallow poultice, and then insert it into the vagina and search for the afterbirth with it; and when it is found, then take it and extract it little by little. But if it is attached to the uterus of the mother, then she should insert her hand as we have recounted, and when she has found the afterbirth, extract it little by little as instructed, so that the mother does not collapse from the violent traction. Furthermore, it is necessary that it be moved to the right and left sides easily.
And if the mouth of the mother (cervix) is constricted, we have already recounted the treatment with sneezing and with the herbal oil medication.
But if it is not expelled by all the means we have recounted, then be careful not to tire yourself in repeated attempts at extraction; however, what has come out of her at the mouth of the mother should be tied to the woman's thigh, and then cauterize it with ointment and tetrapharmacon; for this will cause it to rot in a few days and it will dissolve and be expelled.
But when it putrefies, a bad odor rises from it to the head and stomach, and this harms the patient; and then it is necessary that appropriate fumigations be administered.
But some of the Ancients already used fumigation with henbane and dried figs.
Method of instrumentation with which a woman is fumigated for the retention of menses and the afterbirth:
It should be made of glass or brass.
And the thin end should be placed in the vagina and the wide end over the fire, and the fumigant should be placed on the embers of the fire.
And keep it there until that fumigant is consumed and repeat with another.
Concerning the treatment of an imperforate anus in a child.
Many children are born and their anuses are not perforated, which are very narrow and obstructed. Then it is necessary for the midwife to perforate that narrow passage with her finger; and if not, perforate it with a sharp instrument, and be careful not to touch the muscle.
Then place on it wool soaked in wine and oil; and then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
But if you fear that it is obstructed, then place a cannula in the opening for several days, and remove it when the child wishes to defecate.
And sometimes anal obstruction occurs due to the healing of a wound or abscess; then it is necessary that that consolidation be incised, and then it should be treated with what we have said about the treatment and the lead [presumably referring to lead-based ointments].
Concerning the treatment of fistulas that develop below [presumably, below the surface or in a lower area of the body].
Fistulas that develop in the lowest part are knotty and thick, which develop near the anus externally or in the space between the buttocks.
And it is one fistula or several.
And since that knot is ancient and discharges watery white moisture or subtle pus, and sometimes some of these fistulas are penetrating.
And those penetrating ones are known because of what comes out of them through discharge and flatulence; and sometimes the patient experiences discharge, and worms easily come out of them.
And some of these fistulas sometimes penetrate into the space [between the buttocks] reaching the bladder, and reaching the meatus of the penis; and some penetrate into the joint of the thigh and into the buttock.
And what distinguishes a fistula penetrating into the anus from one that is not penetrating is that you put your finger inside the anus, and insert a thin probe of brass or iron into the fistula when there is no tortuosity.
But if there is tortuosity in it, then insert into it a thin probe of lead or horsehair until you feel the probe or hair on your finger.
And if you do not feel it at all, nor does any matter of discharge, worms, or flatulence proceed from the opening, as we have said, then know that it is non-penetrating, and then attend to its treatment.
And when the fistula penetrates into the bladder or into the meatus of the penis, then its indication is the diversion of urine from it and its prohibition, so that the place may be consolidated with medicine.
But if it penetrates into the joint of the thigh or into the bone and causes pain in the surrounding area, then its sign is that the probe enters there if there is no tortuosity in the bone, and pain arises in the surrounding area; and that there is always putrefaction from it; and that no medication is effective, nor is it consolidated with ointment.
And in all those penetrating fistulas there is no complete cure, and the treatment of these is the labor and vanity of foolish physicians upon which they are fixed.
But in that which is not penetrating and not old, healing with iron is hoped for, according to what I shall recount to you, and this I have already proven.
And it is that the patient lies between your hands on his back and raises his legs upwards, his thighs inclined towards his belly, and then introduce a lead or bronze probe, if there is tortuosity in the fistula, until you know the place where the probe enters.
And if the patient feels it around the anus, then it is necessary that you insert your finger inside the anus.
And if you feel with your finger the probe already discovered by itself penetrating, besides what you feel between your finger and that abscess or flesh, then you know certainly that it is penetrating; and then do not work on that, for there is no healing in that, as we have said.
However, some say that it is healed in some men late.
And of the medication by which help is hoped for him, it is that you ignite a thin cautery according to the width of the fistula, as has been described previously, and introduce that ignited cautery into the fistula until it reaches around the anus; and then repeat that two or three times until you know that all those fistulated, fleshy growths resembling a bird's feather quill are cauterized.
And then treat that with poultices wrapped in linen until all those cauterized tissues are shed, and then treat that with medicines that generate and consolidate the flesh, and if it is healed, good; and if not, then it is not healed at any time by another cure.
And if the probe enters, and does not penetrate beyond your finger which is in the anus, and between that and the probe there is a thick layer of flesh or abscess, and you see the fistula in that which is the surface of the gut, then cut the gut at the beginning of the fistula, and you will cut with the probe, and let it be in the fistula until the incision reaches the place where the tip of the probe arrives, and by the probe it is freed and expelled.
And then cleanse those fistulated tissues which resemble a bird's feather quill, and let no part of them remain.
But if a flow of blood appears between you and your operation when you incise those tissues, then the best and lightest instrument is to cauterize with fire or with a sharp medicine, because cauterization with fire achieves two good things: that is, the cauterization of those affected tissues, and the stanching of blood and drying of the humors.
And then treat it with poultices wrapped in linen or crushed flax until the place sheds pus, and then treat the wound with ointments that generate and consolidate firm flesh.
And these are medicines in which there is stypticity and drying; when then it is restored it is healed and we do not fear recurrence.
But if the fistula penetrates to the rectum and is elongated from the surface of the body, then insert your finger into the rectum and explore with it.
And so if you feel the fistula and between you and it there is a membrane of fat or flesh, and it is suitable for penetration, then there is no operation there, but only a path of trust and hope.
Which cause is to be administered in three ways: either cauterize it as we have said; or dry it until you reach its cavity so that it is possible for you to insert the poultices and the appropriate cure; and do not proceed much with incision lest you cut the muscle containing the rectum, and that you cause harm to the patient thus without his will; and then treat it with what we have said because it will be cured very quickly; or elongate that membrane and clean it after drying it near the rectum, as we have said, with a probe or with another instrument of sharp extremity, and then clean those fistulous tissues which are in the section where you can with cauterization; and then strive to make the restoration of the whole wound with incision, and if the orifice above is not consolidated, and the fistula remains open in the part of the rectum, it will be easier for the patient. And sometimes the fistula ends in this way: when you insert the probe into the fistula, and it is in the side of the rectum around the surface of the body with the curvature and in the margin of the rectum, then take a probe with a perforated tip, which is like a needle for preparing hides in this form:
and insert it into that wound wrapped in five threads or around them; and then insert a probe with thread into the fistula until you reach its cavity.
But if it is penetrating into the margin of the rectum inwards, then you extract the thread from that hole so that you insert your finger into the rectum; and extract the end of the thread and join the two ends together, and tighten each one, and leave it for a day or two, and when you incise the thread into the flesh, tighten it well until those tissues are incised which are between the two ends of the thread and they fall away.
And then treat the wound until it is consolidated and healed.
But if the opening of the fistula is not penetrating, then make it penetrate, in whatever way is prepared for you, except that it is very close to the peritoneum, for it is not for you to do this lest you incise the rectum; and then treat it until it is healed.
The form of the pointed probe with which the fistula is probed: its curvature is very sharp and the other part is not-sharp, so that you do not incise what is unnecessary, as sometimes happens.
Of the suturing of hemorrhoids from which blood flows during their incision.
Hemorrhoids are of two types, for either they are between the buttocks similar to  charcoals, or they are like bunches of grapes. And of these there are small and large ones, and blood constantly flows from them, and there is one, and there are many, and they are outside the anus, and at its extremities.
However, those that are outside the anus are, according to the months, of little humidity, from which flows a citrine water or a little blood with continuous flow, and it is according to the color of the body.
And the treatment of that which is inside the anus is that you order the patient to sit and to strain until the anus opens and the hemorrhoids appear to you. Then you carefully lift and hold them with hooks or with your fingernail, and then incise them at their roots.
But if the hooks do not hold them because of their humidity and softness, then grasp them with a rough cloth or with cotton or with a pledget of wool, and extract them with your fingers, and then incise them and sprinkle on them some hot powders near the incision, so that they act on them in place of a cautery; or cauterize them as is described in the chapter on cauterization. And then treat them with the other treatments until they are healed.
And if the anus does not obey (i.e., doesn't open for) expulsion, then use a small, slightly irritating clyster on the patient, and let it be washed with that water which is in the anus and which will slightly facilitate expulsion when the patient strains.
But if the hemorrhoids are outside the anus, then their cause is slight, and you should grasp them with your fingernail, or grasp them with a hook, and incise them, and then treat them with what we have said until they are healed.
And that which you have incised, you must suture as follows: take waxed thread and insert it into a needle and then draw the hemorrhoids upwards, and pass the needle through the base on the other side, and wrap the two ends of the thread around the lower part of the needle, and this should be laterally; and firmly tighten the hemorrhoid with a strong suture, and then knot the thread and remove the needle.
And do this to all of them, except leave one unclosed, so that the excess blood may flow from it.
And then place on the anus a cloth soaked in rose oil or cerate; and place this on the anus and instruct the patient to rest. And then leave it until it falls off; and when it has fallen off, treat it with ointments or other remedies until it is healed.
And since they are old and that medicine is not effective, then you must scrape them with the point of a spatula or with your fingernail until they are moistened and the crust above is removed, which prevents their consolidation; and then treat them until they are consolidated.
Then remove them with a more forceful scraping than the first, until they bleed much and are excoriated; and then treat them until they are healed.
Know that a felon, that is, a whitlow, is nothing but a round sore, according to the color of the body, similar to the head of a nail, and it is found throughout the body, but especially in the parts below the feet and hands, and because of these sores the pain comes.
And then it is necessary that what is in the circumference of the whitlow be incised, and held with forceps or an instrument, and eradicated from its root; and then treat it.
And if you wish, cauterize it according to what is prescribed in its chapter.
Moreover, a wart is a small, rough, fistulated, round eminence on the surface of the body, and often appears on the hands of children.
And its cure is that you extend and incise it, or that you bind it tightly with thread or with a hair so that it falls off. And if you wish, cauterize it, as we have said, with fire or with a sharp medicine (caustic substance).
Moreover, a mole is a small, hairy or fistulated, rough eminence on the surface of the body, often appearing in the face; and when friction encounters it, a sensation similar to an ant bite is felt, and it is found all over the body.
And its cure is that you take a cannula of goose quill or vulture quill, and let it be strong, and place it over the mole so that the circle of the cannula contains its parts; and then rotate your hand with the cannula so that you incise what is in the circumference of the mole, and place it in the depth of the flesh, and eradicate the mole from its root.
And if you wish, do this with a brass or iron cannula, according to this method:
Let the upper part of the cannula be drawn out to a thinness, blunt (that is, not perforated), wrapped so that the application of it may be softened and its rotation facilitated.
And if you wish, cauterize the mole as previously described in the cauterization of athel in the chapter on cautery.
Concerning the instruments that are used to give a clyster.
Sometimes a clyster is made of silver, or tin, or cast or hammered brass; and sometimes it is made of these instruments, small and large, according to those to whom they are administered, for that which is administered in the treatment of small children should be small; and for those whose rectums are fragile or painful, the clysters for them should be small.
The form of a large and a small clyster:
The head of its cannula, to which the bag is tied, should be wide in this manner; and there should be a distinction where the bag is tied, as sometimes happens.
And the lower extremity, which is inserted into the rectum, should be blunt (that is, not open) but rounded, tapering to a point; and on one side of it there should be two holes, and on the other side one hole, and the size of the hole should be according to the thickness of the rays and a little larger.
And let the bag, in which the medicines are placed, be of animal bladder or sheepskin, and its length be a palm [a hand's breadth].
And let it be perforated with many holes, so that it is woven; and let the space between the holes be the thickness of a finger.
Then insert into those holes strong, raw flax thread, about ten threads or so; and attach the bag with that; and when the bag is placed in position, tie it tightly at the head of the clyster with two distinct ligatures using a strong constriction, and then cauterize each hole with that. The method of cauterizing with that is that you fill the bag with the medicine, heated according to the patient's tolerance; and be careful that it is neither too hot nor too cold.
Then let the patient lie supine on his back, and raise his legs and place a cushion underneath him on which are placed cloths or a sheet; and then lubricate the end of the clyster with oil, or egg white, or fenugreek mucilage, or the like; and then insert it into the rectum easily, and then let the attendant take the bag and squeeze it with both hands and vigorously until all that is in the clyster is evacuated into the bowel; and then remove the clyster and the patient lowers his legs.
And if the medicine forces him to defecate, hold it as long as possible; and if he sleeps with it all night, it is more beneficial.
But if you use this clyster in cases of diarrhea and his defecation is frequent, then repeat the clyster until he is healed.
And if there are hemorrhoids or painful abscesses in the rectum, then the clyster should be very fine and soft, of the kind used to administer clysters to infants.
Concerning the treatment of wounds.
I have already said in the section on wound treatment what was appropriate for the book, and I say thus the treatment of these with hand and with medicines according to the circumstances.
Therefore I say that wounds are diversified according to what caused the wounds and according to the location where the wounds occurred.
And the causes by which wounds are often made are such as a fall from a height, or an incision from a sword or knife, or a blow with a lance, or with a stick, or with an arrow, or similar to those from many causes.
But the wounds that are in the parts of the body are such as a wound which falls upon the head, or the neck, or the feet, or the belly, or the thigh, and similar to those of the other limbs.
And I am recounting the treatment of some wounds so that you may apply that reasoning and rule to other wounds.
And I will begin with simple head wounds, for the discussion of compound wounds will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
Therefore I say that when a simple wound occurs on the head and there is no fracture, then consider: if it is from a fall from a height or similar, and only the scalp is cut and it is a large wound and you fear the occurrence of a hot abscess in that patient, then you should immediately bleed him from the cephalic vein, and do not delay this; and extract blood from him according to his strength unless some cause prohibits bloodletting, especially if the blood that has come from the wound is little.
And let the bloodletting be on the opposite side from the wounded part; and guard the patient from repletion and from wine and from heavy foods.
But if some cause prohibits bloodletting, then let his diet be reduced and he should not approach meat or wine.
And place on the wound, if a hot abscess occurs in him, a pledget soaked in plain rose oil or in wine in which a styptic has been mixed.
But if there is certainty of a hot abscess, then place on the wound, if it is recent, its own blood and the air has not altered that powder which I will soon describe briefly.
And if the air has already altered it, then apply some ointment until it is healed.
But if the wound is large or is from a sword cut or similar, and its lips are not approximated by themselves, then approximate those with sutures according to what I shall relate concerning the suturing of them.
But if the wound is already laid bare to the bone and hangs, and there is no retention of it but only a small suspension, then incise that and then cure the wound with medicines and restore the flesh properly in place of what is missing, and order the patient to be fed on foods in which there is thickness: heads and leg quarters of cooked fowl and similar, until it is repaired.
And if you find putrefaction in the missing part and it does not adhere to the bone, then you incise all that which is rotten and remove it, and then cure that.
But if in these wounds there is an artery or vein from which a flow of blood can occur, and it is not stopped by medicines, then you investigate the artery, and if you find it uncut, then you incise it with a spatula, or tie it; and if necessity compels you that what we have said does not suffice, then you cauterize until the bleeding is stopped.
And if these wounds are simple and small, then their cause is light; therefore you dust upon them this powder, for it consolidates them before the air alters them.
And the manner of the powder is this: take olive oil one part, dragon's blood two parts, unslaked lime three parts; let all be well crushed and sifted, and with it let the wound be filled, and let it be bound with a good bandage until it adheres well to it, and is coagulated with the blood.
And then bind it above with powders and leave it, and do not unbind it while it is thus, that it is not festered, for the medicine is not eradicated from it until it is healed.
And sometimes it does this alone with heat, when you do not have oil and dragon's blood at hand.
And do this same operation on large wounds when it is necessary that it be placed on them and they are stitched, and they are fresh wounds with their blood, which the air has not altered.
And if the air has altered them, and especially when it is summer time, then this powder is not intended for application, but rather treat them with what we have said, in such a way that you apply some digestive ointments to them, or that you apply powders of barley flour with water and honey until they produce pus; and then treat them with the other cure until they are healed.
But if a fracture in a bone occurs with the wound, and it is small, then you extract it with tweezers.
And I will describe the treatment of head fractures in what follows.
Of the wounds of the neck.
But if the wound occurs in the neck, then there is no difference in medication between it and a simple wound of the head.
But if the nerves of the neck or an artery are incised, then if it is a nerve, there is nothing to do but to avoid treating it with something that causes strong astringency, such as vitriol and similar substances, because they are harmful to the nerves and constrict them. And do not apply anything cold to the wound, because the substance of the nerves is cold and is continuous with the brain, which is the highest of all the members.
And if it is cured with light medicines, such as being washed with fresh water, sometimes infused with rose oil or unperfumed oil, and  ointments when washed with fresh water and other healing herbs in this manner, and moist ointments.
But if the wound is large, then administer sutures, or approximate its edges, and then treat it with powders until it is healed.
But if the wound is deep or there is pus in the lowest part of it, then perforate it in the most depressed place.
But if an artery has been incised in the wound and bleeding ensues, then ligate or cauterize it, or tie it off if necessity demands it.
But if the vertebrae of the neck have been incised, or any part, and the veins of the neck have been saved, then you should approximate the edges of the wound with sutures over the cervical spine and do not touch it; first level it and restore it to its natural form, and then bind it with a suitable dressing, and leave it for some days; and then treat it with ointments which have styptic and healing properties until it is healed.
But if the wound has caused damage to the bone, then scrape it, and if there are bone fragments in it, extract all those that you can; and what you are unable to remove, leave it until the wound suppurates, and it is separated and the injury is relieved.
And if the wound is recent, then sprinkle upon it the powder which has been recommended to you. But if a fistula has formed in the wound, then treat it with that which will be mentioned in its appropriate chapter.
If it is a wound from a lance or knife, and you see its depth, then further consider if there is a whistling sound from the wound when the patient breathes; then know that the wound is mortal.
And if it is not deep and the wound is fresh with its blood, then in the first hour you apply powder, and do not bind it tightly so that the blood is not retained in its depth and returns to the heart to kill the patient, but apply attractive ointment, and unbind it twice a day.
And if ointment is not at hand, then you place old linen on the opening of the wound so that it draws out the humidity; and make the patient sleep on the wound so that what is contained within flows out.
But if three days or more have passed since the wound and it has not caused the patient spasms, tremors, or a weak or constricted heart, and you see the other good dispositions of the patient, then know that the wound is safe; and then treat it with cauterization and other treatments until it is healed.
But if its healing is delayed, and it remains open for a long time, then know that a fistula has formed; therefore treat it according to its chapter.
And if the wound is from an incision of a sword or knife, and is simple on the surface of the foot or back, then treat it as previously described for sutures, if it is large, or with powder, if it is small.
But if it has caused damage to the bone, and pieces have been broken off, then you turn the wound and attempt to extract those pieces, if they are separated. But if they are not separated, then leave them until the wound suppurates, so that their extraction is easier.
And for other accidental wounds in other limbs, the treatment is the same as what we have said.
Of wounds to the abdomen.
The illness which occurs in the abdomen is either great, small, or moderate.
And a small rupture is made difficult in another way, and it happens that their reduction is more difficult, if you do not take care of replacing them immediately, because it opens and thickens, thus making their replacement difficult.
Therefore, the best [type of] rupture is moderate, because in that case the reduction of the intestine is not difficult, as it is in the two previously mentioned types.
And know that the suturing of the abdomen is done in four ways, but two sutures are common and are suitable for suturing other wounds of the body.
And two other sutures specific to the abdomen are also used for other wounds, but they are more appropriate for suturing the abdomen.
And I recount to you each one with explanation and clarification.
Therefore, I say that when the wound is small and some part of the intestine has emerged through it, and it is difficult to reduce it, then this is due to one of two reasons: either because of the small size of the rupture as we have said, or because the intestine has become inflamed due to the coldness of the air.
And therefore, when this is so, then you must warm it in such a way that you submerge a sponge or cloth moistened in lukewarm water alone, or boiled in water with squill, cyperus, and spikenard, and bathe the intestine with it until the inflammation is resolved.
And sometimes it is done with a liquid that has astringent properties, and it is better than water alone in resolving the inflammation.
And so, when you see the inflammation resolved, then you moisten the intestine with water in which mallow and marshmallow have been boiled, for by this the reduction of it is facilitated with little effort.
But if the reduction is hindered despite this treatment, then slightly enlarge the rupture with an instrument with which hemorrhoids are incised.
And the first treatment is better, when it is appropriate that there is no incision, and there is no need to dry it because of necessity and weakening.
Regarding the instrument, this is its form:
One part of it is sharply curved, and the other part is not sharp; the end is thin, but not as thin as a spatula, rather a little blunt.
And thus, when the wound is enlarged and the intestine is outside, then its reduction should follow its natural form, to its proper place, if possible, for that is better.
But when the rupture is large and is in the lower part of the belly, then you should make the patient lie on their back, and raise their legs higher than their head; and if it is in the upper part of the belly, then you should raise their head and feet higher than the lower parts.
Similarly, if the rupture is in one of the two sides of the belly, then always direct your attention and consideration to ensuring that the side where the wound is located is higher than the other.
And thus you should administer this in large wounds and in medium-sized wounds.
And in small wounds, apply what you have prepared, and then have the assistant, between your pitying hands, hold the rupture entirely with their hand and adjust its lips, and then discover from that to that what suture or other cause is appropriate.
And this is the common method of suturing: first, take the needle, or several needles according to the size of the wound; then leave the needle at the edge of the disruption at the ring finger, and pull the needle through, but do not insert the thread into both ends of the wound, only at two ends of the part of the wound's edge beneath the thread, until you make it penetrate that part; then you have joined the two ends of the thread and two ends of the wound edges, and thus you have made four points.
Then tighten with a double thread around the needle, sometimes from two sides at once, and then join the two edges of the wound with a neat joining; then leave the width of a finger and place another needle in that gap, and tie that with thread just as you did with the first needle; and continue doing this with needles as necessary until you have completed the entire closing of the wound.
And let the needles be of moderate thickness, neither too thick nor too thin, for thin needles easily cut the flesh; and thick ones are difficult to insert into the wound, therefore they should be of moderate thickness.
And the needle should not be inserted too deeply into both ends of the wound, lest the flesh be unduly cut and the wound open before it heals.
And the sutures should not be too long, lest the wound be hindered from healing.
Then, cut off the ends of the needles so that they do not harm the patient during their sleep; and you shall place over the suture finely powdered substances, which will hold the ends of the needles; and leave those in place until you know that the wound is healed.
And this type of suture with needles is most convenient for small wounds, because one or two needles, or thereabouts, are sufficient for their suturing.
But the second suture is common: and it is that you stitch the four extremities of the wound and two ends of the lip, at once, with a needle around which is wound thread of suitable fineness and thickness.
Then, when with the needle you have penetrated these four extremities, return the needle to the same side from which you began, so that the drawn thread may fall from the highest part to the wound, so that the suture may be like a cloth suture, with which cloths are fastened.
And place between each suture the width of the little finger.
And this suture is known to men.
And with such a suture I sewed up the wound which had happened to a man in his belly, which had been wounded with a knife, and the disruption of the wound was more than a palm, and about two palms of intestine had come out from the middle of the wound, and the disruption was in the middle of the member; and then I reduced it after the intestine had been outside the wound for 24 hours.
And the wound was consolidated in the space of fifteen days or thereabouts, and I cured him and he is healed; and afterwards he lived for many years, and is preserved in his faculties.
And the other physicians had judged that he would not be healed; and it was by a miracle that he was, for I did not cure him with ointment, for it was in a place where ointment was not found nor any medicine, but I placed old linen on the wound twice a day and washed it frequently with honey water until it was healed.
But I will describe two kinds of sutures proper, according to the account of Galen. (Note:  "Paraula" is likely a misspelling or variant of "Galen".)
And it is that you begin with the suture of the quilled suture (or "suture of the quill"), and insert the needle from the outside to the inside.
And so, as the needle penetrates the quill (or "the quilled suture") and that same laceration, according to its width and length of the whole body, leave the end of the thread into which you have inserted the needle; and make the needle penetrate the other end from the inside to the outside at the other extremity of the wound.
And when you have made that penetration, then you make it penetrate again in that same extremity of the wound from the outside to the inside; and leave the end of the thread that is on this side, and make the needle penetrate the other extremity from the inside to the outside.
And make the penetration with that [needle] with which you make that penetration in the thread at the extremity of the wound which is on his side until all of it penetrates.
And then begin on this same side and sew that [wound] with the end of the thread on the other side, and extract the needle from the quill (or quilled suture) which you penetrated, and then return it into that quill and sew the end of the thread that is on the other side with this extremity of the wound; and extract it from the quill which is on his side.
And do this once and again, and do this once and then again until you sew everything that is outside according to that example.
And the sum of this manner of suture is that you sew with a suture of little skins, with which you sew skins, in such a way that you sew the thread one time from the part of the extremity of the quill, and that you leave it another time until you have finished it.
But the second proper kind of suture, which is called *Gualia* (or similar sounding name) and this is spoken of by him and by him recounted, is that you sew it according to the similarity with which certain physicians sew it, so that you match every part to its corresponding part conveniently by nature; and apply the extremity of one side and the extremity of the wound to the other extremity, and this is done as I have recounted to you.
So that you place the needle in the extremity of the wound near you on the outside part, and make it penetrate to the inside part in that sole, and leave the two ends of the thread; and then turn the needle and make it penetrate from outside to inside through the two ends of the thread.
And then turn each one, and make each one penetrate from the inside part to the outside part in two other extremities of the wound that are on the opposite side.
And this manner of suture is better than the common light suture, and it is the suture of which I previously made mention.
This is the account of Gualia (or similar sounding name).
And more they told me, the suture of the belly is rectified with two needles, so that you introduce into these, each one, a thread, and begin with the needle introduction from what is near you, and make it penetrate to the other side according to the suture of those who sew up hearts equally.
And know that when the disruption is in the middle of the belly, then its suture is more difficult than in other places of the belly.
But the judgment of the medication of a plague is the judgment of other plagues.
The reason is that when you treat the fresh wound with its blood before the air alters it, and you return the intestine and sew it and dress it properly, then place an incarnative powder upon it.
And if the air has already altered the wound, then apply some ointments which are present to you until they form a hard scab and the threads fall out, and are consolidated;  and then treat it as the healing of other wounds until it is healed.
But if you do not have the medicines present, then immediately apply, as soon as it begins to discharge pus, old linen, and change it twice a day, as you have been taught, until it is healed, for you will not need other medication in many situations when the wounds are simple.
But if you fear that the wound will spread to the principal members, then it is necessary that you submerge lamb's wool in oil of good quality, or in rose oil, and place it in the area around the armpits and under the arms.
And if you feel pain or putrefaction in his intestines, for many times this happens, then cauterize it with lukewarm black styptic wine, especially if the putrefaction has reached the intestine and an opening has been made penetrating into its cavity.
And know that that which is in the large intestine is of easier healing than that which is in the small intestines.
And it is difficult to heal because the intestine which is called "jejunum" does not receive healing from a wound which falls upon it at all; and this is because of the great multitude of veins that are in it and because of their magnitude, and because of the subtlety of its body, and because of its proximity to the nature of the nerves.
But if what proceeds from the wound is the web (likely referring to a membrane or tissue), and you find it recently produced, reduce it according to your skill with which you reduce the intestines similarly.
But if it has passed into the space and has already become green or black, then bind it with a bandage over the place that is blackened, so that a flow of blood may come, for in the web are veins and arteries.
And then incise that which is beyond that ligament, and place the two ends of the bandage hanging down from the part below the wound outside, so that the traction on it towards the falling of the web and emission of the arm of the wound may be relieved for you.
A reminder of wounds when they happen in the intestine.
When a disruption occurs in the intestine and it is small, then it is possible that it may be restored in some men, because of this, for I saw one who had been wounded in his belly with a lance blow and the wound was on the right side of the stomach, and the wound was old and formed a fistula, and from it came gas and flatulence.
Then I pursued his cure, although I was not confident in his healing, but I continued to treat it until it was healed and the place was consolidated.
And I, after seeing the place consolidated, feared for the patient that some accident might befall him in his belly; and no harm befell him from such an accident, and he recovered his usual strength through eating and drinking, and subsequently he bathed and exercised himself in his usual way.
And some experienced men say that when a wound occurs in the intestine, and it is small, then it should be tied in this manner: that you take ants with large heads; and then adjust the two lips of the wound and place one of those ants, with its mouth open, over the two lips of the wound; then, when it bites and clenches its mouth, cut off its head, because it will adhere and not dissolve.
And then place another ant next to the first, and do not cease to do this with ants, one next to another, according to the size of the entire wound.
And then reduce it and sew the wound; and let those attached heads remain in the intestine until the intestine is healed; and it will not cause any harm to the patient.
And it is also possible that the intestine be tied with fine thread which is made from the gut of an animal, since it is easier to use in a needle; and it is that you take the end of these gut threads, and it should be very clean, and then tie its end with the thread itself, wrapped around it, and then insert that threaded needle and sew the intestine with it, and reduce it in the disruption.
And this method of suturing with ants is only a matter of trust and hope.
But if the wound is large and wide, especially if it is in one of the small intestines, because then it is only a reduction, and not a complete healing of it.
On the treatment of fistulas and fistulae.
Know that every wound and abscess, when it ages and becomes old, and becomes an ulcer, and is not consolidated and discharges pus constantly and is not excised, then, in whatever member it may be, is universally called a fistula, and we call it azukem.
And a fistula, in truth, is a hardened, white knot, which is painless and which has a concavity like the concavity of a bird's claw; and therefore it is called a knotted ulcer, that is, a claw.
And in some men it is moist, which discharges pus; and very quickly the moisture is exuded in a few hours. And sometimes this moisture is thick, and sometimes it is thin, and sometimes it is coarse, and sometimes it is subtle.
I have already shown all those causes, and their signs, and their treatment with medicines, in the division (of the text).
And it is necessary that I make you know the treatment of fistula, which is done by means of an operation with the hand.
And know that fistulas occur in all the limbs of the body; for there are fistulas that reach the large veins and arteries, or the nerves, or the diaphragm, or the intestine, or the bladder, or one of the ribs, or one of the vertebrae of the back, or one of the joints composed by composition, such as those of the hand and foot; and those that harm the proximity of the principal member and similar things.
Therefore, that one of these fistulas which is according to this manner is among the illnesses of difficult healing, and does not receive a cure, and occupation with it is labor and ignorance.
And if it is one of the fistulas whose depth does not reach those places that I have mentioned, and you hope and trust in its cure, and you want to arrive at knowledge of it, then take a probe of bronze or iron, and if the fistula goes in a straight line, and search for it with it.
But if the fistula is tortuous, then investigate it with a slender lead probe, because lead, with the lightness of its body, is easily bent along the tortuosity.
And if the fistula has very horrific pus, it is not possible for you to discern it with a probe.
Then, inject a cleansing solution through its orifices, because the liquid by which you inject it goes through the other orifices and cleanses them.
And then inquire carefully, in whatever way it is possible for you to know if there are bones or nerves here, and if the depth of the fistula is distant or near, or if it is a fistula which has many orifices, and be diligent in all this with the utmost of your strength, with your questioning with which you question the patient, and the discovery of the pain through your compression with your hand over the area, and similar signs and accidental causes of the abscess.
And when you have considered all those factors with true judgment, then proceed to treatment with confidence: that is, you should consider then if it is a fistula that is near the surface or in a healthy place, far from a joint, or from a nerve, or from an artery, or from a vein, or from any of the places which I have described to you.
Then you dry the fistula as was said before in the description of it, and remove what is in that suppuration and of corrupted flesh, and what has grown in the orifice of flesh, or of cartilage, and similar things, and cure it until it is healed.
But if the fistula is of great depth, and is straight, then it is necessary that you incise it as deeply as is possible for you, and then cleanse it of all its corrupt flesh; and then apply heated poultices wrapped in sharp medicines, and introduce them into the depth of the fistula, which you have grasped with an instrument.
And do this several times until the sharp medicine corrodes all that is rotten in the depth of the fistula from the corruption.
And then restore it with ointments which generate healthy flesh until it is healed.
But if it is not healed by this, then you cauterize it as we have recounted.
But if the cause of the fistula is bone and you are certain of this, then you must investigate it and dry it as we have recounted, if you do not prohibit any cause involving a vein, nerve, or principal member as we have said.
But if the bone is exposed to you and there is some corruption and blackness in it, then you scrape it until all the corruption is removed; and then treat it with something that will cause it to grow new flesh until it is healed.
And if it is not healed and discharges pus as it did before, then know that you have not achieved the total eradication of the corruption; and then uncover it again and carefully perform the scraping and cleansing with all your strength, and then restore it.
And so if it is healed, good; but if not, then know that the corruption is in the deep recesses of the body, which has not been reached, and then for you in that case there is nothing to do but leave it.
And if the corrupted bone is small, or it is possible for you to pull it out, then pull it out with fine forceps which are suitable for this.
And if there are many pieces of bone, then carefully remove all of them, and with your strength leave none of them behind.
But if some matter of the humors hinders you, and there is no fear or mistake in their incision, then incise those ligaments or flesh if they are there, and free the bones.
But if you are not prepared to remove the bones at this time, then apply something to the wound that will cause the wound to suppurate, and leave it until it reaches the bone through the flesh and ligaments, and keep the wound from healing, and keep the incision you made during your operation constricted.
Furthermore, if you fear, place on it a cloth soaked in crushed rue with oil, or a cloth soaked in Egyptian ointment, or in any of the green ointments, for when those ligaments fester, and the bones are separated from them, their removal and extraction are facilitated.
But if it is a large bone, such as a bone of the leg or thigh or similar, and only its surface is corrupted, then scrape it with a rasp only on the surface until the blackness and corruption are removed, and then restore the wound.
But if the corrupted part is large, and the corruption has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to close that and completely incise to the place where the corruption has reached, and then treat it until it is healed.
And I recount to you what happened to a man in his thigh, so that you may use this as an example and aid in your operation.
There was a young man, around thirty years of age, who suffered pain in his thigh.  The internal parts were inflamed with matter inside the body until the matter reached the thigh, and it was the matter of an abscess with a large abscess, and there was no external cause for it.
And then time passed with that [condition] due to the error of the physicians until the abscess was opened, and much matter flowed from it.  And its treatment was delayed until the leg was fistulated, and many orifices formed in it which all discharged pus and the humors of the body.
And then many physicians treated him for about two years, and there was no improvement in his condition due to a lack of skill in the art, until I was called.
And I saw his leg and the matter running from those orifices in great quantity; and the body of that man was completely weakened, and his color was jaundiced.
And then I inserted a probe into one of those orifices and it reached the bone.
And then I promptly examined all the orifices and found them to lead from all parts of the leg.
And then I carefully incised one of those orifices until I exposed a part of the bone, and found it corrupted, and it was already rough, corrupted, and blackened; and a part of the leg was corrupted to where it had penetrated to the marrow.
And then I sawed away that which was exposed to me and prepared of the exposed bone.
And I thought that in the bone there was nothing but that corruption which I cut away and sawed, and I had already eradicated it.
And then I applied the restoration of the wound with consolidative medicine for a long time, and it is not healed.
And then I again investigated and uncovered the bone a second time, on top of the first uncovering, and I found continuing corruption in the bone.
And I sawed away what appeared to me to be that corruption, and then I attempted to perform its cure and restoration, and it is not restored.
And then I uncovered it again and did not cease to incise the bone little by little, in a piecemeal fashion, and attempted its restoration, and it was not restored until I had incised about a palm's breadth of it, and I extracted that with its marrow, and then I restored that with medicines, and it is lightly consolidated and healed.
And it is not necessary to iterate the operation and sectioning of it except for the disposition of its weakness and for the smallness of its tolerance and its fear of death, because it happened to him at all hours from superfluity of evacuation a bad syncope.
And therefore it is healed by complete healing, and nothing is in place of the hard bone flesh; and its disposition in its body is made good and its strength has returned; and it is preserved in its dispositions and did not cause it contrariety in walking nor harm in any way.
But if it is a prominent bone in the place of the body already extracted, then you must saw it in this manner:  you must take a ligature and bind that to the extremity of that prominent bone, and command someone to extend it upward; and place that ligature of thicker wool than the first ligature; and then tie that over the flesh that is below the bone, and extend its extremity so that you draw the flesh to the parts below, and you uncover the flesh over the place which you wish to saw so that the saw does not injure the flesh.
And place wood or a board decently under the bone, for when you do this it is not forbidden that the saw not cut the corrupted flesh.
And it is necessary that the sawing be over the corrupt place little by little, because if there is corruption in the concavity of the bone and it does not appear in its appearance to the touch, then force the sawing of it another time.
And if the bone is corrupt and not prominent, before one part is continuous with the other, and the corruption is in the middle or in part of it, then you uncover the flesh from all parts entirely; and then place wood underneath, and then saw it from the first part where the corruption is until the sawing is continuous with the other part.
And let the sawing be according to the location of the corruption, little by little, as we have said.
And if the corruption is in the joint, incise that corrupt joint, and saw the bone where it is continuous with the other part.
And if the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then there is no reason for it but ingenuity/skill.
And if the corruption is in the chest of the hand or foot, it is very difficult; however, it is necessary that you inquire into the corruption in whatever manner appears to you, and that you open that, and clean that according to each disposition which is possible for you, and with each tool it should be rectified for you, when it does not oppose you vein or nerve.
And know that the incisors and saws for incising these bones are many according to the placement of the bones, and the preparation of those, and the thickness of those, and the subtlety and the size and the smallness of those, and the hardness and their rarity; therefore it is necessary that you prepare for every kind of operation an instrument convenient to that operation.
And know that that operation signifies to you the type of instrument of which you have need; when with you is great study and long and deep knowledge of the methods of this art, and experience of kinds of illnesses, for then you will already have for yourself that which is suitable for the instruments for every illness.
And I am forming for you at the end of this chapter the number of instruments which you will posit as simple, with which you will proceed to your prohibition which you will test on others. Form of saw:
Form of another saw:
Form of another large saw:
Form of a saw (or rasp): Let the head of this saw be according to the form of a star-shaped key head, and its points be according to the form of the points of a [presumably surgical] instrument.
And it is only suitable that with that [saw/rasp] the heads of the joints be scraped when they are corrupted, or the opening is very wide.
Form of a smaller rasp:
Form of a wide rasp:
Form of another saw decently made: let its arc be made of the strongest wood and its sharpness of iron, and its handle of wood, neatly made. Its form/shape:
Form of a rasp which has a concavity:
Form of another, more subtle rasp:
Form of another rasp with a curved end:
Form of a small rasp similar to a probe:
Form of another, smaller incisor:
Form of another incisor; this one resembles a ray, and its end is like a saw, and it is used in many places in the treatment of bones:
Form of a ray which is suitable for the treatment of those who have perforated bones:
And its end is triangular and sharply pointed.
And it is made of Indian iron, and similarly, it is necessary that all the things we have said about razors, and incisors, and saws.
Of the incision of extremities and the sawing of bones.
The extremities may be affected either by an intrinsic or extrinsic cause; or if you have treated that corruption with medication and the treatment is ineffective, or you see the corruption spreading through the limb without any apparent cause, then you should incise that limb up to the point where the corruption is located, so that the patient escapes death or a worsening condition that is a greater impairment of the limb.
And the sign of this is that the limb turns black as if it has been burned by fire, or the blackness spreads until the corruption reaches that limb and affects the whole body; therefore, treat it with incision.
Similarly, if the cause of the corruption is the sting of some venomous creature, such as a sea scorpion, viper, or shrew, and similar things.
And if the corruption or sting is in the extremity of a finger, then you should incise the finger and not give space to the corruption so that it spreads to the hand.
And similarly, if it affects the hand, then you should incise it from the root of the palm, and not give space to the corruption so that it spreads into the forearm.
And if it affects the arm, then incise the arm up to the elbow joint.
And if the corruption passes beyond and you see it around the elbow, then in that case is the death of the patient; and to administer anything else besides that in treatment is a waste of effort.
And similarly, do this for the foot: when corruption affects a toe, then you should incise it up to one of the ankle bones.
And if it takes hold in the heel of the foot, then you should incise the entire foot. But if it ascends to the knee, then you should incise the leg up to the knee joint.
And if the corruption has already reached the knee, then there is no remedy for him, only dismissal, and to leave the patient to death.
And the manner of incising or cauterizing a limb is this: you should tighten a ligature on the part below which you wish to incise, and tighten another ligature above the location; and let an assistant stretch a ligature on the lower parts, and let another assistant stretch a ligature above; and you separate the flesh that is between the two ligatures,  spreading it wide until all the flesh is exposed; and then it should be incised or cauterized.
And it is necessary that a linen cloth be placed on all parts so that it does not touch the healthy area, and that the patient suffers a well-adjusted lesion and a hot abscess.
But if a flow of blood occurs while you are operating, then carefully cauterize the affected area, or place on it some powders that constrict the blood; and then return to your treatment until it is completed.
And then bind the wounded limb with a suitable bandage, and treat it until it is healed.
And I recount to you what happened to a man in his foot, this same accident which I have recounted to you, which is that a blackness occurred in his foot with a burn that resembled a fire burn.
And that corruption occurred first in his toe before it spread to the whole foot.
And then that man prepared himself, because he saw the corruption spreading to the limb with such vehemence that he was overcome by pain and burning, and he incised that foot up to the joint, and it was healed.
For a long time he suffered the same corruption in the index finger of his hand.
And then he came to me, and I tried to repel that excess with what I applied to his hand in medicine, namely the purification of his body; and the excess was not repelled and began to spread to another finger until it reached his hand.
And he asked me to incise his hand, but I did not want to do that, hoping for the repulsion of that excess, and even more so fearing death from the incision of his hand, because the patient's strength was failing.
And after he departed from me, he returned to his land, and it was reported to me that that man prepared and incised his entire hand, and he was healed.
And I have added this narrative only so that it may be helpful in the case of this disease, and that it may be a sign by which it may be recognized and according to which it may be treated.
Of the treatment of sinuses and the quality of clysterization with medicines.
When an abscess occurs in fleshy members and the space of the abscess is prolonged until it forms a collection of pus, and then it is broken and perforated, and the pus has come out, and the place remains empty as if it were a vessel, and the skin that is over it is like thin cloth, and it has not reached further corruption, and it does not impinge on bone or nerve or ligament, it is called a sinus, and it is not called a fistula.
But however, if the space is prolonged until the corruption affects some member, then it is called a fistula and not a sinus.
And its treatment is that you incise that skin entirely as it is swollen, and especially when it is thinned and is like cloth, and ensure that it does not adhere to the place through its corruption.
But if you suspect that the skin will adhere and that the corruption has not reached further consequence, and the skin has thickened in appearance, then you treat that with a clyster.
And it is that you consider the sinus, and then if it is large, and the pus from it has a foul odor, then clysterize that with an Egyptian medicine which is made of oil and sharp wine and myrrh, taking equal parts, and they are mixed in a vessel, and cooked over the fire until the medicine becomes thick and reaches the consistency of honey.
And then you take what is necessary from it and dissolve it with water and honey; and clysterize the sinus with that, and constrict its opening, and leave the medicine in it for the quantity of two hours.
And then extract that with a syringe; and do this for so many days until the sinus is cleansed and the foul odor is removed.
And sometimes it is clysterized with wood ash water, when this medicine is not present to you; and it is that you take the ash of vines, and put water over it; and then strain that and clysterize with it until you are satisfied that the sinus is then clean.
And if the patient does not tolerate the Egyptian medicine nor the wood ash water, then clysterize with water and honey in which crushed myrrh is mixed, and clysterize with wine and honey mixed, for it is the property of honey to cleanse and wash, and the wine makes it adhere to the sinus, and especially when the wine has a superfluity of astringency and dryness.
And when you have done this several times and you are satisfied that the sinus is now clean, then clysterize it with something that will cause flesh to grow there.
And it is that you take diachylon ointment and dissolve it with rose oil and astringent wine; or that you clysterize it with some other medicines and ointments which have the properties which I have already written about in the treatise on ointments.
And if the opening of the sinus is narrow, so that the nozzle of the clyster cannot be inserted, then you should widen it with an iron instrument little by little, and place in it a tent wrapped in Egyptian ointment or basilicon ointment until it is widened.
And similarly, if the opening is wide, then you should approximate its lips with a suture and leave an opening large enough for the clyster to enter without difficulty.
And if the opening from which the pus flows is located high up, then dry the lowest part of it so that the pus will flow downwards, for when the pus is trapped deep within the sinus, the growth of flesh is hindered.
And if it is not possible for you to dry the sinus to the lowest point as desired, then you should ensure that you prepare the limb with a preparation by which the pus flows easily as far as is possible, and that nothing hinders the flow of pus.
But the cloth that is over the opening of the sinus, that one you should change every hour so that the pus that collects there is removed. And so that you know if the pus that flows from it is much or little, or is digested, or is undigested.
And with this, you should consider the location of that sinus, whether the patient feels pain there or not, and if there is an abscess there.
And as your treatment is prolonged in this manner, and you see that the material which is discharged onto the opening of the sinus has adhered, or is close to adhering, then on the third day you should loosen it; and when you loosen the dressing, then change the cloth for another and renew the ointment.
But if near the sinus there is a subtle poison, then do not be concerned about its adhesion, for its healing is approaching, for there are some men in whom the generation of flesh in their wounds is slow, and there are others in whom the opposite is true.
And if undigested pus has come from the sinus for many days, then know that the sinus will not adhere; and if the adhesion of the sinus is delayed and the cause is prolonged, then you should adjust the drying properties of the medicines. And if the medicines are moist in their substance and in their effect, they are dry, like diafinicon ointment, when the superfluous addition of zegi is adjusted in it.
And the best remedy with which it is cured is that you take diafinicon ointment and dissolve it in rose oil, and add old, unadulterated wine to its substance, and mix that well with it, and use that.
And it works similarly in that action, when there is no pus:  diafinicon ointment, honey cooked until thickened, and use that; or take myrrh, aloe, and incense, grind it all up and powder it over the honey while it's on the fire, and then apply this on a cloth and bind it tightly over the sinus; and apply this with the honey which you have cooked until thickened, and powder it on a cloth and bind it.
And sometimes, aristolochia longa and celestial lily roots (and it is celestial lily) and chickpea flour and centaury are administered with it; and use these simples or compounds, grind them, sieve them, and powder them over the honey which has been mentioned; and use it.
And if the sinus is prolonged, and is not healed by this treatment, then know that the corruption is in the depth of it, and it has already infiltrated the bones or other hard parts or ligaments; then you must treat it with fistula treatment, as described above.
On the treatment of paronychia, and damaged nails, and the addition of finger incisions and sectioning.
Paronychia is an abscess which arises under the nail of a finger or toe of the hand or foot, and quickly spreads to the other fingers, and as it is prolonged and its treatment is neglected, or it is inflamed by a hot abscess, or it is corrupted, and pus is emitted until it corrodes the root of the nail, and quickly corrupts the whole of it, and quickly its corruption penetrates to the bone until there is a foul odor, and the extremity of the finger becomes swollen, and its color becomes dark.
Therefore, when you have treated this with what we have said in the division and your treatment does not work, then you must incise with an iron all the superfluous matter which remains from the nail and then cauterize the wound, because a hot cautery is very helpful in this.
But if the bone is healthy and the nail is healthy, and the additions of the nail being empty already compress the flesh in the underlying parts, and begin to prick and injure it, then you must place a fine saw under the angle of the nail which pricks the flesh, and push it upwards and incise that flesh easily, and apply to what remains of the flesh corrosive medicines until it is all removed; and then treat that with ointments until it is healed.
But if the corruption has already penetrated the bone, then you must incise that bone and remove it, for a bone which is corrupted will never heal.
And if you see the corrosion and corruption going into the finger, then you must incise it at one of the joints as is prescribed in its treatment, and then treat it until it is healed.
But if the nail suffers percussion or abrasion, and experiences intense pain, then you must first bleed the patient, and then cut the nail with a sharp spatula with a transverse section from above downwards, and take care that the cut does not reach the flesh which is under the nail, for you will cause the patient intense pain, and it will be a cause of the birth of superfluous flesh in the place; and then treat that place with whatever relieves pain.
But a finger, which is born in the hands of some men, is quickly all fleshy, and quickly becomes bony, or quickly becomes a nail.
And some of them are born at the root of a joint, or their birth is in some of the joints of the fingers. But that which is born in some joint of the finger does not hurt, and that which is born in the joints is quickly made sore.
And of those that are born fleshy, the incision is easy, and it is that you should incise that one below its root with a broad spatula.
But of that which is born at the root of the joint, the cure is difficult; and therefore beware of its excision.
But in that which is born on a finger between the joints, it is necessary that you first incise its flesh with a round incision down to the bone, and then saw it with one of those saws suitable for this, and then cure it until it is healed.
But consolidation which happens to the fingers between their joints, whether by the birth of a man born thus, or by the consolidation of a wound, or by burning with fire, or similarly, then it is necessary that you cut that consolidation until the fingers return to their natural form.
And then place between them cloths soaked in rose oil so that they are not lightly consolidated, and separate them, or place between them a thin lead plate until it is consolidated as it should be.
And similarly, if consolidation occurs in some fingers with the palm, then you cut that consolidation according to what is prepared and suitable for the shape of the limb.
Of the incision of vices, they are various.
Vices are various, and they are twisted, thick veins full of melancholic superfluities which come in many parts of the body, and their greatest occurrence is in the legs, and especially in the legs of travelers, laborers, and porters.
Then it is necessary that you administer a purging of the body of black bile several times with strong expulsion, and then bleed the patient from the basilic vein.
But the treatment of them with iron is according to two methods: one is that it be incised and that black blood be drawn out, and the other method is that the vein be elevated and entirely extracted.
The incision of it is in this manner: first bathe the leg with very hot water until the thick blood, which is foul in the leg, is resolved, and then bind the patient's leg from the highest part of the thigh to the part below the knee with a bandage, and then cut the vein in one, two, or three places with a wide incision, and then draw the black blood with your hand from the lower part of the leg upwards, and from above downwards, until the quantity of blood you want and which you think sufficient has been drawn, and which will take away the strength of the disease.
And then bind it up, and command him to abstain from foods that engender black bile.
And repeat the treatment by phlebotomy when the veins are full and this harms the patient.
But the elevation of them is according to this manner: you who shave the patient's leg, if there is much hair on it, and then place him in a bath and bathe his leg with hot water until it reddens and the veins are swollen; or let him be exercised with vigorous exercise, if a bath is not available to you, until the limb is heated.
And then cut the vein in the direction of the vein by a longitudinal incision either behind the knee, or at the lowest part of it below the heel.
And then open the vein with an incision and scrape the vein on all sides until it appears sensitive, and it is by its appearance that you will see this redness turning to blackness.
And then, when you have opened the vein, you will see that white which is like a cord.
And then you place a ribbon under it so that it is elevated and separated from the vein, and suspend it with a golden or silver hook.
And then make another incision near that incision three fingers' breadth away, and then scrape the vein from the part above the vein until it appears.
And then lift it and incise it at the back near the heel, and then extract it and lift it until it is pulled through the second incision, and then extract it from the incision that is above it.
And do this until you extract it from the incision that is highest or most superior of all the incisions, until all of it is out; and then incise it.
And if it does not obey you in being extracted and elevated, then introduce a needle with strong double thread and tie it and extract it, or introduce a ribbon under it and rotate your hand in every direction until it is removed. And be careful that it is not incised; for if it is broken, it is difficult for you to elevate it completely, and harm comes upon the patient from that damage.
And when all of it has been removed, then place on the site of the wound wool soaked in rose wine and olive oil and un-rose-colored olive oil (plain olive oil), and cure it until it is healed.
And if the intestine is constricted, having a tortuosity which is twisted in parts, and is not straight as we have said, then it is necessary that you incise it in each part of its tortuosity and in the places of its twisting, and then suspend it with hooks until you elevate it completely.
And be careful in your incision that you do not cut the vein and that you do not injure it, for it will be difficult for you to elevate it; and use your prudence in this.
The form of the incision with which the intestine is cut:
It is not sharpened like hooks, nor is it of a sharp point so that it does not injure the vein; and it is of great flexibility, broad, because if it were thin, it would cut the vein due to its thinness; it has superfluous thickness as we have said.
Of the extraction of a vein of the leg.
This vein is generated in the legs in hot lands, like in Al-Ategi in the land of the Arabs, and in the hot and arid lands of India, of little humidity, and in which neither grass nor trees grow.
And it is easily generated in other places of the body besides the legs.
And its generation is from putrefaction that comes from under the skin, just as serpents, worms, scabies, and worms are generated between the skin and the flesh.
And a sign of the onset of this vein is that a vehement inflammation happens in the leg; and near the place it is blistered; and then the vein begins to emerge from the place of that blister, which resembles the root of a plant.
And when its extremity appears, then you should wrap around it a piece of lead weighing one to two drachms, tie it, and leave the lead suspended from the leg.
And as many times as some cause protrudes outwards, wrap it in lead and tie it. And if the protrusion is prolonged, then you should incise a part of it and wrap the remainder; and do not incise the root until it has emerged, for if you incise it, it is retracted and enters the flesh, causing an abscess and putrefaction in the place and a bad ulceration.
Therefore it must be treated gently and extracted little by little, until it is completely expelled and no part of the cause remains in the body.
And from this vein, it has emerged in some men to a length of five palms and fingers, and it has even reached me that one emerged of twenty palms.  (Note:  A palm is a unit of length, approximately 4 inches.)
And if it is incised at the time of its treatment, then introduce a probe into its opening and perforate it with a long passage to the body, until all that is in the matter is evacuated, and treat the putrefaction of the place for some days with medicines; and then cure it by the treatment of abscesses.
And this vein sometimes has many branches, and especially when it appears at the joint of the foot or in the foot, and many orifices appear, and a branch emerges from each orifice.
And therefore cure it as we have said in the division and with what has been said above.
Concerning the incision above worms generated under the skin, and it is called bovine illness.
This illness is called in some lands near us bovine illness because it often happens to cows and is a small worm which is born between the skin and the flesh, and goes throughout the body rising and falling, and is shown by the sensation of its movement from limb to limb until it breaks the skin and comes out.
And its generation is due to the putrefaction of certain humors, just as worms and serpents and earthworms and ascarids occur in the belly.
And it is feared for its malice, for when it goes into the body and is elevated to the head, and has reached the eye, then very quickly it enters and destroys the eye, and this happens many times.
Therefore, when you wish to cure this and extract it, then it is done only by means of its movement and appearance to the sense, and then it is necessary that you tightly bind that which is above it and that which is below it with a strong ligature and constriction, and then cauterize above it and extract it.
And if it is deeply embedded in the flesh and you do not find it, then you apply a cautery with fire to the place until it dies, and the greatest thing to be feared is its corruption, by which it corrupts the place as we have said.
But if you see that it has reached the head near the eye, then bind above the eyebrow with a strong ligature, and then cauterize above it, and extract it; and it is necessary that the patient use purification of his body with medicines evacuating bad putrid humors, and guard himself from foods generating putrefaction.
Concerning the incision for the disease nafir (or a similar ailment).
This illness is called nafir in our land, and it is a pain which comes in some members, and then is moved from member to member.
And I have already seen that, as I will tell you. I was called to a sick woman in a village, and I uncovered her arm and saw a small inflammation in the superficial vein of the arm, and after it had remained for an hour, I saw that inflammation moving like a worm climbing upwards, but more lightly than one would fear, as if it were quicksilver when it runs from place to place.
And then the pain left that place and settled in the muscle, and there it remained for about an hour.
And then it ran to the other side until it reached the other arm.
And then I remembered that it was moving throughout her body as I had seen; and I was very surprised by its change of location and its speed from limb to limb. And I had seen this before with my own eyes in this manner, however I have seen many who find pain shifting from limb to limb. But I did not see it with my eyes as clearly as in the woman.
And I thought that this was so because the woman was old, with a dry body and exposed veins, and in this way the shifting wind (or air) was apparent to the senses.
And it is necessary that it not appear, according to this retrospective cure, in those who are delicate and have moist bodies with hidden veins.
And when you want to cure him, and the patient feels that pain, then it is not apparent to your eye as we have said, then you press on that place lightly and dry it until that confined wind has departed, and cauterize the place.
But if you do not see it with your own eyes, then you treat it with a shaking of the body and with things that expel winds, and drive them out with fetid pills and pills of serapium and the like.
On the extraction of arrows.
Arrows are diversified according to their types, and according to the places in the body where they fall, for their diversity is that some have large points, and small ones, and concave ones, and blunt ones, that is, solid ones; and some have three angles, and some have barbs; and some have feathers.
And of the signs of the brain, when an arrow falls into it and pierces the bone, and comes out of the cranium which is above the brain, for there happens because of it sudden vehemence, and scotoma (blindness), and vertigo, and redness in the eyes, and inflammation and redness of the tongue, and spasm and confusion of understanding, and vomiting of bile, and speech is quickly cut off and the voice is destroyed, and there comes from the place of the wound a white humidity resembling pus, and swelling similar to the watery part of the flesh.
And therefore if these signs appear to you, then abstain from the cure and from the extraction of the arrow, unless it is already outside.
But the signs of the arrow when it falls into the heart, are that it is near the left breast, and it feels as if it were fixed in something hard, and not something empty; and quickly the movement of the arrow is similar to the movement of the pulse, and black blood flows from the wound, and there is coldness of the extremities, and cold sweat, and syncope; and therefore know that death approaches without any doubt.
And the signs when the arrow has wounded the lung are the emission of frothy blood from the wound, and the vessels that are near the neck are inflamed, and the color of the patient is changed, and he breathes with great difficulty, and desires the intake of cool air.
And if the arrow falls into the diaphragm which is in the chest, and the pain then is near the lower ribs, and the breath is drawn with great pain and with sighing, and not all the members of the muscles are affected.
And if the arrow falls into the stomach, then very quickly some undigested food emerges from the wound.
And if the arrow falls into the abdomen, and is fixed there, there will be some discharge from the wound, of tissue, or intestine which is ruptured, and there is no hope of its cure without the extraction of the arrow.
And if the arrow falls into the bladder, and urine issues forth, and some matter proceeds from it to the external parts, and severe pain comes upon the patient, then know that it is mortal.
But the other members, such as the face, the neck, and the throat, and the shoulders and the armpits, and the vertebrae of the back, and the clavicle, and the hip, and the leg and similar members, are saved according to the major dispositions when the arrow does not strike a vein or artery and is not a poisoned arrow.
And I recount this to you, what I have seen of the effects of these arrows, so that you may understand thereby your treatment.
The reason is that in one man an arrow fell into the lacrimal duct of his eye, at the root of the nose, and I extracted it from him on the other side, below his ear, and he was healed, and no harm befell his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from a Jew which fell into him in the corner of his eye, below the eyelid, and the arrow was already hidden and I could grasp only a small tip with which it adhered to its shaft; it was a large arrow, one of the sharp arrows of the Turks, with a lion-headed iron point which had no barbs.
And the Jew was healed, and no ill accident befell his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from a Christian man which had fallen into his throat; it was an Arabic arrow, and this kind has barbs.  And then I incised over it between two guides, for it was submerged in his throat; and then I carefully worked on it, and I extracted it, and the Christian was healed.
And I extracted another arrow from a man which had fallen into his belly, and I thought that he would die from it. And so, after thirty days had passed and nothing had changed in his condition, I incised over the arrow and I pulled it out, and he was healed, and no ill accident befell him.
And I saw another man in whom an arrow had fallen into his back, and the wound had healed over him, and after about seven years, the arrow emerged at the root of the thigh.
And I saw a woman into whom an arrow had fallen in her belly, and the wound had healed within her, and nothing had changed in her condition, and the woman found no impediment in any of her natural functions.
And I saw another man into whom an arrow had fallen in his face, and the wound healed and the arrow broke, finding little pain there, and many similar to these.
And I extracted the arrow from the king's prince's man that had fallen into the middle of his nose and had already declined a little to the right side, and the whole arrow was hidden.
And I was called to his healing about three days after the arrow's penetration.
And then I found the wound from the arrow very narrow; and then I examined it with a thin probe, and did not feel it; but he felt a prickling under his right ear, and then I suspected that this prickling was due to the tip of the arrow.
And I plastered the place with a plaster which has attractive and digestive virtue, trusting that the place would suppurate so that the location of the arrow would appear to me, so that I could operate on it.
And no significant accident occurred in the area that indicated the arrow had reached that location; and I continued with the plaster on him for many days and no accident occurred; and the wound was consolidated meanwhile, and the patient desisted from its extraction for many days until one day he felt the arrow inside his nose and related this to me.
And then I applied a sharp corrosive medicine to the wound for many days until it was opened, and with a probe I examined it, and found the tip of the arrow, which adhered to the shaft.
And then I adjusted the application of the sharp medicine to the wound until the tip of the arrow appeared to me visibly, and I spent time with this for a period of up to four months.
And then, since the wound was enlarged, and it was possible for me to insert forceps into it, and remove it, and I did not succeed in doing so, then I did not cease to refine and devise methods for it, until one day I managed to grasp it with specially made forceps, as the form of those will be shown at the end of the chapter, until I extracted it; and then I restored the wound.
And some physicians judged that the cartilage of the nose would not be restored, and I restored it and the wound was consolidated, and the patient was healed completely, and he suffered no ill effects.
And I recount to you the manner of extraction of certain arrows so that you may take this as a rule and explanation of what I have not said, for the details of this art and its definitions are not comprehensively covered in a narrative, nor do books contain them.
And skilled artisans compare the small with the large; and the present with the absent; and they find new operations and new instruments due to the descent of unusual causes in the art when they occur.
Therefore I say that arrows are not expelled from the limbs into which they are fixed except in two ways: either by traction at the point of entry; or by counter-pressure from the opposite side.
And that which is expelled from the place where it entered, is an arrow lodged in fleshy tissue, and is pulled and expelled.
And if it does not readily come out at the moment of extraction, then you must leave it for some days until the flesh surrounding it softens, and its extraction and removal is eased.
And similarly, if it is embedded in bone and does not readily come out, then leave it for a few days and repeat the extraction and manipulation each day, and it will eventually be removed.
And if it still does not come out after a few days, then you must perforate the bone around the arrow on all sides with a fine drill until the area around the arrow is widened, and then extract it.
But if the arrow is hidden within the body and is not palpable, then you should probe for it with a probe; and if you feel it, then extract it with instruments suitable for its removal.
And if you cannot reach it because of the tightness of the wound and the length of the projectile, and there is no bone, nerve, or vein in the way, then you should incise the wound to enlarge it so that it is possible to extract the arrow.
And if it is held fast by barbs, then you should free the flesh in which it is embedded from all sides with whatever means you can; and work on this, if you cannot manage it by removing the flesh at the base of the barbs and twisting them until they yield.
And when you are performing the extraction of the arrow, wherever it may be, then use the twisting motion of your hand and forceps on all sides until it yields; and proceed with utmost delicacy so that the arrow is not broken, making its removal difficult.
And if you cannot manage it at that time, then leave it for a few days until the parts surrounding it soften, and then try again, for it will then be easier. But if you encounter excessive bleeding, then use the remedies described in the relevant chapter.
And be careful to avoid cutting a vein, nerve, or tendon, and employ every possible means to remove the arrow; and do this with ease, calmness, slowness, and firmness, as I have recommended to you.
And therefore, counteract the arrow so that the patient's position corresponds to the direction from which the arrow entered, because this is more beneficial. But if that is not possible, then use whatever means are available to you, according to the circumstances.
But if arrows are protruding from the opposite side, or if any part of the arrow projects outward from the wound, or if the tip of the arrow causes swelling due to the feeling of the part above the deep wound and you see this swelling; then you should incise there; and the incision should be according to the size that the forceps can grasp; and then pull it out, for it will come out easily in this way.
But if it is lodged in the bone, then twist the blade in the opposite direction until the arrow is loosened from the bone, and widen the opening, and then extract it.
And if not, leave it for a few days, and then try again until it comes out.
And if the shaft of the arrow remains inside, then push it in further.
But if the shaft has fallen off and you want to administer a push, then insert, if it is blunt, a concave instrument so that the concavity fits over the tail of the arrow and then push it in.
But if the arrow is concave, then push it in with a strong instrument entering it, because the arrow is thereby eased.
And if the arrow is poisoned, then you must remove all the flesh in which the poison is, if it is possible for you to do so, and then treat it with what is appropriate.
And if the arrow falls into the foot, or into the belly, or into the bladder, or into the side, and is close enough that you can touch it with a probe, and it is possible for you to cut over it, then cut over it and be careful not to cut a vein or nerve, and extract it, and then sew the wound if necessary, and treat it until it is healed.
The shape of the forceps with which arrows are pulled out:
Let their ends be like the beak of a bird, made like a saw when they grip the arrow so that they do not let go of it.
And of these, many types are made, large, small, and medium-sized, according to the size of the arrow and its smallness, and the size of the wound, and the constriction of the area.
like a ray, so that its entry into the concave arrow is eased and it is pushed with that.
Of phlebotomy (bloodletting) of the veins.
The veins for phlebotomy, of which the customary number is thirty, of which sixteen are in the head:  two pulsating veins near the ears, called alhasisain; two veins in the two apparent temples; and two veins in the two tear ducts of the two eyes, which are called aspicientz; and the vein prepared in the middle of the forehead, and the vein that is at the tip of the nose; and two guidegi (possibly a type of vein) that are at the neck; and two veins that are in the upper lip; and two veins that are in the lower lip; and — these are the veins that are called algelic —; and there are two veins that are under the tongue. But the veins that are phlebotomized in the arms are five; for of these, one is the cephalic, and it is on the ulnar side (little finger side); and the common people call it "the vein of the head", and it is a superficial vein, and it is composed of a branch of the basilica, and of another branch of the cephalic; and the people name that one "vein of the whole body", and the basilica is a vein which is located on the radial side (thumb side), and is named "citillar", and the common people call that one "vein of the belly"; and the funis of the arm, and it is located on the fold (of the elbow), and it is that in which phlebotomy is performed, and it is that which appears above the fold by manifest appearance; and the salvatella, and it is the vein that is between the ring finger and the little finger, and it has two branches.
And in the foot and leg there are three veins; one of these is below the bend of the knee on the ulnar side; and the second is the saphenous, and its location is below the leg on the radial side; and the sciatic vein, and its location is below the leg on the ulnar side; and in the leg are other veins similar to those.
The benefit of opening the veins near the ears is for old cataracts, migraine,  sahanfati (a disease, likely requiring further research to identify), and old, bad ulcers of the head.
And the method of bleeding these veins is as I recount to you:  that the head of the patient is raised, and the head of the patient is rubbed at the occiput in the location of both veins with a wide cloth, with good friction; then the patient tightens his neck with a bandage until the two veins and their locations appear near the ears, in two depressed places of the head; and feel for them with your finger, and if you feel the pulse of these with your finger, then bleed them with a lancet.
Then you take the lancet knife, which is sharp, and then you insert it under the vein in the skin until the blood flows out. Then raise your hand with the vein and skin upwards and incise the vein with a sharp incision. And let the length of the incision be the width of two fingers joined, or thereabouts; and let blood flow as much as you wish.
Then bind it with powders and leave it until it is healed.
And already, at the beginning of the book, the incision of these and their cauterization has been described.
But for the two arteries in the temples, bloodletting is beneficial for chronic migraine, sudden severe headaches, persistent ophthalmia (eye inflammation), and acute effusions of superfluities into the eyes.
And the method of phlebotomizing these is as I have recounted to you: constrict the patient's neck tightly until the two veins appear visibly to the touch, and their pulse is felt under your finger; and then you may cut with a lancet.
Then you raise the skin above the vein at the upper part with your index finger, and insert the phlebotomy lancet underneath, raising the vein upwards; and incise it in the same way as you did the other two veins; and let the blood flow according to your need.
Then loosen the ligature on the patient, and place your finger on the vein for an hour, and then place cotton and powder on it and bind it tightly above, and leave it until it is healed.
And already the recollection of them, and their incision, and the traction have been discussed at the beginning of the book.
Therefore, phlebotomy of the frontal vein is appropriate for phlebotomy of the cephalic vein in old facial diseases, and for migraine, stiffness, and foul ulcers.
And the manner of his phlebotomy is as I recount to you; that is, that the patient constrict his neck with a bandage until the vein appears; and then take the instrument which is named a fleam, of which this is the form:
Place the prominent point which is at the head of the fleam upon that vein and strike it with a hammer or other suitable object in the manner of it, and let the blood flow according to the quantity that you wish; and then loosen the constriction on the patient and bind it until it is healed.
And sometimes it is opened with a lateral phlebotomy, however it is not fitting that the phlebotomy be of a sharp point as are the other phlebotomies, rather let it be of a flat point, and perform this phlebotomy transversely, because the bone is close and it would easily break the phlebotomy instrument when it is thin.
But the treatment of the two veins that are at the tear ducts of the two eyes is for scabies of the eyes, for stiffness and swelling in the eyes, and for diseases of the face.
And the manner of the phlebotomy is that the patient constricts his neck with a bandage, and then phlebotomize there, and you stand above his head.
And let the phlebotomy be made transversely rather than lengthwise, with a small phlebotomy instrument, because in that place there is no flesh; and if the phlebotomy instrument is thin, its point is easily broken.
And then allow the blood to flow as much as is necessary to you, and place cotton there, and bind it for a night, and then unbind it.
But phlebotomy of the vein of the nose is beneficial for acute fever and violent headache, and for diseases of the face and migraine and stiffness that occurs in the face, especially when it is chronic.
And the manner of his phlebotomy is that the patient constricts his neck and then you hold his nose with your left hand, and take a long, thin phlebotomy instrument and insert it into the middle of the nasal bridge straight, because the vein is not palpable there, and because the blood begins to flow immediately.
Then you should move your hand with the small phlebotomy instrument little by little and let the blood flow according to your need; and then bind it for a night, because it is lightly restored.
But the benefit of phlebotomy of the two jugular veins is for constriction of the throat and the beginning of leprosy and many diseases and impetigo and bad, corrosive ulcers, as well as herpes.
And the manner of phlebotomy of those veins is that the patient should constrict each side of his neck with a bandage; and the surgeon should stand above the patient's head, and the patient should be sitting on a chair.
And then phlebotomize the vein lengthwise with a wide phlebotomy instrument little by little; and then extract blood according to a moderate quantity or according to what seems necessary; and then do the same with the other vein.
And then untie the bandage and constrict the two veins with a slight pressure so that the patient is not suffocated, and leave it until morning because the wound is healed.
And the benefit of phlebotomy of the jugular veins helps with small abscesses and pustules of the mouth, corruption of the gums, bad ulcers and fissures, and bad ulcers that are in the nose and around it.
And the manner of phlebotomy of those veins is that you make the patient sit before you, and constrict his neck with a bandage, and then roll back his lips and look for two veins, of which one is on the right of the lip and the second on the left; and the indication of each is by the blackness of each of them, and this is more so because in the vicinity of those there are small black veins; and then incise each with a suitable incision.
But if you are in doubt, and you do not know which is which, then you should incise the larger of those veins, and the most apparent one.
And do the same for the two veins that are in the upper lips.
But of the two veins that are below the tongue, the phlebotomy of the cephalic vein is useful for inflammations that are in the throat, for diseases of the uvula, and for diseases of the mouth.
And the method of phlebotomizing these is that you hold the patient between your hands facing the sun, and lift their tongue, and look under the tongue; on one side is a vein and on the other side a vein, and the color of each is tending toward blackness.
And then phlebotomize each one; and be careful not to overuse your hand in phlebotomizing these, because below these are arteries.
And the veins that are phlebotomized in the elbow are those in which blood flows customarily in all men, and their phlebotomy is done in two ways: either they are opened with a lancet or an olive-shaped tool of fine sharpness; or they are opened with a cupping knife, and this is called scarification, and this is its form:
Let its width be like this, and it is suitable for opening concave, full, prominent, thick veins, and those that contain thick, turbid blood.
And this phlebotomy is of lesser width and of a more subtle extremity, and is suitable for phlebotomy of thin veins that contain thin, clear blood.
But the benefit of phlebotomy of the basilic vein, which is one of three veins: because it draws out blood from illnesses that are below the throat and neck, and from those that affect the feet and abdomen.
And it is fitting for the phlebotomist, when performing this phlebotomy, that he carefully guards against it and is very cautious, because beneath it is an artery, and if he errs and is imprecise in the puncture of the phlebotomy, he will cut that artery and cause a flow of blood, therefore it is necessary that he not perform this phlebotomy with a sharp phlebotomy tool before it is cut with a lancet.
And if the basilic vein is not apparent by manifest appearance, then it is necessary that you leave it and that you move to another, or that you seek one of its branches; or that you perform phlebotomy in the area of the inner part of the arm, because that is manifest; and cut that with a lancet as we have said.
But if you wish phlebotomy in the same place, then before the constriction of the arm you should touch the area until you recognize the location of the pulse, and then mark it with ink; and then tie the arm and cut the vein with a concave incision with a lancet as we have said; and be careful that the incision does not fall into the area of the artery.
And when you see, as you tighten the ligature, swelling in the place you have marked with ink, then that swelling is swelling of the artery, and therefore avoid that.
And if you see the blood flowing in the phlebotomy like a child's urine, and the blood is thin and red, then know that it is blood from the artery; and then you observe and place your finger on it for a long time; and then remove your finger, and if the bleeding is stopped, because many times it is stopped, then you loosen the arm and leave it.
And watch the patient for movement, and let there be a fear of movement for him and do not hurt him for some days until he is healed.
But if the bleeding is not stopped, and you see that you do not have medicine present for this, then you incise the artery, if it appears to you; because its extremity is constricted, and the blood is stopped; or that you take bark of a fig tree, and pulverize it, and take one half and apply that to the place of the vein with a descending ligature and with powders until the next day.
And then if the bleeding is stopped, it is good; and if not, then cure it with that which is mentioned before in the recollection of the place of the powders that stop the flow of blood.
And the stopping of his blood is difficult in many dispositions because of the small location of the wound and the possibility of binding the arm.
But of the dark vein, phlebotomy is helpful, which draws blood from the upper part of the head and from the lower part of the body; for this reason because it is composed of a branch of the basilica and a branch of the cephalic, as we have said.
And it behooves the phlebotomist that he be very careful in his phlebotomy, because below it is a nerve; and then if he is inaccurate in the puncture of the phlebotomy and finds the nerve, stupor will happen to him, and its healing is difficult, and very easily it is not healed at all. And this nerve many times appears to the senses; and if it is hidden from some men and is subtle and is not shown, then it behooves you to place the phlebotomy with which you perform phlebotomy with a slanting incision, and avoid the nerve with your skill.
And if the vein is between two nerves, then you should cut the vein lengthwise.
The benefit of phlebotomy of the cephalic vein is that it draws blood from the head and helps with diseases of the eyes.
And it is fitting in this case, if you wish that the phlebotomist punctures with an olive-shaped or myrtle-shaped phlebotomy tool; because it is the safest of all veins, for below it is neither artery nor nerve.
However, it is very quickly abscessed in some men, when it is not phlebotomized on the first percussion, but that abscess does no harm.
The first of these is that you should know that phlebotomy is administered only for the preservation of health and for its hope and caution against the onset of diseases, and that phlebotomy should be performed in one of the veins that are in the elbow, that is: cephalic, median cubital, and basilic; and that phlebotomy should be performed at the beginning of spring, on an empty stomach in spring and autumn, and in winter near mealtime, when signs of repletion appear.
And let phlebotomy be performed on the third day or the first, after three hours have passed from the day.
But phlebotomy is administered more when it provokes convenience and necessity for it, either by night or by day, at any hour and at any time.
And it is necessary that a child not be phlebotomized until they are fourteen years old, and that a pregnant woman not be phlebotomized except from the fourth month until the seventh, and that old women who have already passed sixty years not be phlebotomized.
And if someone wants to be phlebotomized in any way, it is necessary that they cleanse their bowels before phlebotomy with a cleansing enema, if they have much retained waste in them, so that the veins do not draw the superfluities into the phlebotomy from the bowels, which are impure, and that they do not harm the principal members.
And let not patients with persistent nausea and vomiting, or recovering from illness or fever, be phlebotomized until this is resolved in them, nor those suffering from dropsy; and let phlebotomy be further avoided with colic, vomiting, and intestinal distress, and with excessive coitus, labor, and exercise, fasting, or vigils, and any cause that diminishes strength, whether bodily or animal.
And consider carefully the thinning of humors beforehand, if the blood is thick, with foods and drinks, and with medicines, if this is possible for him.
And let him enter a bath if no cause forbids it, or let him be exercised by some activity so that the blood is thinned.
And perform his phlebotomy in the middle of the day, that is, around the third hour, as we have said.
And ensure that the patient's foot is protected that day from all accidental harms, both animal such as anguish, anger, fear, and all bodily accidents such as excessive labor and exertion, coitus, and similar things.
And let there be present at his bedside things whose use is customary among men, with aromatics and fragrances, and with balms and similar things, according to what is possible.
And let the phlebotomist sit on a cushion higher than the cushion of the one who is to be phlebotomized.
Then, the phlebotomist should extend his arm, and rub it with his hand two or three times; and then tighten the ligature with a strap and wrap it twice.
And let the constriction be moderate, for when the constriction is unequal, or the constriction is excessive, then it prevents the flow of blood; or if it is too loose, then it prevents the blood from flowing out properly.
And before the constriction, it is necessary that the one who is to be phlebotomized rub his hands together until the veins are swollen and become clearly visible.
Then the phlebotomist should anoint his fleam with a little old oil; and then he should place the index finger of his left hand on the vein, below the place where he wants to perform the phlebotomy, so that the vein slightly recedes, and the percussion is stopped because some veins are like a fleeing cord during phlebotomy, and those are full of wind, and when you place the fleam on them, they contract around the fleam and the phlebotomist is disappointed; and the fleam does not open the vein, and if it opens, it is narrow.
Therefore, the phlebotomist must be skilled and attentive to all these matters.
Then apply the fleam; but if the vein is opened on the first attempt, that is good; otherwise, repeat the procedure slightly below or above that spot with care, if the area is not infected.
And if the area is infected, or the patient is frightened, then leave it for a day or two, and do not tighten the bandage, for it will quickly attract a hot abscess, nor should they enter a bath.
Then repeat the phlebotomy if necessary.
And if the opening is small and the blood flows slowly, and you fear that you will not obtain the desired quantity of blood, then repeat the phlebotomy in that same opening, straightening and slightly enlarging it, and do this carefully before the area becomes infected, for in many men the area becomes infected from a small opening.
But if you see that it is already infected, then do not repeat the procedure there, for it will do no good; and apply some olive oil to the area, for it relieves the body of blood. And olive oil is better in this instance than other oils.
Similarly, administer olive oil in all phlebotomies with which you bleed veins to prevent blood clotting, and use theriac and sagapenum when one of those is applied to the area, for they thin the blood and resolve it when it is thick.
And if a large abscess develops at the site of the phlebotomy—which happens frequently, especially in someone who has not been bled before or where the vein opening was small—then wait, and apply a sponge soaked in slightly warm salt water, and compress it for an hour, for this will resolve it.
And it is necessary to do this immediately after the bleeding from that vein, or from another vein, is complete.
And if some blackness or greenness remains at the site for a few days, this is not harmful; and if you wish, apply something made of dissolved aloes and myrrh, or something made of mint juice, or calamint, or something similar.
And abscesses and swellings often occur after phlebotomy of the basilica vein.
Then place your hand on it, and if you then find softness under your compression, then that swelling is malignant and bad; and then be careful to apply something of what we have said, because blood will quickly flow from the artery.
And make a plaster with something that has styptic properties, so that the place is hardened, and then treat it with the other treatment until it is healed.
And it is necessary to extract blood from every man according to the quantity of his strength and according to the color prevailing over the blood as it appears.
For if the blood is black, then you let it flow until it is red; and similarly, if you see it thick, then you let it flow until it is thinned; and similarly, if it is sharp, until its sharpness is removed.
And it is necessary for one who is full and strong and needs bloodletting at once, that the phlebotomy of the vein be amplified and the phlebotomy be wide.
And in one who is weak, the opposite should be done, and it is necessary to extract [blood] in small amounts, and the opening should be narrow.
And the best way to administer phlebotomy is that the section be transverse, not a puncture.
And this manner of phlebotomy is safe from excessive bleeding and from cutting nerves, and it is more praiseworthy and safer than phlebotomy according to width and length.
And to one who is accustomed to fainting after phlebotomy, you should treat him before the phlebotomy with a small piece of bread soaked in pomegranate wine or warmed simple oxymel; and extract the blood from him in three or four times.
And if he is of a cold complexion, then let him take before phlebotomy bread soaked in syrup of myrrh or in honey syrup flavored with spices such as pepper, cinnamon, ginger, and the like, or in a fragrant and strongly aromatic syrup.
And if syncope occurs during phlebotomy, and it is caused by the loss of much blood, then he should drink meat broth and a very subtly fragrant syrup; and use aromatics with rue, and let his feet be warmed with it.
And use the other remedies that we have mentioned in the section on syncope by evacuation.
And whoever wishes to bleed his arm and dissolve his blood a second time, it is necessary for him, for whom phlebotomy is for the purpose of evacuation, and whose strength is weak, that he evacuate blood little by little, that is, according to the amount of strength over several days.
But whoever wishes to bleed his arm and shed his blood a second time, and his body is strong, then let him do so approximately seven or nine hours after the first phlebotomy.
But whoever wants to draw blood from his body away from the part to which it is drawn, he should be bled on the second or third day.
But that body in which there is much already heated blood, and is sharp and causes fever, should have blood drawn from it at once, and a large quantity should be drawn, and the opening should be widened until syncope occurs, provided you have observed all the conditions of phlebotomy; and that you place your hand on his pulse below the bleeding, lest death occur instead of syncope, for this often happens when the phlebotomist is ignorant and negligent.
And it is not fitting, when you wish to untie the arm and evacuate the blood a second time, and the opening of the vein is already closed and the exit of the blood is made difficult, that you press on it with vehemence and that it be bent slightly, for this is very bad.
Having let it be until it is bled a second time; or remove it with the sharpness of the phlebotomy that is coagulated blood in the opening of the vein; or place on it theriaca alfarach, or of sage, and compress it with light compression until the blood is completely out.
And if the vein is abscessed, then leave it and do not touch it until the abscess is calmed.
And if necessity compels you to evacuate the blood a second time, and there is no excuse, then you bleed him in that place or in the other arm in another vein.
And the vein called "rope of the arm" is phlebotomized in place of the cephalic or the basilic, when they are not found or are hidden, because it is composed of those.
And the quality of his phlebotomy is that the patient should put his hand in warm water until the vein reddens and appears manifestly.
And then it should be bound above with a moderately tight ligature; and then phlebotomize according to the small transversal, neither laterally nor lengthwise.
And let the opening be wide, and perform your phlebotomy with which you phlebotomize that, a little above the joint of the hand.
And if the flow of blood is impeded, then you put the hand back in warm water and let the blood run into the water until you achieve your goal.
But if you are in the summer days, then you are excused from putting the hand back in warm water, and the same is done, placing the blood vessel in warm water in winter time.
And phlebotomy of this vein is safer than of all other veins, because underneath it there is neither a pulsating vein nor nerves.
And phlebotomy of the little vein of the right hand is beneficial for liver diseases.
And the manner of phlebotomy is that you tighten the hand with a bandage or with your hand, after you have put it in warm water, until the vein is swollen and clearly visible; and then phlebotomize it transversely; and if you cut it completely, it will not harm in any way.
And take care not to go too far with your hand in the phlebotomy, for beneath it are the nerves of the fingers, denuded of flesh.
And then return the hand to the warm water and let the blood flow into it, for if you do not return it to the warm water, the blood will coagulate in the opening of the vein, and the flow will be impeded.
And when the blood has been extracted according to the necessary quantity, then you place oil and salt on the vein, so that it is not quickly consolidated; and similarly you should do in every narrow branch.
But the benefit of phlebotomy on the left hand is that it is beneficial for diseases of the spleen.
And perform the phlebotomy on him similarly as you have done on the other.
And the benefit of phlebotomy of the saphenous vein is for illnesses that are in the lower part of the body, such as uterine diseases, and menstrual retention, and for illnesses of the chronic sores and ulcers of the thighs and legs, and similar illnesses.
And the method of his phlebotomy is that the patient should put his foot in warm water and rub it until the veins appear well; and tie above the joint of the foot with a strap; and the place of the vein is usually apparent below the big toe, and from that one, many branches are spread across the surface of the foot.
Therefore, phlebotomize the largest branch below the leg near the ankle, because it is better and healthier.
And if you phlebotomize that one on the surface of the foot, then beware of the nerves that are below it on the surface of the foot, and perform your phlebotomy in such a way that you phlebotomize across, as if you were going to incise it.
And let the phlebotomy be skillful.
But if the drawing of blood is prohibited; then you immerse his foot in warm water and let the blood flow there until it is evacuated.
And if the phlebotomist errs on the first attempt, then repeat the phlebotomy a little higher, for the location is safe; and do not fear to inflict harm, but beware of the nerves as we have said.
And similarly do the same to the saphenous vein of the other foot equally.
And of the sciatic vein, the location as we have said is below the heel, under the anklebone on the left side.
And the benefit of phlebotomy for him is for hip pain when it is due to hot blood.
And the manner of his phlebotomy is that the patient enter a bath, and fasten and bind his thigh from the hip joint above the ankle above four fingers with a long, thin bandage, for it will not appear otherwise.
And then when it appears, then you phlebotomize that according to whatever method is possible for you and according to the transverse vein, and it is better; or incise it with an incision or cut it with a section, for its location is safe.
And it is often very hidden in many men; and if you find it, and it does not appear to the touch at all, then phlebotomize one of its branches, and that is the one that appears on the back of the foot between the little toe and the ring finger.
And beware of the nerves, and let the blood flow the amount you desire.
And then loosen the ligature and place cotton over the phlebotomy site and bind the area tightly, for it heals easily.
Concerning cupping and the qualities of its use.
Cups are made of horn, or of brass, or of glass.
And cupping is done in two ways: one of them is with scarification and blood extraction, and the other is cupping without scarification.
And this cupping that is without scarification is done in two ways, for it is either with fire or without fire.
And for cups that are administered with scarification and bloodletting, there are fourteen locations on the body, of which the one where cups are placed is called *alnocrati*, and it is the back part of the head; and the middle location between the two sides of the neck together; and cups on the chin below the jaw, below the mouth; and cups on the two shoulder blades; and cups on the *alohoster* (possibly referring to a specific anatomical location, perhaps the lower back or hip), and it is above the end of the coccyx; and cups on the two *focils* (likely referring to some anatomical point, perhaps the thighs), and they are on the two thighs; and cups on the two *cavilhas* (possibly the knees or ankles), and cups on the two hips.
And cupping does not extract blood except from the small veins scattered in the flesh, and therefore it does not deplete strength through them, as is the case with phlebotomy; nor should cupping be done with fire or without fire in any illness caused by repletion until the whole body is evacuated.
But if necessity calls for cupping for illness or for a continuing condition, we administer it at any time, at the beginning of the month, at the end of it, in the middle of it, and at any time.
Therefore, when you see any of these conditions, and especially if it is in the third or middle part of the month, then we command that cupping be done after two or three hours of the day have passed.
And the benefit of cupping the nape of the neck is that when it is applied, it relieves the heaviness in the head and that which is felt in the eyes; but this should be done after evacuation of the whole body.
And this cupping is in the place of phlebotomy of the cephalic vein.
And it is not advisable to use it on someone with a cold constitution or who has a catarrh, for it causes great harm to such a person.
And therefore it is not advisable to use this on the elderly, and on those whose heads suffer from cold ailments.
But to one upon whom this is continually done, forgetfulness is caused; and therefore you must order the cupper to place his hand a little below the cupping area, to prevent the generation of forgetfulness.
But cupping in this place is in place of phlebotomy of the vena fusca and the basilic vein: and therefore it benefits asthma, and the constriction of the windpipe, and the tearing of the windpipe, and cough, and repletion.
And it is necessary that the cupping glass in this place be slightly elevated, for if it is placed too low, it generates weakness in the body and in the stomach.
And cupping at al-hagdahan benefits accidental pains in the head, and ophthalmia, and migraine, and suffocation, and pains in the roots of the teeth; and it is in place of phlebotomy of the basilic vein.
And you must order the cupper not to press his hand on the scarification so that he does not cut the artery and cause a flow of blood.
And cupping below the chin benefits ulcers in the mouth, and corruption of the gums, and similar diseases of the mouth, and stands in place of phlebotomy of the arteries that are in the two lips.
But cupping that is done over the two shoulder blades benefits caphalgia, which is caused by an excess of heat.
And cupping of the two inner parts of the ankles benefits in the same way as phlebotomy of three veins, that is, of the basilic, median cubital, and cephalic veins, because it draws blood from all those smaller veins that are in the flesh, and those small veins from the other larger veins until the attraction reaches the three veins.
And command the cupper that he not proceed too much in scarification, because the place is devoid of flesh, and beneath it are nerves and arteries.
And there is a cupping-glass with which one cups over the hips and it benefits the hemorrhoids of the anus and deeper ulcers.
And it is necessary that you command the cupper that it be a large cupping glass, and that it be of brass, because the place requires strong suction; and thin cupping glasses are quickly broken and should be scarified with scarification.
But cupping of the legs diminishes pain by evident depletion, for it draws blood from the whole body, and it benefits old pains of the joints and of the womb, and of the bladder; and it provokes menstruation, and benefits boils and swellings; and it stands in place of phlebotomy of the two saphenous veins, and of the two jugular veins.
However, they greatly weaken the whole body and cause fainting in many men.
And of the jugular cuppings, the benefit is similar to the benefit of cuppings of the two legs.
And the quality of the placement of the cupping glasses is that you place the cupping glass initially empty and draw by moderate suction, and do not prolong the placement of the cupping glasses, but place them lightly, and remove them carefully, so that the humors come to the place by equalizing pressure. And do not cease to iterate this and continue until you see the place redden and swell and the redness of the blood appear.
And then you scarify and repeat the suction little by little, and consider the condition of the body.
Because that man who is of tender flesh and rare pores, it is necessary that you scarify him once and no more, lest the place be ulcerated.
And command the cupper to enlarge the scarification and make it a little deeper, and moderate the suction with ease.
And if the blood is thick, then it is necessary that you scarify twice, for in the first time the way of thinning is opened to the blood and its watery part. But in the second [scarification], to the acquired scrutiny of the extraction of thick blood.
And if the blood is very foul, then let a third scarification be made so that it achieves the latter [desired effect].
Finally, when we want to extract the blood little by little or a small amount, one scarification is enough for us.
And if we want extraction of much blood, we make many scarifications; and if we know that the blood is thick, then it is necessary that we scarify with deep scarifications.
And the term "scarification" in which [it is] only the depth of the [scarification] needle.
And if the one whose skin is thick, hard, dark, and whose pores are tight, it is necessary that the places for the cupping glasses be anointed with lenitive, aperitive, and resolvent ointments; if it is in summer, such as aloe oil, or violet oil, or sweet almond oil, or poppy seed oil; and if it is in winter, then narcissus oil, or lily oil, or chamomile oil, or St. John's Wort oil, and similar ones.
And if the superfluity is thick and cold, then let the oil be amaranth oil, or balm oil, or aloe oil, or anise oil, and similar to them.
But if the patient has large pores and tender flesh, then the use of oil should be forbidden, and for such a person the places for cupping should be washed with warm water, or with cold water of nightshade, or with poppy water, or with  water of  borage, and similar to those.
And he whose blood is of excessive humidity, wash his cupping sites with sour wine, or with myrtle and sumac water, and similar to those.
And for the one whose superfluities are thick, wash his cupping sites with old wine, or with water of bugloss (or possibly, given the context, majoram), or of anise decoction, or of chamomile, and similar to those.
And the cupping should be performed before the bath; however, it should be administered about an hour or two before the bath, and the patient should sleep after the cupping.
What is it that the person to be cupped or bled ought to observe before cupping?
It is necessary to consider at the beginning: if the person to be cupped or bled is choleric and has hot blood and inflammation, then he should take cooling things, such as sour pomegranates, endive in sour wine and lettuce, and succory, and julep, and things similar to these.
And give him foods such as chicken, and the meat of domestic birds, and foods seasoned with acids, and similar things.
And for one whose complexion is cold, he should drink syrup of almonds, or syrup of succory seeds, and sumac, and very fragrant wine, a middle course between old and new; and it should be recommended to him that he use moderation in drinking and eating, and give him foods such as chicken,  hempseed,  peas, small birds, and doves.
And it is necessary that on the day of cupping and bloodletting, his drink should be greater than his food.
And it is necessary that at certain hours some men be given theriac of alpharaz, or medicines of musk, that is, nutmeg, or celandine before cupping or before bloodletting or afterward, so that the principal members may be comforted and the blood thinned; and they should not take those things heated.
But the cuppings that are without scarification should be cuppings that are placed on the liver, and on the spleen and gout, and on the navel, in the places of the knees, and the urinary bladder, because these members do not tolerate scarification upon them.
And it is not desired for those [members] except the attraction of blood from a member, just as we place a cupping glass on the breast in the illness of nasal bleeding; and we use this so that cold, invisible flatulence in the member may be dissolved, just as we place it on the belly and the navel; for this rarefies the member and warms it and diminishes the pain because it resolves flatulence.
And it is placed on boils when they occur with obstruction or swelling, for by virtue of strong attraction it quickly opens the obstruction and eradicates the swelling from its place.
And similarly it acts when it is placed on the liver and spleen because of flatulence enclosed within them.
And these cuppings are administered empty with suction only; and sometimes they are administered with fire.
And sometimes they are administered full of lukewarm water in illnesses of the spleen.
And this is so that the cupping glass is filled and is larger; that is, hot water alone or water in which herbs suitable for this purpose have been boiled.
Form of cupping administered with fire: let the width of the opening be two fingers, as we have formed it; and let the quantity of the cup be half a palm; and let it be on the side of him, in the place that is in the circumference, half of him, let the hole be small according to the quantity that a needle enters into it.
Let it be made of brass, copper, or tin, with thick edges, smooth, even, and polished so that it does not injure the limb because of its position on it.
And let there be a transverse bar of brass or iron in the middle of it, on which a candle with fire is placed.
And let this cupping glass be larger than the one we have mentioned; and the smaller one smaller than that, according to the illnesses and the age of the one who uses it.
And the cupping glasses for infants and the weak are different from the cupping glasses for youths and those with strong physiques.
And the method of placing this cupping glass with fire on the limb is to extend a wick with a decent wood fire in front of a small wax candle, and place that on the middle of the transverse bar in the middle of the cupping glass, so that the fire is lit around the lower part so that the patient's body is not burned.
And then it should be placed on the patient's limb, and the finger on the hole we have mentioned, until when we hold the cupping glasses and do not need to remove the finger and let the vapor escape through that hole, then the cupping glass is immediately dissolved/removed.
And then ignite the wick according to its nature, and repeat if you need to.
But in cupping that is administered in the illness of pleurisy, with water, in which there is no transverse bar or hole, and it is not administered except that it is filled with water, and it is placed on the limb only.
And this is its form: And this cupping glass, the larger it is, the better it is, because it can receive a greater quantity of water.
Chapter 97.
Leeches are not administered to many limbs, but only to those limbs where the placement of cupping glasses is not possible because of their small size, such as the fingers and gums and similar; or on a limb devoid of flesh, such as a finger and nose and the like.
And the quality of using those leeches is that you have found leeches that are in clean, sweet waters free of putrefaction.
Then let them be left day and night in fresh water until they are hungry, and so that no matter remains in their bellies; and then let the body be evacuated at the beginning with phlebotomy and cupping; and then rub the patient's limb until it reddens; and then let them be placed upon it.
And when they are full and fall off.
And if it is possible to suck the area with a cupping glass, it is more beneficial afterwards.
And if not, then wash the area with vinegar and then with warm water; and let it be rubbed and squeezed.
And if the flow of blood is prolonged after the application of leeches, and it oozes, then you dip a cloth in cold water, and place that on top until the oozing stops.
And if the bleeding is excessive, then sprinkle on it crushed vitriol, or gallnuts and similar styptic substances, until the bleeding stops; or place halves of roasted beans on the area, and leave them until the beans adhere to the area and the bleeding stops.
And it is necessary, if needed, to iterate the application of leeches, when it is possible to change them.
And if leeches are prevented from attaching, then rub the area with fresh blood or prick the area with a needle until blood comes out; and then apply them, for they will readily attach when they sense blood.
And when you want them to detach, sprinkle on them a little crushed aloes, or salt, or ash, and they will detach immediately.
Thus begins the prologue of the third part: On Restoration. This chapter is very often necessary in the art of medicine; and it is the restoration of fractures and accidental dislocations in the bones.
O, son, know that foolish physicians and commoners boast of this chapter, those who never looked at the books of the Ancients nor read a single letter of them.
And for this reason, the manner of the learned in our land is kept private; and I have never forgotten this at any time; and I have not added to what I learned, except by long reading of the books of the Ancients and study to understand them, until I extracted the science from them.
And I have added to it through experiment and study throughout my life.
And I have described in this chapter all that my knowledge contains and on which my experience is based; since I have abridged it for you and freed it from lengthy elaboration; and I have abridged it to the point of brevity; and I have shown it clearly; and I have illustrated it with many forms of instruments that are used in it, as is done by way of added explanation, as I have done in the two preceding chapters.
Chapter One.
Summary and collections on the subject of bone fractures, those things which are necessary to preface before we begin the discussion of broken bones and the various aspects of each. Therefore, I will say in the prologue of this chapter the main points of the discourse; and the chapters on which the craftsman must initially focus and stand firm on the truth of these things; that is, you and those who are prompt to know or learn this noble art more than others among you.
And therefore I say that when a fracture, dislocation, sprain, or fall occurs to someone, then you should begin with phlebotomy or purging, or both together, unless some cause prohibits it, such as weakness, or the person who is injured is an infant, or an elderly person in a weakened state, or it is a time of intense heat or intense cold.
And furthermore, let him be content with a diet of cool herbs and the meat of birds and rabbits; and prohibit fatty meats and filling foods and any food that fills the veins with blood, until you are sure of a good healing, and you do not fear effusion of matter into the limb.
And then return the patient to his former regimen, to which he is accustomed.
And so, as the broken bone begins to be restored, then the patient should be fed nutritious foods, rich and thick and heavy in which there is viscosity, such as foods made from wheat boiled in water, and rice, and heads [perhaps referring to specific cuts of meat], and feet, and bellies of cows, and eggs, and fresh fish, and thick wine and similar things, and with this regimen, the consolidation of the fracture is made more easily and better.
And know that broken bones, when they are in men who are in their first youth and in the elderly, cannot be rejoined and consolidated according to their nature because of the desiccation of their limbs.
However, nature fits and brings to the broken bone from every part some substance similar to glue, in which there is thickness that adheres and binds it until they are together glued and tied together, until they reach the end of strength and firmness, like fire at the beginning, until no cause prevents it from its work.
And for this reason, it is necessary that you provide the patient with foods in which there is weight, viscosity, and thickness, as we have said.
And know that the types of fracture are diverse according to the diversity of the limbs, for a fracture of the bone of the leg is different from a fracture of the bone of the head; and a fracture of the bone of the foot is different from a fracture of the bone of the arm; and similarly all the other limbs are different from one another.
And I come with a recollection of every type of fracture, explained in its own chapter distinct from the others.
Many diversities of fracture in itself. And the types of bone fracture are diversified in themselves; for there is an arcuate fracture, besides what happens in the stars; and sometimes a fracture is made according to the length of the bone: and these are the fractures of the shaft and splinters and additions proceeding and not-proceeding, as is done in the quill when it is prepared for writing, and there is a fracture with a wound and disruption in the head, and there is a small fissure fracture.
And to each type belongs its own method or torment in its restoration, as will be recalled distinctly in its proper place.
Many signs of bone fracture. And by this is a bone fracture known:  its crookedness, and the prominence and appearance of it to the touch, and that which we feel when we compress it with the hand.
And therefore, when there is no apparent crookedness in the place, nor is this felt by your touch when you touch the bone with agitation, and the patient does not find great pain, then there is no fracture here.
However, it is possible that there is a crookedness or small fissure, where it is not fitting that you move it with your hand and with complete compression; however, place upon it the medicines of which mention will be made in their proper place; and then it should be tightened by a subtle bandage.
And know that if the place is bent but not split in two, or other such thing does not happen to it except that it is bruised in some part of its entirety, then it is necessary that you begin immediately to rectify it before an abscess forms there.
And if a hot abscess forms there, then leave it for a few days until the abscess subsides; and then dress it according to whatever light and ingenious method you can.
And know that the restoration and healing of this is easier than of a bone in which a wound has occurred.
And then bind it as the subsequent instructions will indicate.
But if the bone is injured, then extension of that broken member from two parts is necessary, if it is the hand or foot; or with your hand if the member is small; or with two cords or with one cord and your hand.
And your position should be such that you place the injured limb in a bandage according to its natural shape, while the broken parts of the limb are extended; then you must, with skill and in whatever way you can, return those dislocated parts to their places.
And take care, according to your strength, that neither pain nor injury befall the patient through your operation; and you must, according to your ability, apply one bone to its fellow, according to their best alignment.
And it is necessary that at that time you skillfully touch that with your hand, and if you see anything amiss there, rectify it and correct it to the extent of your ability.
And avoid vehement extension and compression, as many foolish doctors do, who often cause a hot abscess through their operation, or cause contraction in the limb, as we have seen happen through their operations many times.
And the quality of the binding of the calmed limb is that which I recommend; so that you may know that broken limbs are diversified in their smallness and in their size and in their form.
And for those that are small, such as the arm and the finger and the forearm and similar to those, then the wrapping should be of very fine soft cloth.
But for those that are large, such as the thigh or the leg, the wrapping should be broad and firm, because a broad bandage connects the large limb and binds it on all sides with even pressure, so that no blemish enters into it.
Then begin, after your equalization, to place a bandage suitable for this, over the place of the fracture with three or four wrappings, according to what the limb requires; and tighten your hand a little with the bandage.
Then come with that to the highest part of the fracture site, and tighten less than you did with the bandage with which you bound the fracture site. Then extend the bandage from the fracture site a little, and soften the binding little by little, until you have covered a large part of the area.
Then take another bandage and wrap it again over the broken area, and then bring the wrappings to the lowest part of the fracture; and let your action in tightening the bandage and in softening it be as we have said in the first wrapping above.
Then place between the layers of the bandage linen or cloth with which the crookedness of the fracture is padded, if there is any crookedness; and if not, place nothing there.
Then place another bandage over it, and then carefully apply properly made splints over these bandages, if there is no inflammation or hot abscess in the area; and then place on it whatever draws out the abscess and reduces the inflammation; and leave that for a few days; and then you tighten the splints over it.
And let the splints be made of half a reed, smooth and skillfully shaped; or let them be of pine wood; or of palm branches; and let the width of each splint be according to this shape and this figure:
However, it is necessary that the splint that is placed over the fracture be a little thicker and smoother than the other splints, and the length of the splint should be according to the size of the limb; and then tighten the splints with another bandage according to your first tightening; and then bind over it with thread properly as we have said concerning tightening, and it should be that your tightening is greatest at the location of the fracture, and the farther it is from the fracture, the less the tightening.
And it is necessary that the threads be moderate in thickness and fineness, and be of linen; and if the threads are thick, as I have seen in the practice of some fools placing their threads of twisted rope, it is a great error, when the tightening lacks uniformity.
And similarly, very fine threads are not suitable, because you will not achieve with them what you want through tightening, and there should not be less than a finger's width between splint and splint.
And if the patient is irritated by the ends of the splints near the bandages in those places, then place under those ends some carded flax or wool until that does not cause him injury.
Sometimes a fracture is accompanied by a wound, and a disruption occurs in the bone, and I will return to this in the following chapter according to its particularities.
And know that not every broken limb is splinted on the first day; the reason is that, when the limb is large, you should not apply splints until about five or seven days, or more, according to your assessment of the risk of a hot abscess forming.
And this is the manner of the plasters with which the Ancients used to treat, which are placed on fractures, dislocations, and sprains.
A method of common plaster, a shortened treatment for fractures, suitable for many complexions and especially for women and children, because it is of a substance which neither heat nor cold overcomes: it is to take the powder of the moli, which is the pith of the flour that settles on the walls of the mill during its operation.
And prepare it in this way, except that you sieve it with egg white, and make the confection neither thick nor thin; and then use it.
Another method of plaster for treating fractures, dislocations, and sprains: take of asafoetida, of ladanum, of acacia, of elecampane, and of migrach (which is the root of wild pomegranate), of each one drachm; of myrrh and aloes, five drachms; of aloes wood, twenty drachms; all should be crushed and sieved and mixed with water of aloes wood or with egg white if the patient's complexion is hot; and then use this plaster, for it is of good composition and treats lightly broken bones, and benefits many people.
Another method of plaster which is good for fractures and sprains: take of migrach and white marshmallow root, ten drachms; of myrrh and aloes, five drachms; of acacia, six drachms; of Armenian bole, twenty drachms.
All should be crushed in a mortar with much grinding, and be sieved, and be made into a confection with water or with egg white and be administered.
A method for plastering joints and bones separated from their places, and for pain occurring in them, and for fissures and fractures: take greasy wool and submerge it in sour wine and cooked oil and place it on the area.
However, this plaster does not have restorative virtue; it rather draws out hot abscesses and expels pain.
Another method of plaster that restores a broken bone: take fresh fig leaves and wild poppy leaves; pound everything and make a plaster from them.
A method for a brief plaster administered for the restoration of a bone fracture and when you want resolution of the remaining abscess: take roots of marshmallow, of chamomile, and violet flowers, of pea flour, of each an equal part; let all be crushed and be made into a confection with wine, if the limb is not inflamed.
But if it is inflamed, then make this confection with moist coriander water or with water and use it.
Another method for a plaster stronger in resolution than the first, when a hard abscess occurs during the restoration of the limb: take roots of marshmallow and linseed, and of pomegranate, and melilot, marjoram, violet flowers, chamomile, of each an equal part; let all be crushed and be made into a confection with willow water or with fresh water or with wine, all this according to the quality of the limb and the restoration of its color.
However, Hippocrates did not say in his book that it should be placed on the broken limb during its restoration except a cerate made of wax and oil and nothing else; and he recommends that it be of medium consistency between thick and thin.
But in Wales it is seen that they are placed on the broken limb during its restoration, and the things which are drying with little heat are thus, such as myrrh, incense, and similar things to those which we have mentioned.
Method of a plaster which benefits injury and pain: take lint,  beeswax, shaved human hair or bird down, and marshmallow, and salt, in equal parts; let them be crushed and sifted and cooked, and let a plaster be made.
But the amount of time for which the bandage should remain and then be loosened is that you consider if no pain or itching has occurred and the bone is not broken or dislocated, then you do not loosen it for many days. And if vehement pain, itching, or inflammation occurs at the site, then you should carefully loosen or remove it at once, and remove the plaster from it.
And take linen cloth and a moistened sea sponge, and submerge it in lukewarm water, and with it wash the area until that itching ceases and the pain is soothed; and then let the limb rest for an hour; and then place upon it clean wool submerged in sour wine and oil or rose oil, and bind it on for a night until you are sure of a hot abscess, and that the inflammation of the limb has subsided, and its pain is relieved.
And then repeat that subtle binding and small plaster and do not tighten it with your first constriction, but refine it with that until it is healed.
And if you see that the abscess, redness, pain, inflammation, and all the symptoms have now completely subsided, and you feel a need for a plaster and binding, then you repeat it in the same way as you did at the beginning, equally.
And if none of the conditions we have mentioned occurs in the limb, then do not loosen it until after three or four or five or seven days; and sometimes all this is left for twenty days, depending on what appears to you by the loosening of the limb, as we have said, until the fracture adheres, and approaches the coagulation of the flesh upon it.
And then adjust the binding more than in your first binding, and adjust it to the thickening of the patient's flesh, as its recovery has preceded.
But if you see the site of the fracture drying out and thinning more than it should, then know that nourishment is prevented from reaching it; and therefore bathe it with lukewarm water every time you loosen it; and let this be done every three days; and loosen the binding a little, and by this operation, nourishment will flow to the limb, and it will heal easily.
But what foolish restorers of a fractured limb do, when it is not set correctly at the beginning as it should be, and is set crookedly, is an error according to their operation, and a great risk; and if it were properly done, the Ancients would have magnified this in their books and would have worked with this.
And I have not seen anyone of them do this, wherefore it is more reasonable that you should not do it.
Chapter Second: Of a fracture when it occurs in the head.
The types of fractures are many, and their forms are diverse, and the causes are distinct, for some fractures are made by a blow from a sword, and the blow crushes the entire bone into the marrow, which is beneath the bone, just as it does in the shaft of a tree; and because of this, this type is called *ascial* (axial?); or the sword cuts a part of the bone, and cuts its flesh, but the incision does not reach to the back of it; and this type of fracture is called *levatio absoluta* (complete elevation/lifting?).
And the wound of these two fractures is either large or small, and of a fracture that is comminution or attrition; and its cause is a blow with a stone or a fall on a stone, and similar things.
And this fracture is either penetrating, so that it approaches the periosteum which is beneath the bone; or it is on the surface of the bone, and the wound of these two fractures is either large or small.
And there is a fracture that is hidden in the bone, as small as the thinness of a hair, and because of this, this type is called a capillary fracture.
And there is a fracture that is made either by a fall or by a blow from a stone and the like, which causes some lamina of the bone to enter the inner parts, and is made in a concave place, just as happens to the plates of brass when a blow is struck and part of them is driven into the inner parts.
And this happens especially in the bodies of moist bones, such as the heads of infants.
And in all these types of comminuted fractures, the pieces are like separated stars. And I will bring all of this back to its place.
And we shall know all these types of fracture by detection on those and by inquiry of them with probes and removal of corrupted flesh that is upon them.
And a hairline fracture is known because it is discovered on the bone, and is wiped clean, and probed with a probe, because the fracture appears black.
But in the treatment of fractures, consider at the beginning the patient's symptoms, and then if you see by the symptoms that indicate by manifest signification danger, such as vomiting of bile, and extension [possibly referring to limb extension or spreading of the injury], and loss of consciousness, and loss of voice, and syncope, and acute fever, and rolling of the eyes and rigidity of those, and similar symptoms in the worst cases, without doubt it is not healed.
And if you see no unusual symptoms, you expect recovery, then you begin his treatment.
The reason is that if the wounded one has come to you at the beginning as wounded and this is in the winter days, then it is necessary that you study the setting of the bone before the fourteenth day, according to all circumstances.
And if it is in the summer days, then it is necessary that you take care to set the bone before the seventh day, before that which is under the bone is corrupted by the panniculus [likely referring to the soft tissue], and before the symptoms that we have recounted occur.
And if the fracture has already reached the pannicle covering the brain, and is with small and pulverized fragments, then it is necessary that you incise the comminuted and pulverized part, as I will explain to you.
And it is that you shave the head of the wounded patient, and uncover the bone according to custom and manner as much as possible according to the shape of the wound, and that it be light on the patient.
And if you encounter, during the uncovering of the bone, a flow of blood or a hot abscess, then you must oppose it with what is necessary, and that is to fill the area with cloths soaked in wine and rose oil, and let the wound rest until the abscess is settled and you are sure of the flow of blood; and then begin with the circumambulation of the bone and its removal.
And this should be done according to one of two methods of operation.
And one method is that you incise the bone with a narrow incision knife, and this is its shape:  And then use another incision knife, a little wider than that one; and this is its shape:
And then use a wider incision knife than the second.
And it is necessary that you have a number of different incision knives, some of which are wider than others; and some of them are shorter than others, and let them be sharpened at the ends, and be made of Indian iron or steel.
And use them easily in percussion on the incision to prevent you from hitting the head and injuring it.
And if the bone is strong, hard, then it is necessary that you perforate its circumference before you use the incision knives with the drills, which are called non-penetrating drills.
And they are not called thus except because these do not reach the bone of the skull to that which is near it, because the drill has a round end or edge on that which is below its sharp head, similar to an edge or a small circle, which prevents it from being submerged and passing through the thickness of the bone.
And it is convenient that you take of these drills a great number, each of which suits the thickness of each bone, so that you have present in all the parts of the skull an end which is sharp, the length and shortness being according to the amount of thickness of that part of the skull.
And this is the form of three types of drills: The method of perforating the circumference of the broken bone is to place the drill on the bone and rotate it with your fingers until you know that the bone is penetrated; then move the drill to another location, and place the space between each hole at the size of the thickness of a finger, or thereabouts.
And then incise with scalpels that which is between each hole in the bone, and make it as thin as you can, for the sake of lightness, as we have said, until you remove the bone, either with your hand, or with some other instrument which you will have prepared for this, such as small pincers and forceps.
And it is necessary that you take great care that the scalpel does not touch anything of the brain.
And so, when you have encircled the bone by perforating it, and it is separated from the brain if it is continuous with it, and you have extracted it, it is necessary that you scrape and smooth its roughness, that which is in the bone, with another instrument similar to a scalpel, but however it must be thinner and more subtle than the other scalpels.
And if some small and splintered bone fragments remain, then take them away easily with whatever instrument you have; and then treat the wound with liniments and ointments which we have mentioned.
And the other method of operation is easier, far from fear, which Galien described and praised for its great usefulness; and this is his description: it is necessary for you at the beginning that you begin to uncover the part of the bone at the place where the fracture is most vehement and most manifest, until, when you have uncovered that part and placed under it the tip of this slow and gentle scalpel of which this is the form:
And it is so that the lenticular part is broad and does not cut anything, and the sharp part is divided in two edges forward in length, like you see; so that the lenticular part is fitted to the brain, with its face, the sharp edge cutting into the bone.
And then strike the scalpel on one side with a small mallet until you cut through all the bone easily as it is revolved, and you are sure of the panniculus that no accident will occur to it in any way, and if the physician were the most foolish of all men and the most ignorant of them; certainly, and if he were sleeping.
Then if some material remains attached to the bone of the panniculus in any part of the bone, cut it away with the lenticular end of that scalpel, and remove it easily, for it is removed without harm and without fear.
And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate to the panniculus, and what is severed or removed from the bone is its surface, and roughness and small splinters remain, then you must scrape away that roughness and remove those splinters with fine rasps for which you have prepared a number, of various sizes, so that it is possible for you to use in each place those most suitable and those most appropriate according to what guides your operation on that broken bone and its form.
And you must proceed in your scraping, with which you scrape the bone, beginning with the broadest of those rasps, and then gradually use the finer ones, and do not cease doing so continuously until you come to use the finest and most subtle of all those.
But in each of the other small, hairline fractures and subtle fractures, you must administer care according to what leads you to their rectification.
And this is a matter not to be hidden from all those who have studied in that art. And I stop here on what we have shown in writing concerning large fractures.
And if the panniculus (skin and subcutaneous tissue) is retracted when you scrape the bone, then you must take linen cloth according to the size of the wound, and immerse it in rose oil, and place it over the opening of the wound; and then take another doubled or tripled cloth and immerse it in wine and rose oil and place it over the thin cloth, doing this as gently as possible, so as not to irritate the tissue; and then apply a broad bandage over it, and do not tighten it except to the extent that it holds the wound only.
And leave it with this dressing for one or two days until you are certain of a hot abscess; and then untie it and then apply medicines which counteract excessive dryness, such as flaxseed, barley flour, and powder of enses [likely a plant, possibly henbane or similar] and birthwort, and things similar to these.
And it is so that you make a powder of these medicines to be sprinkled on the wound, once they are dry; and universally, apply to it any medicine whose property is to cleanse and not to bite (or irritate).
And take care, according to your ability, that the wound in your treatment remains clean; and let there be no filth of ointment or other things in it; nor allow virulence to gather there; for when it is applied to the pannicle of the brain, it corrupts and poisons it, and thereby causes grave harm to the patient.
And it affects the brain tissue of the head, as the bone is cleaned and especially when its care is neglected, and there is blackness on its surface; and therefore, consider that if the patient suffers the accidents we have mentioned, know that it is undoubtedly pernicious.
And if the blackness is not caused by the medicine placed on it, but is by the virtue of that medicine that causes that blackness, then you should take one part honey and three parts of rose oil, and with these, moisten a cloth, and then place it on the brain; and then treat it with the appropriate healing remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 3.
Of the restoration of the nose when it is broken.
Know that the nose is not broken except in two of its most superior parts together, or one of them sometimes, because it has two bones, for the lower part is cartilaginous, and it is not broken and it does not suffer from it except attrition and crookedness and sinuosity.
But if one of the two parts of it is broken, then you should insert your little finger into their nose, and that you should align that fracture inside with your index finger, and with the thumb outside, until the nose returns to its natural shape. And let this be done by you with ease, and beware that you do not cause pain to the patient by your operation.
And if the fracture is in the uppermost part of the nose, and the finger does not reach it, then it should be set with the end of a small, thin rod.
And if the fracture is in two parts, then you do likewise.
And strive to restore it on the first day of the fracture, if possible; and if not, then approximately on the seventh or tenth day you should treat the resulting abscess with cautery.
Then insert into the end of the nose a small roll of linen cloth, if the fracture is in one part, or place two small wedges, if the fracture is in two parts; and let the wedge be of such a size as to fill the opening of the nose.
And I say that some of the ancient restorers [surgeons]  advised that the wedges be dipped in a broth and changed daily, but I have not found this to be effective; rather, it is necessary that the roll [of linen] be dipped in egg white mixed with powdered millstone [or finely ground stone]; and then leave the wedge in place until the bone is set and the cartilage has hardened.
And sometimes, instead of a wedge, a goose feather, wrapped in linen cloth, may be inserted into the nose; and this is especially useful if the nasal fracture is severe and the patient is not prevented from breathing.
And this method is not necessary for you; and if you wish, do this [use the feather], and if you wish, do the other [use wedges].
And if, on another occasion, a hot abscess occurs,  dress the nose with cerate [a medicated ointment] or with cotton soaked in sour wine and rose oil, or with diachylon [a lead-based plaster].
But if a hot abscess does not occur, then you should dress it externally with sesame flour and powdered lentils mixed with egg white; and then place linen cloth over it, and do not bind the nose with anything.
But if the nasal bones are broken with a small fracture or are comminuted [shattered], then you must incise over them and extract them with instruments suitable for this; and then close the incision and treat it with things that promote granulation and consolidation, and with suitable plasters for this.
And if a wound occurs inside the nose, then you must treat it with wedges and administer lead canulae until it is completely healed.
Chapter 4.
Concerning the restoration of the jaw when it is fractured.
When the lower jaw is broken and the fracture is not accompanied by a wound, observe then if the fracture is only external, and is not broken in two and is bent inwards at the broken parts, then its diagnosis is easy.
And it is necessary, therefore, if the fracture is on the right side, that you insert your left index finger into the patient's mouth; and similarly if the fracture is on the left mandible, then insert the index finger of the right hand; and push with that the convexity of the fracture inwards, easily aligning the broken parts, with your other hand on the outside of the bone; thus decently equalizing it.
And if the fracture of the mandible is already separated into two, then it is necessary that you administer extension from two parts according to the straightness until its equalization is possible.
And if there is concussion of teeth with disruption, then bind those which you hope will remain with gold or silver wire or silk; and then place over the broken jaw a cerate, and then place over it a doubled cloth, and place on the cloth a suitably made large compress, or a piece of linen equal to the length of the mandible; and then bind that above according to how the bandage is prepared for you and as the application requires, until it is healed.
And instruct the patient to use rest and quiet, and give him food of sorbitive lions. (This likely means "easily digestible foods").
And if you estimate that the shape is already altered in some way, then you should observe and unbind it on the third day; and then rectify what is already altered and apply a plaster with fine powder, with egg white, or with bean flour, after you have removed the cerate, and place wool over the plaster.
And then, when this plaster is attached and fitted to it, and the position of the bone is not altered, leave it; do not unbind it until it is healed and holds the fracture; for many times this fracture is healed in three weeks.
And if another time a hot abscess occurs, then administer what we have said many times in its sedation until it is healed, and let that abscess be softened/matured.
And if the fracture is with a wound, then consider if a piece of the bone is separated or splintered; then you should carefully remove those splinters with what is appropriate for removing them from the wound.
And if the opening of the wound is narrow, then you should widen it with a fleam, according to your need.
And then, when you have removed those splinters, and nothing remains of them, then you should sew up the opening of the wound if it is wide; and if not, place on it one of the plasters that is suitable for it and that will help it to heal, until it is healed.
Chapter 5.
On the restoration of the clavicle when it is broken.
Often the clavicle is broken in the front part, below the muscle, and this fracture occurs in one of three ways.
Because it is either broken, or separated, or separated into two parts without splinters; and it is easy to restore it; or it is so that splinters are present, and it is difficult to restore it; or it is so that the fracture is accompanied by a wound.
And the operation in this case, when the fracture is without a wound, is that you have two assistants present, so that one holds and aligns the broken clavicle, and the other extends the neck towards that side.
And then bind the fracture with your bandages until its shape is properly restored, and there is neither a small prominence nor a concavity.
And if you need more extension, then you should place under the patient's armpit a pad of cloth or wool, its size according to your needs; and extend and elevate the clavicle and compress the pad with your hand until you bind the fracture as needed.
And if you cannot pull the end of the clavicle to the outer parts because it is stuck to the sternum, then the patient should be supine on his neck, and you should place a moderately sized cushion on his muscle.
And the assistant presses the muscle downwards until the bone of the clavicle that is on the sternum above is elevated, and then you straighten the fracture and bind it with your bandages.
But if you feel splinters of the clavicle and they are bad, then you should incise over it and extract those splinters easily.
And if it is retained in the bone, then you carefully make an incision with one of the scalpels that you have prepared for this, after you have placed under the clavicle the instrument that serves the purpose; and this instrument is of wood or iron, of which this is its form:
And it is similar to a spoon, of which this is the concavity; and let its width be according to your need, according to the size of the bone or the smallness of it.
But its length should be as long as is possible for you in the operation; let it have two ends like this, and one end should be wide and the other narrow.
And if the disruption of the wound which you have incised when you extracted the splinter from the bone is wide, and there is a risk of a hot abscess, then you should join the two edges of the wound with suture.
And if the disruption is small, or you fear a hot abscess, then you should fill the wound with cloths and powders according to the size of the wound's incision.
And if a hot abscess occurs, then dip a cloth in sour wine and rose oil and wine, and place it on that.
And ensure that the splint is not loosened from the broken bone; and for that it is necessary that you see the patient every day, so that when the bandage is loosened or you see the splint is already displaced, then you rectify this and tighten the bandage.
And then place the patient's pillow under their neck, and place a small cushion under their heel at night; so that with this the limb is elevated from the bed, and thus the fracture of the clavicle is elevated from the muscle; or let their arm be tied to their neck.
And do not untie the bandage unless a boil or abscess occurs at the site, until twelve days have passed.
And then renew the plaster if you see the need, and adjust the constriction, and restore it and leave it until it is restored and the fracture of the clavicle is consolidated.
And it is strengthened and healed, according to the case, in twenty-eight days, and sometimes in some men it is done in less time than that.
Chapter 6.
Concerning the restoration of a shoulder fracture.
The shoulder blade is broken on its lateral side, and not shattered, only the edges are broken.
And so when the place is broken—and it is broken in the middle of the place—and is not known except by touch, then, according to what the shape of the fracture is, force the preparation of it and reduce it according to its natural shape in every way possible to you.
Then place on the area powdered finely ground albumen with lion's wool; and then place a poultice of doubled cloth; and then place over it a smooth, thin linen bandage, according to the size of the whole shoulder blade or a little more.
But if the bandage shows a concavity in any place on the shoulder blade, then you fill that concavity with lion's wool, and then apply the bandage evenly.
Then bind over it with a long bandage with decent tightness and firmness of the bandage until it is not moved from its place.
And examine the bandage each day; and every time that it is loosened, bind it again and tighten it, and straighten the bandage if it is moved from its place.
And let the patient lie on his healthy side.
And the shoulder blade is restored in 20 or 25 days.
And so when this number is complete, then you unbind the bandage, and you should know for sure that this is from the bones of which the beginning is not feared nor their dissolution.
And if it proceeds from the location of the collarbone and extends under the armpit, then you make an incision over it, and remove it, and proceed as we have said in the treatment of a fracture of the clavicle or of a hot abscess if that occurs there.
Chapter 7.
On the restoration of a fractured foot.
The foot is sometimes broken in the middle, and this heals slowly; but its extremities heal much faster, as they are scarred and comminuted.
And among its accidents, when the middle of the foot is broken, it inclines inward, causing great pain, difficulty in breathing, coughing, and strong fever and vomiting of blood; and it is evident in the cavity of the broken bone and is not hidden from feeling.
And its restoration is that the patient should be supine on his back, and a cushion placed between his shoulders; and then press on his muscles, and adjust the broken bones with hands from both sides, and be skillful in the operation and in the setting, in every way that is possible and appropriate, until the bone returns to its proper shape.
Then place over it a plaster and lint, and over that a splint of thin willow or alder wood, or similar light materials, after you wrap it in cloth; and be careful in binding it over the broken bone so that it is not loose; and use a circular bandage around the dorsum sometimes, and tighten it with a decent constriction; and then check the bandage frequently, and tighten it when it becomes loose.
And if necessity demands loosening it because of corrosion or itching, or pain, or an abscess that occurs in the area, then you should examine and unbind it, remove the plaster, and correct what has occurred by means of its appropriate treatment; and then reapply the plaster, if it seems appropriate; and adjust the binding until it is healed.
Chapter 8.
On the restoration of ribs when they are broken.
Know that a fracture of the ribs only happens in the thicker parts, where there are two; and in their extremities at the front part, this crushing does not occur, because they are cartilaginous. And knowledge of it is not hidden from sensation through its examination with the fingers.
And the restoration should be thus: equalize the fracture with the fingers as much as possible, until it is aligned as needed, and then plaster and bind the broken bone with a bandage, if that is needed.
And if the fracture of the ribs is towards the inner parts, then the patient experiences vehement pain and a stabbing sensation, like the stabbing pain that occurs in pleurisy, because the bone pierces the membrane; and he experiences difficulty breathing, coughing, and vomiting much blood; and this is difficult to cure.
And the Ancients were ingenious in that with many inventions.
And of them it is said: it is necessary that you give the patient foods that produce inflation and flatulence, so that the belly is inflated and extended, and the fracture is pushed outwards.
But we should avoid this so that it does not easily cause a hot abscess if it does not already exist; and if it already exists, then it already helps that.
And some of them say that a cupping glass should be placed on top and that it should draw with force; and this seems reasonable, but nevertheless it is feared that the cupping glass will attract superfluities to the place because of the weakness.
And some of them say: the place should be covered with wool that has been immersed in hot oil, and powders should be placed between the ribs until it is filled, so that the bandage is even as it enwraps that roundness; and then the patient should be treated with a treatment for pleurisy of food and medicine.
And if a violent cause constricts the patient, which is unbearable, and the bone pierces the skin with a painful puncture,  we fear for the patient, then it is necessary that we make an incision over the place, uncover the broken rib, and then place over it an instrument that preserves the *ciphac* (a word I cannot define with certainty - it might refer to a specific surgical tool or anatomical feature), the remembrance of which is previously mentioned, and that we incise the bone easily, and extract it.
And then we should join the two lips of the wound, if it is large, with sutures, and treat it with plasters until it is healed.
And if an internal abscess occurs, then you should take and infuse powders in rose oil and place it on the area, and the patient should be treated with what is appropriate for the internal abscess.
And let him lie supine on the side on which he sleeps, until he is healed.
Chapter 9.
Concerning the restoration of a fracture of the spine and neck.
Sometimes a fracture occurs in the bones of the neck, and it is slow to heal, and similarly in the vertebrae of the back. And when this happens to someone and you want to know if they will be healed or not, then consider: for if you see their hands already softened and numb and dead, and he cannot move them, nor extend nor flex them, and when you constrict them with your fingers or prick them with a needle and he feels no pain in them, then know that he is not healed, and in most dispositions, it is mortal.
And if he moves them and feels constriction in them with the fingers and puncture, then know that the marrow of the bone is safe and that the patient will recover with treatment.
And if he has something similar in the vertebrae of the neck and you want to know if he will heal or not, then consider his feet.
Then if you see that they are already softened, the same thing has happened to them as happened in the hands, and when he lies on his back, he has flatulence and bowel movements without his will, and sometimes he lies on his back and wants to urinate and cannot, then know that it is mortal, and then do not labor in his cure.
But if none of those things happen, the cause is better and lighter.
And the cure for him is that you should apply to the maturation of the hot abscess, that you place on the affected vertebra,  pure rose oil, or with boiled egg yolks;  apply some of this several times a day until the hot abscess is matured.
And then apply one of the comforting and drawing plasters, and bind it tightly; and command the patient to use rest and tranquility and that he not sleep on the side where he finds pain until he is healed.
And if it happens because of the attrition of the bone, a splinter, or some cause that is already separated from it, then you must dry the wound and remove that bone; and then bring together the two edges of the wound, with sutures if it is large; and then treat it with some incarnative ointment until it is healed.
But if the lower part of the hip bone is broken, and it is the end of the hip joint, then you must insert the index finger of your left hand into the rectum, and reduce the broken bone with your other hand as much as possible by counter-traction; and then apply a plaster and bandage, if you need them, and then bind it tightly.
And if you feel splinters broken in it, then you should probe for them, and remove them, and treat the wound with the treatment previously described until it is healed.
Chapter 10.
Concerning the restoration of the hip.
Hip bones are rarely broken, and if they are broken, then the fracture is only a separation at the ends of those bones and is lengthwise, and inclined towards the inner parts; and the patient experiences pain and numbness in the area, and the leg is numb when it is fractured.
And the restoration of it is that you extend your hand over it until it is over the fracture, which is its shape.
And if the fracture is only at its extremity, then you bind that according to what is prepared for you by equal binding until it is similar to its natural shape.
But if the fracture is lengthwise or it inclines towards the lower parts, then you make the patient lie on their stomach so that the restoration of that fracture is prepared for you. And then, when you have bandaged it, place a plaster over it, and then place a splint of wood or reed over that, and tighten it with a bandage over which you do not fear a puncture of the fracture or movement of the splint.
And bind the concave part with something that fills it until it receives the bandage equally, and command the patient to sleep on their back or on their healthy side.
But if a hot abscess occurs, then you cease the extension of it and its restoration until the hot abscess is sedated, and place on it that which sedates it as is preceded; and then return to its restoration, and bind it as is necessary.
And if it happens in the bones that they are pierced or comminuted, then you extract them.
Chapter 11.
Concerning the restoration of a fracture of the collarbone.
The collarbone is that which is between the neck and the head of the shoulder.
And if it is broken, then its restoration is in one of two ways, of which one is that you take a wooden splint of moderate thickness according to this form:
And let two bandages be tied at its two extremities, and then let it be suspended from an elevated position.
And seat the patient on a stool; and then place his broken arm upon the splint until it reaches his little finger, in the middle of which the curve of the splint should be placed.
And then suspend some heavy weight from it, or let the assistant extend it downwards; and then let the physician set the fracture with his hands, until the fracture returns as it should.
And the other method is that the patient lies supine on his back and suspends his hand from his neck with a bandage; and then order two assistants, that one of them hold what is above the fracture with his hands; and the other hold the lower part; and each of them extend to their part.
And if you want the extension to be stronger, then you tighten above the fracture with a bandage and above that with another bandage, and each of the two assistants extend to their two parts.
And so if the fracture is close to the end of the muscle, then it is necessary that half of the bandage be placed on the little finger and the other below the fracture towards the elbow.
And similarly, if the fracture is close to the elbow, then it is necessary that the bandage be placed on that place and on that elbow.
Swallow it easily and without effort, and then, when it has been swallowed as it should be and is applied by good application, tighten it unless a hot abscess occurs.
But if a hot abscess occurs, then leave the constriction until the seventh day, and place on it soiled wool soaked in sour wine and rose oil until the abscess subsides, and then you tighten it.
And the way to tighten it is to place a plaster on the fracture, and then place a bandage of new cloth over the plaster; and then adjust the arm on that support, and place your open hand on the muscle.
And place the cloth and tighten the arm on the support so that the arm is in a fixed position, unless some cause of the broken bone prohibits this.
And then use splints.
And it is necessary to place on the fracture that splint which is wider and stronger than the other splints; and place between each splint the width of a finger, and let the length of the splints follow the fracture with the addition of three fingers on each side.
And then tighten the splints with the bandage which I mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
And it is necessary that your bandage over the fracture site be tighter. And the longer the fracture, the less tight the bandage should be.
And so if you see the placement of the splints and the bandage as we have said at the time when you restore the limb to its proper position, then you have done it correctly.
And if you fear a purulent abscess, then you leave the bandage and splints in place until the seventh day, as we have said.
And then observe the bandage in all parts for three days so that neither itching nor inflammation occurs at the site; or it is forbidden for food to reach the limb because of the tightness of the bandage; and therefore rectify all this according to what we have said.
But if you are confident that none of this will happen, then do not untie the bandage until three days or more.
And let the patient's sleeping position be on their back, and their hands should be on their stomach.
And place on the splint a poultice full of wool, carefully, and check every hour of the night and day that the broken limb is not loosened or dissolved, or that the bandage is not softened; therefore, rectify all this with your skill.
And give the patient food according to the order which we have previously mentioned, so that the food is light at the beginning until the tightening begins; and then it is necessary to thicken his food.
Because it is customary for the splint and his leg to be bound for forty days; and then it is necessary that they be unbound and a bath be administered and it be medicated with ointments which rectify that.
And if the fracture is widely comminuted, then you should not unbind the bandage and splints until 10 days or until two months.
Chapter 12.
Concerning the restoration of a fracture of the arm.
The arm is composed of two bones which are called two focils; of which one is small, and it is that which is next to the little finger, and the other is large and it is that which is placed below the little finger, on the lower side.
And very easily the larger focil is broken alone, or the smaller, and very easily they are broken together.
And when the small focil is broken above, then its restoration is easy, and its healing is easier.
And when the focil is broken below, the fracture is bad, and its healing is difficult.
And worse than that is when both bones are broken together.
Therefore, if the bone that is broken is the small focil above, then it is convenient for the physician, before its restoration, that he apply slight extension easily until it is aligned.
But if the large focil is what is broken, then it is necessary to apply more forceful extension.
And if both focils are broken together, then you must apply the extension much more strongly.
And it is necessary that you place your hand during its restoration and its extension stretched out on a cushion, and the thumb of your hand should be on the upper parts, higher than all the other fingers, and the little finger lower than the other fingers, and the patient should be lying on a square-shaped pillow.
And let there be a cushion in front of him at his height or level, so that the patient does not suffer any strain.
Then let the assistant extend the arm from the lower part with his hand or with a bandage, and another assistant extend it from above similarly.
And then the physician should set the bone until he reduces it to the best position he can.
And if the bone fracture is complicated, then you must forcefully reduce all the pieces to their place with your skill.
And if a separated complication appears in him, that the bone protrudes and there is no hope in its restoration, then you should operate on him and remove it according to the method which we have described above.
But if the fracture is accompanied by a wound, I have already dedicated a special chapter to that, and therefore take care of it accordingly.
And if an abscess occurs at the beginning of your treatment, then you should apply a cloth with a plaster made of rose oil and white wax, of a consistency midway between thick and thin, and bind the cloth tightly over it until the abscess subsides; and then remove the plaster and apply a poultice prepared from powdered barley flour with egg white, and then apply a compress; and the compress which is placed over the fracture should be thicker and stronger.
And know that the number of compresses for the arm depends on the severity of the situation, whether the fracture is in one bone or in two bones together.
Then apply your bandage over the fracture site firmly and tightly, and if the bandage is applied to the parts above the fracture or to the parts below it, apply the bandage a little more loosely, as was explained previously at the beginning of this chapter.
And the cloths that are wrapped around the fracture should be soft and moist, not hard or rough, and the thread with which it is bound should be of a moderate thickness, neither too fine nor too coarse, as we have previously recommended.
And examine the limb and its binding after a few days. And if any complication arises that requires correction, such as itching which may occur in the limb, then you should bathe the limb with warm water until the itching subsides.
And leave the limb unconstrained until it rests, and then reapply the bandage.
And if the fracture is now softened and the bone is reset and similar to the others, then correct everything with your skill.
And consider further if nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb by an excessively tight bandage, for then you must loosen it a little and leave it thus for a few days until nourishment flows to it, and then tighten it again.
But if the patient suffers from none of the conditions we have mentioned, then the bandage should not be loosened for about twenty days or thereabouts.
Then let the patient's hand be suspended by its own agitated movement, and make him sleep on his back.
And know that this fracture is healed in thirty days or in thirty-two days, or very quickly in twenty-eight days, and all this depends on the constitution and the disposition of the vital force/healing power.
Chapter 13.
On the restoration of a fracture of the wrist and fingers.
Know that fractures rarely occur in the wrist and finger joints; instead, what often happens is attrition (wear and tear).
And when a fracture or attrition occurs in the hand, then the patient should lie down, and a cushion should be placed beneath him, keeping it level, and then place his hand on that [cushion] extended [outward].
Then let the assistant extend the broken bones, and the physician should align them until they are joined with a good connection.
Then it is necessary to apply a plaster and lint, unless a hot abscess occurs; then apply a bandage over it according to the size of the area, and wrap it in linen cloth.
But if the fracture is in the inner parts of the palm of the hand, then make a kind of ball of cloth, and instruct the patient to grasp it with his fractured hand; then it should be bound tightly with a long cloth.
And let the bandage be of leather with cloth in which it is softened, so that the leather may be applied to the palm; and bind it as is necessary.
But if the fracture is on the outer parts, then it is necessary that you place a bandage above and another below on the palm, so that the hand is open and straight; and then apply the splint, in such a way that the hand is bound to the splint between the fingers with bandages.
And if a fracture occurs in one of the knuckles of the fingers, then if it is the thumb, it should be straightened as necessary and then bound to the palm; and if you wish, apply a small, straight splint so that the fracture is elevated and not moved.
But if the fracture is in the other fingers, such as in the middle finger, or in the index finger, or in the ring finger, or in the little finger, then it should be straightened and bound to the finger next to it; or all should be bound together consecutively, which is better; or place a small splint on it, as we have said for the thumb.
And consider, in your restoration, and next to it, the disposition of hot abscesses and oppose — with your operation — what is necessary when any of those things occur, according to the repeated narration of them.
Chapter 14.
Concerning the restoration of a fracture of the thigh bone.
The thigh bone is often broken and this is revealed by the sensation as it is displaced forwards and upwards.
And its restoration is done in this way: a ligature is tightened above the fracture and another ligature below the fracture, and the patient is laid prostrate on their stomach and face.
Then the assistant extends all the ligatures to their proper place according to the nature of the fracture, when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
But if it is close to the hip joint, then the ligature should be close to the knee at the hamstring area, so that the extension pulls upwards, and the other ligature below the fracture.
And similarly, if the fracture is close to the knee, then the ligature should be placed close to the knee, and the extension applied to the parts below.
Then the physician joins the bone with both his hands until he reduces it to its natural form and the bone is joined by a good conjunction; then it is necessary to apply a plaster and bandage, unless an abscess occurs in the limb. But if an abscess occurs there, then you leave it for a few days until the heat of the abscess subsides, and then return to your treatment.
The bandage should be made like this:  You should wrap a firm bandage around the fracture, and fold it two or three times, removing any excess; and then wrap the leg until it reaches the ankle and the hip joint.
And insert a long strip of cloth between the thigh and the leg near the knee on the lower parts, and let the ends of the strip come from the upper part of both sides, and then wrap around the leg and thigh what is superfluous of the bandage.
And then place splints on the thigh at the site of the fracture, and place one splint on the bone of the leg.
And then fill the spaces between the leg and thigh with soft cloths, so that the bandage is firm.
And then begin with a tight bandage in the middle over the fracture site with three or four turns, and the farther you move away from the fracture site, the looser, lighter, and softer your bandage should be.
And then extend the two ends of the cloth to the lower parts until they reach the ankle, and tie both ends of the splints on the other side so that the bandage does not shift from its place.
And then leave the bandage on it, provided that it does not cause the limb to become corroded, or develop a hot abscess, or swelling, or anything similar; and if any of these things happen, then immediately loosen it, and rectify whatever has happened as soon as possible, according to what we have said many times.
But if there is a piece of bone in the bone which protrudes, then you must reposition it as best you can; and if not,  cover it and leave it, and treat it with what has been previously mentioned until it is healed.
And sometimes this fracture of the thigh is tightened in addition to the splints being applied, just as we have said in the treatment of the arm.
But however, in the restoration made in this way, lameness does not befall the patient; and if it is restored alone, without the other leg being supported, then it is necessary that he will limp constantly.
And know that the thigh is bound for forty days, or a little more or a little less, and all this depends on the diversity of complexions and other dispositions (of the patient).
Chapter 15.
Concerning the restoration of a fracture of the kneecap.
Know that a fracture of the kneecap heals slowly, but attrition often happens to it.
But if a fracture occurs, then it is only a fissure or hole in its parts, and this is with or without a wound, and everything about this has been examined. (or "...and this is with or without a wound, and this is all determined by examination.")
And its restoration is such that what is broken of its parts is aligned with the said [bones/parts] until it is joined and conjoined as much as possible by equalization, ease, and fabrication. (The "fabrication" likely refers to setting and splinting/bandaging.)
Then apply a plaster and place a round splint over it, if you need one; and bind it above with a suitable bandage.
And then consider all the provisions that we have recommended in other fractures, such as a hot poultice and similar things, so that all accidents are countered with what is suitable for it until it is healed.
Chapter 16.
Of the restoration of a leg fracture.
Know that in the leg there are two bones, of which one is large and is called by the name of tibia (shinbone); and the other is slender and is called fibula.
And the same types of fractures occur to these two bones of the leg as occur to the two bones of the arm, and therefore its restoration is done in the same way as the restoration of the arm, and the operation is the same.
And if the two bones are broken together, the leg is deformed in all parts.
And if the more slender bone is broken, the leg is deformed in the front parts.
And if the larger bone is broken, you will find it below, and it is among those things that are not easily healed.
Then administer extension, equalization, and bandaging of the splints according to that same method.
However, if the leg fracture is extensive, having many splinters, the extension should be less and gentler, and alleviate it with your skill.
And in a leg injury, the procedure is similar to that of the arm. When you align the splints and complete your operation, you will take pieces of pine wood which are placed under the parts that are placed on the soles, and they are made of palm branches; choose those of small thickness, not the small ones, and let their length be according to the length of the leg, from the knee to the very bottom.
Then wrap each one in two cloths, according to its length, and place one on one side of the leg and the other on the other side, extending from the knee to the lowest part of the foot.
Then tie the two splints in three places: at the two ends and in the middle.  For with this structure the leg is prevented from bending to the right or left, and it remains in a good position.
And now a small wooden splint, according to the length of the leg, has been prepared; and let the leg be placed on it so that it preserves it from movement.
And especially it is necessary that you do this in a fracture, and when there is a wound along with it.
Then examine the leg each day and study it carefully, and watch for abscesses, inflammation, or other similar problems; and if any of these occur, then attend to it with whatever is necessary until it is healed.
Chapter 17.
Of the fracture of the talus and of the bones of the foot and toes.
A fracture of the entire talus does not often occur; but fractures of the bones of the foot do sometimes occur; and fractures of the toes occur rarely, and they suffer more from attrition in cases of improper positioning.
And if a fracture occurs in the bones of the foot and these bones are raised up between themselves, then the patient should place their foot on the ground prepared as before.
Then place one foot on top of the elevated bones, and then tread down on them, pressing and pushing them until they return to their proper places.
Then apply a plaster and lint on top, and place a small board under the sole of the foot, to which two pads are attached.
Then bind that tightly to the foot with a descending bandage, after you have wrapped it with cloths and other necessary materials.
And when three or four days have passed, then untie the bandage, for you will find the bones set, whether they were broken or dislocated, and the operation in these cases is as you know.
But if some say they are broken, then restore them and set them as I have recounted to you in the restoration of the fingers of the hand. Then apply a splint to the broken finger according to its length, and let it be a little longer; and place under the foot that board which I have described to you, and bind it with a suitable bandage.
But if what is broken of the bones is two or three or more, then you place on each finger a splint of its size wrapped in lion cloth, and tighten the board at the base of the foot, and let it rest on one of the ends of the board above the belly of the foot so that it holds it with good retention.
And it is convenient for you that you not forget to consider all the things which I have told you in the other fractures of the accidents that we have mentioned; and oppose yourself to every accident with what is suitable.
Chapter 18.
Of the fracture of the woman's hip and of the pubic bone and of the man's penis.
When the hip of the woman is broken, then make her lie in a low lying position, and gently incline her to one side, and let her be held from behind.
And then the midwife fills the hip with cotton, and it should be made into a ball in her hip; and then the woman should be held, and her hip raised little by little, for all this is useless until the broken part of the hip is in the shape of a ball and the broken bone is returned [to its place].
And then place powders on her back, and when she wants to urinate, remove the cotton easily and then she urinates, and reduce and return it according to the manner in which you set it at the beginning, and then return to the first powdering.
And do this for seven days or thereabouts, for then it is restored.
And if you wish, take a sheep's bladder and attach a reed tube to its opening; and introduce the whole bladder into her hip, and then blow into the tube forcefully until the bladder is inflated inside the hip, for this will return the fracture [to its proper place].
And then let it be filled with cotton and remain so for several days as we have recounted, until it is healed.
And when the bone of the pubis of a man or woman is broken, then administer for its restoration and healing that which we have recounted for the hip bone.
And that which is right is not hidden in these proximate fractures which happen infrequently, especially to one who studies and uses and understands this my book well; for that fracture signifies to you in the greatest dispositions the right way in its restoration and in its binding, and therefore understand well.
But in the penis of a man, when it is broken, take a hen's gizzard, and place the penis in it; and then place a cloth bandage over it, and let it be wrapped, and then let it remain for three days or thereabouts, and it will be healed.
Chapter 19.
Of the restoration of bone fractures when accompanied by a wound.
It is convenient for one who suffers a fracture with a wound, and especially if the bone is large, such as the thigh bone or the humerus, or similar to those, that you take care and bleed him immediately if the conditions for phlebotomy testify to you as we have said above.
And if the wound flows with blood, then it is necessary that you attend to its retention so that you sprinkle crushed egg yolk on it, if no other cause is present to you.
And then begin to restore the fracture on that same day, and do not prolong this, unless an abscess occurs.
But if a hot abscess occurs, then you leave its restoration until the ninth day, until the abscess has subsided, and do not approach it on the third and fourth days at all, for you will cause bad accidents.
But if the broken bone is prominent above the skin uncovered, then it is necessary that you carefully reduce it and align it with your hands easily and with little extension.
But if extension is not prepared for you and the alignment of it with your hands, then you reduce it with your hands with this instrument; and this instrument is made of iron, whose length is seven or eight fingers and whose width is according to the size of the wound; and for this, it is necessary for the physician to take three or four of these, according to the amount needed for this in the treatment of every type of fracture.
And let it be round, and let it be of little thickness so that it is not bent by the compression on it during the operation.
And let it have a sharp point with a margin at its ends; and let the upper part of it be of increasing thickness, and from the middle of it to the ends.
And this is its form:
And it is named in Greek "labre volentz atelarem," that is, a small spatula.
Therefore it is necessary that its sharp end be placed raised above the end of the prominent bone.
And push that in at once until the bone returns, and it is held with some bandage.
And then strive to bind the ends of the fracture together, and if the broken end of the bone is thin, and does not receive the instrument well, then it is necessary that you incise the end of that bone until the instrument can grasp it.
But if you cannot reduce the bone completely with what we have recounted, then incise it with whatever is appropriate from the incisors which we have mentioned; or saw it with one of the saws in whatever way is possible for you.
And then scrape away what remains on the bone of roughness and small splinters.
And when the bone is reduced, and after the reduction the patient finds vehement pain remaining, then know that the bone is not returned to its natural place; and then do this because you will confer great benefit to the patient.
When your restoration of the bone is completed, then submerge a cloth in black styptic wine, especially if it is summer, and do not place on the wound a cerate or other substance containing oil, so that it does not cause putrefaction and corruption there.
And then administer stitches at the time of your completion of the bone's restoration, and leave the wound uncovered so that you incise the opening with scissors and use bandages according to the size of the wound.
And guard yourself with all caution that you do not constrict the wound with the fracture, for many times foolish physicians have done this, and caused death or a corrosive or festering illness, that is, gangrene, upon their patients. And if your constriction is light, soften it, different from the constriction of other fractures.
And if the wound is large or a bad wound, and you fear some bad accident among those we have recounted, and you find pain in the area, then it is not fitting that you place stitches there, but apply a bandage of hard cloths instead of stitches and bind it with those.
And when after a day or two the wound begins to generate pus, then you remove the cloth which you had placed over it with wine, and then administer balms, ointments with which it is our custom to treat wounds, such as tetrafarmacon ointment and similar ones.
And it behooves you to untie the bandage and examine the wound each day, morning and evening, until it is consolidated and closed, and it is necessary that the limb be positioned in such a way that the pus flows down from it to the lower parts with ease.
If many days pass and the wound is not consolidated nor is the pus removed from it, then know that here are the beginnings of little worms, for which it is necessary to probe the wound with a probe. And of those beginnings, those that are separated, remove and extract them; those that are not separated and cause pain in the limb, force yourself to cut them, as far as it is possible for you.
And if there occurs in the wound a swelling or ulceration—that is, an abscess—or another kind of corruption and putrefaction, then it is necessary that you treat each of these with what is appropriate to it from the cures of which the narration precedes in its chapter.
And this is what my discourse should dwell upon, and you should attend to this matter: when a large bone is broken,  bleed above the limb, just as with the bone of the thigh and similar large limb bones, and do not attempt traction or extraction from it, for in many instances death results from this; rather, leave it until it festers, for it will soon fall away by itself in about twenty or thirty days; and then treat the wound if it seems appropriate to you, but if not, leave it be.
Chapter 20.
Chapter 20: On the treatment of swelling that occurs at the site of a fracture.
Often this swelling occurs at the site of healing of a fracture, especially if it is near the joints, and the shape of the limb is distorted by it; and it quickly prevents the limb from its natural function.
Then consider if the swelling is recent and administer medicines that have astringent properties, such as aloe, incense, myrrh, cerussa (white lead), and similar substances; so that you take some or all of these, and mix them with astringent wine, or with egg white, or with sour wine, and apply this to the swelling on a cloth, and bind it firmly in place.
And leave the bandage tight; do not loosen it for many days; and then loosen it and reapply another, until the swelling is reduced; or apply a lead plate over it gently, for lead has the property of reducing anything swollen in the limbs.
But if the swelling has already hardened and become constricted, and necessity requires its removal carefully, then incise it in its most superior part, and incise the superfluous and prominent part, or scrape it with a sharp instrument until it is reduced; and treat the wound until it is healed.
Chapter 21.
Chapter 21. Of the restoration of a fracture when it is set, and the limb remains thin and weak, not according to its natural state.
When a bone fracture is set, and afterwards the limb remains thin and weak, this is caused by many things: one of which is the multitude of solutions of the ligaments, and its binding not as it should be; or by excessive tightening of the bandages, such that nourishment is prevented from flowing to the limb; or by excessive and superfluous embrocation; or by excessive movement not at the proper time; or by a lack of blood in the patient's body and their weakness.
And the cure for this is to give the patient nourishing food and make his heart cheerful so that his blood is multiplied; and administer baths; and instill joy and gladness into him.
And then apply a plaster to the limb, so that the plaster draws much nourishment to it, or continue embrocation with warm water, until nourishment flows and the limb returns to its natural form.
Chapter 22.
Chapter 22. Of the treatment of fractured bones when they are set crookedly and the proper operation is prevented.
When, after a limb has been set, there is a crookedness and swelling at the fractured bone and a deformity of the limb's shape, but the limb is not prevented from its natural function, then you should not accept the opinion of someone who claims that limb is newly fractured.
But there have been many foolish physicians and bone-setters who have done this in our land; and this operation is very blameworthy, leading to great fear, whose sign is death.
But if the lameness and swelling are recent, then they should be bathed in lukewarm water in which softening herbs are boiled, such as mallow leaves and roots, melilot, and similar things; and a softening plaster should be applied, such as well-made diachylon; or a mucilage of mallow root should be prepared and mixed with white clay or wax oil, and applied as a plaster; or ripe figs should be crushed with pigeon droppings, and similar medicines that are called consolidating emollients.
And sometimes it is resolved with gentle, frequent rubbing with moist hands, and movement of the limb in all directions should be administered at all times.
But if the crookedness has progressed and become hardened and turned to bone, and it becomes necessary to treat it with iron, then the uppermost part should be cut away and the continuity of the bone dissolved, and that which superfluously swells beyond the bone should be incised with fine instruments, and relief should be given to it with care and skill.
Chapter 23.
Concerning discourse on dislocation.
Dislocation is the displacement of one of the joints from its place, wherefore movement is prevented, and the shape of the limb is distorted, and it causes great pain and injury to the patient.
Therefore, when a dislocation happens to someone, then it is necessary to strive immediately that it be reduced, and not delay that reduction, because if it is delayed, the place becomes inflamed and very quickly the reduction of the dislocation becomes difficult.
And for this reason, it should not be moved or stretched at the time of inflammation, because many times it causes spasms and intense pain.
But when this happens, then you should attend to the phlebotomy of the patient, and let it be until the inflammation subsides; and then the limb should be bathed with warm water and oil, and then it should be reduced with ease.
And every limb should be treated with that which will bring it back to its proper place (or function).
And I have already ordered the chapters on dislocation according to what precedes in fracture; from the most superior part of the body down to the most inferior part.
Chapter 24.
On the treatment of dislocation of the lower jaw.
If the two jaws are dislocated, it is not delayed; and the dislocation of both is done in one of two ways:  they are moved from their places by slight movement, and are somewhat softened; or they are dislocated by complete and total dislocation, to the point that they are softened at the joint, to the point that saliva flows from the patient and he cannot hold it, nor can he close his mouth, and his tongue is entangled in his speech.
But when his dislocation is slight, then in most cases it returns by itself with little help.
But if the dislocation is complete and total, then a slight reduction must be administered, and it should not be delayed at all.
And it is that the assistant holds the patient's head, and the physician inserts the thumb of one hand into the root of the dislocated jaw inside the patient's mouth, if the dislocation is on one side; or that he inserts both thumbs together, if the dislocation is on both sides, and the other fingers of his hands are outside with which he pulls; and he commands the patient to relax his jaws and release them from each side; and the physician pulls the jaw and pushes the jaw until it returns to its place.
And if the reduction is difficult, and especially if both jaws are dislocated together, then administer evaporation with hot water and oil, until the reduction of both is made easier, and do not delay the reduction of both at all, as we have said.
And then when they return and are aligned, and the patient's mouth is closed and not softened, then place on it powders of cloth with cerate, and let it be made of wax and rose oil; and then let it be tied easily with soft bandages.
And let the patient sleep on his back, and his head be positioned between two pillows, so that it does not hurt him on the right or left side; and do not force him to chew anything; before his meal let his food be finely chopped, until when the pains are relieved and the jaws are knit together, then let him eat what he wishes.
And this should be administered easily, and do not work on opening the mouth during eating and drinking and speaking, until the jaw is knit together and healed.
And if the reduction of the two jaws is difficult when they are dislocated at any time and are not returned to their places, then many times fevers and constant thirst occur, and very quickly the patient's belly is distended, and very quickly he vomits pure bile.
And when you see this, then know that it is dangerous; and many times he who this happens to dies within ten days.
Chapter 25.
Of the reduction of the dislocation of the clavicle and of the extremity of the muscle.
The clavicle is not dislocated inwards by its connection with the ribs; and sometimes it is dislocated outwards, and this is evident to the touch.
And its restoration is that the patient lie on his back and extend his arms. And then compress the area with your palm with firm compression, for it will return.
And then apply a plaster and powders to that area and bandage it tightly.
But the extremity of that which is the hip and is continuous with it, is not dislocated in any way; then it must be reduced and bandaged according to what we have said and according to what is at your disposal.
And then apply a plaster, and powders, and a bandage, and instruct the patient to adhere to tranquility and rest until it is healed.
And with this same treatment, the extremity of the muscle is reduced when it is separated from its place.
Chapter 26.
Of the reduction of the dislocation of the muscle.
Know that a muscle is dislocated in only three ways, one of which is that it is dislocated from the upper part to the lower part.
And the second is that it is dislocated to the upper part of the muscle, and this is done slowly; and it is not dislocated to the back parts by the shoulder; and it is not dislocated to the front parts by the nerves.
And it is mostly dislocated and protrudes to the lower parts below the nipple, and especially in those who have little flesh, it is easily dislocated; but in those who have much flesh, it comes out with difficulty.
And it quickly happens to some men through a blow or fall, and their muscle is inflamed with a hot abscess, and it is thought to be dislocated because of this.
Then it is necessary that you prove this before you are certain of it, and then you proceed to its cure.
And the dislocation is known when it is in the lower parts below the nipple; so that you distinguish between the dislocated muscle and the healthy muscle, because you find a manifest difference between them; and you find in the head of the muscle a concavity, and below the nipple, near the touch of the head of the muscle, like an egg, and the patient cannot bring his hand to his ear, nor move it through all movements.
If it is dislocated near the feet or above, and you then find a manifest touch, and it is not hidden.
And of this dislocation, reduction is easy when it is fresh and the patient is a child.
And the reduction of it is that the minister raises his hand to the upper parts; and then places his hands below the patient's nipple, and raises the joint strongly upwards to its place, and the minister raises his hand, and extends it upwards; and then places it below because it returns easily.
But if by what we have said it does not return, and much time has passed since the dislocation first occurred, then the patient should be bathed in warm water and an emollient and softening liniment should be applied, such as boiled roots of althea, fenugreek, and melilot in water, and it should be administered.
And then the patient should lie supine on his back and a wool pad, of a consistency between soft and firm, should be placed under his nipple. Then the physician should place his heel on the pad and raise the head of the muscle forcefully, and pull the patient's arm so that it is not pulled downwards, and another assistant should hold the patient's head so that it is not pulled downwards, for then it immediately returns to its place.
And if you wish, reduce it in this manner: have a man present who is taller than the patient, and let him stand on the affected side, and insert his shoulder under the patient's armpit and lift the patient's armpit upwards until the patient is suspended in the air, and another assistant pulls the patient's arm from below their abdomen. But if the patient is light, then something else should be suspended with him to add weight, so that it will weigh him down, for the dislocation will immediately return.
And it is reduced thus according to another method: a long pole is fixed in the ground, the head of which is round in shape, like a pestle, neither thick nor thin, and then it is placed under the patient; when sheets are placed on top of the pole, and the patient is standing along the length of the pole, and then their arm is extended downwards on the opposite side; and their body is pulled forcefully on the other side, for the joint returns to its place quickly.
And if reduction is difficult for all the reasons we have mentioned, then use this treatment: take a pole two cubits long and four fingers wide, and its thickness should be reduced near the armpit in this manner:
And then, on the rounded end, soft cloths should be tied so that the pole does not injure the patient.
And then it is placed under the armpit of the patient, and the arm or hand is extended over the pole to the lower parts, and the pole is tied to the armpit and the arm and the extremity of the hand.
Then the arm is placed on a rung of a ladder according to its width, and the hand is extended downwards, and the rest of the body is suspended on the other side, for the joint enters immediately.
And when its reduction is completed in whatever way possible to you, then you should place under the armpit a ball of wool of sufficient quantity; and then apply a plaster prepared from powdered myrrh and egg white to the entire muscle, as it is rolled up; and then bind tightly under the armpit with a suitable bandage; and the bandage should be rolled over the plaster, and his hand should be attached to his neck, and it should be left, and his hand should not be moved for seven days.
And it is necessary that the patient's diet be light until the limb is strengthened, for it is easier for his healing.
And then the diet should be gradually increased after seven or five days and movement exercised; and if it is firm and not softened, then it is healed.
But if the joint is dislocated many times due to humidity that affects it or another cause, then cautery with three holes should be administered in that place, as previously stated in the chapter on cautery.
And if all this is done, and after seven days the bandage is untied and the joint is not firm, and the plaster and the binding are reapplied several times, and it is not firm and hangs and cannot raise that arm to the upper parts, then know that his nerves, which are at the head of the muscle, are incised or stretched or softened, and know that the joint will never be fixed in its place.
Regarding the dislocation that occurs between the foot and the ankle or the back parts, the reduction is done with impulse and extension with the hands, until it returns [to its place].
And let another bandage be applied to that [area], and treat it until it is healed.
And if during healing there is heaviness in the limb and slowness in its movement, then let the patient use a bath many times until that heaviness is relieved and it returns to its former natural state.
Chapter 27.
Of the treatment of hip dislocation.
Know that the hip joint is dislocated with difficulty and similarly returns with difficulty; and it is dislocated in all directions, and especially to the front and to the back.  And its dislocation is not hidden from you, for it is evident upon sight or touch, depending on how it is dislocated. And when you align the dislocated hip with its socket, this is clearly evident to you, because the joint is concave and one cannot bend the leg nor touch the thigh with the hand.
And it is necessary that you act quickly and reduce the dislocation before a hot abscess develops, for if a hot abscess develops, its reduction is difficult, and it is not easily healed completely; and especially when it is in the back, for it is worse than all other types of dislocation, and more painful, and often causes death.
And its restoration, when it is possible to reduce it, is that the patient's leg should be extended with two hands, and the leg should be spread out, and the physician's hands should be on and under the hip, and he should push the joint with the thumbs of his hands together, or with the base of his palm, until it returns to its place.
But if the dislocation is to the front, then reduce it by bending the leg with your hand, until you strike the hip with the base of your palm.
And if the dislocation does not yield to reduction, then administer forceful and very strong extension.
And it is so that two assistants extend the arm, and two other assistants hold that extension so that it is not loosened during the extension.
And then the arm should be rotated in every direction, after it is wrapped in a long, doubled cloth over the patient's hand, or a bandage.
And when the physician touches the joint with his hand, anoint it with some oil so that this may aid in the lubrication of the joint with ease; and then push the joint with a strong impulse until it returns [to its place].
And after the reduction, it is necessary that he be placed on a plaster which has styptic and drying properties with egg white, and it should be tightened with a descending bandage, and the arm should be suspended from the neck, and left like that for some days.
And then it should be untied; and if the joint is formed in its place, then you untie its bandage and leave it.
And if you see the joint not well-knit, then you repeat the plaster and the bandage, and leave it for some days until it is tightened; and then untie it.
But if gravity occurs during the reduction of the joint, and the patient's disposition is agitated, then administer moist heat in a bath and gentle friction, and compression, until he is relieved; or place on the joint  allayments, that is, something very fatty; and then it should be bandaged, and left on the bones day and night. And then remove it, and put it in a bath; and when it is soaked, then you rub the joint with a tempered friction, and then repeat the application of the allayment, that is, very fatty ointment, once, and a second time, and a third time. with the bath treatment, until it is healed.
And if you wish, place upon it warm, moist cow dung and bind it tightly; and do this several times, because it is moist and reduces the inflammation.
Chapter 28.
Concerning the treatment of a dislocated wrist, that is, of the joint which is between the arm and the hand.
A dislocated wrist is sometimes easily reduced, unlike other joints. However, speed is essential in its reduction at the time of dislocation, before the area becomes inflamed or a hot abscess forms there.
And the reduction of its dislocation is that you place the patient's wrist joint on a table and the assistant extends the hand, and the physician places his hand or palm on the prominence of the joint and pulls it until it returns to its place.
However, it must be considered whether the palm is already facing the belly of the hand; then the patient should place the back of their hand on a table during extension and reduction.  And if the dislocation is toward the back of the hand, then the position of the hand should be inside-out on the table, so that the physician's hand rests on that prominence of the joint.
And thus, if it returns immediately, it is good; and if not, then constrict it with a poultice, allowing the inflammation to subside, and leave it.  And do not repeat this, for otherwise, you will not be able to succeed in its reduction once several days have passed.
However, if the joint remains crooked and causes no harm to the patient other than that the hand is weakened and cannot grip anything, then know that the nerves are pinched or crushed.  In this case, there is no remedy other than to constrict it with a cautery near the injury site, and quickly give it something to support it.
Therefore, once the limb is returned to its place, apply the poultice we have recommended, and let it remain and constrict for five days; then unbind it, and leave it unbound, and let the hand be exercised.
But if its movement is impeded and some severity occurs, then soothe it with warm water and massage several times until it is relieved.
Chapter 29.
On the treatment of finger dislocations.
Sometimes the fingers are dislocated in every part.
And when a finger is dislocated on the back of the palm or the belly of the hand, then stretch the finger and push the dislocation back with gentle pressure until it returns.
Then support the head of the finger, and suspend it toward the part to which it is dislocated, and leave it for two days.
Then suspend it and extend it until it is straight and aligned on that same day.
And when it is night, bind it according to that description, and do not cease to unbind it during the day and exercise it with movement, and bind it at night; and do this for several days until it is tight (or strong/stable).
And do similarly if it is dislocated on the palm of the hand, and bind it to that part and perform this your first operation until it is healed.
And similarly do this when it is dislocated in other parts (of the body).
Chapter 30.
On the treatment of the dislocation of the vertebrae of the back.
When a complete dislocation happens to any of the vertebrae of the back or neck, and many vertebrae are dislodged from their places, then in that case there is no cure, for death is expected for the patient.
And a sign of this is that the patient's excrement is expelled involuntarily, and they cannot retain it; and many times some of their limbs are paralyzed,  either both legs, or both arms, or one of them; or a vertebra is dislocated, because sometimes it is dislocated and sometimes the dislocation is done to four parts.
Therefore, that is dislocated in the back parts and is called yellowness (jaundice -  likely referring to a symptom related to the spinal injury, not literal jaundice).
But the treatment is that then you consider if the yellowness (jaundice-like symptom) comes from a fever, because then in that case there is neither cure nor healing at all.
But in that which comes from a fall or percussion or similar, the Ancients already described the methods of cure with lengthy discourse, of which the most returns with profit; but I have abbreviated that, whose little excuses the excess of it, by my proximity to my intended exposition, with which I have exposed and formed this from diverse instruments of that with which I will show this and explain that.
And of those, only that which occurs in the two sides properly is cured with what I have recounted.
And it is that the patient should be laid on his face on a soft cushion near a wall, and a soft mattress should be placed under him so that his feet are not chafed.
And then a straight pole should be placed, fixed in the earth at the head end of the cushion near his head, and another pole near his feet at the other end of the cushion.
And the attendant should hold the pole, and it should not be fixed in a pit; and another attendant should hold the other one in the same manner.
Then wrap a bandage around the patient's head and under his armpits firmly; and extend the end of the bandage to the pole which is near his head, and tie it to it; and then tighten another bandage around his hips, his buttocks, and around his legs; and then adjust all the bandages and tie them to the other pole which is near his feet.
And then each attendant should stretch the bandage to the part of the pole, and the two poles and the bandages should not be moved from their places where they are fixed, but however, they should not be fixed as we have said.
And the physician should place his palms on the spine with firmness until it returns, or place a board on it, and then adjust his feet on the board until it returns.
But if it does not return by this method, then take a board whose width or length is about three braccia, and make a hole in the wall which we have said is near the patient, into which the end of the board fits. And then place half of the board on the spine, and the physician should place his feet on the other end, and press firmly until the spine is compressed and returns to its place.
And if you wish, use a lathe which is rotated by hand; and you should place in the ground near the patient's head at the back of the buttocks two poles, the length of which is one arm's length, and near their head at the back of the buttocks similarly two poles; and the length between each pole should be one palm, and a hole should be made in each pole through which the lathe passes, and each should be firmly fixed in the ground so that it is not moved.
And there should be another round pole on which the lathe is, and it should be rotated in the two holes of the two poles.
And at its end is a hole into which the pole is fitted, the length of which is one palm including that which is rotated; and in the other two poles it is similar to that.
And then tighten the ropes that you have tied to the patient's feet in the hole which is near their head, and the ropes that you have tied to their thighs in the lathe which is near their feet.
And then near each lathe let a servant stand who turns the lathe with his hand, and the physician manipulates the spine as we have said.
And then, once the spine is returned and the place is manipulated, then you should apply a drying plaster with egg white, and then lint; and then place over the plaster a piece of cloth whose width is three fingers or thereabouts, and whose length is sufficient to cover the area of the curvature, and over the healthy part of the spine.
And then it should be bound with the bandage which we have mentioned, and nourish the patient with a light diet until he is healed.
And if any swelling remains in the area at the end of the healing process, then medicines should be administered which soften and smooth, with the administration of the cloth for a long time, which we have recommended; and a lead plate is also applied to that area.
And sometimes swelling occurs in the back of the spinal column, and it is caused by that dislocation; and that is a bone which already swells, so that no attempt should be made on it with this medicine, for it will very quickly cause death.
Chapter 31.
Concerning the treatment of a dislocated hip.
Know that the hip joint and the muscle joint suffer only dislocation, and that which happens to other joints with small movement and concavity does not happen to these.
And the hip joint is dislocated in four ways, for it is dislocated inwards, or outwards, or forwards, or backwards.
And it is mostly dislocated inwards, and rarely forwards or backwards.
And a sign of its inward dislocation is that, when you align the patient's healthy leg with the affected one, the affected leg is longer and the knee more prominent than the healthy one, and the patient cannot bend their foot without lengthening the leg, and it is in this place, where lengthening is accompanied by a hot abscess, that the head of the femur has already arrived.
And the sign of that to which dislocation happens outwardly, is that its symptoms are contrary to these symptoms.
And a sign of that to which dislocation happens forwards is that he extends his leg completely, yet he cannot bend it without pain in the knee, and if he forces himself to walk he cannot do so without limping forwards; and his urine is retained and his groin is inflamed, and he walks on his heel.
And a sign of that to which dislocation happens backwards is that he cannot extend the knee, nor can he bend it before bending the hip, and his leg is shorter than the other, and the hip is softened, and the head of the femur is in that place.
But regarding the reduction of these types of dislocation, you should consider that if the dislocation is old and ancient, already set with the limb having adapted to it, and you attempt reduction, and it remains according to its disposition, then it is not a complete cure; and therefore no prognosis should be made in that case.
But in the case where the dislocation is recent, and is one of the four types of dislocation, then take care to return the joint and extend it inwards and outwards, and move it to the right and left, for it quickly returns and needs no further treatment.
But, if it does not return in this manner, then you must prepare a strong assistant and extend his leg from the lower part, either with his hands or with a bandage tied above the knee; and another assistant extend the hand from above so that he places his hands under the patient's armpits; then tighten a linen bandage around the root of the thigh, and let another assistant hold the end of the bandage.
And let the extension be from the inside of the hip to the fork (presumably the groin), or from the back to the back.  (The last part is a little ambiguous;  "dos" might refer to the back, specifically.)
And let the extension of all those (assistants) be at once until the patient is raised with his body from the ground and remains suspended.
And this type of extension is common to all four (types of dislocation).
And therefore, if the dislocation returns with what we have said, it will be good; and if not, then it is necessary for every type (of dislocation) that which we shall say of its proper cure.
In the reduction of the hip itself, when it is dislocated, and the dislocation is towards the inside, it is necessary that the patient lie supine on his sound side; and then place the ligaments on the root of the thigh in that place which is between the head of the thigh and the place that is below the groin; and then extend the ligament upwards from the groin to the highest part of the fork (groin).
And then another strong assistant should take his arms, and grasp the thick part of the affected thigh and extend it outwards with a strong extension, because that will return it to its place.
And this type is of easier cure, with which this member is reduced, than the other types.
But if it is difficult for you and it does not yield to this method of treatment at all, then it is necessary that the patient's two feet are tied together with a strong, light bandage, above both ankles and both heels.
And let the length of each (bandage) be the amount of four fingers, and let the affected leg be extended more than the other by the amount of two fingers.
And then the patient should be suspended from the head of a wooden beam, and let him be inside the house; and let his height from the ground be the amount of two arms' lengths.
And then order a strong young man to reduce the head of the thigh, and let another young man suspend the patient, and the other young man, reducing the joint with strong pressure, for the joint returns to its place quickly.
But in the actual reduction, when it is a dislocation to the outside, it is necessary that the patient lie on his back as we have recommended in the case of fever; and let the bandage be tightened on the affected leg and on his feet.
And then two beams should be placed, one at his feet and the other at his head; and then let adjusted beams be placed in the middle of the mound placed upon which damp cloths are wrapped, so that the patient is not harmed because the beam is between his thighs, so that the extension downwards is not pulled.
And then each assistant should extend to his part, and the physician with his hand guides the reduction according to the art.
And when the dislocation is in the front parts, then it is necessary that the leg be extended slightly, and it is according to this same account on a mound; and the physician places the palm of his right hand on the patient's hip, and then grasps that with the other hand, and with that grasping pulls that which is extended downwards to the part of the knee.
And if the dislocation is in the back parts, then it is not necessary that the patient be extended downwards, and he is elevated above the earth; rather it is necessary that he be placed on a hard surface, just as it is necessary to raise him if his hip is dislocated outwards, according to what we have said about his lying on two hips; and if he is on his face and the ligaments are extended, as we have said, it is not good.
And it is necessary that compression be administered with a cloth on the place where the joint is.
Therefore, when the reduction is completed as necessary — and the sign of his reduction is not hidden from you, and that is that you extend the patient's two legs, and when you see those equal and the patient straightens his leg and extends it without difficulty, then you know that the limb is returned as necessary — and then you adjust the two thighs and apply a plaster and bind it tightly so that the hip is not moved in any part; and let the patient rest for three or four days.
Then untie the bandage and the plaster, and compare one leg with the other.
Then, if you see them equal in appearance, then you know that the dislocation is now healed, and then let the patient go.
And if you see any cause for softening, then you return and plaster that, and bind it according to your first binding, and leave it for three days.
Then untie it, and have him delay in walking about for some days until he is strengthened.
Chapter 32.
Of the treatment of dislocation of the knee.
The knee is dislocated in three ways, for it is dislocated outwards, and inwards, and downwards, more towards the back; and it is not dislocated forwards.
And the sign of its dislocation is that you command the patient to apply his leg to his thigh; then you will know that the knee is dislocated.
And the restoration of all its dislocations is that you make the patient lie straight, so that he extends his leg, if he can, thereupon; adhere your two hands to his face, and place his foot between your feet; and then make his knee adhere to your palms, and hold those between your fingers on his knee with strength, and another assistant extends his foot until the knee returns to its place.
And the sign of its reduction is that his leg adheres to the thigh with light, effortless ease.
And then plaster that and make the leg adhere to the thigh, and then bind them together with a bandage for three or four days, and then unbind them.
And do not allow the patient to walk for some days, until he is healed and strengthened.
But if the reduction is difficult for you, then administer strong extension with bandages, the use of which in the treatment of the hip was described earlier.
Chapter 33.
On the treatment of the dislocation of the talus. (Talus refers to the ankle bone)
The talus is sometimes displaced by a slight movement, and sometimes dislocated completely, and its dislocation occurs either inwards or outwards.
And the sign of its dislocation is that sometimes the talus swells, extending towards the side to which it is dislocated.
But the treatment of its displacement is by gentle reduction, and it is that it should be extended easily with the hands and manipulated until it returns [to its place].
But in its treatment when it is completely dislocated, it is necessary that you make the patient lie down straight, and that a strong and capable assistant hold him from behind, at the level of his back.
And then you take with your right hand the foot from its upper part, and with your left hand the lower part of the foot at the ankle.
And then pull the foot towards you with your right hand, and then with your left hand twice, and then extend with the left; and push the toes of the foot with the right hand towards the leg without effort.
And do this twice as we have described.
And then push the toes of the foot towards the leg a third time, and you are at the ankle.
Then it will return in one or two times according to this method, and if you see the foot set correctly, it is good; and if not, then repeat the operation, because it will return [to its proper place].
But if the reduction is forbidden to you by what we have recounted, then have the patient lie on their back on the ground, and tighten a strong rope firmly on the ground, so that it falls between their thighs, and you have already wrapped a cloth around them so that the patient is not harmed.
And then let the patient's attendant hold their thighs, and let another attendant extend the foot with their hands or with a bandage tied above the ankle; and then let each attendant pull against the extension of their partner, and let the rope remain between the patient's thighs restraining it, so that their body is not pulled downwards against its extension.
And then the physician sets the dislocation with their hands, and another attendant holds the healthy thigh below, because the dislocation returns easily.
And so when the dislocation is reduced and the success of its reduction is clear to you, then apply a plaster and bind it tightly with bandages, and bind the foot to the leg with a bandage.
And it is necessary that you fear or guard against the nerves which are behind the heel, so that the bandage over it is not too tight and severely injures them.
And then leave it for two or three days; and if the bandage is loosened, tighten it.
And then unbind it on the third or fourth day, and forbid the patient from walking for forty days. But if he is forced to walk before that time, there is no certainty that the dislocation will not be loosened and worsened, and then it will not receive a cure.
And if a hot abscess happens to him, then you must administer to its suppuration that which we described previously, in another place of treatment and embrocation, until it is healed.
Chapter 34.
On the treatment of dislocations of the toes.
It is necessary that that which is dislocated be healed with little extension without effort; and this, which is not difficult, is sooner lighter (easier/quicker).
But if the dislocation is in some of the bones of the foot, then you must make the patient sit with his foot on the ground or on a table, and he should remain thus as if he were walking.
And then you stand, and place your foot on that which protrudes from the joints, and then press that with your foot with force until it returns, and you see that it is now healed and no prominence appears in the place.
And then place under the sole of his foot a board that covers the whole foot, to which there are two ends, and then tighten that with a decent and firm bandage for three days; and then untie it and make him rest from walking for many days, until it is strengthened and its recovery is assured.
Chapter 35.
Of the types of dislocation that are made with a wound or with a fracture or with both together.
When any of these things happen, and you attempt its cure and restoration, death often results.
And therefore, one should not presume to cure it, except for someone skilled in the art, of long experience, merciful and compassionate, slow, not rash or presumptuous; and who uses in the beginning medicines that only reduce hot abscesses, and leaves the patient to divine judgment, except for one in whom you see hope of recovery, with alleviation of the disease, and in whom some hope appears. And then strive immediately to reduce it at the beginning of the ailment, before a hot abscess develops.
And then, if the limb returns as we wish, then administer a regime which reduces hot abscesses and treat the wound with what is suitable, using drying ointments.
And if the dislocation is with a fracture and happens in the jagged separated bones, then you should attempt to reunite them, and do in this what we have said in the simple diseases that precede this in those locations.
And guard and avoid, according to your virtue, that entry into paths of fear as my preaching has preceded you; for that is better for you before your Creator, and more permanent to your glory, and more salutary to your true body in your time. Thus end the words of Albucasis perfectly, for which may God be blessed. Amen.
