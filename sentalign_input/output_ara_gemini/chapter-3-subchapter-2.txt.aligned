The second chapter on the fracture occurring in the head.	CHAPTER TWO. On a fracture occurring in the head.	0.82322794
The types of fractures occurring in the head are many, their forms are various, and their causes are diverse.	The kinds of fracture occurring in the head are many, of various forms and differing causes.	0.93754673
Some fractures result from a sword blow, and it may either completely shave the bone until it reaches the membrane beneath it, like an adze does to wood, and therefore this type of fracture is called adze-like (qadumi).	Some fractures are due to a sword-stroke which may cut right through the bone and reach the membrane beneath the bone, like an adze-cut in wood, for which reason this kind of cut is called 'ascial'.	0.83301413
Or, the sword may cut part of the bone and shave only its surface without penetrating through it completely, and this type of fracture is called a simple extraction (qala).	Or the sword may cut through part of the bone, only slicing through the surface and not reaching the depth; this kind is called an absolute avulsion.	0.7293142
The wound of these two types of fractures may be either large or small.	The wounds in these two fractures can be either big or small.	0.94512606
Some fractures are comminuted or crushed, caused by a blow with a stone or a fall on a stone or something similar.	There are also some fractures accompanied by smashing or crushing; such as by a blow from a stone or by falling on a stone, and the like.	0.83921546
This fracture is either penetrating, having almost reached the membrane under the bone, or it is on the surface of the bone. The wound of these two types of fractures is also either large or small.	A fracture of this kind will be either penetrating, reaching the membrane beneath the bone; or superficial; the wound in these two fractures may be either big or small.	0.91437465
Some fractures are hidden in the bone with the thinness of a hair, which is a slight fissure, and therefore this type of fracture is called hairline (sha'ri).	Then there is a type of fracture that is hidden in the bone, as fine as a hair, a thin crack; therefore this kind of fracture is called 'capillary'.	0.7039302
Among them is a fracture caused by a fall or a blow from a stone or something similar, which causes the surface of the bone to depress inward, creating a concavity, similar to what happens to a copper pot when struck, causing a part of it to depress inwards.	There is a fracture due to a fall or a blow from a stone and the like, making a dent in the surface of the bone and a hollow at the site as occurs in a bronze bowl when a blow falls on it and a portion of it is pushed in.	0.7807399
This most often occurs in heads with soft bones, like the heads of children.	This mostly occurs in heads whose bones are soft, as those of children.	0.9485999
All of these types of fractures may have loose or non-loose fragments. We will discuss the treatment of all of this in its proper place.	Any of these kinds of fracture may also have splinters, jagged or otherwise; we shall deal with the treatment of all these in their place.	0.7650455
We identify all of these types of fractures by examining them, probing them with probes, and removing the dead flesh from them.	All these kinds of fracture are diagnosed by laying them bare and investigating them with probes and removing all the lacerated tissues over them.	0.82978034
As for the hairline type, it is identified by exposing the bone, wiping it, and smearing it with ink; the fracture will appear black.	The 'capillary' kind is diagnosed by laying bare the bone, wiping it clean, and rubbing ink on it, when the fracture will appear black.	0.6909435
As for the treatment of fractures, first look at the patient's symptoms. If you see symptoms that clearly indicate danger, such as vomiting bile, stretching, loss of consciousness, loss of voice, fainting, acute fever, bulging and redness of the eyes, and other similar symptoms, then do not approach the patient nor treat him, for death is inevitable in most cases with these symptoms.	As to the treatment of the fracture: begin by paying attention to the patient's symptoms. If you observe any symptom clearly indicating something dangerous, such as bilious vomit, convulsion, mental derangement, loss of voice, fainting, high fever, protrusion and inflammation of the eyes, and similar symptoms, then leave the patient alone and do not treat him; for in the majority of cases these symptoms undoubtedly indicate the approach of death.	0.9195881
If you see symptoms that do not alarm you, and you hope for his recovery, then proceed with his treatment.	But if you find symptoms that do not alarm you and you see hope of recovery for him, then begin treatment as follows.	0.8475592
That is, if the injured person comes to you immediately after being injured, and it is during the winter, you should strive to remove the bone before the fourteenth day in any case.	If he be brought to you immediately after his injury and it be the season of winter, you should try to remove the bone, at all events before the fourteenth day.	0.8005918
If it is during the summer, you should hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, before the membrane under the bone becomes infected, leading to the symptoms we described.	If it be summer you must hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, before the covering membrane beneath the bone and over the brain be infected, and before the above-mentioned symptoms occur.	0.8532256
If the bone fracture has reached the membrane covering the brain, and it is accompanied by comminution and crushing, then you should cut the comminuted and crushed part as I will describe to you.	If the fracture has already reached the cerebral membrane with fragmentation of the bone and depression, then you must cut out the splintered and broken part as I shall now describe to you.	0.8755013
That is, shave the injured patient's head and expose the bone in any way possible, depending on the shape of the wound and what is easiest for the patient.	Shave the head of the injured patient and lay the bone bare in any way you can, following the course of the injury and in the manner least grievous to the injured man.	0.72952193
If you encounter bleeding or a hot swelling when exposing the bone, address it as necessary. That is, pack the area with rags soaked in syrup and rose oil, and clean the wound until the swelling subsides and the bleeding stops.	If, when you lay the bone bare, you encounter a haemorrhage or abscess, meet the case with suitable remedies; that is, pack the place with dressings soaked in wine and oil of roses, and cleanse the wound until the swelling subsides and you are safe from haemorrhage; then begin the trepanning and removal of the bone.	0.85480547
Then proceed to excise and remove the bone, which can be done in one of two ways.	This may be done in one of two ways.	0.5177922
The first way is to cut the bone with a fine, narrow-bladed instrument, and this is its image:	One way is to cut the bone with a fine-bladed chisel, this being the figure of it.	0.72571766
Then you use another piece after this piece, slightly wider, and this is its picture:	Then after this one employ another chisel, a little broader. It is figured here.	0.7460994
Then you also use another chisel, wider than the second.	Then use yet another chisel still broader than the second.	0.9218601
And it is necessary that you have a set of different chisels, some of which are wider than others and some of which are shorter than others, and they should be extremely sharp at their edges. And let them be made of Indian iron or good steel.	You should have by you a number of different chisels, some broader than others and some shorter than others; their tips should be exquisitely sharp; and they should be made of Indian iron or best steel.	0.9047731
And use gentleness in striking the chisel, lest you shake the head and harm it.	Let the strokes upon the chisel be gentle lest the head be shocked or injured.	0.6864912
If the bone is strong and hard, then it is appropriate that you drill around it before using the chisels with the drills they called non-sinking drills.	If the bone be strong and hard you should, before you use the chisel, make perforations round about it with drills called 'non-sinking' drills.	0.90737414
And they called them non-sinking drills because they do not go beyond the limit of the skull bone to what is behind it, because the drill has a round edge below its sharp head, similar to a collar or small circle, that prevents it from sinking and exceeding the thickness of the bone.	Their name of non-sinking drills is due to their not piercing the cranial bone through to what is beneath, because the drill has a circular margin beneath its sharp head like a small collar or wheel, that prevents it from sinking in and going beyond the thickness of the bone.	0.8840729
And it is appropriate for you to take from these drills a large number, each one of which is suitable for the thickness of that bone, so that you have for each skull a drill whose sharp tip is of a length and shortness appropriate to the thickness of that skull.	You must obtain a large number of these drills each of which will suit a certain thickness of bone; so that for each skull you have a drill whose pointed extremity is of a length to suit the thickness of that skull.	0.86439943
And this is a picture of three types of drills: large, medium, and small:	Here are figured three kinds of drill, large, medium, and small.	0.8006225
As for the method of drilling around the broken bone, it is that you place the drill on the bone and turn it with your fingers until you know that the bone has been penetrated. Then you move the drill to another place and make the distance between each hole the thickness of the probe or similar.	As to the manner of perforation round the fractured bone, you apply the drill to the bone and revolve it with your fingers until you know that the bone is pierced, then you transfer the drill to another place, making the distance between the perforations about the thickness of a probe.	0.91411185
Then you cut with the cutters between each two holes and do that with the utmost gentleness you can, as we said, until you remove the bone either with your hand or with something else from some of the instruments that were prepared for that, such as forceps and delicate hooks.	Then with the chisels cut out the bone between the perforations, using the utmost delicacy, as we have said. Then take out the bone, either with your hand or with some other instrument you have ready for the purpose, such as forceps or fine tongs.	0.85975957
And you should be very careful that the drill or the cutter does not touch any of the periosteum.	You will have to observe the utmost caution that neither drill nor chisel touch any part of the membrane.	0.7453159
So if you hollow out the bone and it is cleared of the periosteum, if it was attached to it, and you take it out, then you should scrape and smooth the roughness of what remains in the bone with another instrument similar to the cutter, except that it should be thinner and smoother than the rest of the cutters.	When you have cut the bone circularly, free from the membrane if adherent to it, and have removed it, then you will have to scrape away and smooth out all the roughness in the remaining bone with another instrument, resembling a chisel, except that it must be finer and slenderer than any of them.	0.8095225
If anything remains of the small bones and fragments, then take them gently with the instruments you have, then treat the wound after that with bandages and ointments which will be mentioned.	If there are any little bits or spicules of bone left, pick them out with whatever instrument you can, gently; and then treat the wound with dressings and ointments as we shall describe.	0.8486155
As for the other aspect of the procedure, it is an easy aspect, far from danger, mentioned by Galen and praised highly, and this is his saying: You should first start by exposing the part of the bone from the place where the fracture is most severe and obvious, so that when you have exposed that part, you place under it the tip of this lenticular cutter, and this is its picture:	The other way of operating is altogether easy and free from danger; Galen mentioned it and greatly praised it; these are his words: You should begin by laying bare that part of the bone where the fracture is severest and most obvious; when you have done so, place under it the tip of this lenticular chisel figured here.	0.887349
The lenticular part of it should be smooth, not cutting anything, and the sharp part of it on its sides going lengthwise, as you see, so that the lenticular part rests on the peritoneum and the face of the sharp section is on the bone.	The lenticular part of it should be smooth and not for cutting, the sharp part of it being on both sides longitudinally, as you see; so that the lenticular part is resting upon the meninges while the cutting surface is on the bone.	0.8564001
Then you strike the section from one side with a small hammer until you cut all the bone gently as it rotates, and you are safe from the membrane, no frightening accident will happen at all, even if the therapist is the most ignorant and cowardly of people, yes, even if he is sleepy.	Then with a small hammer strike the tool on one side until you gently cut through the bone in a circle, in the confident knowledge that nothing untoward can happen to the membrane even though the operator be the most ignorant and cowardly of men; yes, even if he be sleepy.	0.81967086
If something attached to the bone from the membrane remains in some places of the bone, then scrape it off with the edge of the lenticular section itself and gently remove it from it, for it will be removed without harm or fear.	If any membrane stick to any part of the bone, strip it off with the lenticular tip of the chisel and free it gently from it, for it will come away without harm or danger.	0.8730229
But if the bone fracture did not penetrate to the membrane, and what was cut from the bone was its surface, and roughness and fine fragments remained in it, then it is necessary to strip that roughness and remove those fragments with fine scrapers, of which several different sizes have been made, so that you can use them in every place that is most suitable and most appropriate, depending on what the work and the broken bone itself and its shape lead you to.	If it be a fracture of the bone not reaching to the meninges, only the surface of the bone being separated, and there remain some roughness and fine splinters, you should smooth down the roughness and remove the splinters with fine scrapers, of which you should have a number, of varying sizes so that you can use the one best fitted and most suitable, in the light of what is suggested by your operative method and the broken bone itself and its shape.	0.84085065
And you should use in your stripping first for the bone the widest of those scrapers, then use after it a finer one, and you continue to do that successively until you get to using the finest and thinnest of them all.	When you smooth the bone you must first use the broadest of the scrapers and then a finer one, and so on until you come to use the finest and slenderest of all.	0.8682128
As for the rest of the small capillary cracks and the fine fracture, it is necessary to use a treatment for each one according to what leads to its healing, and it is something that is not hidden from anyone who has the slightest training in this craft and has come across what we have written and explained in major fractures.	As to the rest, the little capillary fractures and fine fissures, you will have to apply to each of them that treatment that will bring about a perfect repair. This is obvious to anyone who has the least practice in this art and is acquainted with what we have written in explanation of the big fractures.	0.8882633
If the membrane remains exposed when you remove the bone, then you should take a linen cloth the size of the wound and dip it in rose oil and place it on the mouth of the wound, then take another folded or triangular cloth and dip it in syrup and rose oil and place it on the first cloth, and do that as lightly as you can so that you do not weigh down the peritoneum, then use a wide bandage over it and do not tighten it except as much as it holds the wound only.	If the meninges are left bare when you remove the bone, you should take a linen dressing measured to the wound, soak it in oil of roses, and apply it to the opening of the wound; then take another dressing, folded in two or three, soak it in wine and oil of roses and apply it over the first with the utmost gentleness so as not to press upon the meninges; then employ a broad bandage on top, but tighten it only enough to keep the wound covered.	0.8597995
And you leave it with this treatment for a day or two until you are safe from the hot swelling, then you dissolve it and use after that the medicines that have excess dryness, such as orris roots, cress flour, frankincense powder, and zedoary, and the like, which is to make a powder from these medicines and sprinkle it on the wound as it is dry, and in general, use a medicine in it that clarifies and does not sting.	Leave it with this dressing on for a day or two until you are sure there is no abscess; then loosen it and apply desiccant remedies such as lily roots, vetch-flour, powdered frankincense, birthwort, and the like. The method is that you make a powder of these drugs and sprinkle it, dry as it is, upon the wound; in short, in these cases use drugs whose nature is cleansing and not irritating.	0.8100071
And strive your best while treating the wound that it be clean, that there be no harm to the fat or dirt in it, and do not let pus gather in it at all, because pus, if it gathers on the brain membrane, corrupts it and rots it, so a great affliction happens to the patient from that.	In this be most diligent, that the wound, while you are treating it, be clean; nor let there be any dirty vestiges of ointment in it or any filth; and let no pus collect in it; for when pus collects on the meninges it corrupts them and renders them necrotic, which causes great harm to the patient.	0.85793126
Blackness may appear on the surface of the peritoneum of the head when the bone is exposed from it, especially if its treatment is neglected, you have observed. If the symptoms we mentioned appear to the patient, then know that he is inevitably doomed.	Sometimes the surface meninges go black when the bone is removed, especially when the treatment of them is neglected; so observe, and if the patient exhibit any of the symptoms that we have mentioned you may know that he is undoubtedly doomed.	0.7875781
And if the blackness only occurred from a medicine placed on it, and it was in the power of that medicine to cause that blackness, then it is necessary to take one part of honey and three parts of rose oil and beat them well and smear a cloth with them, then place it on the peritoneum, then treat it with the types of treatment that are necessary until it heals.	But if the blackness be due to some medicament applied to it, which has the power to produce blackness of that kind, then you should take one part of honey and three parts of oil of roses, beat them well up together, spread on a cloth and apply it to the membrane; then treat as necessary until cured.	0.8567903
