Chapter Eighteen.
On Cauterizing a Cleft Lip.
A fissure often occurs in the lip, called the harelip, especially in the lips of children, as it frequently happens. If you treat this fissure with what we mentioned in the section on incisions, and the treatment is not successful, then heat a small knife-shaped cautery iron in this manner.
Its concavity should be like the thinness of a knife. Then place it hot, quickly, into the fissure itself, until the cautery reaches the depth of the fissure. Then treat it with qayruti until it heals, God willing.
