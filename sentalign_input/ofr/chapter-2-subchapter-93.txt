of the pain that comes from flatulence
This illness is called "vakirir" in our land, and it is a pain that arises in certain limbs, and then moves from limb to limb;
and I saw what I tell you.
I was called to a sick woman, and she uncovered her arm, and I saw a small swelling in the vein of the arm;
and shortly after, I saw it rise like a worm to the shoulder, faster than anything, like quicksilver when it runs from place to place;
the pain left that place, and settled in the shoulder, and then a little later ran throughout the body, until it came to the other arm;
then she told me that it constantly moved around the body, as I saw it.
I marveled greatly how it moved thus from limb to limb, for I had never seen this illness in this way.
However, I had often seen that pain could move from place to place, but I had not seen it as I saw it in the woman;
and I thought that this was because the woman had a dry body, and uncovered veins, and because of this, this constrained flatulence appeared;
and it does not appear in this way in those who are soft/delicate, and who have moist bodies and hidden veins.
And when you want to treat this illness, and the patient feels this pain, if it appears to you as we have said, then quickly tie it above and below, and then cut into it so that this constrained flatulence at that place can come out;
and cauterize the place;
and if you do not see it with your own eyes, treat it with something that expels flatulence, like fetid pills, and pills of serapin, and other similar things.
