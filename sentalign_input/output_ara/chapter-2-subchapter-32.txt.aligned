It resembles a small beak and should be made of sharp Indian steel, very sharp at the tip. You should cut it over the course of several days, due to the hardness of the tooth and so as not to loosen other molars. But if it is protruding in a way that allows filing, file it with a file made of Indian steel, which is pictured here.	It resembles a small chisel and should be of Indian steel with a well-sharpened end. You should spread your cutting with it over several days on account of the hardness of the tooth and so as to leave the others undisturbed. If the tooth projects in such a way as to make filing possible, use a file of Indian iron, shaped like this.	0.9227694
It should be entirely made of Indian steel and its cutting edge should be very finely engraved, like the file used for making needles. File the tooth with it a little at a time, gently over several days, so you don't loosen the tooth and cause it to fall out. Then, finally, smooth and polish it with a polisher.	It should be wholly manufactured of Indian iron, its handle too, and covered with very fine points to resemble the file used in making needles. You should file the tooth with it very slowly and gently over a period of many days so as not to shift the tooth and cause it to fall out; then finally smooth it and scrape it with one of the scrapers.	0.93800485
If a part of a molar has broken off and it hurts the tongue when speaking, you should also file it down until the roughness of the break is gone and it becomes even and smooth and doesn't hurt the tongue or impede speech.	If it be a tooth of which part has broken off and it hurts the tongue in speaking, file it down till you have disposed of the roughness of the break and the tooth is smooth and neither injures the tongue nor hinders speech.	0.9016351
