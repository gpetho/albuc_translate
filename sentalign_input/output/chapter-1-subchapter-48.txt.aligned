On the cauterization for stupor.	On cauterization for numbness.	0.84674394
When any limb is numb or asleep and has been treated with medicines, oils, and plasters but is not healed, then you must cauterize the numb limb with cauteries according to its size and importance.	When some limb is affected with numbness and it is treated with drugs and ointments and plasters, but is not cured, burn the benumbed limb itself with cauterizations proportionate to its bigness or smallness.	0.8525351
And let your cautery penetrate the thickness of the skin a little. Then treat it with ointment until it heals.	Let the cauterization somewhat penetrate the thickness of the skin; then dress with ointments till healed.	0.84105873
Sometimes numbness that affects the hands and feet, the vertebrae of the back, and the emergence of the nerves that move the limb is cauterized, and the numbness is removed.	For numbness that occurs in the hand or foot it is possible to cauterize over the dorsal vertebrae at the exit of the nerve activating that part; and the numbness will go.	0.62353665
But only someone knowledgeable in the anatomy of the limbs and the emergence of the nerves moving the whole body should perform this.	This should not be attempted except by one who has a good knowledge of the anatomy of the limbs and of the exits of the nerves that move the body.	0.7567737
