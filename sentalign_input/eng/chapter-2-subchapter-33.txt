 CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE.
On interlacing loose teeth with silver or gold wire.
 When the front teeth are loosened by some blow or fall and the patient cannot bite upon what he is eating lest they fall out, and you have without avail treated them with styptic medicines, the technique in this case is to bind the teeth with gold or silver wire.
Gold is the better, for silver oxidizes and corrodes after some days, but gold remains for ever in its state and does not suffer this change.
The wire should be moderate in thickness in accordance with the distance between the teeth.
The method is to take the wire and run it doubled between two sound teeth; then with the two ends of the wire you weave between the loose teeth, either one or several, until you bring your weaving to a sound tooth on the other side; then you repeat your weaving back to the side whence you began; tighten it gently and judiciously till they do not move at all.
You should tie the wire at the root of the teeth lest it slip.
Then with the scissors cut off the two ends of the wire remaining over, and bring them together and twist them with forceps and hide them between a sound tooth and a loose tooth so as to not injure the tongue; then for the future leave them thus bound.
But if it comes undone or breaks, bind them with another wire; so may he have the use of them all his life.
This is a figure of the teeth and the manner of interlacing two sound and two loose teeth, as you see.
 After one or two teeth have fallen out they may be restored to their place and bound in as instructed, and become permanent.
This can be done only by an expert and gentle practitioner.
Sometimes a piece of ox-bone may be carved and made into the shape of a tooth, and placed in the site where a tooth was lost, and fastened as we have said, and it will last and he will get long service from it.
