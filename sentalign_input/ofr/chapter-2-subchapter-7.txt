On the blockage of ears
Some children are born without any openings in their ears; and this same thing happens to men by blockage from a wound, or from flesh born inside the ear, and this blockage sometimes occurs deep in the ear, so that it cannot be seen; and sometimes the opening is slightly closed, and it can be clearly seen.
The one that occurs deep inside, so that it cannot be seen, is difficult to heal in many cases, and in the one that can be seen, you should place the patient's ear in the sun; and look inside: if you see the apparent obstruction, open it with this spatula, of which this is the form:
And it should be sharp and cutting at the front and back, completely smooth, so that it does not injure the ear; if the blockage is from flesh born in the ear canal, hold it with fine forceps, and cut it lightly, until all that flesh is removed.
And if the blockage is deep in the ear, take a thin, light razor and heat it slightly in the fire, then place it in the ear canal.
If you feel the blockage which causes the patient difficulty hearing, pierce it lightly, and be careful not to damage the nerves of the ear; then put a tent in the ear according to the width of the opening, and moisten it with Egyptian ointment.
Do this every day until the wound is healed, or take a tent and soak it in rose water, and powder it with ground vitriol; and if you see the ear swollen, you should remove the tent and replace it with another tent soaked in cerate made with rose oil and wax, until the swelling is gone; then treat it until it is healed.
And if bleeding occurs, soak a sponge and cloths in cold water, and place it on the ear, and use other treatments that stop the bleeding which are in the treatise on distillations.
