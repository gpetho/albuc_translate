Chapter Fifty-Seven.
On the Hygiene of Boys and Treatment of Accidental Injuries that Occur to Them.
Circumcision is nothing but the separation of a connection, like other surgical procedures, but since it is done by our own will and is performed specifically on boys, we must describe the best practice for it.
And the easiest way that leads to safety. I say that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books because it was not practiced in their religions, but rather it is something we have adopted.
Through experience, I have found that most surgeons and cuppers perform circumcision using a scalpel and scissors, and they use a fibula, thread ligature, and cutting with the fingernail. I have tried all of these methods.
I have not found anything better than circumcision using scissors and ligature with thread, because when circumcising with a scalpel, the skin often adheres to it because the foreskin has two layers, and sometimes the outer layer is cut while the inner layer remains.
This necessitates another cut and renewed pain. Circumcision with a fibula risks cutting the tip of the urethra, as it may enter its opening. As for circumcision with the fingernail, the skin may slip and ruin your work, or the boy's foreskin may be naturally short...
They are often born like this, not needing circumcision, and I have seen this. As for circumcision with scissors and ligature with thread, experience has revealed its superiority to me, because the scissors cut evenly since the upper blade is like the lower blade.
So when you squeeze your hand, coordinating the two blades, they cut evenly and at the same time, so the ligature becomes like a wall for the skin of the urethra on all sides, so no error occurs at all. The method is, first, to distract the boy.
Especially if he is one of those who understand a little, that you are only tying the thread around his urethra and leaving it until another day. Then make him happy and delight him in every way you can and that his mind accepts. Then have him stand between your hands, upright.
He should not be sitting. Hide the scissors in your sleeve or under your foot; the boy's eye should not fall on them at all, nor on any of the instruments. Then insert your hand into his foreskin and blow into the skin, and lift it up until the tip of the urethra emerges.
Then clean it of any dirt that has accumulated in it. Then tie the marked area with a double thread, then tie a second ligature a little below it. Then grasp firmly with your thumb and index finger the place of the lower ligature, and cut between the two ligatures.
Then quickly lift the skin upwards and expose the tip of the urethra. Then let the blood flow a little; this is better and causes less swelling of the urethra. Then dry it with a damp cloth, then sprinkle on it some ash of burnt dried gourd, for it is the best thing I have tried, or knotgrass flour, which is also excellent.
Then apply over the powder, in a cloth, the white of a cooked egg beaten with fresh, fragrant rosewater and rose oil, and leave it on him until the next day. Then continue treating him with other remedies until he recovers.
This is a picture of the scissors that are suitable for circumcision:
They should be sharp, cutting, without any bend, with a secure screw, and the length of the two blades should be equal to the length of the two handles. As for the mistakes that occur in circumcision, sometimes the inner skin, all or part of it, folds over during the cutting, so it is necessary to immediately extend it with your fingernail before the area swells.
And cut it evenly. If you cannot hold it with your fingernail, pull it with a hook and cut it.  If three days have passed and what is under the tip of the urethra remains swollen and inflamed, leave it until the acute swelling subsides and then gently peel it off.
And cut it as much as is feasible for you, but be careful of the tip of the urethra. If a part of the tip of the urethra is cut, it will not cause harm. Treat it with wound-healing powders that we have described in the chapter on powders.
And if more than necessary is cut from the skin and it retracts upwards, it will not cause much harm either. Treat it as we have mentioned until it heals.
