Regarding the section on the illness called nafir.
This illness is called nafir in our land, and it is a pain that comes to some limbs, and is often transferred from limb to limb.
And I have seen that according to what I will tell you.
I was called to a sick woman in a village, and I uncovered her arm and saw a small swelling in the vein of the arm, and after an hour, I saw that swelling move as if a worm was climbing up, but more lightly than could be, as if it were quicksilver running from place to place.
And then the pain moved from that place and settled in the muscle, and stayed there for about an hour.
And then it ran through the body until it reached the other arm.
And then she recounted to me that it revolved throughout her entire body as I saw; and I was very amazed by the movement and the speed from limb to limb.
And I had already seen this before with my own eyes in that manner, but I have seen many cases where the pain was transferred from limb to limb.
But I did not see this with my eyes as I did in the woman.
And I do not think this is anything but because the woman was old, with a dry body and exposed veins, and in this way, that moving swelling appeared to the senses.
And it is necessary that this does not appear according to this back-and-forth movement in those who are healthy and have moist bodies with hidden veins.
And when you want the cure for this, and the patient feels that pain, then it is not apparent to you by sight as we have said, then you press on it and gently shake it until that trapped swelling comes out, and cauterize the spot.
But if you do not see it with your eyes, then you cure it with exercise of the body and with things that expel swellings, and treat them with foul-smelling pills and with serapic pills and the like.
