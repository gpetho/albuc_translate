Chapter Seventeen:
On the Cauterization of a Fistula in the Lacrimal Duct of the Eye.
When treating a fistula according to the previous divisions of diseases and your treatment does not succeed, it is necessary to cauterize in the following manner: instruct the patient to rest their head on your knee, and have an assistant hold the patient's head steady so it does not move or shake.
Then place cotton soaked in egg white or ptilli mucilage over the patient's eye.
Next, heat the cautery,
which should be concave in shape, similar to a reed or vulture's feather, with one end suitable for the cautery.
If desired, it can be penetrating to the other end.
And if you prefer, it can be a rod shape.
However, the concave one is better for your work.
Then press the fistula if it is open, extract the pus, and dry it.
If it is not open, then open it and remove the pus.
Then place the well-heated cautery on the fistula, holding it from the eye to the nose to avoid errors or disturbing the patient, and apply the cautery to the tissue to cauterize it.
If the initial cauterization reaches the bone, that is good; if not, repeat the cauterization once or twice if necessary; then leave it for three days, and apply cotton soaked in butter and cover it with a drying ointment until healed.
But if after ten days it is not healed, then apply a strong corrosive medicine until the bone is exposed and treat it as described in the appropriate chapter.
Another method of cauterizing a fistula as suggested by some early practitioners is: locate the fistula and place a fine wick in it. Then pour a small amount (one ounce) of melted lead into the fissure; hold your hand steady with the wick to ensure the molten lead does not reach the patient's eye. Place cotton soaked in egg white or water over the patient's eye, as the lead will cauterize the fistula and heal it miraculously.
If the fistula heals with the cauterization and treatment mentioned, that is good; if not, it is necessary to create a nasal passage and redirect the fistula to the nasal cavity as described in its appropriate section.
