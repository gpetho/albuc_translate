When, in the sufferer from dropsy, these swell and become full of yellowish fluid, you should cauterize the upper surface of the feet in the depression between the little and fourth toes; hold your hand upright with the cautery; do not let it slant.	When swelling occurs in the dropsical person, and yellowish water fills the feet, it is necessary to cauterize the top of the foot, specifically on the area between the little toe and the ring toe. Raise your hand with the cautery tool, do not twist it, and then lift your hand; do not repeat the procedure at all.	0.77206427
Then remove your hand and do no more cauterization whatever; for the yellowish fluid will exude. The cautery should be of this type.	This will cause the yellow water to sweat out, and the cautery should be applied as described.	0.54767704
Then sear the legs with two cauterizations on each leg; cauterize with the bladed end of the cautery, and let it be along the length of the leg: one under the knee, the other lower than that, about the middle of the leg; and two more cauterizations over each femur. Leave the burns open without treatment for a long while during which the fluid will exude from them. Then dress with all that we have described.	Then, apply two cauteries on each leg. Use the blade-like end of the cautery tool, applying it lengthwise along the leg, one below the knee and the other slightly lower, around the middle of the leg. Apply two cauteries on each thigh. Leave the cautery sites open without treatment for an extended time so that water may exude from them. Afterward, treat the area with the remedies previously mentioned.	0.8922149
