Of hemorrhoids
Hemorrhoids are of two kinds: they are either inside the anus, like grains of resin, and some are small and large, and blood always flows,
and there is one or several, and they are outside the anus and at the top of the anus; but those that are outside have little moisture,
and always ooze a little yellowish water or a little blood, and have the color of the body;
and the treatment for those who have them inside the anus is to instruct the patient to strain to go to the bathroom, until the anus comes out, and the hemorrhoids appear;
so hurry, and grab it with forceps, or hold it with your fingernail, then cut it at its roots;
and if the forceps cannot hold them because of their moisture, grab them with a cloth, or cotton, or a piece of camel hair;
and pull them out with your fingers, then cut them, and sprinkle hot powders on them in place of cautery;
or you cauterize them as mentioned in the chapter on cautery, then treat them with other treatments until they are healed;
and if the anus cannot come out, give the patient a biting and sharp clyster to wash what is in the anus, so it can come out clearly;
when the patient strains, and the hemorrhoids come out of the anus, the treatment is easy;
it is to grab them with your fingernail or forceps, and cut them, then treat them as we have said, until they are healed, and he fears the incision by iron.
So you must administer the suture in this manner: take a twisted thread, and insert it into a needle, then pull the thread through and pierce the needle on the other side, and twist the two ends of the thread under the needle,
and it should be wide; and tighten the thread firmly, then tie the thread, and pull the needle, and do the same for all the others, and leave one to drain the excess blood;
then place on the anus a cloth soaked in rose oil or wax, and place it on the anus, and instruct the patient to rest;
and then leave it until they fall, and when they have fallen, treat them with ointment and other treatment, until they are healed.
Of the drying of feces in the anus
Many times the drying of feces happens in the intestine, and by constriction of nature, and when the illness is old and medicine is of no use.
So you must scrape the top with the point of a spatula or your fingernail, which does not let it soften;
then treat it until it is healed as it should be;
and if it cannot heal, then start the scraping stronger than before, until it bleeds a lot, and is skinned;
then treat it until it is healed.
