of the nail (pterygium) of the eye
Know that the nail (pterygium) is of two kinds: one is fibrous and resembles a hard wen, and the other is not fibrous, but resembles a frozen white moisture, so that when one touches it with iron and tries to grasp it with tweezers, one cannot; and both kinds begin near the tear duct, and grow little by little until they cover all the sight and all the light and the movement of the eye. 
And the manner of the incision is as follows: the patient puts his head in your lap, then opens his eyes; and you lift the eyelid with your hand, then grasp the nail (pterygium) with tweezers with a slight twist, and stretch it upwards; then take a needle, and put in it a horsehair, or a cowhair, or an oxhair, and a strong thread; and bend the point of the needle a little and stick it in the middle of the nail (pterygium), and pierce it through with the needle, and tie the nail (pterygium) with a thread and stretch it upwards, and peel off with the hair the side of the nail (pterygium) that follows the pupil and the white of the eye up to the end, then cut the remainder at the root of the tear duct with a thin spatula and with little force, and leave the natural flesh in the tear duct, so that the flow of tears does not become habitual through the incision; and sometimes the nail (pterygium) is stretched with a hook only, and with the thread, as we have said; then it is peeled off with the spatula gently in this way:
And be careful that the spatula does not touch the fleshy membrane and tear it, and that the pupil is not pierced; and after the incision throw a little crushed salt into the eye, and some eyewash made of litharge, and leave it until the next day; then treat it with what is necessary until it is healed.
And if the nail (pterygium) is not fibrous, and you cannot push the needle in, and the hook cannot enter, this kind of nail (pterygium) is often treated with medicines; and they arise as I have described in the division, and if you wish to cut it, open the eye of the patient, and take a light, slightly sharp spatula of this shape:
And scrape the nail (pterygium) off subtly, and if you see that it diminishes a little and the scraping is effective, then drip from your mouth into the eye an eyewash made of litharge and red eyewash and crushed salt, and cover the eye until the next day; then resume the other work according to this same method, until it is all removed.
If something is wrong in the eye, such as a hot abscess, then leave it, and first treat the hot abscess until it is healed, then resume the work as before, until it is healed.
And if the appearance of the flesh of the caruncle hinders the eye significantly, then lift it with a hook, and cut a part of it and not all, so that a flow of tears does not occur; then instill into the eye a red eyewash which is made of litharge.
