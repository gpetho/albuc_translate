On the extraction of thorns and bones from the throat.
Chapter 38.
Often, a bone, a fish spine, or something else adheres in the throat.
Therefore, it is necessary to extract whatever is visible, upon which your sight falls, after pressing the tongue down with an instrument in the sunlight, and it will become clear to you what is in the throat.
And if something does not appear to you and is hidden in the throat, you must induce the patient to vomit before the food is digested in the stomach.
For perhaps the attached object will be expelled by vomiting.
Or let the patient swallow a piece of turnip, or a lettuce root, or a small morsel of dry bread; or take a piece of soft, dried sea sponge, tie it with a thread, and then let him swallow it.
Then, when it reaches the place where the spines or the bone are, it will be extracted and come out.
If it does not come out with what we have mentioned, then use a lead instrument in this shape.
Let it be slightly thicker than a rod, and at its end, let there be a curve, which is easily inserted into the throat, and let the patient keep his head elevated.
And let him avoid touching his epiglottis to prevent coughing, and let him press with it against the bone or spine, or the physician may insert it with his own hand.
But it is better if the patient inserts it himself, since he knows the location of the attached object, and he should push it downward or pull his hand with the instrument upward, in the amount prepared for him, until it is expelled.
