O you, very dear sons, I have completed for you this book which is the last of the science of medicine together with its completion, and I have made the end through its explanations and through its declarations. And it came to me in a vision that I should complete it for you with this treatise, which is part of the work of hands, that is to say, "surgery".
And because the work of hands is weakened in our region and is entirely estranged from everything, so is the science lost and broken, and nothing remains of it except the brief descriptions in books of the ancients that the hands have changed. And from this has come error and vanity, and intentions are closed and the science is removed.
Now it seems to me that I wish to revive it together with the ordering of this treatise according to the way of explanation and declaration and abbreviation; and I will bring together the forms of cautery irons, and of the other instruments of the work with the addition of their declaration and preparation, as is necessary.
And for the reason that no good masters of hands are found in our time, the art of medicine is lengthened/prolonged. And it is necessary for him who undertakes it to excel in the science of anatomy, as Galen says, so that he knows the arrangement of the limbs, and their forms and connections and separations, and has knowledge of the bones and nerves and muscles and their number, and the movement and of the moving and resting veins, and the place of their origin.
And for this reason Hippocrates says that the name without the deed is much, and with the deed is little; and especially in the art of the hand.
We tell you in the introduction to this book that whoever is not knowledgeable of the things said before, let him beware that he does not fall into error and that he does not kill men;
as I have seen many times several of those who meddle in this science and abandon themselves without knowledge and without experience.
For I saw a foolish physician who cut an abscess of scrofula in the neck of a woman, and cut the arteries of the neck; because so much blood came out that the woman fell dead in his hands.
And I saw another physician who extracted a stone from an old man, and the stone was large; so he removed with it a piece of the bladder, and the man died within three days.
And I had already been called to treat him, and I saw the condition of the patient and the size of the stone, and I knew that if it were cut he would die.
And I saw another physician who took into his care a duke of our land who had a broken leg, and with the fracture there was a wound;
and the physician, full of ignorance, pulled the fracture over the wound at the ankles with strong traction, and did not leave the wound any lint, and left him thus at the end;
and ordered him not to untie it;
and it remained so that the leg and foot were completely swollen and came to ruin.
I was called to come to him, and I hastened to come to untie the leg; and when I had untied it, he was at peace and felt no pain.
But nevertheless, the corruption was already established in the limb, and I could not heal it;
and the corruption did not cease to spread through the limb until the limb was completely lost.
And I saw another case where an abscess broke open, and then became inflamed by the malignancy of its nature.
For a cancer, when it is full of melancholic humor, should not be touched with iron unless it is in such a place that one can remove everything that is corrupted.
And therefore, dear son, you need to know that the work of hands is divided into two divisions: that is to say, work where there is danger in several ways;
and I will show in each part of this book where there is fear and danger.
Therefore it is necessary that you guard against it, so that foolish people cannot speak ill of you.
So take up your instruments cautiously, and undertake your patients lightly and firmly, and use the best method so that by the grace of God you come to salvation and are praised;
and leave the frightening diseases to serious treatment;
and remove your instruments from that which makes you doubt, and have faith in yourselves so that you may pass from this world to the next in glory.
Galen says in some of his admonitions: Do not undertake a serious illness unless you are called a fool.
I have composed this treatise according to three chapters.
The first chapter is of fire cauteries and of cauteries of sharp medicine, and the chapter is ordered from the head to the feet;
and of the forms of the instruments, and of the cautery irons, and of all that is necessary in the work.
The second chapter is of cutting and piercing, and of cupping and wounds, and of the extraction of arrows, and similar things;
and the chapter is ordered and the forms of the instruments.
The third chapter is of restoring dislocations and sprains, and similar things;
and is ordered from the head down to the feet, and of the forms of the instruments.
Before we remember the work, it is necessary that I speak of the quality of the help and harm of each complexion.
I say that the quality of help and harm is the longest speech and subtle science and the secret response;
and of this many wise men spoke, and agreed on this;
and their words suffice me little, for I fear the length.
I say that cautery universally helps every complexion where there is matter, except for two complexions: that is to say, a hot complexion without matter, and a dry complexion without matter.
In a complexion that is both hot and dry with matter, some disagreed and said that cautery is a great help; and others said the opposite: that cautery is not good for illness that comes from heat and dryness. For the nature of fire is hot, and a hot illness should not be treated with heat, nor with dryness;
and he who said the opposite said that cautery greatly helps hot and dry illnesses that occur in the bodies of men. For when you compare the body of man and its moisture to the complexion of fire, you find the body cold.
And I agree with this statement. For I have found it so sometimes by experiment.
And in any case, let no one meddle with it except he who has tested it, and who knows by long usage the chapter on cauteries, and the diversity of the complexions of men, and the dispositions and causes of their illnesses, and the occurrences and the length of time;
of other complexions we have no fear, especially in cold and moist diseases. And all the physicians assembled and agreed on the cautery.
And know, son, that cautery with fire is among the secrets of cures, and of greater benefit than cautery with burning medicine.
For fire is simple, and it comes only to the member which is burned, and harms no other member except very little.
Burning medicines spread from one member to another, and cause illnesses in the member that are difficult to heal; and perhaps kill the patient.
Fire, because of its power and the goodness of its substance, does not do this, unless there is superfluity.
And this I have found by experiment and by the length of service and study that I have devoted to the art, and it was based on the truth of things;
and therefore I excuse the length of my words, for I do not wish to withhold from you the secret which is contained in fire, and the quality of the work, how it expels the illnesses of the body, as the philosopher says in demonstrating; Therefore receive it in your thoughts.
And know, son, that they agree on what time cauterizations should be performed, and choose spring.
And I say that cautery is suitable at all times, because the arising harm is overcome by the help of cautery; and especially if the cautery is for necessary pains, strong and urgent, which cannot wait for the time lest greater harm comes to the limb.
And never think of it, dear son, as foolish physicians do; for a disease that is cured by cautery does not return; and they say it thus;
and they say it thus; but it is not as they think, because cautery is only a medicine that changes the complexion, and dries the humors that are the cause of the pain, and is better than medicine for the speed of its effect, and for the virtue of its work and its mastery.
And it is possible that the disease sometimes returns according to the patient's complexion and the location of the disease and its virulence;
and superfluities are gathered there by the consumption of food and similar things, unless cautery is applied where there is little superfluity and moisture, such as cautery of the teeth for pain, and similar things, and such pain does not return; but this happens rarely.
And many people do not understand why cautery is called the last resort of medicine, and it is true;
but they do not believe that cautery is effective after medicine, but their understanding is false, and cautery is the last resort of medicine because when we administer various treatments for a disease and they are ineffective, then we administer cautery, and it works.
Therefore, it is clear that cautery is the last resort of medicine, not according to the understanding of foolish people.
The ancients said that cautery with a golden instrument is better than with iron, and they did not say this falsely, but because of the quality of gold and the excellence of its substance;
and they said that the site of cautery does not become putrid, but this is not true for I have tested it, and found that it is true in some people;
and cautery with gold is better than with iron, as they said. And yet when you heat a golden instrument, you do not know when it is hot by the color of the gold, and it is immediately cooled;
and if one heats it too much; they do so in the fire; and thus there are enough impediments.
Now I have ordered this chapter from head to foot, so that the way may be easier to find.
This cautery is good for moisture and coldness on the brain, and there are two that are made because of an illness that is called "soda," and because of many humors that descend from the head to the eyes and ears, and for a multitude of dreams and toothache and sore throat, and likewise for all illnesses that come from coldness such as paralysis, soda, apoplexy, and similar illnesses.
The form of this cautery is that the patient be purged with a purgative medicine cleansing the head for three or four nights, according to what the strength and age and habit of the patient can endure; and then shave the patient's head.
And then make him sit cross-legged between your hands, and put his hands on his knees;
afterwards put the root of your palm on the root of his nose between his two eyes; and let your middle fingers be there, so it bleeds from there; then heat the cautery which is called "olivare", of which this is the form: And put it on the place marked with ink, and move it downwards and inwards with your hand little by little, turning it; then lift your hand quickly, and observe the place if you see the bone a little; and if you do not see it, repeat the cautery until you see the bone as I have told you;
afterwards take a little of wax, and put it in water and soak cotton in it, and put it on the place, and leave it for three days;
Afterwards, apply cotton moistened with butter; and leave it on until the burn is healed; Afterwards, treat the wound with the ointment called "tetrapharmacon" until it is healed.
And the ancients say that the longer the wound remains open, the more it purges; and therefore it helps to move (it).
And some of these say that one should leave the cautery on so long that part of the bone is burned, and then one removes what is burned from the bone, and it is healed.
And others say that one should leave the cautery on so long, and apply it so forcefully that one removes from the bone as much as a whorl that women put on their spindles so that the humors may more easily exit;
and one should leave the wound open a long time; afterwards one should treat and heal it.
And these two methods of cautery do not seem to me to be good at all, except in some people where there is cause for fear;
and more it seems to me that I ought to leave it;
for the head is weakened by the continued relaxations of nature, as we witness in other members;
and likewise when the patient's head is weak by nature, and the first type of cautery is safer and gentler for me, and of this I use the work then together for safety.
When chronic pain comes in the whole head, and lasts a long time, the patient should use herbs and pills which are called "cochie", and head purges and oils and plasters; and if cautery is performed as we have said before, and it does not help. Take care if the patient's head is of strong nature, and that it is not too cold; then cauterize a little below that cautery we have mentioned above. Afterwards, make a cautery on each temple of the head down to the bone, as we said before, and make a cautery in the place that is called "vessels"; and that is the place where cupping glasses are applied; and lighten your hand so that you do not go down to the bone: the patient feels much greater pain in this cautery than in the others, and I will speak of it elsewhere;
and it is necessary that the cauteries of the temples be more subtle than those with which one cauterizes the middle of the head, and this is the form:
of the cautery of the head When a sudden pain comes in a part of the head, and the illness extends to the eye, and the head is purged by purifying medicines, and the other treatments that I have mentioned in the division of illnesses have been done, and all this does not help: then make cauteries according to two methods, that is to say, with sharp medicine and with fire.
The cautery of sharp medicine is that you take a slice of garlic, and remove the peel and cut it in half at the two ends, and then slit the temple where the pain is in such a way that you can place the slice of garlic under the skin;
and when it is placed, tie it and bind it well and leave it thus for twelve hours; and then untie it and remove the slice of garlic, and leave the wound thus for two or three days; then apply cotton soaked in butter until the suppuration ceases.
Afterwards cure it with ointment until it is healed;
and if you wish, do this with some burning medicines that I have written in the twelfth treatise on burning medicines.
The iron cautery is in this manner. Heat the cautery of which this is the form:
And it is called "closed" because the head is made in the form of a bell or has a little curve, and in the middle a small opening;
and place it on the painful area, and hold your hand and turn the iron a little lightly, until half the thickness of the heart is burned;
and lift your hand so that the artery does not burn, which is outside, and abundant blood flows.
Afterwards, put cotton in salt water, and apply it to the area for three days; then put cotton soaked in butter, and then treat the area with ointment until it is healed;
and if you wish to cauterize this migraine with the cautery that is called "cultellare," use the point, and be careful not to cut the artery in this migraine which is not old.
of migraine
When you treat a migraine as we have said before in the divisions of diseases, and it does not improve, and you see that the cauteries previously mentioned of medicine and iron are not sufficient, then you must heat the cautery that is called "cultellare" until it is white;
and bleed thus on the painful area a line half a finger long, and remove your hand once, and be careful that you do not cut the artery and that you do not reach the bone;
and beware of the mandible which moves when one eats, and the nerve should not be affected so that it moves and that spasms do not come to the patient, and beware of the flow of blood from the artery when it is cut, or cutting causes great fear, especially to him who does not know it, and who is not a student and experienced; and leave the work half-done;
but I will tell you how to stop blood when the artery is cut, and I will show you the place where it is appropriate in this book.
And if you see that this cautery is not sufficient for the illness, and the patient is suffering, cauterize him in the middle of the head as we have said, and treat the wound until it is healed;
and if you wish, administer the cautery that we have mentioned in the chapter on the extraction of the artery, with the cautery that has two knives; and this cautery is better than that one and more helpful.
of the earache from cold
When pain comes to the ear from cold, and solutions and other treatments that we have mentioned in the division have been tried, and the pain does not cease, then heat this cautery which is called "points," of which here is the form:
Afterwards, prick all around the affected ear, or around both if the pain is in both, and move a little above the root of the ear after you have marked the place to begin; and have ten points around each ear;
afterwards, treat the place until it is healed.
Of the torture of the mouth
Torture which must be treated by cautery is nothing but that which moves from phlegm, as we have said in the divisions of diseases;
and do not apply cautery to those similar ailments that come from dryness and spasm of the nerves.
When you treat this kind of torture which moves from phlegm by means of leeches and purgatives for the head and gargles, and this is not effective, then it is necessary that you cauterize the patient with three cauteries: one at the root of the ear, and another a little outside the temple, and the third at the joining of the two lips;
and place the cautery in the area that appears healthy, and make the cautery towards the top of the ear a little below the corner of the head, and another in the temple as long as a thumb; and leave the cautery on until half of the core is burned;
and this is the form of the cautery:
And it is similar to the lancet that we have described before, but it is a little more subtle and the knife should be a little thicker;
afterwards, treat the area as I have said before, until it is healed.
When apoplexy is old and you treat it as we have said, and it does not improve, and the patient does not have a fever, then make four cauteries: two on the two horns of the head, and one in the middle of the head, and one in the place that is called "vessels" as we have said before, and the last cautery on the mouth of the stomach;
and let it be treated as we have said before.
of lethargy
For this illness, it is necessary to give the patient large herbs and pills that cleanse the brain;
after shaving the patient's head completely, and applying to the occiput the mustard plaster which is described in the treatise on plasters;
and this is the manner of cautery: if he does it as I have said.
If he is healed thus, it is good; and if he is not, make three cauteries in the middle of the head descending to the neck, and let there be a space of one thumb's breadth between each cautery;
and treat it like the others, and if you wish to add more, and the patient can tolerate it, make one cautery in the middle; and if necessary, two others on the two temples, and treat it until he is healed;
and let the cautery be that which is called "olivare," as I have said before.
It is necessary that the head be cleansed of herbs and what we have said before;
after shaving the patient's head, then make a cautery in the middle of the head and on each temple, and one behind and three on the spine of the neck;
and if you need more, and the body is moist and the patient is suffering, and the illness is severe, make four cauteries on the spine of the back; and leave them until the deepest part of the heart is burned, and lift your hand; after the cure until it is healed, and let the cautery be what is called "olivare" that we have said before.
of epilepsy
Epileptics should not use fire cautery except those who are phlegmatic, and it is necessary to first purify the brain of humors and other treatments that we have mentioned in the section when the patient is large and suffering to take medicine.
And if it is a child who cannot endure it, give him gargles and mastication purifying the brain often with good foods;
after raising the head in the middle, and make one cautery according to what we have said before, and one cautery above the vessel, and on each temple; and if the patient is strong and suffering, make cauteries as I have said for one with paralysis and softening of the body, on the spine of the back and neck, and let the cauteries be olive-shaped according to the method I have described.
If the patient is a child, make one small cautery in this manner:
When, due to melancholy, the superfluities or humors are corrupted and the phlegm is thick, then cauterize with such cauteries as we have described for one who has paralysis.
And if, due to melancholy, the superfluities are inclined towards melancholy, and the patient's body is moist, then give him something to drink to cleanse the brain, according to what is mentioned before in the division.
Afterwards, shave the patient's head; then make a well-made linen compress, like a circle, and place it on the head;
and let the patient sit cross-legged, and be well supported on all sides;
then present the liniment, and it is worth using old sheep butter; and warm it over a fire moderately, so that the fingers, when placed on it, can endure it; then empty the circle inside onto the head, and let it cool;
and do this to the patient once each week along with other good treatment, until he is healed.
Or if you wish to cauterize it, making several points throughout the cautery.
This method of cautery moistens the brain evenly;
and then apply cotton moistened in butter and chicken fat.
of the water of the eyes When water first comes to the eyes, by the signs that I have mentioned in the division, then begin and give the patient something to drink that cleanses the head, and guards it from all moisture, and make him sweat in a bath several times fasting.
Afterwards, instruct him to raise his head, and cauterize him in the middle of the head, and make two cauteries on the two temples if the descent of the water is to both eyes together, or one if the descent is to one;
and with the whole cautery cut all the veins and arteries that are below the heart, and let the cautery be long according to the width of the temple;
and guard yourself from a flow of blood, and if you see too much blood issue forth, then staunch it with such power as you have.
And I will teach you in the extraction of arteries and in the incision the precaution how you will staunch it;
and sometimes a cautery is made or applied under the two bones behind.
and one sees that it is from cold phlegmatic superfluities, then make for him the cautery that I have said at the beginning of the descending water to the eyes: I cautery in the middle of the head, and II cauteries on the II temples, and II cauteries on the nape of the neck under the two bones; and if there is more need, then cauterize him wisely above the eyebrow with one small cautery.
When you treat him according to what we have said in the division, and it does not help, then give the patient to drink III poppy heads; after shaving the head, and make a cautery in the middle of the olive-shaped cautery; and make two cauteries with the cautery that is called "clavilis" above the two eyebrows, a little below the hair;
and beware of the artery that you do not cut it.
And this is the form of the cautery that is called "clavilis":
When the eyelid is softened by illness and moisture, then cauterize it with this cautery which is called "olivare". of which this is the form:
And if you wish, make two cauteries on the two eyebrows as long as the eyebrows are;
and do not leave the hand there except until the third part of the eyelid is burned, according to the manner that I have said.
of the hair that pricks the eye Sometimes it happens that the hairs of the eyes are turned inward, and prick the eye, and cauteries are made there according to two methods: that is to say, of fire, or of burning medicine.
For the fire cautery, instruct the patient to let the hairs grow long and even; and if they prick at their base, hold the eyes steady so they do not move until they grow.
When they grow and are even, then the patient puts [them] in your lap; then draw on the paper with the eyes a figure that is like the leaf of myrtle, and let the beginning of the sign be near the hairs;
then put cotton moistened in egg white and parsley poultice on the eye, then heat the cautery of which here is the form:
Then cauterize over the figure that you have marked little by little many times, so that the flesh is burned in that place;
And the sign of the success of the work is that you see the paper retracted, and the hairs raised at the puncture of the eye;
then lift your hand, and leave it so for three days, then put cotton moistened in butter there until the burn is removed; afterwards treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if after that the hairs come, and the skin is softened, then begin the cautery again on that same place, as you did before;
and if the hairs are destroyed, cauterize it until the skin is raised to its natural place, and is even, and the hairs do not prick the eye.
The cautery of burning medicine is that you instruct the patient to let the hairs grow until they are long and even, then make from parchment the shape of a myrtle leaf;
then take of French soap and quicklime, of each one-third, and grind them well together; and do it quickly, so that it does not cool, then spread it on the form that you have made like the myrtle leaf, and place it on the skin; and if the disease affects only one eye, one should operate on one, and if on both, likewise; and place under the eye cotton moistened in egg white;
and the patient's head should be on your lap, and place your index finger on the medicine, and press it slightly and move it every time the patient feels the medicine biting, for it bites like fire.
When you have done this for a long time, remove the medicine with your finger. And when the biting sensation has passed, lift the area with water, and observe if you see the membrane raised as if it were raised by the constraint of fire or by incision; and if it is so, it is well.
If not, apply more medicine to the area where the medicine has not worked, until your work is even, and your eyes are focused;
then apply cotton soaked in butter until the burnt area is healed, afterwards treat the area with the ointment called "dyafenis" and others, until it is healed.
And if it is necessary that you guard well your work with great care that none of the medicine falls into the eyes.
And if the skin becomes soft afterwards, and the hairs prick at the eye, apply the medicine again to that area which has been softened by the skin properly, as you did before; afterwards treat it until it is healed;
and this is the form of the myrtle leaf:
And know that the eyes of men are diverse in size, and according to that should be your constraints;
and the right path should not be denied to him who studies this art.
of the treatment of fistula by cautery
When you treat a fistula, as we have said in the divisions of diseases, and your treatments do not help, then you must cauterize it in this manner.
Instruct the patient to put his head in your lap; and let the attendant hold his head between your hands in such a way that he does not move, nor lower his head;
then place moistened cotton in egg white or parsley juice on the eye;
afterwards heat the cautery which is thus:
and is shaped at the head like the form of a swallow's feather, together with which is the cautery;
if you wish, let it be pointed from one end to the other, and if you wish, let it be like a tent;
but however, this which is shaped is better for your work.
Afterwards, press the fistula if it is open, and draw out the corruption, and dry it; and if it is closed, then open it, and draw out the pus;
afterwards apply the hot cautery strongly, and hold your hand to the cautery at the part of the hip above the eye, so that your hand does not falter; and put the cautery in the fatty tissue of the eye, and burn it.
If you reach the bone with the cautery at the beginning, that would be good. If not, then repeat the cautery once more, and again if you need to, and leave it for three days;
afterwards put on cotton soaked in butter, and treat it with drying ointment until it is healed, and if forty days pass and it is not healed, then apply a corrosive medicine until the bone is uncovered; and treat it according to what comes in its chapter.
And there is a method of cauterizing a fistula that some of the ancients described. Understand [regarding] a fistula, and cut the place; afterwards put into the incision one thin cauterizing iron of which this is the form: and it is made to the quantity of a .3. of lead; and hold your hand with the cauterizing iron firmly, and the patient should not move at all, lest the molten lead run into his eye;
and it is necessary that one place on the patient's eye cotton moistened in egg white or in water:
the lead thus burns the place of the fistula, and heals it with marvelous health.
And if the fistula is healed by the cautery that we have described, that is good. If not, it is necessary to make a hole in the nose, and return the fistula to the body of the nose as it should be in its proper place.
of cracks in the lips Very often cracks in the lips occur which are called "chapped lips," and especially in the lips of children.
When you treat these cracks with what we have said in the sections, and the treatment is not effective, then heat a small knife-cautery according to this form:
And apply it quickly to those cracks until it reaches the bottom;
Afterwards, treat the area with cerate until it is healed.
When an abscess occurs in the root of the throat, or in the uvula, or on the palate, or at the roots of the teeth, after it forms pus and bursts and is old and becomes a fistula; and you treat it as we have said in the divisions, and it does not help: Then it is necessary that you apply a cautery according to the size of the fistula; after the opening or hole of the fistula, and hold your hand until the hot iron reaches the bottom of it, and the last place;
and do so once or twice, after treating it as we have said in treatments, until it is healed;
and if it is healed thus, it is good; and if not, it is necessary to uncover the place and remove the corrupted bone, according to what you will find in its chapter.
When the gums are softened by moisture and the teeth move, and you treat it with medicines and it is not effective, then place the patient's head in your lap; afterwards heat the cautery whose form will come later in such a way that you place a chain on the tooth;
and put the hot cautery inside quickly, and hold your hand so that the patient feels the heat coming to the root of the tooth;
afterwards lift your hand and repeat the cautery according to your will;
afterwards let the patient fill his mouth with salt water, and hold it for an hour and then spit it out.
And in this way the tooth which was moving is fixed, and the softened gums are restrained, and the corrupt moisture is dried.
Of the toothache
When toothache comes from coldness, or there is coldness or worms, and the medical treatments are ineffective, then cautery is needed according to two methods: and cautery by burning and cautery by fire.
Cautery by butter is such that you take cow butter, and put the end in an iron or bronze spoon; then take cotton and wrap it around the point of a tent, and soak it in boiling butter, and apply it to the aching tooth quickly and hold it until it cools;
and thus do it often until its virtue reaches the root of the tooth, and if you wish, soak wool and cotton in cold butter, and put it on the aching tooth, and put a hot iron on it until the fire reaches the end of the tooth.
The cautery with fire is such that you take an iron or bronze cautery iron, and it should be thick so that the fire does not reach the patient's mouth;
then heat the cautery, whose shape will be shown later, and put it on the tooth and hold your hand until the cautery is cooled;
do this often, for the pain will be removed that same day or the next.
And it is necessary that the patient fill his mouth with good butter at the time of this cautery, and then rinse it forcefully;
and this is the shape of the cautery:
And make a cautery of whatever head you wish, and according to what you are able;
and this is the shape of the chain:
of the scrofula When the scrofula are of phlegm and cold moisture, and are not amenable to digestion by medicines, then heat the cautery head of which the shape follows, and it shall have two openings for the fumes to escape from the cautery on the other side;
and apply the hot cautery to the abscess once, or twice if necessary, until it reaches the bottom of the abscess;
and if the abscess is small, apply the cautery according to the size of the abscess, and leave it thus for three days; and apply cotton soaked in butter until the burn is healed;
afterwards treat the area with ointments and tents until it is healed.
When the humors overcome the channels of the lung, and especially when this comes from a cold complexion, then the patient must first be purged with laxative medicines;
afterwards apply a cautery to the root of the throat, and be careful not to go down to the throat, and not to burn the heart but only a little.
Afterwards apply another cautery to the joint of the neck at the head of the spine, and let the cautery be that which is called "clavile" of which we have the form before;
and treat the area as we have said before until it is healed.
When all the illnesses of the lung are of cold moisture, and the patient has neither fever nor dryness, and the illness is chronic, apply two cauteries to the clavicle in empty places; and one other cautery in the middle of the breast between the two nipples;
and let the cautery which is called "clavile" be according to the form which is described above.
And if you wish, make a cautery by pricking with the entire cautery which is called "points," of which the form is given above, in the illness of the ears;
and let the pricks be up to thirty, or thereabouts.
After, cure the place according to what is said above, and let the cautery be in three rows according to this form:
And for this reason the cauteries are lighter, because you make three at a time.
of the dislocation of the shoulder
When the head of the shoulder is dislocated due to moisture, and it is reset but cannot stay in place, repeatedly dislocating with slight movement as we have experienced, then you must first reset the dislocation. Afterwards, let the patient be supported on his back and on his side; then lift the heart which is inside the pericardium with the fingers of your left hand;
and if the joint is dislocated inside, heat the cautery which has two nerves of which this is the form:
and cauterize the heart until it pierces it to the side, and the shape of the cautery would be like four cauteries;
and for that reason a cautery is made with the cautery which has three nerves, because of which the figures of cauterization are six cauteries;
and the nerves are according to the thinness of a tent peg and this is the form of the cautery which has three nerves:
And sometimes one nerve is added to it, because of which there are eight cauteries.
Afterwards, put on the cautery crushed poppy seeds with salt; afterwards make the patient rest, and let the limb not be moved for a long time until it is well strengthened.
And if it is dislocated above, which happens rarely, then make a cautery on the thickness of the clavicle cautery, or many cauteries by pricking.
For the joint is closed, and the moisture is removed, and the patient is healed.
When in the stomach come colds and much moisture so that it alters its complexion, and the catarrh is multiplied in him, and the usual methods of treatment do not help, then the patient must be laid on his back, and extend his legs and arms. After this, make for him three cauteries, one under the hollow of the breast, the size of a finger, with the whole clavicle cautery, and two cauteries outside the two sides so that the shape of the cauteries is triangular, and there is such space between one and another that they are not joined together when they discharge pus;
and let the cauteries be so deep that they reach the two parts of the heart, and let the shape of the cauteries be according to this form without addition:
And if you wish to cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form;
and he who is afraid of this cautery, cauterize by pricking and bleeding on the stomach at one point according to the amount you wish to remove; then cauterize with the whole cautery which is called "points".
After the treatment of the cure that we had before, until it is healed.
When pain in the liver comes from cold and moisture and great flatulence, so that it is far removed from its natural complexion by superfluities; and the patient is treated with what we have said in sections, and it does not benefit him, then it is necessary that the patient be treated on his bed; and apply three cauteries according to this form and this figure and this quantity on the liver, outside the hypochondria, where the ribs of a man come;
and let there be a space between each cautery the thickness of a finger; and let the cauteries be lengthwise along the body, and do not press your hand too hard on the whole cautery;
and let only half of the heart be burned, and let the patient be standing on his feet;
and if he cannot, let him be lying down, and extend his legs, and raise his arms;
And if it is your will, cauterize these cauteries with the cautery iron, if you are skilled and wise in the art, and beware that you do not burn the whole heart, for you would dry up the whole body; and that it does not come to a boil, for the heart is very delicate in that place, and know this for certain.
When there is an abscess in the liver, and you wish to know if it is in the flesh of the liver or in the membrane: if it is in the flesh, the patient does not feel too much pain;
and if it is in the membrane, he feels excruciating pain.
And then when this treatment weakens the eyes, it is necessary that the patient be supported on his head;
and then bleed from the area where the abscess is, and then heat the cautery which is similar to a ray, of which this is the form: And cauterize with the cautery until the core is burned, and reaches down to the syphac, until the puncture is completely open;
after the treatment, according to the treatment of fistulas, until he is healed;
and it is not necessary that anyone use this cautery except those who have long studied the art of medicine, and by whose hands these diseases have sometimes been cured.
Then he can boldly operate, and yet it seems to me that leaving it is better.
Of the cautery of pleurisy.
The ancients said that for pleurisy one should make cauteries of the roots of aristolochia, and in this manner: take a long aristolochia root, the largest you can find, and let it be dry, and let it be as thick and as long as your fingers; and grind it in oil, and apply it to the fire, and cauterize I cautery between the clavicle and the neck, and II small cauteries a little lower in the part which is under the chin;
and II cauteries between the fifth rib and the sixth, leaning back a little; and I cautery in the middle of the breast, and I other on the stomach, and I between the two shoulders, and II at the two sides of the breast outside the cautery which is between the two shoulders;
and do not press your hand, but act openly as if in smelling.
And some ancients said that some men use a fire cautery similar to a razor, and heat it and place it between the ribs, until it reaches that abscess; and the pain leaps out, as we have said in the abscess of the liver.
But in this work there is fear that the patient dies immediately, or a fistula develops which cannot be healed.
of the mice
When you treat the disease of the mice, as we have said in the divisions of treatments, and it does not help, then there are three kinds of cautery that are all good.
Of which one method is that you make three cauteries, or four, in a line according to the length of the mice, according to the figure of the liver cautery that we have mentioned before;
and do not press your hand on the whole cautery, and let the patient often lie on his back;
and another method of cautery is that you heat the cautery which has two nerves, as we have shown it in the dislocation of the shoulder;
and lift the heart which is in the place of the mice, or the pain of the patient comes from the left, and let the elevations by which you lift the heart be according to the heart, according to the length of the body, and the cauteries be according to the width of the body.
Afterwards put the two burning nerves in until the heart is pierced on the other side, and then pull out the cautery, and thus there will be four.
And if you wish, cauterize with the whole cautery with three nerves.
After the treatment, when it has expelled pus for a long time, and this is better than the other treatments mentioned before.
Cautery is not useful for a dropsied person, except in the manner that is called "asclytes".
When you treat it according to the methods we have described in the divisions, and your treatment does not help, then you must make four cauteries around the belly, and one on the stomach, and one on the liver, and one on the spleen, and two on the back along the spine, and one near the breast; and let the cautery be very close to the thickness of the heart.
Afterwards, leave the cautery open to discharge pus for a long time, and do not neglect the treatment of the patient after the cautery; and healing will be hastened, and the two intentions will be combined with God's help.
The shape of the cautery for the belly should be the little peg that we have shown before; and that for the back should be olive-shaped, according to what is shown above.
When the feet are swollen in one who is dropsical, and are full of citrine water, it is necessary that you cauterize on the back of the foot between the little toe and the ring finger; and lift your hand with the cautery without turning.
And do not enter too deeply, lest the citrine water be ignited, and let the cautery be according to this form:
Afterwards, make on the two legs two cauteries on each leg at the tip of the little toe; and let the cauteries be long, one below the knee in front and the other behind, in the middle of the leg;
and leave the cauteries open a long time without dressing, so that the water may flow out;
after the treatment of the other treatments that we have mentioned.
When looseness of the bowels comes from cold and moisture, so that the retentive and digestive powers which are in the stomach and in the intestine are weakened, and cannot be cured by methods of treatment; and you see the patient well-bearing and of strong virtue, then make a large cautery on the stomach according to what has been spoken of above in the cautery of the stomach, with the circular cautery; and four small cauteries around the buttocks, with one small claviform cautery, and two cauteries on the hips.
And if you see abundant moisture and the patient suffering, then make a cautery on the wrist, and one cautery on each flank, and two small cauteries on the stomach beside the large one, for the treatment is beneficial when there is good assistance.
Of the treatment of hemorrhoids
When hemorrhoids are in the fundament, one or more, and are old and are of large, cold, and moist corrupt humors, and are treated as we have said in the divisions, and it does not help, then make cauteries: three on the spine of the back, that which is entirely outside below the armpit little by little in a triangle, and one cautery below the buttock two fingers;
and if you think that his stomach is cooled, and the food does not digest, and one sees the face swell, then make one large cautery on the stomach, as is said before, and another on the liver, and another on the spleen with the clavicle cautery; and leave the cautery open a long time. After, cure the place until it is healed.
When you cut the thelul, heat the cautery which resembles a razor, and then put it, burning, on that cut thelul; and leave your hand there until the cautery reaches the origin of the vein, from which the blood flows;
do this once or twice, and if there is much thelul, cauterize each one as we have said; afterwards cure it with helpful ointments until it is healed;
and if you cauterize with a large cautery on alchatim, it will have greater help.
When the patient cannot tolerate incision or opening, which we will discuss in its place, such an illness arises that it cannot be healed except by cautery.
When a fistula occurs in someone, and it is old and discharges pus and corrupted moisture, you should probe it entirely with a thin tent, and ensure you know exactly how deep the tent goes.
Then heat the cautery, which resembles a razor, and insert it into the fistula according to how far the tent entered, and repeat the cautery until the rotten and corrupted flesh is burned, once, or twice, or three times, according to the need;
and beware of burning the nerves that are there, and the large veins.
If the fistula goes to the body of the bladder and the intestine, beware of those places, and do not apply the fire except in fleshy places, and intend that it is not penetrating;
Afterwards, treat the area until it is healed, and if the wound is sealed, and the matter has been removed for a long time, then know that the area is completely healed;
and if the matter is not removed, know that the area is perforated, and the bone at the bottom is corrupted; and thus like one of those that we shall say in its place.
When cold pain comes to the kidneys, and from great flatulence, and he does not desire a woman, then you must cauterize him on the kidneys on one side and the other with the cautery iron that we have mentioned before;
and if we cauterize him in the middle, there will be three cauteries in a line, and they will provide greater help.
Of the bladder When the bladder is soft and weak from cold and moisture, so that the patient retains urine, then cauterize him in the outer part above the bladder, where the hairs of the groin begin, and one on the right and one on the left, and let each cautery be as long as the width of a thumb;
and make one cautery on the outside of the back, or two if you need them;
and let the cauteries be peg-shaped according to the form previously described.
When the womb is cold and moist, and does not allow conception for that reason, and the flowers (menstruation) are corrupted and their timing is delayed; and when they come, she feels great pain: then it is necessary that three cauteries be made around the buttocks, as we have said in the cautery of the bladder, and two cauteries on the outside of the back;
and let the cautery be deeply burned, as we have said.
When viscous humors descend to the hip joint, and because of this it moves from its place, and the sign is that the thigh is longer than the other when measured together;
and the place of the separation is found empty, then you must cauterize the patient over the hip joint with one cautery resembling a circle, and bleed in front of the place around the joint as it turns, so that the joint is inside the circle;
and let the cautery be like that with which one cauterizes the stomach.
And if this cautery is not present, make three cauteries of olive size, and let the cautery be as deep as all the fingers;
and cure it until it is healed.
of the hip pain When pain comes in the hip joint, and it is from cold and moisture, and the patient is treated with what we have said in the division and the treatment is not effective, and the illness is old: then you must purge the patient of the gross humors with fetid pills, or other similar good pills. Afterwards, apply a cautery;
and the manner of the cautery is according to two methods: that is to say, with burning medicines, and fire cautery.
Fire cautery is done in many ways, of which one is this:
that you cauterize on the hip bone three triangular cauteries according to this form, and make them deep and large, and have between each cautery the width of a finger, and let the cauteries be olive-shaped;
sometimes a cautery is made in the middle on the head of the hip, so that there are four according to this form:
And if you wish, cauterize it with the circular cautery that we have previously mentioned in the hip dislocation;
but do it in such a way that the circle contains the whole hip, and all the thickness of the flesh is burned.
And this is the method used in sciatica, when the pain is in the hip, and does not reach the thigh or leg.
And if it reaches the thigh and leg, make two cauteries where the patient says the pain is, and one cautery above the ankle four fingers, on the left side a little;
and let the cautery be knife-shaped, and let the thickness of the flesh be burned;
and if the patient feels that the pain extends to the toes or near them, cauterize where he feels the pain three or four points with the cautery which is called "points". And if necessary, make more for him;
and if he knows that the pain is below the knee towards the thigh, make a cautery with a knife-shaped or circular cautery, and take great care in all your cauteries that you do not leave the cautery on so long that you burn the nerves and the large arteries, and that you do not cause the patient greater harm and contraction.
And I myself have seen many who have made a cautery on the ankle of the foot, and left it on so long that the leg was completely swollen, and the foot also, and the whole foot was pierced and corrupted. After a bowel movement from which he died.
And if the pain is in two parts together, make a cautery in one and in the other, according to this manner.
And the wise men said, in the cautery of the hip, of which this is the manner, make one such iron and let it be at the head as thick as a date pit, or a little less, and let it be between the ribs and let it be from one rib to the other in width the quantity of a thumb's breadth;
and let the ribs be open on two sides, and let them be also like knots, and let there be a well-made iron handle;
and this is the form:
And let it be heated until it is all red and throws off sparks, and then put it on the hip joint that is diseased, and let it be turned towards the healthy side;
and cauterize it once, the cautery round, and leave it for three days; and then make a plaster of butter, and leave the wound open a long time; after the treatment with ointment until it is healed.
Albucasis says that we use little of this cautery because of the fear of its effects, and we see few who use it;
and yet it is one of the good cauteries, for those who can endure it, and where it is appropriate.
The cautery of burning medicine is that you make an instrument with interlocking parts in which the edges of the door descend, and it should be of bronze or iron with a long side, and in height it should have two fingers' breadth, and between each the quantity of the thickness of a finger; and they should be open on the outside and above, and join together according to this form:
Then place the box on the hip of the patient lying on his healthy side, and press your hand very much on the box of the hip; afterwards pour between the two circles hot water which has been heated in the fire for a while, and let it remain for an hour, and let the patient suffer the heat and burning from it.
For it produces a burning sensation like that of fire;
and when the burning is past, lift your hand with the instrument and lift the hip from the warm water, and leave it so for three days, and apply butter until that which is black from the burn is removed; and leave it for three days so that the corruption is drawn out;
and this would be the final remedy after the treatment with ointments until it is healed.
And if the pain has extended to the thigh or to the leg, make for it an instrument that holds water according to what you have done to the hip equally;
and this is the manner of hot water, and I have written it in the treatise on the rectification of medicine. Take alkali and quicklime, as much of one as of the other, and grind them together, and put them in a new pot. where there is a small hole outside so that the point of a razor can enter;
where there is a small hole outside so that the point of a razor can enter; and place on that pot another pot well sealed, and put on top alkali and lime and sweet water, until there is a finger's breadth above the powders when you have pressed it well with your hand;
and leave it thus until water descends and falls into the sealed pot, then take all that water, and pour it over lime and alkali as before.
And then it will be very strong and is administered in many medical operations and in cauteries of other members.
For it does the same work as fire, and there are other medicines with which one cauterizes the hip well, such as tesisie and honey anacardi and lime with soap, all these things mixed together.
And Galen tells us of a cure by which a man was cured of the hip pain and sciatic vein, and he praises it greatly, and says that no other cure was done, and that he was healed at one time when this cure was done, and he was bathed as he teaches hereafter.
And he says in this manner that you take fresh and dry green litharge, and grind it very finely with a little fat, and apply it to the hip and thigh and leg where the pain is, and bind it;
and leave it for three hours, and according to the amount that the patient no longer feels the burning.
And then make him enter the bath until his body is slightly warmed, and make him enter the bed, and the pain will all go away and he will be healed.
And know that no one should use cautery with such medicines, unless it is after the evacuation of the body.
And Dioscorides says that when the sciatic vein is cauterized with goat dung, it helps very much;
and the cautery should be done in this manner. Take wool and soak it in old oil, and place it on the small hollow that is between the thumb of the foot and the other which is called foscile.
Then take dried goat dung, and heat it in the fire until it is embers, and put it on the wool, and leave it until it is extinguished;
and do it again in this way, and do not cease doing so until you think by feeling that it reaches the hip, and that the pain has ceased;
and this manner of cautery is called "goat cautery".
of the pain of the back
When pain comes to the back, whether from a fall or from a blow or from too great an evacuation, or from similar spread cold matter, in none of these cases is cautery of value, except for that which comes from the infusion of cold matter.
It is necessary that after the patient is purged of foul pills or others similar, that one makes on his back, there where the pain holds, three lines marked with ink, and in each line five cauteries or more according to the strength and quantity that the patient can endure;
and let the cautery be made according to the cautery which is called "points";
and if you wish, make three cauteries or four with the middle nail cautery according to this form:
Many times this illness comes to small children, and the sign of the beginning is that they have shortness of breath when they rise, and fear; and you find in the last spine of the back and in us the appearance which comes upon the other spines.
When you see this and you wish to cure it, cauterize it with the circular cautery according to this form. So that the cautery equally encompasses each part of the spine.
And if you wish, cauterize around the spine with the pointed cautery two or three lines, and let the points be close to one another.
After, cure the place until it is healed according to what we have said, and beware that you do not apply cautery to a gibbosity which is in a spasm of the nerve.
Of the pain of the joints
When joint pain is from humors that are spread to each limb of the body, and when pain comes in the feet, which the Greeks properly call "podagra," and when it is from a cold cause and cures by medicines cannot cure it, then it is cured by cauteries in this manner:
Make many cauteries around the joint of the foot, and let the cauteries be olive-shaped according to this form:
And if there is need that you cauterize on the surface of the foot, make a cautery there, the whole cautery that one calls "point. And if the pains come down to the knees and to the other joints, and this happens many times, make cauteries on each knee, three or four on each side, with the whole olive-shaped cautery;
and if you need more, then make more, but do not hold your hand there longer than until the thickness of the heart is burned.
And if the pains descend to the knee and to the back, administer the cautery that we have described in its chapter.
And if the pains are in the hands, make points around the wrist, two lines;
and if some pain remains in the fingers, make points on each joint and on the palm of the hand;
and if the pains come down to the elbows or to the shoulders, cauterize each part, and give good care to the patient and administer medicines.
For if you give him good care and you purge phlegm, he will be healed with God's help.
When a rupture occurs in the groin, and the bowels descend into the scrotum and this is recent, it is necessary that when you wish to cure it, he not eat that day; and that he use things that loosen the bowels, so that the feces descend from his belly;
Afterwards, make him sit on his back between your hands, and instruct him to hold his breath until the bowels are replaced, and push them back with your fingers, and make a sign below the rupture on the pubic bone, and with a whole sign that resembles half a circle above the body;
then heat the cautery of which this is the form:
until it is white and emits sparks. Then return the bowels to their place; and the assistant hold his hand above so that they do not return backwards;
and spread the patient's thighs well, and place a cushion under him and a servant on his thighs, and another on his chest who holds his hands;
then place the cautery on the mark with your whole hand, and hold it straight and hold it until you reach the bone, and if you do not reach it the first time, repeat it again until you reach the bone; and guard subtly that the bowel does not protrude when you apply the cautery; that you do not burn it; and that thereby the patient does not die, or suffer other harm.
And know that when you do not reach the bone with the cautery, your work is worthless.
And it is necessary that the cautery for children be small according to their size, and for adults also large according to their size;
after three days, cure the cauterized area with butter until the burn is gone;
afterwards cure it with other ointments until it is healed, and let the patient lie on his back for forty days until the wound is well healed;
and it is necessary that his diet be light for a long time, so that his bowels do not become active when he attempts to go to the privy.
And after forty days, when he wishes to get up, give him a well-made bandage, and let him wear it for another forty days;
and let him have good rest, that he work little and guard himself from too great repletion of drink and food, and from too much loud laughter;
and when he has followed this instruction he is completely healed.
And I shall describe the treatment of a wound in its chapter.
When ruptures occur in other bellies and are known, and you see that they are not growing any more, make a cautery of the round cautery according to its size, and let a third of the core be burned; after the treatment according to what we have said;
and some of the ancients have said that one should cauterize it with a three-angled cautery according to this form:
but first mark the place with ink and make a line across the width above the rupture, and another outside, and hold your hand in the middle with the whole cautery clamped.
But the first cautery is lighter and better.
of old pain in any limb When pain comes in any limb, whether from a fall or a blow, and that pain lasts a long time, and the cure of medicine is of no use, then it must be cauterized with the cautery which is called "points", and let the cautery be according to the length of the limb and its smallness and its weakness and its virtue and its location of torsions and its pain.
If he is healed by the first cautery, it is good;
if not, begin another cautery on that one, for such is the custom that it must move to the limb that is near it, wherefore it is necessary that you make the cauteries until the patient is healed.
Lepers are sometimes helped by cautery with great help, and likewise the illness that comes from the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy.
When you see it cauterized, take care if the illness is at the beginning, and if it is cured according to what we have said in the division, and does not descend or remain, and you doubt that the corruption will seize the whole patient, then make five cauteries on his head: one in the middle of the head at the nape, and another towards the forehead at the hairline; and two on the two temples, and one behind on the occiput;
and leave your hand there until the cautery reaches the bone, and until the scabs come out so that the vapors of the thick humors can escape;
and cauterize it on the affected part according to what is described above.
And if the leprosy is spread everywhere; and it is clearly evident, then you must cauterize it with the cauteries we have mentioned on the head, and one cautery in the middle of the nose, and two cauteries on the spine of the neck, and six cauteries on the spine of the back, and one large one on the rump and one other next to it, and two on the two shoulders; and two on the buttocks, and two on the breasts, and one on each joint of the hands and feet, and on the hollows of the hands;
and beware of the nerves that are on the heel, that you do not burn them;
and sometimes one makes a cautery on the bone of the wrist, and another on the bone of the stomach, and another on the liver.
And know that the more cauteries you make, the more help you give, and the more it benefits him;
and know that the sick person does not feel any pain from the cautery as healthy people do, because the body is already all corrupted.
And it is necessary that the cauteries be large and small according to the limbs and joints, according to what you will find it in the manner of irons.
Afterwards, treat the place with barley flour with honey and other treatments until it is healed.
When swelling comes in any limb and is treated with medicines and oils and plasters, and it is not healed, then make cauteries on the limb according to the size of the limb;
and let the cautery be somewhat deeply penetrating into the thickness of the flesh; then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
And sometimes a cautery is made on the hand and on the foot and on the back, at the exit of the nerve that moves the limb, and in this way the swelling is removed;
and however, let no one interfere unless he is knowledgeable of the limbs and the exits of the nerves moving the body.
When the disease that is called "albaras" is old, and the devices of medicine are of no use, then cauterize it with a cautery a little deeply, according to the quantity of the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness is removed, and its color is changed;
then treat it with flour of vetch and lentils with rose oil and plantain leaves, and pigeon blood and swallow blood, of each one part; and let it all be mixed together, and be bound with a cloth, and be left in place until it is healed.
The treatment of cancer by cautery
When cancer appears at the beginning, and you wish to stop it, cauterize it with a cautery that resembles a circle, all around the edge of the cancer.
And yet the wise men say that one should also cauterize the middle of the cancer;
and yet that does not seem good to me, for I fear that it will be ulcerated and corrupted, and I have already seen that happen sometimes;
and a more straightforward thing is that it be cauterized around, with the cautery that is called "circular," as we have said in many cauteries.
When someone has a disease that is called "adubelati," and it delays in maturing, either because of the superfluity it causes or because of the age of the patient when he is decrepit (that is to say, very old) and he has little blood, or because of the season; and you want to hasten its maturation: then cauterize it around with many small, piercing cauteries; afterwards leave it thus. For it will hasten to mature.
And if you want to pierce it with the whole cautery, then heat the cautery of which this is the form:
And place your hand in the middle of that illness which is called "adubelati" until the cautery has pierced the core, and let the cautery be such that the patient feels it from the outside in such a way that the course of the putrefaction is alleviated.
Afterwards, treat it until it is perfectly healed.
There is another kind of illness which is called "corrodens", and it is nothing other than a consumption of the limb, for it eats away the limbs like fire eats dry wood.
If you see this illness in a place that can withstand cautery with fire, then heat the cautery pins, small and large, according to what is needed for the place where the illness is;
after cauterizing on all sides until you eradicate all the corruption, and nothing of it remains, so that all that is corrupted is removed.
And then leave it for three days, and put on the cauterized places crushed sulfur with oil until the burns from the fire are removed, and all the corruption.
Then treat it with ointments that generate flesh.
And if you see after three days that healthy flesh does not grow, that is good;
and if not, then repeat the cautery on what remains of the corrupted areas.
And this disease has sometimes been cured by a liquid medicine instead of fire cautery;
but still, fire cautery is of greater help, and I have already described the treatment with liquid medicine in the section: take it when you need it.
of the swellings that come on the feet Very often it happens that on the feet, from without, a disease arises which is called "clos" according to our understanding, and it is a large, swollen thing which injures the foot.
And the cautery for this disease is according to two methods. That is to say, cautery by fire, and cautery by hot water.
Cautery by fire is that you heat a cautery iron as if it were a goose feather, and it should be made of good iron to the measure that it can encompass the nail on all sides, and that it has fine edges;
afterwards put it, all hot, on the nail, and turn your hand all around the nail until it reaches the bottom of the nail; and leave it thus for three days until it begins to shed pus; then make a plaster of wild mallows crushed with oil, and leave the plaster on all night, and the nail will fall and be uprooted from its roots.
Then cure the place with flesh-generating ointment until it is healed.
And if they are turned outwards from the body, and this often happens in hands and feet, then you must apply a cautery of hot water; and it is in this manner: take a chain of brass or iron, or a goose feather, and put it on the nail and the althelul, that is to say, warts; and put the chain on so that it encompasses all around, then put a little hot water on it, and hold your hand well, and press your hand turning so that the edge of the chain comes to the root of the nail, and the hot water can find a deep path to the root;
and let the patient suffer the biting of the hot water a little for an hour; then leave it thus, and it will be uprooted entirely with all its roots.
Do this one after another, until you have uprooted all those that are on the body, then cure them with ointments that generate flesh.
When someone trembles from coldness of the nerves, or from a quartan fever or another, you must make four cauteries on the spine of the back, one cautery between each spine; and one cautery on the feet, and one on the stomach with an olive-shaped cautery;
then the trembling will cease, and the health from the cold illness will hasten.
Sometimes there appear on the outside of the body boils, or foul pustules, which come from large corrupted matters.
then it is necessary, when they first appear, that one makes a cautery on each head of the pustule: a subtle cautery of myrtle wood, of which the point is seized in the fire, or of the root of aristolochia longa, or with the lenticular cautery.
And sometimes they are cauterized at the beginning when they appear, in this manner, and they cannot grow further, but the superfluities from which they come are broken up, and they are healed;
but it is necessary that this be done after the evacuation of blood.
Often great flows of blood occur from the artery which is cut in the wound which comes from a burn, or in the incision of the abscess, or in the cautery of the limb, and similar things; and it is a very difficult thing to stop.
And however when this happens to someone, quickly put your index finger on the wound of the vein, and press it tightly until the blood is stopped under your finger, and no drop comes out anymore;
then put in the fire several olive-shaped cauteries, small and large, until they are all red;
then take one, either large or small according to the wound and the place where the artery is broken, and put the cautery on that vein where you hold your finger, and hold the cautery there until the blood is stopped.
And if it spurts out when you lift your finger from the vein, and the cautery is extinguished, quickly take another of the cauteries that are in the fire.
And do not cease doing this, one after the other, until the blood is stopped;
and beware that you do not burn the nerve which is nearby, and that no other harm comes upon the patient;
and know that when blood flows from the artery, one cannot easily stop it, especially when the artery is large, unless it is by one of the four methods that we have mentioned: either by cautery, or by extraction when it is not treated, or by strong binding with thread, or by medicines applied which have the power to stop blood; and let it be bound and compressed tightly.
He who attempts to stop the bleeding by tightly binding with cloths or by applying burning things, or other similar things, will benefit little.
And if this happens to someone and he does not have a remedy or medicine present, he should place his index finger on the wound of the vein as we have said, and press firmly until the bleeding is stopped above the wound and above the vein; and not move the finger, but moisten it with cold water often, that it be very cold until the blood is congealed and thickened and the bleeding stops;
and then do what is necessary with cauteries and medicines.
We have told you in the first chapter every illness in which a fire cautery, or burning medicine, is necessary, and the indications, and the causes, and the instruments, and the forms of cauteries;
and I have placed that chapter from the head to the feet, and I will proceed in this chapter by the same method so that one may find more easily what one wants.
And before I begin this, dear son, it is necessary that you learn that in this chapter there is more peril and fear than in the first of cauteries, and therefore greater caution is necessary.
For in the work of this chapter there is often evacuation of blood in opening a vein, and in the incision of an abscess, and in the treatment of wounds, and in the extraction of arrows, and in the incision of a stone, and similar things; where there is doubt and fear, and death comes to many.
And I warn you that you do not undertake folly. For many kinds of people come for treatment. Some come who are so afflicted with their illness that they die easily because of the madness they find in their illness and the magnitude of its malice; and one must be afraid of these.
And among these are those who give you their senses, and say: Wait, I am healed"; and the illness is spiteful.
It is not fitting that you consent to those who come to you who have this manner, but place greater trust in your honor than in your greed, and do not work foolishly but wisely on that which you are certain, and from which you can have profit and praise;
and use prognosis and indication in the treatment of your patients to which salvation should be directed;
and this will help you to acquire good reputation, and glory, and memory of praise.
My dearest son, may Our Lord grant you good understanding and righteousness, and may He inspire you with the holy inspiration of His hand, amen.
Now I have arranged this chapter in divisions by chapters, according to that which is before in the chapter of cauteries, which I have described for you from head to foot, so that you may more easily find that which you will need.
Know that this illness often comes to children at birth, and when the midwife pulls the child's head too hard;
and sometimes it comes from a hidden cause that one does not know.
And I never saw this illness except in children, and in all those whom I have seen, death hastened; and for that reason it seems to me that it is better for me to leave the work in such treatments.
And I saw a child whose head was full of water, and the head swelled each day until it could not support it;
and the moisture grew so much that he died, and this moisture is gathered under the bone on the dura mater, between the brain and the bone;
and the operation is such that if the moisture is between the brain and the bone, and the abscess is small, that you cut into the head a wide incision;
and let it be as long as two fingers, so that the moisture runs out;
And here is the shape of the spatula:
If the moisture is deeper, and the abscess is larger, make two incisions in the manner of a cross, according to this form:
And if the moisture is below the bone, and the signs that you see the sutures of the head open on each side, and the water spurts out when you press it with your hand from the inside, and this is not restored to you: then you must make three incisions in the middle of the head in this manner:
And after the incision, extract all the moisture. Afterwards, dress the incisions with cloths and powders, and apply wine and oil, and leave it thus until the fifth day;
then unbind it, and treat the wound with tents and ointments, and let the head be bandaged evenly, and give the patient dry meat with little moisture until the limb is strengthened and healed.
And another method of incision is that you observe where the size of the abscess and the collection of water are apparent;
for sometimes it is in front; sometimes behind; sometimes on the right; and sometimes on the left.
Therefore, cut where the abscess appears, and the collection of water, and make an opening according to your ability;
and be careful not to cut the artery; and a flow of blood comes, so that the patient dies from the bleeding and the evacuation of moisture.
When someone has a disease called "catarrh" in the eyes or chest, and the disease is old, and medical treatment does not help, then the last resort is cautery, with the cutting of the two arteries.
Therefore, when you want to cut them, the patient should throw back his head; then rub the area with a rough cloth until the arteries appear, then the patient should constrict his neck with the whole cloth; then look where the vein beats, and the location of one and the other is behind the ears, and they are somewhat hidden;
then mark the places with ink, then cut one and the other with a sharp spatula on two sides, until the cut reaches the bone, and this should be across the width of the head.
And if you wish, place the spatula under the artery and cut above it, cutting as if with two fingers across.
And when the vein is cut, the blood spurts upwards continuously.
And if the artery is not felt, you must measure the space of three fingers, then mark with ink and cut down to the bone;
and the amount of blood to be let out is six ounces, and perhaps a little more or less, depending on what the patient can tolerate, and the fullness of the artery;
then examine the wound: if there remains a point of the dura mater on the bone, cut it so that no abscess forms there, then bind the wound tightly and treat it with ointment until it is healed.
of migraine When chronic migraine occurs, and acute catarrh, due to the moisture of the tears and the heat in the temples and old, raging thirst and similar things, and it is treated by various methods of medical treatment and none of it benefits, then we bleed the arteries of the temples and cauterize them, as we have recounted.
And the method of their extraction is that the patient should push back the hair from his temples, and find the artery which appears in the temple, for it appears clearly by its pulsation, and is quite superficial except in some men who are very cold;
and if it is deep, let the patient draw back his skin with some cloths, then rub the area with some rough cloth, and wash the area with warm water until the artery appears clearly; then take the spatula of which this is the form: then lightly scrape the skin until you reach the artery, then pull it upwards with forceps, and separate it well from the tissues that are underneath it on each side;
and if the artery is small, then turn it with the point of a hook, then cut it from that side according to the quantity of two fingers. For if it is not cut, the blood will not flow out completely.
And draw out six ounces of blood, down to three;
and if the artery is large, then you must tie it in two places with a strong double silk thread, so that putrefaction does not occur before the closing of the wound, and that there is a continuous flow of blood;
then cut the excess that is between the two ligatures at that very moment, and then, if you wish, cauterize it with a knife cautery down to the bone until the fingers are cut;
and this is the best procedure, if the patient does not have a fever and is of a warm complexion. For cautery helps to eliminate moisture: therefore it is of greater help for moistures.
Where it is necessary for the extraction of arteries that one fill the area with old cotton and place well-made tents on top;
and when they are untied, it should be treated with dry medicines that cause flesh to grow, and with tents, until it is healed;
and if blood flows from the artery as long as you work there, hasten to cauterize it, or fill the area with vitriol and press it with your hand so that the blood is stopped; and if you do not have that present, put your finger on the area until the blood is congealed, and sprinkle the area with cold water until the bleeding stops, and it should be extracted as necessary;
And there should be a finger's breadth of thickness between the two knives, and then when you have marked the two places, and you place the burning iron there until it reaches the bone, and cut the vein in two places; and they should be separated between the two ends because it is not completely sealed by this cautery;
and this is the form of the cautery:
and that which is gentler and easier in the extraction of the artery is that you cauterize the vein with this sharp cautery on two sides, but the cuts should be thick to retain their heat longer. For when the instrument is too thin, it retains its heat less.
of tears When tears from the eyes are descending from the veins that are on the head of the forehead, and no medicinal cure benefits, and you see the face of the patient redden, and he feels a pulsation in the forehead like a tremor; and his face is swollen and moist so that the hairs of the eyelids have fallen out, and the eyelids are heated, and scalded by the burning of the tears, then this treatment is necessary. And the ancients called it "contus cure," and it is that you make the patient who has this illness shave the hair from his forehead, then make three incisions on the forehead equally along the length of the forehead;
And the ancients called it "contus cure," and it is that you make the patient who has this illness shave the hair from his forehead, then make three incisions on the forehead equally along the length of the forehead; and let one of the incisions be like two fingers across the middle of the forehead going down to the nose, and the other two at the two temples above the eyelids, and beware of cutting the arteries that are at the two sides above the eyelids;
and keep your hand away from the area between the two jaws, and let each wound be the size of three joined fingers across;
and have ready a piece of sponge and many cloths to wipe the blood, then apply the sharp spatula from two sides, of which this is the shape:
from the incision that is towards the temple to the second incision; and scrape all the skin that is between the two incisions to the entire surface that is on the bone, then do likewise from the middle incision to the other second, and then remove this spatula. then place in the first incision the instrument which is called "cultellary", and is very sharp on one side, and on the other side is smooth, not sharp, and this is its shape:
And place the cutting side towards the raw flesh of the skin, and the smooth side towards the bone, and push it until it reaches the middle incision.
And cut all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes until the incision is continuous up to that which appears of the skin, and then likewise do in the middle incision up to the other outside;
and then draw out the blood equally, and press the place for the blood taken;
then put in each incision a tent of old cotton, and put on cloths moistened in wine and oil and vinegar, and guard against hot abscesses coming there;
and on the third day untie the ligature, and administer a great quantity of warm water there, then treat it with basilicon ointment with rose oil, and other treatments with which one treats wounds, until it is healed.
When to someone comes an acute catarrh habitually, and you see the eyes swollen and small, and the sight weakened, and the eyelids burned; and the hair falls out, and in the head there is acute pain, and the patient sneezes; then know by these symptoms that this matter and that catarrh comes forth only from many veins, and the best treatment that there is, is this.
And it is that you instruct the patient to raise his forehead, then make a large incision in the middle of the forehead, and another of about one inch. And begin from the incision of the left temple to the right temple, and let the incision be to the bone; and keep your hand away from the nerves of the temples that move when eating;
and when the bone is uncovered, wipe away all the blood with a sponge, and then separate the two lips of the incision and place old cotton and linen tents there; then bind over it cloths moistened in wine and oil, and beware of a hot abscess;
when it is removed, you must rub the bone until flesh begins to grow there, then treat it with drying things, which cause flesh to grow.
In this manner: take two parts of wheat flour, and four parts of colophony, and make a plaster; and apply it to these wounds to grow flesh everywhere.
Of the deafness of the ears
All that falls into the ears is one of four things: either grains, or an animal, or a mine stone or something similar like iron; or seeds, such as lentils, beans, peas; or flowing things such as water and pus and similar things.
When a stone or other kind of thing that does not adhere to the ear or grow in the ear falls into the ear, put the ear in the sun.
If you see the stone, instill a little violet oil or oil of sesame, then proceed with extraction; and make him sneeze with hellebore, and plug his nostrils when the sneezing comes, and put pieces of cloth or wool around the ear; and hold the ear upwards.
Often, strength returns through this treatment;
and if strength does not return, administer extraction with fine forceps, of which this is the form:
If it comes out with the forceps, it is good;
if not, administer extraction with a fine probe of small diameter;
and if it does not come out by this means, make a bronze chain and put the head of the chain into the opening of the ear strongly, and plug that which is around the chain with soft wax so that the wind cannot enter with the chain; then pull it out forcefully, for very often it comes out as we have said;
and if it does not come out in this manner, take birdlime, and put it on some instrument that is pointed for this purpose, and put a little cotton around it; then press the birdlime onto the stone or whatever it may be, and pull it out.
And if it does not come out by all these things that we have said, hasten to cut open the ear before a hot abscess and spasm occur;
and the manner of the incision is that you first bleed the patient from the cephalic vein, and draw out blood according to the measure of his strength, then make the patient sit between your hands and turn his ear upwards, and make a small incision at the root of the ear at the fatty tissue or the lower part; and let the incision be like a crescent moon, until you reach the stone, then remove it as best you can, and suck it out quickly with your mouth;
and treat it until it is healed.
And if it is a grain that is inside and it swells, administer extraction;
and if it cannot come out, administer a thin spatula according to this form: and administer incision of that grain.
But do not do this when you think the grain is moist because of the moisture of the ear, until you have made many pieces;
then extract it with fine forceps and a sucker, as we have said, so that the extraction is gentle.
In the water then that falls into the ear, it is necessary that the patient use sneezing powder first, and fill the ear with old cotton. And let him lie on that same ear where the water is. If it jumps out because of this, it is good.
If not, take several stones, according to the length of your middle finger, smooth and light, and warm them a little in the fire; and let the patient put one in the opening of his ear, and jump on it with his feet from the other side, and strike with another stone on the stone that is in the ear; and do not cease doing this with stone after stone until all the water comes out, and thus it all jumps out;
and if you wish, take a reed, and put one end in the ear, and take the other end in the fire until the tip of the reed is burned;
then do likewise with other reeds until all the water comes out, as we have said with the stone.
In the extraction of the creature, if it is small, like a flea and similar things, treat it as we have said in the division;
but if it is large enough to be felt, then administer extraction with tweezers; and this is the easiest thing to remove that is in the ear.
In the extraction of worms lodged in the ears, when you treat it as we have said in the division and in the treatment of distillations, and the treatment does not help, then you must look at the ear in the sun: if any worms appear, extract them with fine tweezers, and if they do not appear, take the chain of which this is the form:
And let it be narrow below and wide above. And put the most slender end into the ear according to the amount the patient can tolerate, then suck strongly on the whole chain; do this often until all the worms come out.
And if they do not obey and come out, stuff cotton around the chain as I have said for the stone;
and if they do not jump out as we have said, administer distillations that the ancients have proven in killing worms, and you will find them in the treatise on distillations;
and distill your oils and your medicines into the ear with this instrument, of which here is the form as you see: And let it be of silver or bronze, narrow below with one small hole, and open above for distilling;
and to press the distillation inside with a well-made bronze instrument for this purpose, and if you wish take a rasp and wrap cotton neatly around the point; then pour your oil or your juice, and what you wish of your medicines, into the tube, and the tube should be in the ear;
then put in the rasp with all the cotton, and press your hand moderately until the oil is distilled or completely in the ear; and the patient feels it inside, and let the distillation be slightly warmed by fire before it is distilled into the ear; and ensure that it is not too cold, for the medicine would not be as good.
Of the deafness of the ears
Some children are born who have no opening in their ears;
and this same thing happens to adults through the obstruction of a wound, or of flesh growing inside the ear, and this obstruction sometimes occurs deep in the ear, so that one cannot see it;
and sometimes the opening is slightly obstructed, and one sees it well.
That which occurs deep within, so that one cannot see it, is of difficult healing in many cases, and in that which one sees, it is necessary that you put the patient's ear in the sun; and look inside: if you see the obstruction clearly, then work with all this spatula of which here is the form:
And let it be sharp and cutting in front and behind, completely smooth, so that it does not wound the ear;
if the obstruction is of raw flesh or body of the ear, then hold it with fine pincers, and cut it lightly, until that flesh is entirely removed.
And if the obstruction is deep within the ear, take a thin, light rasp and warm it slightly in the fire, then place it in the body of the ear.
If you feel the obstruction from which the patient feels pain in hearing, pierce lightly, and be careful not to injure the nerves of the ear;
then place in the ear a tent according to the width of the opening, and moisten it in Egyptian ointment. Do this for a few days until the wound is healed, or take a tent and moisten it in rosewater, and sprinkle on crushed vitriol;
and if you see the ear swollen, then you must remove the tent and apply another tent moistened in a cerate made of rose oil and wax, until the swelling is removed; then treat it until it is healed.
And if bleeding occurs, dip a sponge and cloth in cold water, and apply it to the ear, and use other treatments that stop bleeding which are in the treatment of distillations.
These styes that come on the eyelids when they are moist and dry, then you must stretch them with forceps and pincers, and cut them with a spatula from their roots; then put crushed vitriol on the area.
And if blood flows, cauterize it with a fine lenticular cautery, and cauterizing after incision is better;
and often they return, when something remains of their roots; and when they are cauterized by fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
of the hail Often there appear in the eyelids things that resemble hail in form and hardness, and for this reason this illness is called "hail," and is a gathering of thick moisture in the eyelid above and below; the procedure is as follows:
the procedure is as follows: observe if the hail moves from one side to the other, and that is easy to know;
then make an incision, then lightly scrape each part, then grasp it with forceps, and cut it.
if you cannot cut it without piercing the eyelid a little, it does no harm to the patient;
and if the fissure is large, join it with a suture, and treat it until it is healed;
and if it is small, do not use force, for ointments restore it quickly and generate flesh.
And if the hailstone descends into the inside of the ear towards the upper part, invert the eyelid, and remove the hailstone with forceps, and cut and press from one side and the other;
and if the eyelid is separated by the incision, it does no harm;
and when the hailstone is removed, wash the eye with salt water, and treat the area with flesh-generating substances until the patient is healed.
of the fat of the eyes Exinach is a grease that is generated in the folds of the eyelids, and this happens more to children than to other people, and it greatly harms their eyes, and they get cataracts in the mornings, and cannot look at the sunlight because tears rush to their eyes;
and therefore they always lie on their faces, and sleep thus, and their eyelids under their eyebrows are moist, as the swelling and appearance have covered the exinach which appears in the eye. And when you press the area with your fingers and feel the exinach between them.
And the manner of the work is that the patient puts his head in your lap;
and then take a linen cloth, and prepare a tent in the manner of a circle according to the quantity that contains the exinach of each part, then place it over him; and press with your fingers on one side and the other, so that the exinach is gathered in the middle of the circle;
then cut in the middle of the moisture with a sharp spatula a slit of the width, and let it not be greater than the wound that one makes in bloodletting;
and cut the skin deeply until you reach the exinach; and in several instances, exinach comes from the slit, according to the form of a piece of white fat.
Then extract it completely with a piece of lint cloth between your fingers, pulling outwards, and turn your hand to right and left until it is separated;
and be careful not to push into the slit, that you not come with the whole spatula up to the eye, that you not injure it.
And if the exinach does not appear at the beginning of the slit, slightly enlarge the slit a little until it appears;
then extract it as we have said, then moisten cloths in vinegar and water, and apply to the place, and bind with bandages.
And there are some men who grind salt and apply it to corrupt that moisture which has remained.
Then treat it until it is healed.
And if a hot abscess appears at the location, treat it with soothing plasters until it is healed.
of the hairs of the testicles When hairs grow in the testicles in addition to the natural ones, and they become coarse, they harm the eyes and cause various illnesses such as habitual tearing and softening of the testicles and albuginea, to the point of causing the destruction of the eyes;
and the cure is according to four methods: either by cautery with fire, or by a liquid medicine as described in the chapter on cautery, and it is done either by incision and suture or by cautery, as I shall describe.
It is necessary that you place the patient's head on your lap, then turn the testicle towards your left hand;
if it is turned, that is good; if not, then insert a needle with thread into it; and let this be near the edge of the testicle where the hairs grow near those hairs, and pull the thread over with the testicle, and turn it back;
then cut in the part under the testicle, under the attached hairs, with the cutting spatula, from the large tear to the small;
then pull out the thread, and place under the testicle a small tent of cotton and cloth, then draw on the testicle a figure of an anvil, like a myrtle leaf, and however it is necessary that the figure be according to the quantity that you want to lift the testicle which is divided for all.
And if there is someone who needs to cut a large quantity of the testicle according to how the testicle is softened;
then cut with the spatula on the two lines that you have marked, and begin from the large tear down to the small; and let one of the incisions be near the natural hairs in the thickness of a root, then put the onion in one of the two angles of the heart, then peel it all;
then bring together the two lips with a stitch of a needle with a fine wool thread, and wipe away the blood, and burn the excess threads above the two eyebrows with some sticky substance, if you wish to do so;
and if not, then do not worry about it, then leave the suture and the threads for three or four days;
then treat the wound without sutures with drying and constricting substances, for the paper rises suddenly from the wound and the joining of it, but the suture is better (as the ancients say), and this is work without fear; and there is another method:
and there is another method: and it is that you cut the paper in a shape like a myrtle leaf, as we have described, three inches apart according to the form which is here:
then cut what extends beyond evenly with small scissors according to the form which is here:
And if you are not able to hold the forceps, and the thing is not even, then take a needle with one thread, and put it in the middle of the figure; and put one other thread next to the large tear, and the second thread next to the small one, and bring together between your fingers the threads evenly;
then lift your hand evenly, and lift all the skin on which you have cut, as we have described, then bring together the two lips of the wound by suture, and treat it until it is healed;
and if an abscess comes to your incision, then soothe it with cerate and similar softening ointments;
and sometimes it happens that the hairs of the wound are inverted:
then you must use what we have said about the incision;
but the suture in one and the other is more skillful.
The treatment of fistulas is according to this form: and that is that you invert the wound and the edges inside according to what I have said, and then make two canulae by art, and two thin threads as long as the wound and the width of the spatula is; and cut at the two ends of the two parts where you hold the threads;
then carefully assemble one and the other on what protrudes from the wound of the eye, and firmly press the two canulae of the two parts; and leave it thus for some days, and the skin which is pressed will die and shrivel and rot, until it falls off by itself.
If it is slow, then cut it with force, then cure it until it is healed;
and when the wound is healed, and the membrane is lifted, and the hairs no longer prick;
and this is the form of the two canulae that you will make according to this figure, and according to this quantity of length and width:
the procedure is such that you take a fine needle, and thread it with a soft and fine silk thread; then join the ends and tie one to the other subtly, and let the length of the threads be one palm long;
then arrange in the cavity another fine silk thread briefly, and tie the ends of the thread;
then let the patient put his head in your lap;
and let it be near the sun so that the work is clear, for it is a subtle and delicate work, then put the needle with the entire cavity at the root of the hair to be added, and pierce it into the skin quickly until you draw it over the natural hair;
then pull the hair up to the cavity, and put that hair into the cavity, whether there is one or two or three or more;
then withdraw your hand until the hairs come out with the entire cavity into the skin along with the natural hair.
And if the cavity is pulled and the hairs do not come out with it, then pull the cavity from below along with the thread that you have placed there, until the cavity comes out of the hole above and you see it with the vision of your eye;
then you will pull the cavity and the thread, and close the eye and leave it closed for two or three days, until the hair grows back in its place and the flesh grows over;
and if the hair is small, accompany it with a long hair from the natural hair, and let it grow with that one or leave it, until it is lengthened and then remove it.
of the corruption of the eye When this illness which is called "aleacrati" or corruption comes to the eye, there are two kinds of it:
one natural, and the other unnatural.
And it happens suddenly from a wound, or a cut, or a cautery, and by similar things.
And the manner of working on it is that you split that suture, and separate the lips of it, and put inside linen tents, and bind it until it is healed;
and it is not necessary that you use in the cure of it things that dry and constrict. For if you do this, the illness returns worse than the first;
but work with softening things, such as fenugreek; and rosewater or mallow and linseed cooked, and diachylon ointments melted in some oil, and wrap a tent around it, and cure it with this.
And the key to your cure is that you take care that it does not heal according to the form it was before;
and these operations that we have mentioned are nothing but remedies for this illness, so that it does not return according to the form it was before.
This illness which is below, which is truly called "axacrati", and is natural and accidental.
The accidental [cause] comes from a wound and a fissure and a cautery and similar things;
and the method of operating on it is that you take a needle, on which there is a double thread, and you stick it into the flesh, and make it pierce from the left tear duct to the right, so that the thread comes out in two pieces of the flesh;
then stretch the flesh above with the needle, and cut it to a width of one spatule. And if the shape of the eyelid returns as it should, it is good;
if not, take a rasp and put it in the fissure, and turn the eyelid, and make two incisions on the inside edge of the eyelid;
and let the ends of the two incisions be at the two angles of the incision that you have cut, and make an angle so that when they are joined, the shape is like the shape of a letter that is called "I Greek";
then remove that flesh, according to the amount that its edges are sharp underneath, from that which follows the eyelid, then join the two separated parts, and sew them with a wool thread;
then treat it with what we have said of softening medicines and tents, until it is healed.
And if the disease comes from a fissure or suture or cautery, then you must make a full incision under the hairs of the eyelids, and according to what is above; then separate between the two lips with a tent, as I have said;
then separate between the two lips with a tent, as I have said; and one must do the work according to the form of the illness, for it is very diverse in form, and the wise master prepares a device with all his power so that he may restore the figure to its natural form;
and the patient himself, according to what is necessary for work and instruments in several situations.
When this adhesion happens to many men in such a way that the eyelid above is adhered to the white of the eye, and cannot move or perform its natural functions, then you must put the point of a razor under the eyelid and lift it upwards;
and extend it with tweezers, until you cut what is attached with a fine spatula, which should not be too sharp nor too blunt, so that the patient cannot suffer that the too sharp spatula may injure the eye;
and let your incision, with which you scrape away that adhesion, be light, so that the eyelid returns to its natural form;
and when that adhesion is healed, they sometimes put salt water in the eye, and wash it with fresh water, and with whey;
then place between the eyelid and the eye a tent of linen, and put on the eye wool moistened in egg white; and after the third day use whey and soothing things until it is healed.
Know that the corner of the eye is according to two manners: it is nervous and similar to a hard pellicle, and another which is not nervous, but is similar to congealed white moisture, that when one touches it with iron and thinks to pierce it with pincers, one cannot;
and both forms begin towards the large tear duct, and grow little by little until it covers the whole vision and all the light and movement of the eye.
And the manner of the incision is that the patient puts his head in your lap, then opens his eyes; and lift the eyelid with your hand, then grasp the corner of the eye with small double forceps, and stretch it upwards; then take a needle, and put on it a horsehair, or cow hair, or ox hair, and a strong thread; and double the point of the needle a little and stick it into the corner of the eye, and pierce it with the whole needle, and tie the corner of the eye with a thread and stretch it upwards, and scrape with the hair the side of the eyelid which follows the pupil and the silk with the hair to the head, then cut the remainder at the root of the tear duct with the thin spatula and the small forceps, and leave the natural flesh in the tear duct, so that the body of the tears does not come out through the incision usually;
and sometimes only stretch the eyelid with the hook and the thread, as we have said; then scrape it with a smooth spatula of which this is the form:
And take care that the spatula does not touch the fleshy membrane and break it, and that the pupil is not pierced;
and after the incision, put a little crushed celery and a little eye-salve made of litharge into the eye, and leave it until the next day; then cure it as needed until it is healed.
And if the nail is not sensitive, and you cannot insert the needle, and the probe cannot enter, this type of nail is often cured by medicines;
and grow as I have recounted in the division, and if you see it should be cut, open the patient's eye, and take a light, slightly sharp spatula in this form: And scrape the nail thinly, and if you see that it diminishes somewhat and the erosion approaches it, then instill into the eye from your mouth an eyewash made of litharge and red eyewash and crushed celery, and plug the eye until the next day;
If nothing hinders you in the eye, such as a hot abscess, then leave it, and first cure the hot abscess until it is healed, then recommence the work as before, until it is healed.
then recommence the other work according to this same method, until it is all removed.
And if the appearance of the flesh of the tear duct harms the eye greatly, suspend it with a hook, and cut a part of it and not all, so that the tear duct is not damaged;
then instill into the eye red eyewash which is made of litharge.
In the eyes of some men, sometimes red flesh grows and covers the pupil and encroaches upon the eyelids and turns them outward, and resembles a pomegranate flower;
and the procedure is that the patient puts his head in your lap, then opens his eyes, and you pull all that flesh with hooks suitable for this, and support it with force;
then cut the first layer of flesh, and keep cutting with a razor to the end, and be careful that you do not injure the eye in the procedure;
and let the incision be with the spatula that we have mentioned in the incision of the nail and in small forces with which one removes the sebaceous material, as the figure after this chapter demonstrates;
and when the incision is complete and all the flesh removed, apply crushed celery seed oil or you can distill red copperas and similar corrosive medicines, and place on the outside of the eye cotton with egg white, so that it is protected from a hot abscess;
and if anything remains, and the hot blood overwhelms you, and you fear a hot abscess, leave the eye and treat the abscess with things that soothe a hot abscess;
then return to your work until it is healed, and thus do it when flesh is added to the eye in this manner.
However, it is necessary that you ease the treatment of each weak eye by natural means; and by accidental means, using iron instruments;
and do not put your hand to any of these operations until you see that this limb is capable of withstanding that operation.
These are red veins which are spread over the eye, and they impede its function and weaken the eye always.
It is necessary then first that you look if the eye, in which the sebels are, is strong, and there is no other illness except the sebels; then treat the eye in this manner:
instruct the patient to place his head in your lap, then you suspend those veins with the unguent according to your skill, and let the unguent be finely divided according to this form:
And let there be two unguents by degrees in one body according to this form:
then one treats forcefully those veins subtly, and the blood flows out hour after hour, until you see those veins removed from the eye;
and be careful that you do not injure the eye with the points of the spatulas, and perform this work at midday before the sun, and be very diligent in your work so that you only cut those veins;
and when you have done this, then instill into the eye green and red copper sulfate to corrupt that which remains of the pus.
And if you are not able to remove all of it at that time, then apply a plaster to the eye of things that soothe the pain of the eyes, and leave it for a few days until the pain is soothed and the hot abscess is healed, then begin again in this manner which is described above until it is healed;
and this is the method of treatment:
The Arabs call it "arissati" fistula:
When you treat it with cautery and with burning medicine according to what I have said before, and it is not healed, then it is necessary that you cut into the abscess, there where it should mature, and draw out all the moisture that is there, until the bone is uncovered.
And when the bone is uncovered, and you see the corruption and the blackness, then scrape it with the instrument of which this is the form;
and it is called "rough head," and let it be made of iron with a round head, and let it be pointed like a file as it is in the present form:
And place it on the spot of the corrupt bone, then turn it between your fingers, and press your hand a little until you know that the corruption is removed;
and do this several times, then restore the place with drying medicines.
If the place is healed, and flesh grows there, and the body of the bone is healed, and remains so for forty days, and it does not renew itself and is not abscessed, and no bad accident comes to it, know that it is healed;
if not, there is no other device than to return the fistula to the opening of the nose according to this form: and it is that you uncover the bone a second time with iron and with sharp medicines, and when it is uncovered, take a drill according to this form, and let the head of iron have three angles, and let the shaft be tapered to the head as you see here:
then place it on the bone near the tear duct, and move your hand away from the eye a little, then turn the drill completely until it pierces the bone and the patient feels it because the wind comes out if he holds his hand over his nose;
and then restore the place with dry medicines, as I have taught you, and when the flesh grows and the place hardens, the matter goes to the nose; this is easier for the patient.
When the eyes are completely open and there is no obstruction or diminution of the nose, you must bind the patient;
then cleanse it, then apply cupping glasses to the temple without wounding to draw out the humor, then apply to the eye a liniment made of acacia, aloe, incense, and sarcocol, and then bind the eye, and plaster it over with bandages and cloths;
and the manner of the cloths is that you take fairly soft cloths, and double each one four times, and then place one over the other according to the amount that the eye needs;
then bind it over with a strong bandage, and repeat the cupping glasses to draw out the humor without wounding;
then remove the cupping glasses and leave the eye bound day and night, and if the liniment softens, you must bind it tightly;
then remove the liniment after a day and a night, and if you see the eye repairing, it is good;
if not; then repeat the plaster and cloths and the liniment and the cupping glasses until it is healed.
Of the rupture of the uvula When rupture occurs in the uvula, then it opens, and there comes forth from the papules something like a grain of resin, and it is frightful to see;
then if you see it severed, the procedure is such that you insert a needle into the root of the lower part up to the upper part, then insert another needle where there is a double thread from the part of the tear; and pierce it there, and leave the first needle according to the arrangement;
then cut the place of the double thread and tie a part of the uvula around, and tighten it well, then remove the needle and apply wool soaked in egg white;
and leave it until the thread falls off with the uvula, then treat the eye with comforting things until the wound is healed;
and sometimes the wound is constricted by the uvula on each side with a circle of cloth, until it is healed.
And if the eye gives great appearance, pierce it with a fine spatula which goes into the depth of the eye, and correct the moisture of the albuginea and let the eye descend, and enter immediately;
then remove it until it is healed.
This illness which is called "alcunnati" is nothing but a swelling which is gathered in the eye, resembling descending water, and it is not water;
and the manner of the appearance of the work is that you make the patient sit on a prepared and straight seat, then take the head between your hands on both sides, and move it until you see the swelling come to the top to your eyes; then let it be pierced, and let the light not descend and be obstructed, and let the patient see things as he was accustomed;
and if it does not descend below, know that it is water, and if the descent of the swelling is not prepared as we have said.
then make the patient sit between your hands, then take a fine spatula and pierce the cornea slightly by the continuation of the conjunctiva with the cornea and the iris, until the swelling comes out;
and when it is out, then distill warm water mixed with honey into the eye, or water in which fenugreek has been boiled and honey, then let it be treated with other treatment until it is healed.
of the eye waters We have here the appearances of the waters in the division, and what is necessary for piercing; then work according to the health.
It is necessary that you make the patient sit between your crossed hands, away from the light of the sun, and bind the healthy eye and squeeze it very tightly;
then put the paper of the eye in your left hand if the eye is left, or in your right hand if the eye is right;
then take in your right hand, if the eye is left, the instrument which is called "almagda", or in your left hand, if the eye is right;
then place the point of the instrument next to the cornea by the thickness of a ray in that white of the eye at the part of the smaller tear duct, then push the instrument which is called "almagda" skillfully, and twist your hand until it pierces the white of the eye, and feel that the almagda reaches the empty thing;
and it is necessary that the measure of the almagda's path be at the depth of the space which is from the pupil to the end of the blackness; and that is the cornea of the eye;
then you will see the bone in that membrane because of the clarity of the corneal membrane, and then put the instrument to the place where the water is, then press it out one way after another.
if the water descends immediately, the patient sees in front of him and the instrument in his eye.
Afterwards, rest a little, and if the water rises the second way, apply force with the instrument, and when it is inserted and it does not rise, extract the almagda lightly by turning your hand little by little;
and then put a little rock salt in water, and bathe the eye in it. Then apply to the outside of the eye tampons or wool soaked in rose oil and egg white, and bind it with a healthy eye.
We, and those of our time, apply crushed cumin with egg white.
And if the almagda cannot enter the eye because of its hardness, for there are such men who have very hard eyes, then you must take the instrument which is called "alberit", of which this is the form:
And then pierce only the conjunctiva, and do not go too deep, but make a small opening, then put in the almagda, as we have said;
and upon completion of the work, prepare for the patient a suitable sleeping place, where he sleeps on his back in a dark place;
and let him be free from all movements, and let him take light foods, and let him not move his head neither to the right nor to the left, and let him be bound according to his condition until the third day;
then unbind him in that same dark room, and test his sight, and make him see some things, and then put the bandage back on until the seventh day;
and it is not necessary that you do this at the time of the treatment or immediately after the incision, but it is necessary that you delay this, because the water rises quickly.
If a warm abscess appears, that you unbind the eye before the seventh day, and treat it with something that relieves the abscess;
and when it is calmed, then unbind the sight and put on his face a small pillow to cover for a few days, and let him always be in that dark room.
And then he should leave the house little by little, and return to his usual activities;
and know that no disciple should interfere in this case. And someone from Iraq came to us, who told us that in his country they made pierced almonds, from which one sucks the water, but still I never saw any in our land, nor did I ever read of it in the books of the ancients; and perhaps it is a new thing.
And these are the likenesses of the forms of almonds, so that those who do not know them may see them;
and let them be properly of bronze: And let their heads be of this same subtlety, and the last in three sharp angles.
Sometimes various fleshy growths arise on the nose, of which some resemble scorpions with many feet;
and there are some where there is flesh ingrained of dark color, and there is soft flesh of good color. In that then of these fleshes which is soft, and not ingrained, it is necessary that you make the patient sit between your hands against the sun;
In that then of these fleshes which is soft, and not ingrained, it is necessary that you make the patient sit between your hands against the sun; and open his nostrils, and throw the onion on those fleshes, and pull them out; then cut that which you can hold with a thin sharp spatula on one side, until you know that that flesh is all removed.
And if any remains that cannot be cut, then operate on it with all the subtle instruments lightly, so that nothing remains; and if suppuration or a hot abscess overcomes you, then treat it as is necessary;
and if it is malignant abscesses, then hasten and cauterize it until the blood is stopped and all the flesh is removed, then pour on it vinegar and water or wine. If the nose works, and moisture comes down to the palate, know that it is healed;
and if moisture does not come forth as it should, know that there is new flesh on the bone above, which the instruments cannot reach to cut:
then it is necessary that you put in it a rather thick linen thread, knotted by the hand, and having between each knot a finger's breadth or less; and let the patient put the end of the thread in his nose as much as possible, and pull gently until it comes through the nose into the mouth;
and often children do this in schools, and it is an easy thing for one who wants to do it;
then hold the end that comes through the nose in one hand, and the other end that comes through the mouth in the other hand, and saw it back and forth on the knots that are in the thread.
Do this until you see that the knots have corrupted that flesh, then pull out the thread, wipe away the blood, and moisten the thread in Egyptian ointment, and put it back in the nose as before;
do this three days or more, until the ointment corrodes all that remains of the flesh;
and then put a lead cannula in the nose for a few days until it is healed, and if it needs drying medicines, then use them;
and this is the form of the instrument to purge the head, with which one distills oils and medicines into the nose:
And let it be of silver or bronze, similar to an open lamp, like a cannula, and the conduit also;
and if you wish, make a closed cannula, and let the instrument be full to purge the head;
and have a handle at the top to hold it when one heats the oil or any liquid.
of the flesh above the nose
Many times a disease called "telul" arises at the head of the nose, and grows and becomes large continuously, until it is a frightening thing to behold;
and therefore it is necessary that you cut it at the beginning, and remove it entirely, then apply the cautery or burning medicine to the place;
and if one delays cutting it until it is large, then take care if it is hard, of a livid color, and insensitive:
then do not touch it with iron, for it is a festering abscess, because when it is cut sometimes, great harm comes to the patient;
and if the abscess is soft to the touch, not livid in color, and you see that it can be entirely cut, then empty the patient and cut it without fear, and treat the place with drying and astringent things.
Know that when a solution of continuity occurs in one of these cartilaginous works, it profits little, except in some men.
Therefore, when this happens to someone, see if the wound is fresh with all its blood; and then join the two lips with a suture, then treat it until it is healed;
and if the lips are already separated on one side and the other, you must scrape all the parts of their heart until they bleed, then bring the two lips together with a suture, and bind it, and sprinkle on dragon's blood powder and ground incense; and place on the powders a piece of strong plaster or other consolidating plaster, and leave it until it falls off by itself, then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
The manner of the suture is that you bring together the edges: or with needles, as we have said in the suture of the belly; or with thread, as I have shown you.
of the abscesses of the lips
In many men there occurs within the lips a hard abscess, similar to vesicles, some smaller and some larger;
then you must turn back the lips, and make an incision on each side, and grasp it with forceps and cut it in each part;
then fill the place after the incision with powdered vitriol, until the blood is stopped;
and then wash it with vinegar, and treat the place with drying things until it is healed.
Many times there grows on the gums added flesh, which the ancients call "albulus";
then you must hold it with tongs, and cut it at its root, and let the wound or blood run;
then put on the place crushed vitriol, or other astringent and desiccative powders;
and if that flesh returns after the incision, and this often happens, then cut it a second time, and cauterize it: it will not return after cautery;
Sometimes there are gathered at the root of the teeth, inside the mouth between the gums, crusts which are foul and rough; and sometimes the teeth are black and yellow and worm-eaten, until the corruption reaches the gum, and the teeth are foul-smelling;
then you must make the patient sit between your hands, and his head should be in your lap, and clean the teeth or the crusts which appear, until nothing remains; and so do with the blackness and greenness, and the yellowness and other stains, until they are cleaned;
and if one removes what is there at the first scraping, it is good; if not, then begin again the second and third day, until you have cleaned everything;
and know that the teeth need various forms of instruments for cleaning, according to what the work demonstrates, because the scrapers with which one cleans outside the teeth have different forms than those with which one cleans between the teeth; and these and other forms should be prepared and with you.
It is necessary when you treat a toothache that you delay extraction as long as you can, for one should not do this; for it is a very high substance until one has no excuse for scraping.
Then, when the patient is compelled to extraction, it is necessary that you are certain of the aching tooth. Many times the pain deceives the patient, and he thinks it is in a healthy tooth, and has the good tooth extracted; and yet the pain does not depart because of that, until the bad one is extracted, for we have already seen this happen to these healers;
and when you are certain of the aching tooth, you must scrape around the tooth with a very strong spatula to protect the gum on all sides;
then move it with your fingers or with fine forceps little by little, until it is well loosened, then firmly attach the forceps; and let the patient's head be on your lap between your knees, and hold it well so that it does not move.
Afterwards, extract the tooth straight without breaking it, and if it does not come out easily, take one of these instruments and put it inside from each side lightly, and move it as you did before.
And if the tooth is pierced and eaten away, you must fill it with lint where the holes are; and extract it carefully with forceps, so that it does not break on extraction;
and it is necessary to work very wisely around the gum to loosen the tooth.
And I warn you well that you do not break it, and that a part remains, and that greater pain than the first returns to the patient through the malice of the root.
And beware that you do not act as ignorant surgeons do, who through their haste and boldness sometimes break the tooth, and do not achieve what we have recounted;
but sometimes cause, through the breaking of the tooth, or because of the roots that remain, a great illness, as we have often seen;
And when the tooth is extracted, wash the place with wine or vinegar and salt;
and if bleeding occurs, which often happens, fill the place with crushed vitriol;
and if that does not work, cauterize it.
The shapes of the instruments with which one moves the teeth first should have long points and thick handles, so that they do not bend when you extract the tooth;
and these are the shapes: And let them be of thick members so that they do not bend when pulling, and let them be of well-made iron, and let them be toothed to hold the tooth.
of the root of the teeth When the root remains after pulling, it is necessary that you place on the spot cotton moistened in butter for one or two days, until the place is softened, then put there the pincers which are called "algefri", of which the head resembles a bird's beak;
and let them be made inside like a file, and this is the shape:
And if the roots do not want to come out with all these pincers, it is necessary that you uncover the flesh all around the root, and put there the instrument which is called "althali", that is to say, a lever, of which this is the shape:
And let it be strong and thick so that it does not break, and if the root comes out by this, it is good;
if not, help yourself with all the instruments, of which the forms come here after:
And one helps oneself with this instrument which has two prongs, of which this is the shape: and of other tools which are in front in the arrangement of teeth, and of this instrument which resembles large pincers, of which this is the shape:
And let this instrument be strong so that it cannot break, and know that there are many instruments for teeth; and also other instruments, which are not counted;
and the wise and subtle master finds his own instrument, according to what his work and the illness show him, for there are such illnesses where the ancients taught no instrument because of the diversity of cases; and if one breaks a piece of the cart [presumably, referring to the bones of the body] or other bones, or if it rots, then he seeks among the instruments which are necessary, that I have told you, and he helps himself with the gestures, of which this is the shape:
And let them be thick and well-holding to hold the bone, so that it does not escape, but that one can hold and remove it;
and then restore the place with medicines suitable for this, and if there is rot in the bone, and it is small, then scrape it with this instrument:
When the teeth appear not according to their natural course, and the form is ugly, and especially in virgin women, then you must know if the tooth is born after the tooth, and is not in the right place, and one cannot move it or file it:
then shave it; and if it is close to the tooth, then take this instrument of which here is the form, and it is similar to a small beak, and let it be of iron, sharp at the tip:
And cut it little by little over several days because of the hardness of the tooth, and so that you do not move the others, and if it is apparent that one can file it, then file it with a file such as this is the form:
and it is like the file with which needles are made;
and file the tooth little by little over several days lightly, so that it does not move until it falls;
then smooth it at the end with some kind of scraper, and if the tooth is too sharp and it injures the tongue, then it is necessary to file the roughness until it is even, so that it does not injure the tongue nor impair speech.
When the front teeth loosen, either by percussion or by falling, and the patient cannot bite into what he eats without them falling out, and you have treated them with astringent medicines, and that does not work;
then it is necessary to restrain them with a gold wire, for silver wire turns green and rots, but gold never changes;
and let the wire be medium, neither too thick nor too thin, according to the amount of space between the teeth;
and if you wish to straighten the teeth, take the wire and double it between the two healthy teeth, then place the ends between the moved teeth, if there is one or more, until you wisely reach a healthy tooth on the other side; then begin the wrapping again to the point where you began, and restrain your hand subtly and wisely, so that it does not move;
and let your binding be at the root of the tooth so that it cannot escape.
Then cut the ends of the wire with pliers, and join them, and place them between the healthy tooth, and place it so that it does not injure the tongue;
and then leave it thus tightened as long as it can remain, and if it loosens, or the wire breaks, tighten it with another wire;
it will remain and serve thus its entire time, and this is the form of the teeth and the figure of the straightening of the two healthy teeth, and of the two moved, as you see:
And when the tooth falls out, one puts it back in its place, freshly, as we have said;
and let no one interfere who is not wise and patient, and sometimes one makes the form of a tooth from cow bone, and one puts it in the place where it is missing, and one tightens it as we have said, and it remains and serves thus a long time.
Sometimes this frenulum which comes from under the tongue is natural, that one is born thus; or by accident of a healed wound;
and the operation is such that you open the patient's mouth, and have his head in your lap, and lift his tongue;
then cut the nerve frenulum widely, so that the tongue is released from its constraint, and if there is hardness or a knot, and this is from a sudden wound, then insert the hook and cut widely that ligament;
and take care that the incision is not too deep, because of the artery which is below;
and when you have done, lift [the area] with rosewater and vinegar, or with cold water, then place under the tongue a linen tent;
and let the patient dress it each night, so that the wound cannot close.
And if bleeding occurs, put crushed vitriol on the area; and if the bleeding overcomes you, cauterize it with the lentiginous cautery, which is good for this; then treat it with another treatment until it is healed,
and if you see it of a dark or black color or hard, so that the patient does not feel it, then do not touch it, for it is cancer;
and if it is tending towards whitening, and there is moisture, then pour on onion juice, and lance it with a fine spatula, and cleanse it from one side and the other; and if the bleeding overcomes you in your work, apply crushed vitriol until it is stanched, then return to your work until you have removed all the pus;
then clean the place with vinegar and salt, and treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
Of the abscesses of the throat Sometimes there come within the throat swellings which are called "godath," and they are properly called the two tonsils, and when you treat them, as we have said in the division, and they are not healed, then take heed:
if this abscess is hard, little sensitive, and of a dusky color, then do not touch it with iron.
And if it is red and the root is large, then do not touch it with iron, also because of the flow of blood; but leave it until it is ripe, and then you will open it, or it will break by itself;
and if it is of a whitish color around, and the root is thin, then have the instrument ready for cutting, but first see if the hot abscess is calmed and appeased.
Then make the patient sit before the sun, and his head should be in your lap, and the operator opens the mouth and the assistant takes it between his hands, and presses the tongue down with the instrument, of which this is the form;
and let it be of silver or of thin bronze like a knife:
When you press the tongue with this instrument, and you see the abscess, then take the onion and stick it into the tonsil, and pull it out above as much as you can;
and pull out some of the membranes with it, then cut it with the instrument, of which this is the form, which resembles a pair of forceps; and yet the ends are curved, and one towards the other, and they are very sharp, and it is made of Indian iron or bronze:
And if you do not have this instrument present, then cut it with pincers, of which this is the form: And let it be sharp on one side, and blunt on the other;
and when you have cut one of the tonsils, cut the other in the same manner, and after the incision let the patient gargle with warm water, and vinegar and water, and if bleeding occurs, let the patient gargle with water in which pomegranate bark has been boiled, or myrtle leaves, and similar things, until the bleeding is stopped; then treat it until it is healed;
and sometimes other abscesses grow in the throat besides the two tonsils, then cut them in the same way as the two tonsils exactly.
And I treated a woman with an abscess which had grown inside her throat, that is to say, a small abscess;
and it had almost completely closed her throat, so that the woman could not breathe because the passage was blocked, and could neither eat nor drink, and would have died if she had remained thus for one or two days.
And the abscess had risen so much that it had forced out two veins through the two nostrils.
I hastened then at once, and inserted a small hook into one, then pulled it out, and drew out a large portion of pus;
then I did likewise in the other nostril, and opened her mouth and pressed her tongue;
afterwards I inserted the hook into the abscess, and cut a part of it, and only a little blood came out; and thus the passage of the woman's throat was cleared, and she immediately began to drink water and then wine, and I did not cease cutting that abscess for a long time;
and the abscess grew again, and filled the space that I had emptied, until it was very large;
then I incised it and cauterized it inside the throat: thus it remained without growing;
and I departed from those parts, and I do not know what God did with her after me.
of the grape
When catarrh descends to the uvula, and it is swollen and elongated, it is called "perpendicular";
and if it is thick and round below, it is called "uve".
When it is treated as we have said in the division, and the treatment does not help, and you see that the heat of the abscess is subsided, and it is thin, then you must cut it;
and that which is round and gathered and is not long; and it is bloody or of a dark color or black, then you should avoid cutting it. For there is great danger to the patient.
Therefore, when you see it, according to the manner that I have said, of its whiteness and length, you must make the patient sit before the sun, and press the tongue with the instrument of which we have made mention before; then insert the oncin into the uvula, and pull it down, and cut it with one of the two instruments that I have mentioned in the incision of the two tonsils.
And you must not cut more than the superfluity which is beyond the natural limit;
for if you cut more, you will harm the voice and speech;
and after the incision, use what we have said in the incision of the two tonsils, and treat it until it is healed.
And if the patient fears the cutting, then you must use a method of cauterization so that he does not feel pain.
And the manner of the cautery is with sharp water. And it is that the patient should put his head in your lap, and then press his tongue with the instrument that we have mentioned in the chapter on cautery, and cauterize it with warm spring water, so that it is neither too thick nor too thin; and use the end of this instrument, of which this is the form:
And it has on the head a cavity where one puts the medicine, like the bowl of a spoon, and puts the instrument with all the medicine on the uvula;
and the patient should lie on his side, so that the saliva and mucus run from his mouth away from the medicine, so that it does not descend to the throat and injure it;
then hold your hand with all the medicine and press it on the uvula, the amount of half an hour, until you see it numb and the burning from the medicine is calmed;
and if you wish, take cotton and wrap it around some instrument, and wet the cotton in the medicine, and put the instrument with all the cotton in the throat above, until the cotton touches the uvula;
and do this often, until the cautery is complete, then let it dry, and it falls after four or five days.
And if you need to restart the cautery with the medicine, then restart it, and after the cautery wipe around the uvula with cotton wrapped in butter, and clean what is around the medicine;
and let it be rinsed with cold water, and let it be treated with gargles until it is healed.
This treatment is safer than incision, or than cautery;
if it is treated by fumigation in this manner, take calamint and hyssop and origanum and rue and chamomile and vervain and similar herbs, and mix all or some of them in a pot, and add vinegar, and bring to a boil;
and the pot should be well sealed with strong clay, and inside the pot there should be a perforated instrument according to this manner: And let it be of silver or bronze, and let one of the ends be placed in the mouth of the patient so that the vapor rises to the uvula through the throat, until the uvula is cauterized;
afterwards repeat it often, until the uvula is dry, and take care that you do not do this at the beginning of the appearance of the hot abscess, for many things happen there; and do not do this except at the decline of the hot abscess.
And if this instrument is not present, take a tube and put inside it an eggshell, so that the patient's mouth is not too hot; for the eggshell does not allow the vapor to burn the mouth, and this is a good treatment and also a salvation.
Many times a bone or fish spine, or something else, gets stuck in the throat;
then you must pull out what you can see, and press the tongue down with the instrument, so that you see the thing move;
and what you do not see and is lodged in the throat, you must make the patient vomit before the food is cooked in the stomach; perhaps the thing will come out through vomiting;
or the patient swallows a piece of sponge, or a piece of navel, or a lettuce root, or a piece of dry bread; and tie a thread to the sponge, and then swallow it; and when it comes to the place, it will stick, and then pull it out;
and if it does not come out by what we have said, take a lead instrument according to this form:
And let the instrument be curved at the head so that it may more easily enter the throat, and have the head raised high; and beware that you do not touch the epiglottis, lest a cough comes to him, nor thrust the bone inside;
and it is better that the patient inserts the instrument, because he knows better where the thing is stuck; then push it down, or pull it out with the instrument evenly, until it is out.
Of the leech in the throat
Sometimes the leech is medicated, as I have said in the division, by the cure of medicines; and when that does not help, then look in the patient's throat at the sun, then press his tongue with the instrument that I have told you.
And if you see the leech, pull it out with a small hook, or with fine forceps that are good for this.
And if that is not effective, take a horsehair, and put it in the patient's throat, then put a hot iron at the end of the hair, and do this often. And let the patient drink water every day.
Then take a full glass of cold water, and open the mouth, and pour it in without swallowing, and move it around with your hand often; and as soon as the leech feels the water, it falls off.
And if it does not fall off as we have said, fumigate the patient with asafoetida, with the instrument that I have described in the fumigation of the uvula;
do this many times, for it will fall off without delay.
And the method of fumigation is that you take a pot in which there are live coals, and the pot is covered with a lid pierced in the middle, and in that hole is the end of the instrument;
then throw in your fumigation, and the patient puts the end of the tube in his mouth, and closes his mouth, so that the smoke does not escape, but comes down to the leech;
and the leech will fall off immediately, and if it does not fall off, repeat the fumigation many times;
and let the patient suffer thirst, and eat salty and sharp things, and not drink water;
and then it will be necessary for it to come out forcefully through this treatment.
And the shape of the instrument with which one pulls out the leech is, when one can see it, similar to curved pincers to easily enter the throat; and it resembles a bird's beak, and has a roughness like a file, so that what it grasps, it cannot let go;
Many kinds of abscesses exist, according to what is remembered later in this book about one and another, and they differ in perforation and size;
and this is in two ways, one of which is in its very appearance, and what it contains in moisture.
And the second manner is because of the places where they are in the body.
For abscesses of the head are different from those of the fundament, and abscesses of fleshy places are different from those that occur in joints, and each has its own judgment in treatment.
And there are abscesses that one should not pierce until the swelling is ripe according to its completion;
and there are some that it is necessary to pierce when they are grown, and do not mature according to their completion, such as abscesses that are near joints.
For when abscesses occur near joints, and one leaves them until they are rotten around, by chance the ligaments and nerves of the joint are corrupted, which is the cause of contraction in that limb.
Or, if the abscess is near the principal member, and you delay perforation until it is ripe, it will harm the principal member;
or if it is near the fundament, one pierces it before it is ripe;
and it is not necessary that you pierce an unripe abscess without complete digestion, except that which is near the fundament, lest it rot deeply, and lengthen inward, and a fistula forms there; and cannot heal in a long time.
And it is necessary that you know the time of the perforation of the ripe abscess according to its completion, and that is when the pain is lessened, and the departure of the fever, and the lessening of the pain and redness, and of the throbbing and sharpening of the head of the abscess, and the other signs;
and it is necessary that you make the perforation in the most dependent part of the abscess, and where it appears soft;
and let the perforation be along the body, and if the abscess is in the hands or feet, or in joints and near nerves and arteries, and in all similar places where there is no bending. In those that bend, along that limb.
And when the abscess is in a fleshy place, it is better that you delay the perforation until it is confirmed in completed digestion, as we have said.
For if you pierce it before that, the body of the venom will be spread from it, and it is full of much filth; and perhaps the lips and depths of it will harden.
And if there is an abscess that is pierced according to the breadth of the body, according to what the limb needs.
And it is necessary that you make small holes in small abscesses; and in large abscesses, large holes, and many fissures according to the resemblance of the size of the abscess;
and there are such abscesses where it is necessary to reach the core, and to cut; when it has become like a rag, and is dead, it is necessary to do as one does with buboes:
and there are some that are split into three angles, and there are some that are cut like a myrtle leaf, like abscesses of the angles;
and there are some where one makes a round incision, and other incisions and similar cuts.
Those which have no head, like a superficial soft abscess, it is necessary that you pierce it completely;
and it is necessary when the abscess is large, and it has collected much pus, and you pierce it, not to draw all the pus at that time, but to draw a part; then stuff the abscess until the next day, then draw out something again; do this many times gradually, until all the pus comes out;
especially if the patient is of weak constitution, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an old decrepit man. For the spirit sometimes leaps with the exit of the pus, so that by chance the patient dies, and you are not to blame.
Therefore perform this chapter with great caution, and when you have perceived your abscess, clean the wound, and see if the wound of the abscess is small; and if it is a full incision, apply tents of linen or old cotton; and if it is a large abscess, and there are many openings, then you must place a tent in each so that they meet one another;
and if you have cut a part of the skin in the abscess, and you have turned it over, then you must fill it with old cotton or linen cloth shavings without moisture, and bind it until the third day;
then remove it, and treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if bleeding occurs in your work, apply cold water and vinegar, and moisten a cloth, and apply it to the bleeding area many times.
And if the bleeding persists, apply the treatment and remedies, and the powders that I have mentioned elsewhere in this book, and if it is winter, and the place where the abscess is is very sensitive, then you must apply tents and cloths moistened in wine and warm oil;
and if it is summer, and the place is fleshy, then you must apply cloths moistened in water and oil, or in wine and cold oil, until the third day, as we have said;
and then open the abscess and clean it and treat it, as is necessary, until it is healed.
And this must be universally known in the treatment of abscesses:
I have told you how one should proceed with the treatment of abscesses, and here is the chapter.
In the scalp come small abscesses, and there are kinds that are web-like, like the comb of a hen, and there are many similar ones.
There are fatty ones and others where there is moisture, like pus;
and there are some that are hard and stony to the touch, and there is no doubt if the artery does not interfere.
And the work of the incision is that you should probe with the instrument which is called "entromissoire," whose form is given below, what thing it contains.
For if it contains moisture, then lance it from above lengthwise.
And when the moisture is emptied, then scrape it without leaving anything of the skin that contains that moisture, for it returns repeatedly when one leaves anything there;
then dip cotton in Egyptian ointment, if it is present; if not, in water and salt, and apply it to the wound, and leave it until the next day; and this will drain what remains from the night.
And then repeat the cotton, as before, on the second day, and the third, until you know well that nothing remains from the night;
then treat the wound with a suitable ointment, until it is healed.
And if the abscess contains thick pus, cut it lengthwise, according to this form; and put in your ointments, and scrape it from all sides, and put all your effort into drawing the pus out of the pocket where it lies;
and if the artery opposes you, then do what I have told you afterwards.
And do the same with the abscess if it is stony, and with the cutting and cleaning as I have told you.
And the incision on a stony and moist abscess is easier, for they contain little blood. And if there are some of these abscesses on the head where there is no moisture, and among these were abscesses that I cut on the head of an old woman;
and I found the abscess like a hard, rough, and white stone, and could not break it; and if one had struck it, one would have made a wound as well as with a stone.
In other abscesses occurring on the head, except for those which appear on the heads of children and at the roots of the ears, the opening should always be at the lowest point, so that the matter may escape;
and treat them as is necessary.
Often these abscesses occur in the neck, and under the armpits, and in the groin, and sometimes they appear elsewhere on the body, and are many, and are interconnected with one another.
And each scrofula is properly within its own sheath, like the nut and the abscess of the head, as we have said; and the appearances of these scrofulas are many.
and the appearances of these scrofulas are many. There are some that contain moisture, and there are malignant ones that do not want to obey treatment.
In that one then which you see to be of good disposition to the touch, and is similar in color to the body, and moves on every side and is not close to the nerves of the neck nor to the artery nor to the windpipe, and is not deep;
then you should cut it from above, and scrape it from each side, and extend the two lips of the heart with hooks, if you need to, as we have said in abscesses of the head;
and draw it little by little, and be sure that you do not cut the nerve or the vein, and that the spatula is not sharp or cutting, lest the hand slip, and do not go too far, lest you cut what you should not.
And if you cut the vein or the artery, and that does not allow you to work, then put in the wound crushed vitriol, or some powders that stop blood, and bind the wound; and leave it until the abscess is calmed, and the wound is softened, and begins to fester.
And when the blood is stopped, then return to your work, until you complete it;
then search with your index finger if there remain any small scrophulae, cut and cleanse them.
And if there is a large vein at the root of the scrophula, it is not necessary that you cut that scrophula at its root, but tie it with a strong double thread, and let it fall off by itself, without harm;
then fill the wound with old cotton dipped in Egyptian ointment, then dress it.
And if you cut the whole scrophula, it is necessary that you bring together the two lips of the wound, and sew them immediately, since there is no remaining superfluity because of the size of the scrophula. then you must attend to cutting its root, and pull it out, and sew it as we have said.
then you must attend to cutting its root, and pull it out, and sew it as we have said. Those scrofulas which contain superfluity, pierce them where they appear ripe;
and pierce it like the one previously mentioned, downwards, then apply tents with ointment and similar things, so that it may corrupt that which remains of the corruption; and when the wound is well cleansed, then treat it with ointment generating flesh, until it is healed.
The ancients said and spoke of the incision of the throat; but I never saw anyone in our land who did it, and this is the writing of their words.
For those who have quinsy, it is necessary that the fissure of the throat which is called "epiglottis" be opened; and that one not make aid by this, because all the veins and the lung of the sick person are near to those who have a hot abscess in the mouth, or in the throat, or in the two tonsils.
When the illness is in the channel of the lung, it is necessary to cut the epiglottis to avoid the loss which comes from strangulation.
Therefore, when we want to cut the epiglottis, we must cut it below three or four circles a small fissure across, between the two circles or by the amount of the fissure of the tonsil, not in the cartilage;
and that place is so suitable for the section of the epiglottis that there is no flesh, and the vessels are far away.
And if the master is fearful, it is necessary that he extend the skin of the throat with the hook, then cut the skin until he reaches the channel; and avoid the blood vessels, if you see anything, and then cut the tonsil, as we have said;
and it is demonstrated by the section of the phlegm of the channel which leaps forth through the place which is broken, and by the lack of voice;
and leave the wound open a while.
And when the hour has passed in which strangulation is feared, bring together the two lips of the wound of the throat, and sew it all alone without the cartilage;
then administer medicines which cause flesh to grow, until it is healed.
Albucasis says that one should not do this until the throat is completely swollen, and the patient is judged to be dying, and lacks breath. Then one cuts the epiglottis because the patient cannot breathe, and he breathes through the wound, and thus is saved from death;
and for this reason the ancients ordered leaving the wound open until the malice of the illness has passed, and it passes in three days or in four. And then they ordered sewing the wound and treating it, until it was healed;
and I will tell you what I saw. I saw that a young lady took a knife, and thrust it into her throat, and cut part of the channels of the lung;
and I was called to treat her, and found her as good as dead.
I uncovered the wound, and found the blood that had flowed from it, and I knew well that she had not cut a vein or duct except the throat, and the wind came out through the wound.
I hastened, and sewed the wound, and treated it until it was healed;
and nothing happened to the young lady except that she was hoarse, and afterwards returned to her usual state;
therefore I say that in the incision of the epiglottis one need not fear.
This abscess is called a "hernia of the throat", and is a large abscess the color of a yolk, and is very common in women;
and is of two kinds: natural, and accidental;
or natural has no remedy.
And the accidental is of two kinds, of which one resembles fat, and the other kind resembles an abscess which comes from an artery; and if there is fear, and it is not necessary to operate with fire cautery except in that which is small, and prove and search it with the whole probe: if you find it like a nut of fat, and it is not attached to any vein, cut it, as one cuts nuts, and draw it out with its covering, if there is any; and search well all around, and treat it as is necessary, until it is perfectly healed.
Many kinds of nuts there are, of which I will describe all the similarities;
And now it is necessary that I explain all the difference which is between a nut and an abscess.
I say that an abscess is accompanied by heat and fever, until the boiling is past, and the putrefaction is complete; Then the fever and the heat subside.
With a nut there is neither heat nor fever nor pain, and it contains a cyst, which is its own sac and is according to the color of the body, and begins like a pimple, and grows large;
and they are according to two appearances, either greasy or moist, and many are in color as I have said in the division.
It is necessary, when you come to the treatment of the nut, that you first examine it with the instrument which is called "probe," according to what its form will show in the chapter which follows.
And the manner of the examination of the abscesses of the nuts is that you take the moistest place that you find in the abscess, and turn your fingers little by little, until you know that the instrument has reached the core, then that it should be according to the size of the abscess;
then withdraw the probe, and take care what comes out.
If running moisture escapes, what color it has, treat it as I have said of the other abscesses;
and if after the probe no moisture comes, know that it is fatty, then treat it in a cross, and take it with tweezers, and lightly scrape it on each side and guard the sheath in which it lies so that you draw it out whole with the nut;
and if you cannot draw it out whole, then draw it out in pieces so that nothing remains.
For if anything remains, the nut returns many times;
and if a little remains, and the blood troubles you, fill the wound with some sharp corrosive powders, and clean the wound, and apply things that soothe a hot abscess, and treat it with other treatments until it is healed;
and if the nut is large, sew the two lips of the wound, and treat it with that which generates flesh.
And if the throbbing vein is contrary or otherwise hastens you, fill the place with powdered vitriol, and leave it there two or three days, until the wound festers, and the boiling of the blood rests; then return to cut away what remained of the nut.
Here are the forms of the instruments used, and there are three kinds: large, medium, and small;
and there are three squares which are called "albaret", and one which is called "breb", and there are three kinds: large, medium, and small, for encircling abscesses of fistula;
and they are like the needles with which one sews up sores, and are of yellow brass, or of iron, or of silver, and those which are yellow are worth more, and are more proven with black lead for encircling the curves of fistula;
and there are three kinds: large, medium, and small, according to the size of the width of the holes.
The shapes of the hooks are very similar, as you see here:
and there are hooks which have two curves of three kinds also;
and there are hooks which have three curves, and are also of three kinds;
and there are hooks which have two curves, and hooks of only one curve, and are of three kinds;
and all these are necessary in their place.
The heads of those with which one cuts are sharp, and there are some which do not cut except on one side, with which one scrapes the humours, so that one does not cut the vein or the nerve;
and of these introducers, the blades are enclosed in sheaths, so that the patient does not feel them at the opening of the abscesses;
and they are of three kinds: large, small, and medium, as you see;
and one uses them only in fleshy places, such as legs, and arms, and breasts, and in the armpits, and in similar places;
and sometimes one makes another small instrument, similar to a fig-wood splinter, according to this form, with which one stops blood: and it is sometimes placed in the place that heals the cutting of veins and arteries, and sometimes round according to this large form:
Sometimes the breasts of some men swell when they begin to be corrupted, until they resemble the breasts of a woman;
and remain ugly and swollen, and whoever wants to cure them, must do so according to this form, from this line b. down to g.: then scrape away the fat, and fill the wound with flesh-generating medicine, then bring together the two edges of the wound with a suture, and treat it until it is healed;
and if the breast droops and is softened by its size as happens in women, cut it in two parts from above, through two similar incisions; so that one is attached to the other at the end of each, so that the larger line contains the smaller according to this form, from this line b. to line g.; then scrape the skin that is between the two edges, and remove the fat, and apply what we have said about sutures and powders, and what is necessary in the treatment, until it is healed;
and if it is not healed, or the incision is not completely made, because the patient will not rest, or because of the flow of blood, then you must fill the wound with cotton soaked in corrosive ointment; and leave it until it consumes the remaining flesh and fat, then treat it until it is healed.
These abscesses that come from under the armpits are kinds of hard scrofula where there are ribs, and some contain moisture.
Those then which contain moisture must be cut according to this form, from line b to line g: And when all the pus that is in the abscess is emptied, fill the wound with old cotton, and leave it until the next day, then remove all the cotton, and treat with an ointment suitable for this until it is healed.
And if the abscess is similar to scrofula, incise it as we have said in the incisions of scrofula, and if the wound produces pus, apply cautery as we have said before.
When the artery is broken, and the skin above is sutured, abscesses often result, and the same happens with an inflamed vein and abscess;
and one knows it thus when it is due to the artery, the abscess is long and deep; and when you feel it with your fingers, you feel a pulsation;
and when it is due to the vein, it is round and apparent on the outside;
and it is folly to cut this abscess, especially when it is under the armpits and in the groin and neck and in many other places, and is very large. It is necessary then to avoid the treatment with iron, and the one that is in the head should also be avoided, and in the one that is from an artery swelling, one makes an incision above the skin along its length;
then open the incision with hooks, and carefully separate the artery from the tissues, until it is uncovered;
then put a needle underneath it, and make it pierce to the other side, and draw the artery out with a double thread in two places, according to what I have taught you in the extraction of the two arteries that are in the temples;
then prick the place that is between the two ligatures with a lancet until the blood that is there comes out, and the abscess is emptied;
then administer the treatment that heals well, until the ligatures fall off; then treat it with an ointment suitable for it, until it is healed;
and if the abscess is due to the incision of a vein, then you must hold in your hand what you can of the abscess along with the skin, then put the needle under the place that you hold in your hand, and make it pierce, and let there be a double thread, so that you draw it from the other side; then tie the abscess, as I have told you, with the ligature on one of the two sides at the two ends of the thread;
and if you doubt that the threads will come out, then put another needle with a thread under the whole abscess at the incision of the first needle, and draw the threads in four places;
then cut the abscess until the excess comes out, then cut the excess from the heart and leave what is tied;
then put on a cloth moistened in wine and oil, then administer treatments of tents and ointments until it is healed.
Just as abscesses come in the artery and in the vein, abscesses come to the nerves when they are injured, or by too much work, and similar things.
And this happens more often in the shoulders and fingers and in all places where there are joints, and it is a serious abscess, and its color resembles the color of the body, and is in many ways without pain;
and when it is squeezed hard, the patient feels pain, and it is not deep in the body, but under the skin;
and spreads well in all directions, and does not go forward or backward, or down or up, and the one that is in joints should not be cut with iron: by chance, contraction would result; and the one that is on the head or forehead, incise the skin with a spatula.
and the one that is on the head or forehead, incise the skin with a spatula. If the abscess is small, hold it with tongs, and cut it at its root;
and if it is large, lift it with a hook, and scrape it, then remove it and sew up the wound, and treat it until it is healed.
Sometimes it happens in the abdomen and nowhere else, and it is a disease that is called "fungus" because of its resemblance, and its root is thin, and its head large;
and there are small ones and very large ones;
and I saw a man who had two in his belly which were more like fungi than anything else, and there was no difference, and they were white, and had thin roots, and were split open, and moisture constantly flowed from them.
I cut them and found one weighing eighteen ounces, and the other six and a half, and the procedure in the incision is that you look if the patient is moist, and the color of the fungus is white and moist and of thin root; if you cut it with a wide spatula, and have the fire cautery in your presence.
if you cut it with a wide spatula, and have the fire cautery in your presence. For in the cutting there often comes too great a flow of blood, and if the blood overcomes you, then hasten to cauterize;
and if you see the patient frightened and fearful of the incision of the iron, take a well-made lead thread, and tie the fungus with it as we have said, and leave it for two days;
and then constrict it, and do not cease to constrict the lead thread until it cuts the fungus, and it falls by itself without labor;
and if the roots are large, there is fear in cutting itself for the belly, but you can well cut half, then cauterize it so that it does not return;
then cure the wound, and take care that you do not cut the small growth which is of a dark color and of poor sensation and milky appearance.
For this is a cancerous abscess, and I will come to the treatment of cancer afterwards.
when the swelling comes forth If the appearance of the swelling comes from a cauterized wound or a fissure of the fascia, and is on the belly and some of the swellings come forth, as happens in other ruptures, or of blood flowing from veins or arteries according to what is before, or from flatulence;
and if it is by the rupture of the fascia and by the protrusion of the bowel, then the color of the abscess is similar to the color of the body, and it is a light thing without pain, and appears of diverse issue. And if it is due to the protrusion of the intestine, then it is more diverse, and when one presses it with one's fingers it retracts, and then returns, and perhaps it is scarred, and increases greatly at the entry into the bath and by hard work.
And if it is due to moisture, it is a light thing, and it appears well when you press it with your hand, and does not constrain.
And if it is due to blood, then the abscess appears large and hard through these signs, and is fixed according to a quantity; and if it is due to flatulence, it is soft to the touch, and the procedure is that you look whether the appearance is due to the blood of the artery, or the vein, or flatulence.
and if it is due to flatulence, it is soft to the touch, and the procedure is that you look whether the appearance is due to the blood of the artery, or the vein, or flatulence. Then you must leave the treatment. For there is doubt and fear, as I told you in the chapter on abscesses, concerning the artery and the vein.
And if the appearance is due to the intestine or bowel, then you must instruct the patient to hold his breath, and lie completely straight, then bleed around the swelling; then instruct him to lie often between your hands, then go around the place you have marked with the whole spatula, then extend half of the abscess upwards with the large hook; then tie it around with a strong thread, or a cord of strong silk firmly, and let the knot of the binding be loose;
then open the half of the abscess extended above the binding, and put your index finger there, and search for the intestine; if you find it caught by the binding, then untie it, and put the intestine outside the belly;
and if you find the bowel, then take it with the hook, and cut off the excess;
and if the artery opposes you, or the vein, then go carefully around, then return to your work and take two needles, and put two strong threads there, and put the two needles around what you have made in a cross that you made pierce;
then bind the abscess in four places above the needles, and if you wish, remove the needles, and leave the place until it festers, and the dead flesh falls off by itself; or you cut it when it is thin and rotten, then treat it as is necessary, and finish the abscess as we have said;
or you cut it when it is thin and rotten, then treat it as is necessary, and finish the abscess as we have said; and draw out the blood or moisture that you find, then treat the place as is necessary, and close the wound.
Of the chancre We have described in the division the types of chancre, and how one should treat them with medicines, and how one should avoid the use of iron;
and we say that chancre develops in the marrow, and is very difficult to treat, and the ancients said that when a chancre is in a place where it can be scraped away, such as a chancre that is in the breasts, and in the thigh, and in similar places, and one should remove it entirely when it is in the beginning;
nor has anyone ever healed it before me.
And the procedure, when it is in a place where it can be removed, as we have said, is that you purge the patient sometimes of black bile;
then make him bleed if he has a manifest repletion, then prepare the patient in a good place to perform the operation;
then throw your ointments on the cancer, and the hair from all sides, and remove it from all sides without leaving anything;
and let the blood flow completely, and press well on the place with your hand or something else, and if the flow of blood prevents you from incising the artery or vein, then cauterize it until the bleeding is stopped; then treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
Of dropsy We have, I said in the division, the appearances of dropsy, and in what manner the gathering of water is made, and the signs of each appearance, and the cure which is made by medicines, and that which is cured by iron:
and one should not touch with iron in these two appearances: that is to say, tympanites and ascite, for it is a deadly thing;
therefore when you treat this appearance of dropsy which is called "burst" with medicines, and the cure does not help, then see if the patient is weak, or if he has another illness than dropsy, such as fever and diarrhea and similar things; then do not touch with iron, for there is danger;
and if you see the patient of strong constitution, and he has no other illness than dropsy alone, and he is neither too young nor too old, then you must act thus: lift the patient straight up on your hands, and press the belly, pushing the water to the lowest part of the abdomen, then take the spatumile espinous according to this form: And let it be sharp on two sides. pointed, and yet not so penetrating that it can reach the intestine when it is inserted, and cannot injure it;
then see if the dropsy is concentrated towards the intestines: if so, you must make three incisions above the buttocks, straight up from under the hip; and if the dropsy is due to liver disease, let your incision be on the left of the buttocks, three fingers wide;
and if it is due to the spleen, let it be on the right, and it is not necessary that the patient lie on the incision lest the superfluities run to that weak place;
then pierce all the skin with the instrument, and push it in, and lift your hand with the whole spatula between the skin and the peritoneum, as in skinning, to the extent of a fingernail or thereabouts;
then pierce the peritoneum until the spatula reaches the empty space, and this is the place of the water, then draw it out, and insert this instrument of which this is the form: And it is similar to a fine silver tube, and is made of light bronze or brass, and has at the lower part one small hole; and on one side, three holes; and two on another side, and one on another;
and the head is cut like a pen, and this is the shape of the incision with which the scribes cut the pen:
at the top is the handle, so that when the instrument comes to the water, it immediately descends on the instrument;
empty then half or a third part, for if you empty more than is necessary at that time, perhaps the patient will die from the resolution of his vital spirit, or he will fall into a faint, or he will approach death;
but empty according to the quantity of its strength, and according to what the dispositions of the patient's strength signify, and his pulse;
then draw out the instrument and retain the water, and it is retained immediately by the heart which stops the opening which is on the surface, of which I have spoken, that you pierce in this manner;
then resume the instrument the next day, if you see the patient enduring it, and draw out a small quantity of water;
do this every day, and be careful not to continue until there remains only a little water.
And if you are in doubt about the patient, and you leave much water in him, then cure him with a hot poultice or warm sand, and by much sweating or a bath and the sun, and let him abstain from drinking; and cure him with drying medicines until he is healed, and cauterize on the stomach and on the liver and on the spleen after the extraction of the water, as I have said before.
Sometimes children are born who have no opening in the penis, or the opening is small, or it is not in its proper place.
Then it is necessary that he be pierced immediately with a very fine spatula according to this form:
then put into the opening a thin lead tube, and bind it and keep it thus for three or four days; and when he wants to urinate, let the tube be removed, and let him urinate, and then replace it;
and perhaps it is not necessary, for the urine that comes out will not leave it closed.
For one whose opening is small, it is treated with the lead tube, as we have said, and it will widen.
Those who do not have the opening in its proper place are injured, for some are born who have the opening at the head of the penis, wherefore they cannot urinate unless they raise their penis upwards; and cannot reproduce because the matter cannot reach the testicles, and this is a serious illness.
And the manner of the procedure is that the patient lies often on his back, then the head of the penis is extended and cut like the quill of a pen, so that the opening falls in the middle, as it should;
and beware of the bleeding that often occurs there, and if it happens, staunch it with what stanches blood, and treat the wound until it is healed.
of the pustules of the penis Often these whitlows appear on the penis, and it is an unsightly appearance of flesh;
and there are malignant and non-malignant ones;
you must take them with a fine scalpel, and cut and clean them all, then apply moistened cotton with Egyptian ointment; then treat it with diafinicon ointment until it is healed.
And if the whitlow is malignant, of a foul color and putrid, then you must apply a cautery.
When you have cut it, and if the whitlow is on the penis, and part of it is inside the skin and part outside, then you must remove the whitlow that is inside first; and when it is closed, then treat the outside.
For when you treat it together, the penis is not ensured from being pierced, and blackness and corruption come to the penis and the testicle;
it is necessary to remove all that is black and corrupt, then apply a plaster of honey and flour made from the bark of pomegranates and vetches, then treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
And if a flow of blood occurs, administer the lunar cautery according to this form:
The cautery helps in two ways together: that is to say, to the flow of blood, and to the corruption;
and if the head of the penis is corrupt and retracted, it is necessary that you insert into the canal of the penis a lead tube, and let the patient urinate through it;
and when the skin is tight around the head of the penis, which happens to those who have not been circumcised, or which happens because of a wound or an abscess, then it is necessary that you scrape it with a sharp instrument, until the constriction is loosened, and the head of the penis is freed on all sides;
and if it is a serious matter to remove this, it is necessary that you scrape it with a spatula a little bit of the head of the penis and of the skin;
then separate gently the two parts, and place there a thin linen cloth moistened in cold water, so that it does not constrict again.
Circumcision is not the loosening of a continuity like other wounds; however, when we perform this operation by our own will, and properly on children, it is necessary that we perform the best work, and the easiest for healing.
I say that the ancients did not speak of the circumcision of their children, for they did not use it in their law, and we have nothing but that which we have acquired through experience.
For I have seen the greater part of the masters and surgeons who performed circumcision around the glans, forcefully, and with a whole scalpel;
the heart fled because there are two membranes, and perhaps one cuts the upper one and leaves the lower one. Now it must be cut, and the pain is doubled, and the cleansing which is of the glans is not assured at the tip of the member;
and in the cleansing of the nail perhaps the iron slips, and spoils the work, and often they are born thus that they have no need of cleansing and I have seen it.
Of the cleansing which is done forcefully with a linen thread, I have found the goodness of the experiment, for the threads cut just as well above as below.
For when you press your hand, you cut equally in one single moment; but that the thread be well tight around the skin;
and the manner of the first operation is that you make the child think, if he understands, that you are only tying the thread around the penis, and then you make him rejoice in every way that you can;
then make him stand straight between your hands, and place the threads between your hands or under your feet so that the child does not see them, nor any of the instruments;
then put your hand to the penis and blow on the heart, and pull it upwards until the head of the penis is inside; then cleanse it well of the filth that has gathered there, then mark the place with a double thread, then tie it below, one little knot after another;
then cleanse it well of the filth that has gathered there, then mark the place with a double thread, then tie it below, one little knot after another; and hold it with two fingers for the second hour, by the little finger and the index finger, and cut between the two ties, then quickly lift the heart and pull the head of the penis; then let the blood flow little by little, for that is the best; and put powder on, and on the powder a cloth glued with a little of a cooked egg yolk mixed with rose water, prepared with good and fresh rose oil, and leave it on until the next day, and treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
The form of the forces for the cleansing is this:
the two ends should be sharp and cutting, and the ends should be as large as the handle, equally:
The error of the cleansing is when the pus flees at the incision;
then you must spread it with your fingernail, so that the place forms an abscess;
and cut it evenly, and if you cannot hold it with your fingernail, then hold it with tongs, and then cut it.
And if three days pass, and what is beneath the penis is swollen, leave it until the swelling of the abscess is subsided, and then lightly scrape it;
cut it as much as you can move, and guard the part of the penis, it will not harm it at all.
Then cure the place of the wound with the things [soothing powders], which we have said in the treatise on powders, and if one cuts too deeply and it goes to the top, it will not harm.
then cure it, as we have said, until it is healed.
Of the retention of urine
The retention of urine is from obstruction by stone, or congealed blood, or bowel, or dead flesh, or similar things, which we have said in the division;
and if the urine is not released, and you see that the retention is because of a stone which is in or near the neck of the bladder, then it is necessary that the patient be bent over his knees; and his feet be placed on his back, and he extend his belly from the upper part of the back, and the patient restrain his breath as much as he can; and then the neck of the bladder is constrained to express the stone upwards, because of which the urine is released;
and if it does not come, as we have said, and the patient feels great pain, then you must administer extraction with the instrument that is called a "syringe," of which this is the form:
and it should be of fine silver, light and hollow, like the quill of a bird; and the tube should be a palm and a half long, and thin at the end.
And the method of releasing the urine is that you take a doubled thread, and tie a small amount of wool or cotton to the end, and insert the end of the thread into the syringe;
and cut off the excess wool and push it to the end of the syringe, then lubricate the syringe with oil or butter and egg white, and have the patient sit on a seat, and moisten the bladder and penis with warm water and olive oil;
then gently insert the syringe into the penis, until it reaches the root of the penis, then bend the penis upwards towards the belly;
then push the syringe forward to the bladder, and the patient will feel it reach the empty space, and this is not done according to this order except because the passage where it goes is twisted;
then pull the thread with the wool little by little, and the urine follows the wool, then pull it out completely, and let the urine flow;
and repeat with the syringe until the bladder is emptied, and the patient is relieved.
When scabs or blood come into the bladder, or corruption gathers there, and you want to instill waters and medicines, do so with the instrument that is called a "clepsydra," and this is its form:
It is closed, and it has three openings: two on one side, and one on the other, as you see;
and the head through which the medicine flows should be such that it stops up the penis well without addition, so that one can draw out the moisture, and insert when necessary;
and when you wish to pour your medicines into the bladder, put the head of the instrument into the moisture, and pull on the tube which is inside;
then you will draw the moisture into the instrument, and then push the tube forcefully inside again; then the moisture will enter, and will reach the bladder immediately, so that the patient will feel it;
and this is the form of the subtle clyster with which one clysterizes the bladder:
And it is of silver or tin, and the head is higher;
and below there is a hole where the liquid falls;
then take a sheep's bladder and put in it the liquid with which you wish to clysterize the bladder, then tie it between the two holes firmly with a good double thread, and heat the liquid a little over the fire;
then put the head of the clyster into the penis, then squeeze your hand on the bladder with all the liquid gently, until the patient feels that the liquid has reached the bladder;
and if you do not have a bladder, take a piece of parchment, and make a circle from it, and pierce it roundly all around; then put a strong thread into these holes, then assemble the circle as one assembles a bowl, and put inside what you wish of oil and liquid and water, and tie it to the instrument;
and do as you did with the bladder, pressing with your hand until the liquid reaches the bladder.
of the stone
We have, I said in the division, the kinds of stone, and their extraction along with medicines;
and I have spoken of the difference between the stone lodged in the kidneys, and all the signs, and which stones one should operate on by cutting; and in the bladder, and in the penis;
and I will tell you clearly and briefly.
I say that the stone which is lodged in the bladder happens more often to children, and it is a sign that the urine spurts from the bladder similar to water in its thinness;
and sand appears, and the patient scratches his penis, and it hangs down many times, and then becomes stiff; and in many of these, the buttocks jump;
and the healing of children is easy until they are four years old, and it is very difficult in old men, and it is moderate in young adults, in those who are between youth and old age;
and the cure is easier for those who have a large stone than for those who have a small one.
And when we come to the cure, it is first necessary to cleanse the patient with a clyster, to remove all the feces that are in the intestines. For it sometimes hinders the retrieval of the stone.
Then take the patient by the feet, and lift and move him upside down, so that the stone descends to the bottom of the bladder, and sometimes protrudes from the high place;
then make him sit between your prepared hands, and his hands should be under his thighs, so that the bladder is entirely inclined downwards;
then seek and touch it inside;
If you feel the stone in the space, then hasten now to cut upon the stone.
And if it does not fall completely to the touch, moisten your index finger with oil from your left hand, if the patient is a child, or your middle finger, if the patient is a fully grown young man; and put it into his fundament, and seek the stone, and when you feel it with your finger, bring it to the neck of the bladder;
then press upon your finger, and push it to the outside where you wish to cut.
And instruct the assistant to press the bladder with his hand, and instruct him to lift the testicles upwards with his right hand, and with his left hand remove the skin which is beneath the testicles in the area where the incision is made;
then insert the cutting spatula, which is shaped like this: And cut between that which is between the testicles and the fundament, not in the middle but to the left side of the seam;
and it should be directly over the stone, and your fingers should always be at the fundament, and the incision should be such that it is wide on the outside, and narrow inside, according to the size of the stone, and not too large;
by chance press with the finger which is at the fundament, so that it comes out without difficulty;
and know that there are some stones which have angles and edges: then it is difficult to remove;
and there are some which are smooth, similar to an acorn, and round, from which the removal is easy.
For that one then which has angles and edges, make the incision larger;
and if it does not come out, then you must use forceps which are like a file at the head, to gently extract the stone so that it does not escape; or you put underneath it a thin instrument curved at the head;
and if you cannot manage it thus, slightly widen the opening, and if the blood flows, restrain it with vitriol;
and if there is more than one stone, first put the largest one at the neck of the bladder, then cut above, then draw it out, and the smaller ones afterwards if there are several.
And if it is very large, it must be sawn, and a larger incision made. For two things happen to the patient: either he dies, or the urine constantly escapes because the place cannot heal;
but nevertheless try to pull it out, or break it with tongs, until you remove it in pieces;
and when you have completed your work, fill the wound with incense and aloes and dragon's blood, and bind it, and place over it a cloth moistened in oil and wine, or in oil and rose water and cold water, to soothe the hot abscess; then raise the patient up by his neck, and do not untie the bandage until the third day.
And when you untie it, wash the area very well with oil and water, then treat it with diafinicon ointment and basilicon ointment, until it is healed.
And if hot abscesses and corrosions appear in the wound, and blood clots in the bladder, and the urine is thereby retained, which is known in such a way that it comes out with the urine without jumping: then put your finger into the wound, and extract that blood, for if it remains there, it will corrupt the bladder, and rot it;
then cleanse the wound with water, vinegar, and salt, and help it in every way that you know, until it is healed;
and it is necessary that every time you treat it, you bind the two thighs together, and apply the medicines to the area.
And if the stone is small, and it is in the passage of the penis, and lodged inside, and the urine cannot come out; then treat it as I said before, that you cut it many times, and one is excused from the incision by this treatment. I have already proven this so.
Take an iron drill according to this form and let it be with three angles fixed in a firebrand:
then take a thread and tie it around the penis below the stone, so that it cannot return to the bladder;
then put the drill into the penis lightly, until it reaches the stone; and turn the drill with your hand in the stone little by little, until you can pierce the stone on the other side;
then the urine will come immediately, then press your hand on what remains of the stone that is inside the penis. Then it is immediately broken, and jumps out with the urine, and the patient is cured;
and if you cannot do this because of something that prevents it, then tie a thread under the stone and another above, then cut the penis towards the stone between the two threads, then pull it out, and untie the threads, and clean the congealed blood that is in the wound; and treat it until it is healed.
of the stone of women
It happens that a stone is engendered in women, and if it happens sometimes, the cure is difficult, and is forbidden for three reasons:
one is that perhaps the woman is a virgin;
and the second is that one cannot find a knowledgeable woman who will uncover herself to the physicians, especially when she is chaste.
And the third reason is that perhaps one cannot find a woman well-skilled in this art nearby;
and the fourth reason is that the stone in a woman is deeper than the stone in a man, wherefore a deeper incision is necessary, and there is great danger. And if necessity demands it, then you must take a well-skilled female physician, and one scarcely finds them, and if you do not find one, do not seek a chaste and subtle physician;
and present to her a wise matron experienced in the lives of women, or a woman who knows something of the art, and instruct her to do what you instruct her concerning the examination of the stone; and look very carefully if the woman is a virgin:
and look very carefully if the woman is a virgin: then she must insert her finger into the rectum and search for the stone;
and if she finds it, she should press it down with her finger, and instruct her to place her finger in the vagina of the patient, and press her left hand firmly against the bladder.
If she finds it, then she must move it gradually from the entrance of the bladder downwards, until it comes to the root of the thigh;
then cut above the stone at the root of the thigh towards the middle of the vagina, where the muscle is prepared, and feel the stone in that area; and do not move her finger above or below the stone, and let the incision be small at first;
and do not move her finger above or below the stone, and let the incision be small at first; then put the tool into the incision; if you feel the stone, enlarge the wound until the stone can come out, and know that there are many types of stones:
that is to say, small and large, rough and smooth, long and round, and which have roots.
so know the similarities to know the outcome.
And if the blood overcomes you, put crushed vitriol on the spot, and hold it for an hour until the bleeding is stopped;
then return to your work, until the stone is out, and have the instruments that I told you about in the extraction of the stone in men to help you in your work;
and if the blood overcomes you, and it is from the artery that is cut, put the powder on the spot and restrain it with tents and bandages, and do not recommence that, and leave the stone and do not extract it, lest by chance the patient die; then treat the wound.
And when the heat of the blood is subsided, and the place is dry, then return to your work, until the stone is out.
Watery hernia is nothing other than a collection of moisture or white fluid, which is under the skin of the scrotum, which contains the testicle;
and it is called "syfac," and sometimes it is properly in the membrane of the testicle, so that one thinks that it is another testicle; and it is the skin of the scrotum between the white fluid that we have mentioned;
and this happens only rarely. And the generation of this hernia is from weakness that comes to the testicles, and this matter is spread.
And sometimes it comes from a blow to the testicles, and this moisture has many colors: or it is a color tending towards jaundice, or it is without redness, or black, or watery white, and this happens more;
and these are the signs to recognize this collection, for if it is in the white membrane that we have mentioned, the abscess is round, a little long like the shape of an egg, and the testicle does not appear, for there is moisture all around.
And if there is moisture in the proper membrane, the abscess is round with a part of the testicle, and for this reason it is thought to be another egg;
and if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white membrane, one feels it well;
therefore when you wish to know the color of the moisture, test it with the square probe, whose form is shown above. According to what comes out after the probe, judge what is inside.
And when we treat it with iron, it is necessary that the patient be bled according to his strength and the fullness of his body;
then place him on his back, on something a little high, and place many cloths under him;
then sit on his left, and instruct the assistant to sit on his right, and extend the rod to one of the two ribs of the heart near the testicles;
then take the sharp knife, and cut the skin of the scrotum lengthwise down to near the handle, and let your incision be straight, separating the skin of the scrotum to the white fascia, and carefully peel it according to your ability;
then pierce the fascia full of water with one large hole, and drain all the water, and then apply your ointments, and stretch the fascia upwards;
and do not touch the testicles themselves, but only the fascia; cut all or parts of the side very carefully, because if you do not cut it wisely, the water will return;
and if a testicle jumps out during your work, replace it in its place when you have completed the work on the fascia;
then join the two lips of the scrotum with a suture, then treat it like other wounds, until it is healed.
And if you find the testicle corrupted by another illness, then you must tie the vessels that are suspensory, fearing the flow of blood;
then cut the testicle with all the suspensory ligament, and remove the testicle, and treat it as we have said.
And if pus is gathered in two parts together, know that these are two branches; then cut the other part as you did the first equally, then wipe away the blood, and put in the wound wool soaked in rose oil;
then cut the other part as you did the first equally, then wipe away the blood, and put in the wound wool soaked in rose oil; and put on top other wool soaked in wine and oil, and put it over the two testicles, and put over it doubled cloths, and bind it all with a linen bandage which is according to this form:
Then take two cloths, and fill them with carded wool according to this likeness and let them be joined by sewing at the top of the breeches, and one of the ends should go over the buttocks down to the back, and the other to the groin;
and the other two ends over the two thighs, and let all the bandage be assembled in the buckle of the breeches;
and sometimes this branch is medicated with cautery instead of an iron knife, and it is that you take a thin, knife-like cautery, and cut the skin of the testicles, and let it be heated as we have said, so that the white layer which contains the water is uncovered;
then take the cautery according to this form, and pierce that layer with the awl, and scrape it with this hot, thin cautery:
And cut it in all the ways that you can, until you have scraped it all;
and be careful that the fire does not touch the testicle;
and know that this work is safer; and less prone to bleeding, and gentler than cutting operations;
and if anything goes against you, whether an abscess, bleeding, or something else, then treat what is hindering you, according to what has been said before.
And if the patient is fearful and does not want to undergo this operation because of its horror, then perform a perforation, as I tell you, and it is that when you are certain by the signs that we have mentioned that watery humor is present, then have the patient sit on a raised seat; then pierce the abscess in the lower part with a spatula as wide as possible, and make the perforation lengthwise along the body;
and let the hole be wide, so that all the water may flow out freely;
then put cotton on the place, and bind it, and leave it to drain the remaining water, then treat it until the wound is healed;
and if the white cloth does not allow the water to escape from the wound opening, then you must insert a quill or the instrument with which one draws water from dropsical patients, the form of which is described above;
and widen the wound slightly, and know that the water will return, and will accumulate after six months or thereabouts, and when it is accumulated as before, and thus the patient will spend his days.
Know that in the incision of this branch there is fear in many situations, which is why it seems to me better that it be left;
and I will tell you the procedure and the characteristics of the abscess.
I say then that many abscesses come on the body, and especially on the testicles; and that is in many cases.
That is to say, by an excess of sharp and acrid humor, which is spread to the testicles, or by percussion;
and the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body; and it finds no pain, and is a serious abscess;
and perhaps there are serious, dangerous, and stony abscesses, and of a livid color, and sometimes it comes from an artery, or from a vein swelling.
When it is from an artery, it is known by the disposition of the hot abscess, when you press it with your fingers; and you must not touch it.
That which is made from a vein swelling is known by its disposition to the expression of the touch of the fingers, and one can well make an incision on this type, and on the other sores; and it is that you cut the heart of the testicles, then extend the egg upwards, and draw the white sheath strongly, and free the suspensory ligament from all parts of the testicle.
If the testicle is already fused with the neighboring tissues, then you must draw out the testicle and cut it;
and if it is attached to the sheath, or to that which is within the vessels, then you must free all that tissue and cut it roundly.
And if the origin of the flesh is in the posterior location, then you must cut it all away and extract the testicle, as we have said.
And when your work is complete, fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine, then treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
This is an abscess enveloped in a covering similar to a bud, with softening of the testicles, and the patient moves with difficulty when he walks;
and the treatment of this illness is almost as frightening as the one before, and yet we will tell you its treatment, according to what the ancients did.
It is necessary that you make the patient sit on a raised seat, then place the suspensory of the testicles down to your fingers, with all the vessels that are near the penis, and let the master hold them, and stretch them strongly;
then cut with a sharp, wide spatula across towards the vessels, until they are uncovered, and then scrape on each side, as we have said in the extraction of arteries that are in the temples;
then insert a needle with a double thread, and tie it at the first place where the pus has come, and tie it again at the other end; then cut them in the middle straight, according to the length of the body, and draw out the corrupted humors;
then treat the wound like the others where you insert a bandage, so that no vessel is injured that nourishes one of the testicles;
for by this no harm comes, and if pus comes to all the vessels, then it is necessary to draw out the testicles with all the vessels; so that the testicle does not lose its nourishment because of the incision of the vessels, and dries up and cannot be helped.
The occurrence of this hernia is by the section that occurs in the syfac (synovial membrane), or the extension on the abdomen in the groin area, because of which the intestines descend from that rupture to one of the testicles;
and this rupture is either of the syfac (synovial membrane), or of its extension, and these two types come from many causes:
from percussion, or from jumping, or from shouting, or from lifting a heavy weight, and from similar things;
and the signs when it is from the extension of the syfac (synovial membrane), are that it happens little by little, over a long time, and does not come suddenly; and the swelling is even towards the depth, because the syfac (synovial membrane) presses on the intestine.
And the sign is that when it is from the section of the syfac (synovial membrane), it causes sudden pain at the beginning, and the swelling is diversely apparent, under the skin near, and that is because of the protrusion of the intestine and the body outside the syfac (synovial membrane).
And sometimes the intestines descend with the intestine, and are held there, and cause the patient to suffer great pain, especially when pressed.
And in these iron treatments there is fear, wherefore one must avoid them.
And the manner of the work is that you instruct the patient to return the intestine with his hand inside into the wound, if he can return it; then let it be supported on its neck, between your hands, and raise the thighs;
then extend the scrotum upwards, and cut all the skin of the testicles lengthwise; then insert into the lips of the wound hooks according to what you need to open the wound, and let it be such that the egg may come out;
then peel away the fascia that is under the skin of the testicles, until the hard white fascia is uncovered on all sides;
then put your index finger into that which follows the testicle, into that which is between the white fascia which is under the skin of the egg, and between the second fascia, and separate that which is behind the egg, and between the second fascia;
and then move with your right hand into the scrotum, and stretch the white fascia upwards with your left hand, and lift the egg with all the fascia towards the groin; and instruct the assistant to extend the egg upwards, and untie that which is behind the ligature;
and search with your fingers if there is any of the intestine wrapped in the hard white fascia, and if you find anything, then put it back into the abdomen below;
then take a needle with a thick thread made of ten threads, and insert it into the back part of the fascia, which is behind the skin of the scrotum; after the groin, then cut the ends of the threads that appear, until there are four threads; then assemble them one over the other in the manner of a cross, and tie the fascia, which we have said is under the skin of the scrotum, with a strong ligature on two sides; then wrap the ends of the threads, and tie them firmly on two sides, so that none of the vessels that nourish them can enter in, lest an abscess should form there; and place the ligature again according to the first ligature, two fingers' breadth from it, and after these two ligatures leave of the fascia which is under the skin of the scrotum the width of a finger; and afterwards all the rest according to the roundness that the testicle has;
then cut in the part which is under the skin of the scrotum, until the blood flows and the bowel appears, as we have said above;
then apply wool soaked in oil, and place it in the wound, and apply the ligature that we have described. And sometimes the white fascia that we have mentioned is cauterized, after the incision, for fear of bleeding. For this happens many times, and leave the ligature until it falls off by itself;
and if it is slow to fall off, let it be sprinkled with warm water, and apply what we have said, until it falls off;
then treat the wound with another treatment, until it is perfectly healed.
of fleshy hernia
In this branch I never saw anyone who dared to perform the treatment with iron.
And the ancients said that it is made like the branch which is around the vein, in such a manner that you tie the vessels, after the incision above or slightly below;
then cut in half, and treat the abscess with that which works, until the vessels heal;
and treat it as we have said, until it is healed.
Sometimes a rupture occurs in the angles, as we have said, and the place opens;
and none of the intestines descend to the testicles, and if any do descend, it is little, and returns every hour;
and however, if it remains too long at this point, the wound or fistula grows, until the intestine descends;
and this happens because of the extension of the fistula which is in the angles, as we have said, for it is extended, then the place is softened and swollen and opens;
and the cure is by cautery, as we have said before;
and sometimes it is cured by iron in this manner: and it is that the patient lies often on his back between your hands, then cut the swollen place of the rupture widely according to the quantity of three fingers;
and then extract the fistula which is under the skin that follows it, then take the root and put it on the apparent place of the fistula;
and press it to the depth of the belly, then sew the two apparent places of the fistula over the head of the root, and sew one and the other;
then extract the head of the root, and do not cut the fistula nor extend the egg nor anything else, as I have made you know in the treatment of the rupture of the intestines; then cure it by the treatment of wounds.
then cure it by the treatment of wounds. And when you cut the threads, then cleanse and treat the wound until it is healed.
The fistula is constricted, and has no appearance in the rupture, and the cautery is milder in this place, and closer to healing.
of the softening of the skin of the testicles
Often the skin of the testicles is softened in some men, because the flesh within is softened, and it is unpleasant to see;
and it is necessary, when one wants to cure it, that one makes the patient lie on his back, and cuts the softened skin from the natural skin;
then bring the two edges together with a suture, and if you wish, first sew the excess of the softened skin with three or four sutures firmly;
then cut between the sutures, and treat it like other wounds, until it is healed, and the thread falls out.
Of castration
Know that castration is forbidden in our law, and therefore I would rather not speak of it in this book;
and it is only necessary for two reasons:
one is that the surgeon knows how to answer when asked, and knows the treatment;
and the other, because we often need to castrate certain animals to help us, such as goats and sheep and cats and other animals.
I say then that castration is done in two ways: either by pulling, or by cutting.
In that which we do by pulling, we make the animal sit in warm water until the testicles are softened and hanging; then take them in your hand, until they are retracted and you no longer feel them.
Of castration by cutting: you must hold the animal, and press the skin of the testicles with your left hand, then tie the suspensory, and cut each testicle with one cut, when you have properly skinned them;
and leave a little of the tunic and the thin tunic which is over the vessels;
and this method of castration is better than that which is done by pulling, because with pulling, by chance, some part of the testicles remains, whereby the animal desires lust;
then treat the wound until it is healed.
Of hermaphrodites
Hermaphroditism is according to two ways in men: one is that between the two testicles appears something like the figure of a woman's nature, where there is hair, and sometimes urine flows there.
And the other way is in women, and she has above the vulva something like a penis and two testicles.
And the cure for the man and the woman is that you cut away all the added flesh, and cure it like other wounds;
in the second manner, of men whose urine escapes through the skin of the testicles, there is no cure.
Tetanus is a flesh added to the natural part, so that it is too ugly to see; and some women have it as large as a hand, and this is the cure.
It is necessary that you hold the superfluity of the tetanus in your hand or with tweezers, and cut it lightly;
and do not go too deep, that a flow of blood does not come there, then cure it with another cure until it is healed;
and to another flesh that grows at the mouth of the mare, and fills it, and by chance jumps out, and is according to the likeness of a wart, and for this the ancients called it "wart disease". Then it is necessary that you cut it, as we have said of the tetanus, and cure it until it is healed.
Erratic is when the nature of the woman is not pierced, or the opening is small; and is natural by birth, or accidental by a disease that has come there;
and is natural by birth, or accidental by a disease that has come there; or it is by added flesh, or by a thin or thick septum, and it is made deeply in the womb, or on the sides, or below, or wherever it may be;
and prevents conception, and childbirth, and perhaps having flowers (menstruation);
and the knowledge of this is by the examination of the vagina.
If the obstruction is nearby and apparent, search with your fingers or a probe.
If it is of a thin septum, and it is close to the two lips, hasten, and break it thus:
place your two index fingers together, and the woman should be on her back, her legs spread;
then stretch the two lips widely, until the thin septum is broken, and the obstruction is opened;
then take wool, and moisten it in oil, and place it on the spot, and let the woman and man lie together each day, so that it may not heal.
And if the septum is hard and thick, then you must cut it with a spatula resembling a myrtle leaf.
If the obstruction is of raw flesh, then lift it with a hook and cut it;
and have styptic medicines, such as acacia, dragon's blood, incense, together with egg white;
then apply a wide lead plate so that the wound cannot heal;
and so it should be for a long time, and apply a tent of dry linen;
then it should be treated with other treatments until it is healed.
And when in the wound comes raw flesh, it must be cut in this manner, unless it is festering abscesses. For a festering abscess which is in the wound, one should not touch with fire.
of the hemorrhoids Hemorrhoids are openings of veins from which blood frequently flows, and when the hemorrhoids are old they become swollen;
and we have already said in the division the similarities of these, and the signs, and I will here say those which receive cure.
I say that hemorrhoids and swelling, when they are deep in the wound and are not apparent to the touch, are not cured by iron.
Those which are at the opening of the wound, which one can feel, are those which one can cure.
It is necessary then that you place the woman in a cold house, then you grasp the swelling with tongs, and cut it at its roots, then sprinkle on medicines that restrain blood, such as acacia and dragon's blood and incense, and similar things;
then place her feet against the wall for an hour, then put her in cold water;
and if a flow of blood comes, make her sit in a decoction of sumac and pomegranate bark and oak galls and similar things, and then take barley flour, and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster of it and place it on her back.
And if it stops, it is good. If not, apply cupping glasses to the back and breasts without cutting;
then take wool, and moisten it in plantain juice or agrimony juice with old wine, and apply it to the place.
And when the abscess is healed, treat the place with ointment until it is healed;
and that which is called "albathir" is red, and is similar to a rough head, so it must be cut as I have said of the thelul; and then treat it until it is healed.
Many kinds of abscesses occur in the sea, such as cancer and stony abscess and herpes and esthiomenes and fistulas and hemorrhoids and hot abscess, and many other diseases that I have mentioned in the division.
It is necessary then that I describe in this treatise the hot abscess which occurs in the sea, which is not one of the abscesses which collect pus;
and if you wish to know the work of iron, see if the abscess is sharp at the beginning of its appearance, and full of heat and fever, and if it becomes red if you can see it. Then do not hasten to pierce it, but let it mature until the pain is lessened;
and then have the patient sit on a seat, and have two small seats on which he leans, and rests on his back and brings his feet together at the outer parts of the legs;
and let his thighs be spread, and put his arms under his knees, and bind them well with a good bandage;
then draw him towards the right side, and apply the instrument with which one opens the mouth of the abscess, the form of which follows here;
and it is necessary that when you wish to apply this instrument, that you first insert a probe to know the depth of the abscess, so that that which enters of the instrument does not go in deeper than it should, and that it does not injure the patient; and if the instrument is larger, it is necessary to cover the depth of the abscess with cloths, so that the instrument does not harm him;
and it is necessary that he place the cone of the instrument on top, and that he hold the instrument.
And when the abscess opens, and one opens it with a soft hand, then it is necessary to cut it at the head, with a spatula;
and when the swelling is emptied, it is necessary that you place in the wound tents moistened in rose oil, or in dry vervain oil;
and place the tent deep within the wound, to the bottom of the abscess, and place on the outside of the abscess and on the wound clean wool moistened in water in which mallows have been boiled;
then cure it after two days with a suitable ointment, until it is healed;
and sometimes one raises the abscess and the wound by a clyster of water and honey, and then of water in which lily roots and long birthwort have been boiled; then return to the ointment.
And if the wound is deep in the abscess, you must avoid cautery with iron, but cure it as we have said in the chapter.
of childbirth It is first necessary for the midwife to know the nature of childbirth, and the signs are when you see the woman bearing down, and desiring to defecate:
then the child hastens to come out; then know that this childbirth is according to the natural form, and the exit is head-first, and the afterbirth with it;
and when you see these signs, it is necessary to gently press her belly, so that the child comes out quickly;
for when it descends head-first, the afterbirth comes out with it, and the womb is cleansed of its superfluities by a good cleansing;
and that which comes otherwise does not come naturally.
For sometimes it comes feet-first, and the body or the head and hands come forth, or it comes on its belly or back, and is perhaps turned over its neck, and in other bad positions;
so it is necessary for the midwife that she be wise and skillful in these things, and beware of error and deception, and I will show you all the positions how one should help her.
If the child comes head-first in the natural way, and the woman labors grievously, and her strength is weak, then have her sit on a stool, or let the women hold her;
and let her anoint herself with oil or fenugreek that has been cooked, and then let the midwife put between her fingers the small spatula of which this is the shape: and let her break the secundine, and cut with her nail until the moisture that is inside runs out;
and grasp the woman's belly until the child descends, and if it does not descend, then it is necessary to give the woman a clyster of fenugreek mucilage with linseed oil;
then make her sneeze with sneezing powder, and hold her mouth and nose for an hour: then the child will come out immediately.
And if the two hands come out, it is necessary that you gently replace them little by little; and if they cannot enter, then have the woman sit on a stool, and raise her feet up; then lower the stool to the ground, and hold the woman so that she does not fall when it is lowered;
and if the hands cannot enter, and the child dies, then cut the hands with the knife that is mentioned above, and extract the child, and replace them equally.
of the delivery of the child on its feet When the child comes on its feet, then it is necessary to push it upwards; and then turn it little by little, until it is even;
then take it by the feet and extend it little by little.
When it comes up to the thighs, instruct someone to grasp it, and make it sneeze with sneezing powders; then it jumps out, if God wills.
And if it does not come out as we have said, then turn it little by little, until it is according to its natural form. For then it comes out easily.
And if it does not come out as we have said, take mallow juice, and sesame oil, and melted gum, and grind everything in a mortar; and put it on the woman's genitals and melt this ointment, then make her sit in warm water up to the ribs;
and when she is softened below, make her a pessary of myrrh, and put it below, and leave it for an hour; then make her sit on a seat, then make her sneeze and clear her mouth and nose, and gently press her belly, for the child will jump out immediately.
from the delivery of the child on her knees When the child comes in this way, let the midwife put her hands on it little by little; then let it be supported at its neck, and its feet hanging down, and let it lie on a bed; and bend its hands little by little, and then take its hands on its belly, and remove the pillows from underneath, until it is positioned downwards; and if the child does not come out, take its feet and move them strongly, then move its belly upwards, then put your hands there; and draw the child out little by little; and instruct the woman to strain until the child comes out.
of the delivery of the child which comes from the womb, one hand hanging down it is necessary to devise a way to bring back the hand: if one cannot bring it back, then make the woman get up and walk;
if she cannot walk, then make her lie on the bed, and spread her legs widely;
then administer the mucilage that I have described;
and if she does not give birth, then make her sit on a seat, then study bringing back the hand; and draw out the child according to its natural form, and make her sneeze, and instruct her to strain until the child comes out.
of the child's exit over its neck, and has its hands spread out, and its face turned towards its mother's back it is necessary that the midwife hold its hand, then turn it little by little, and draw it gently;
and when they are even, then apply to the area a poultice of mallow and oil, as we have said, then instruct her to move little by little;
and when you have done this, then have her sit on a seat, and instruct her to strain; and make her sneeze. in this same manner with all the afterbirth
in this same manner with all the afterbirth When it comes out in this manner with all the afterbirth, then cut the afterbirth with your fingernail until the moisture is emptied;
and if the child hangs by its face and neck, then cut it from the buttocks, so that it may not be retained, and the child die;
then put the child inside, until you have placed it as is fitting, and instruct the woman that she take herself sometimes:
Of the delivery of twins Know that twins are often born, and sometimes three or four are born; and that is not a strange thing, and it happens little. Two are a strange thing, and they do not live, except a few by name;
Two are a strange thing, and they do not live, except a few by name; I know that, that they are multiplied, and are separated by the syfac which divides them, which is attached to the navel;
and sometimes they come out as naturally as a single child, as we have said.
And if they come out grievously, treat it as we have said, and let the hand be subtle, and do quickly and lightly what it does; and do as it is best for salvation. of several children
Sometimes they are formed in the womb, one or two or three or four or five or six or seven, or more up to fifteen, and they are all formed in the shape of a child by the measurement of the glorious sage, and the hand must know all this, for by chance similar things happen; then do as is necessary.
of the dead child
When you treat a woman with a dead child in her womb, as I have said in the division, and it does not come out, and you are constrained to manual work; then you must know if the woman is of sound constitution, and has no accident or fear of death;
then the woman should be positioned on her back, with her head inclined downwards, and her legs raised;
and the attendant hold her from two sides, or she be tied to the bed so that she is not pulled during the descent of the child;
then rub the mouth of the womb with moist oils with mallow and fenugreek mucilage and linseed, then let the midwife lubricate her hands with these oils and mucilages;
then insert them into the womb gently, then find a suitable place where she inserts the fingers, and take care if the child is positioned so that it descends head first;
then insert the fingers into its eyes or its neck or its mouth or its palate or under the chin or into the clavicle or near the sides, and if the descent is feet first, insert them into the groin and the middle ribs;
and it is necessary that he hold the finger with his right hand, and place the curve between the fingers of his left hand, and gently insert it with his whole hand, and insert the finger into one of these places that we have mentioned, until he reaches the empty thing;
then insert another finger, or a third if you need it, so that the extraction is even;
and then extend it equally by moving from one side to the other, to allow the matter to come out, and let the fingers be toothed to hold the matter, as this is the shape:
And if a part remains, let him grease some of his fingers with oil, and insert them into that part, and pull out the other part;
and if any remains, place this finger or more in the higher place, and do this until it all comes out.
And if one hand comes before the other, and he cannot retrieve it because of the tightness, you must wrap it in a cloth, until all comes out; then cut it at the joint of the sole or at the heel, and so you must do in the other hand, and in the two feet.
And if the child's head is large and it is narrow at the exit, or it has a sharp swelling on the head, you must place the spatumile espinous between your fingers, and split the head and drain the water; or you round it with the instrument that is called "almidach", the form of which is shown with the instruments in the chapter that follows this one;
and do the same if the child has a naturally large head;
and then pull out the bones with tongs, and if the head jumps out and is extracted with the forceps, let it be split, until the moisture that is in the worst place comes out;
and if it cannot come out, cut it into pieces as best you can;
and if it is swollen in the belly or under the ribs, then you must pierce it so that the moisture runs out.
And if the child is on its feet, the extraction is easy, and the adjustment to the mouth of the womb is easy.
And if it is narrow in the belly or chest, then you must extract it with a cloth wrapped around your hand; and split open the belly or chest, until the moisture that is there runs out;
and if the other limbs are removed, and the head remains, then the midwife puts her hand into the depth of the womb, and draws it down to the mouth of the womb; then she puts in one or two fingers, and pulls it forcefully;
and if the mouth of the womb is constricted by a hot abscess that has formed there, then you must not work there, but must administer moist and greasy things; and administer plasters, and sit in softening and moistening water.
And if the child is on its side, and you can put it straight, then administer what we have said for a living child;
and if one does not have the power, then pull it out forcefully piece by piece, and leave nothing of the afterbirth.
And when you have done this, then administer what we have said for hot abscesses that occur in the womb;
and if a flow of blood comes, then let it be placed in astringent water, and administer other treatments.
And I saw a woman in whose womb a child had been dead, then another was conceived on top of that one, and the other was also dead. After a long time, an abscess came in her belly, and it swelled until it opened, and began to greatly fester.
I was called to the treatment, and I thought about it for a long time, and I could not heal the wound.
I applied a plaster of strong attraction, and a bone came out, and after some days another. I wondered greatly, because the belly has no bones.
So I thought that it was the bones of a dead child.
I searched the wound, and extracted many bones, until the woman was in better condition; and the woman lived a long time thus, and a little pus always issued from the place;
and I have recounted this chapter only because, when the master finds a strange thing, that he may know how to give aid.
Here follows the form of the pressor, with which one presses the books;
and with two turnings at the two heads of the two straps. However, the horns should be more subtle than the restrictor, and should be made of ebony or boxwood;
and the mouth of the wood one inch wide, and the margin of the boards one inch, and one and a half palms long; and between the two straps should be two additions of this same wood, which are fastened in one and the other, half a palm long or a little more;
and these two additions are inserted into the mouth of the machine to open when one turns the two horns.
Another form, similar in appearance but more subtle and lighter, should be made of ebony or boxwood, similar to tongs; and have at the two ends two additions, as you see, one palm long, and two inches wide;
and when you wish to open the instrument completely, have the woman sit on a bed, her feet hanging down and her legs open, then insert the two joined additions into the instrument, and hold the head of the instrument underneath between her thighs; then work your hand with the whole instrument, just as you did with the tongs equally, according to the amount you want to open the mouth of the instrument, until the opening does what it should.
These instruments are all surpassed, and their likenesses are multiplied; and when the physician has prepared them, the work is so much faster, and more valuable to men because of their quantity.
Do not disdain the instrument that you have not prepared, for their necessity is not excusable.
When the afterbirth is retained after childbirth, you must instruct the patient to hold her breath, then make her sneeze with a potion, and squeeze her hands on her mouth and nose; and if it comes out because of this, it is well.
If not, take a pot, and make a hole in the lid, and put in herbs that can open the mouth of the womb, such as calamint, rue, anise, chamomile, cassia lignea, and centaury; all these herbs, or some of them, should be boiled in water in the pot over the fire;
then place one end of a tube in the hole of the pot, and the other end in the mouth of the womb, and hold it there until the vapors enter the womb;
then make her sneeze, as we have said. If the secundines [afterbirth] come out quickly.
And if it remains after this treatment, and does not come out, instruct the midwife to moisten her left hand in sesame oil or in mallow mucilage, and then put it into the birth canal, and search for the secundines; and when she has found it, let her take it and gently pull it out straight, so that the womb does not fall during extraction;
but she must move it gently to the right and to the left, and then pull; then it will come and detach itself.
And if the mouth of the womb is too narrow, we have described the treatment of sneezing and herbal fumigation;
and if it does not come out from all that we have said, see that you do not fail to pull;
but it is necessary that what is at the mouth of the womb, that you tie it to the thigh of the woman, then clysterize it with tetrafarmagon ointment; then it will rot and soften, and will come out.
But nevertheless, when it rots, a bad odor comes to the stomach and head, and harms the patient. Then suitable fumigations are necessary for this:
Some of the ancients have tested a fumigation of cress and dried figs.
The form of the instrument with which one fumigates the woman for the retention of the flowers and afterbirth is this:
And it is of glass, similar to a cane, and one puts the thin end into the vagina, and the wide end over the fire;
and let the fumigation be on the coals, and burn it until it is consumed, and begin again with another.
Many children are born who do not have the fundament pierced, but it is stopped up by a thin membrane: then it is necessary for the midwife to pierce that membrane with her finger, and not pierce it with a sharp instrument, and guard against laceration so that she does not touch it;
then apply wool soaked in wine and oil, then treat with ointment until it is healed.
And if you doubt that it will close up again, put a lead tube in the opening, and leave it there for several days, and remove it when the child wants to use the toilet.
And sometimes this blockage comes from a sudden wound or abscess; then it is necessary to cut that blockage. Then it should be cured, as we have said of the lead tube.
Fistulas that come from beneath the fundament are knots and swellings that come near the fundament outside, or in the space between the two parts;  there is one fistula or several;
and when that knot is old, it works, and moreover moist white matter or subtle pus, and sometimes these fistulas are perforated;
and are known by the fact that there comes from them with excretion or flatulence when the patient excretes, and by chance a worm jumps out.
And there are fistulas that pierce as far as the bladder, and as far as the middle of the penis; and reach as far as the joint of the thigh, and as far as the buttock.
And thus one recognizes the fistula perforating the rectum, and not perforating: and that is that you put your index finger in the rectum, and insert a thin needle of bronze or iron into the fistula when there is no tortuosity.
And if there is tortuosity, then insert a thin lead tent, or a horsehair, until you feel the tent or the hair with your finger;
and if you do not feel it, and there is no discharge of excrement, wind, or worms from the opening, as we have said: know that it does not perforate; then hasten to cure it.
And when the fistula penetrates to the bladder or to the urinary duct, urine escapes from it, and it cannot be healed by medicines.
If it is pierced to the hip joint, the tent is brought to the place; if there is no tortuosity and the location of the pain is around it, it is that pus continuously emerges, and neither medicine nor healing by ointment is of use;
and in these penetrating fistulas there is no cure except labor, and the vanity of foolish physicians who meddle with them.
In that which is not penetrating and is not old, there is hope of healing by iron, as I have experienced, and it is that the patient lies on his back between your hands;
and he raises his legs to his thighs, and has his thighs inclined towards his belly; then place a tent of bronze, or of lead if there is tortuosity, until you know where the tent comes to.
If the patient feels it around the fundament, then you must put your index finger there, if you then feel that the tent has pierced it;
and it is uncovered where you feel between your finger the fascia or the flesh, then know that it is penetrating; then do not work on it if it cannot be healed.
It is said however that one can heal some, but this happens rarely;
and the help that is done there, is that one heats the cautery subtly according to the width of the fistula, as it is said before; and puts it very hot into the fistula, until it reaches near the bottom; and do this two or three times, until you know that the rotten flesh is burned, which is similar to a bird's feather;
and then treat it with tents moistened in butter, until that rotten flesh comes out, then treat it with an ointment that generates flesh and heals.
If it is thus healed, it is good.
If this, it cannot be healed otherwise;
and if the tent enters, and does not pierce down to the finger which is in the bottom, and between your finger and the tent there is a thick covering of flesh or of syfac, and you see the fistula at that which follows the covering of the heart; then cut from the beginning of the fistula, and push the tent always forward, and then cauterize afterwards, until it comes to the head of the tent; and the tent will be delivered, and will fall;
then cleanse those rotten fleshes that resemble a bird's feather, and let nothing remain.
And if the blood overcomes you, and runs between you and the work, then cauterize it with fire or with sharp medicine.
For fire cautery combines two good things: that is to say, the burning of these added fleshes, and the staunching of blood and the drying of moisture;
then treat it with tents soaked in butter or in crushed herbs, until the place throws off pus, and the burnt flesh comes out in the pus;
then treat the wound with ointments that induce hard flesh, and the medicines are dry.
For when it is restored, it is healed and does not return.
And if a fistula reaches down to the bottom of the fundament, and is distant from the body, put your finger into the fundament, and search for it.
If you feel the tent, and between the two is the membrane or the syfac or flesh, where it is about to pierce, there is no other way than faith and hope, through the administration of one of the three methods:
either you cauterize it as we have said, or you cut it to the bottom, or if you can, you place tents there and treat it as before;
and do not go too deep, lest you cut the ligament that holds the fundament, and there is an evacuation against the will; then treat it, as we have said;
then treat it, as we have said; perhaps it will be healed, or you remove that covering and clean it after it is cut near the fundament, either with a tent or other pointed instrument; then clean the rotten flesh that is in the wound, as much as you can; then strive to restore the wound, and to keep the fistula on the outside of the fundament:
then strive to restore the wound, and to keep the fistula on the outside of the fundament: that will be easier for the patient.
And sometimes there are fistulas in this manner: and it is when you insert the tent into the fistula, and it is beside the fundament near the skin above, then take a tent pierced at the end according to this form: And put one twisted thread into two, and insert the tent with the thread into the fistula until it reaches the end.
If it is penetrating into the margin of the fundament inside, then pull the thread through that hole, so that you insert your finger into the fundament;
and pull the end of the thread, and bring the two ends together, and pull one against the other, and leave it one or two days;
and restrain it sometimes, until the thread cuts the flesh that is between them, and they heal;
then treat the wound until it is healed and sound.
If the fistula does not pierce, then make it pierce in all the ways that you can, if it is not too deep. For it is not necessary to cut too deeply for the laceration, and then treat it, as we have said, until it is healed.
The shape of the spatumile spine with which one opens the fistula is very sharp on one side and cutting; and on the other side not, so that one does not cut what one should not cut, as you see here:
Hemorrhoids are according to two manners: or they are inside the rectum, like grains of resin, and there are small and large ones, and they constantly bleed, and there is one or more, and they are outside the rectum and at the end of the rectum;
but those which are outside have little moisture, and often a little citrine water or a little blood, and have the color of the flesh;
and the cure of those who have them inside the rectum, is that you instruct the patient to strain to go to the privy, until the rectum comes out, and the threads appear; then hurry, and hang it with tongs, or hold it with your fingernail, then cut it at its roots;
and if the hooks cannot hold them because of their moisture, then take them with a cloth, or with cotton, or a piece of camlet; and pull them out with your fingers, then cut them, and sprinkle on top some hot powders which are in place of a cautery; or you cauterize them as is said in the chapter on cautery, then treat them with other treatments until they are healed;
and if the matter cannot come out, then clysterize the patient with a biting and harsh clyster to wash that which is in the fundament, so that it may clearly come out; when the patient is seized, and if the threads are strong from the fundament, then the cure is easy;
when the patient is seized, and if the threads are strong from the fundament, then the cure is easy; and it is that you take them with your fingernail or with tongs, and cut them, then treat them as we have said, until they are healed, and that he dreads the incision by iron. Then it is necessary that you administer the suture according to this manner:
Then it is necessary that you administer the suture according to this manner: take one twisted thread, and put it in a needle, and then pull the thread above and make the needle pierce on the other side, and turn the two ends of the thread under the needle, and let it be wide;
and pull the thread tightly, then knot the thread, and pull out the needle, and do so for all the others, and leave one to run off the excess of blood;
then put on the wound a cloth moistened in rose oil or in cerate, and put it on the wound, and instruct the patient to rest;
and then leave it until they fall off, and when they have fallen off, treat them with ointment and other treatment, until they are healed.
of the drying of the fistula or wound Often there is drying of the fistula in the intestine, and by constriction of nature, and when the illness is old and medicine is of no use. Then you must scrape with the point of a spatula or with your fingernail the scab from above, which prevents it from moistening; then treat it until it is healed as is necessary;
and if it cannot heal, then begin scraping more forcefully than before, until it is very healthy and the scab is removed; then treat it until it is healed.
of the tremor Formication is a small, faulty sensation around the body, and it goes very deep;
and sometimes it finds the cold, and one feels it as if dead from trembling, and it comes over the whole body, and more in the hands than elsewhere.
And the cure is that you take a quill from a goose feather, or a strong vulture feather, and place that quill on the tremor, until the circle encompasses the tremor entirely; then turn your hand with the quill until you cut all around the tremor, and put it deep in, and eradicate the tremor from its roots.
And if you wish, do this with a quill of bronze or iron according to this form, and let it be subtle below and sharp above: not pierced, to hold and press firmly with the finger.
And if you wish, cauterize the tremor, as is described in the chapter on cautery.
Sometimes a clyster is made of silver or tin, or molten bronze or lead;
and sometimes these instruments are made small and large, according to those to whom they are administered. Those then which are administered in the treatment of children and who are weak and painful, are small.
Those then which are administered in the treatment of children and who are weak and painful, are small. The form of the small and large clyster is wider above, where the belly is tied in this manner:
and there is a release where the belly is tied, as you see, and the bottom is pierced inside;
and has on one side two holes, and on the other one;
and let the belly where one puts the medicines be of an animal bladder or parchment, and let it be pierced all around with small holes, and let there be one finger's breadth between each hole, then put in these holes a strong thread of raw thread twisted in X or around, and gather the belly like a goat's bladder; and when the medicine is inside, tie it to the instrument in front with a strong thread, then clysterize;
and this is the form of the circle:
And let the medicine be neither too hot nor too cold, and anoint the head of the clyster with oil or egg white, or something similar, then insert it gently; then let the administrator squeeze it with both hands together, until it is completely empty, then remove the clyster, and let the patient raise his legs to the wall, and if the medicine wants to come out, let him hold it as long as he can; and if he sleeps a whole night, it is a greater help.
And if you clysterize him for a disease of looseness of the bowels, and the medicine hastens to come out, repeat it until he is healed.
And if the hemorrhoids are in the fundament, or an abscess, let the clyster be as fine as for a child;
and this is the form of the fine clyster on which the leather is stretched:
We have already spoken in the division, the treatment of wounds;
now we will tell the treatments by hand and by medicine, according to the fulfillment.
I say that wounds are diverse according to how they are made, and according to the places where the wounds are made, and what they are made of.
The things by which wounds are made are by the throwing of a stone, and the cut of a sword and of a knife, or of a lance or of a stick or of an arrow, or of similar things;
or that are made according to the places of the body, such as a wound that falls on the neck, or on the head, or the foot, or the belly, or the liver, and similar members;
and I will tell you the treatment of each wound, and I will begin with the simple wounds of the head, for the remembrance will come in its chapter.
I say that when a simple wound comes to the head, and the bone is not broken, then take care if it is from the throwing of a stone or similar things, and the skin is nevertheless broken and the wound is large, and you doubt slightly of a hot abscess: then make it bleed immediately from the cephalic vein itself if little blood comes from the wound, and let the bleeding be on the opposite side from the injured part;
and let the patient avoid repletion of wine and heavy foods.
And if he does not want to bleed, let his food be reduced, and let him not drink wine, nor eat meat;
and put on the wound, if hot abscesses come there, cotton soaked in rose oil only, or in styptic wine;
and if there is no hot abscess, then put on the wound, if it is fresh with all its blood, and it is not exposed to the air, the powder, which I will mention shortly;
and if the air has exposed it, then apply some ointments, until it is healed.
And if the wound is large, like from a sword cut and similar, and the lips cannot be brought together by tents, then bring them together by suture, as I will say for wounds of the belly, of the suture.
If the wound exposes the bone, and hangs, and holds only by a little, then cut it; then treat the wound with medicine, and restore hard flesh in place of skin, and instruct the patient to eat strong foods, such as bread and cooked wheat, also poultry, and similar things.
And if you find putrefaction in the skin, and it does not reach the bone, then cut away all the putrid part, and throw it away, then treat it;
and if there is an artery or vein in the wound, from which blood flows, and it cannot be stopped by medicines, then seek the artery, and if you find it loose, then tie it with a thread; and if that does not help, then cauterize it.
And if these wounds are small and simple, the treatment is easy: and it is that you put in this powder which heals before the wound has moved.
And the manner of the powder is: take incense, one part; dragon's blood, two parts; quicklime three parts, and powder it finely, and apply to the wound, and bind it firmly, until it heals well and joins with all its blood;
and then bind it well, and leave it unbound, if it does not swell; for one does not remove the medicine until it is healed.
And sometimes one uses only lime, when one does not have incense or dragon's blood, but only if the burn has not moved the wound.
And if the burn has moved the wound, especially in summer, then one does not put this powder on it;
but puts on some digestive ointments, or poultices of barley flour made with water and honey, until it sheds pus; then cure it with other cures until it is healed.
And if a bone fracture occurs with the wound, and it is small, then extract it with fine tweezers;
and I will tell you later about head fractures.
of the wound of the neck
If a wound occurs in the neck and it is simple, there is no difference between it and that of the head, but if the nerve of the neck or the artery is cut.
If it is the nerve, there is no other remedy than to leave it to heal, and not to put anything constricting on it, for it harms the nerves and causes them to retract; and not to put anything cold on the wound, because the substance of the nerves is cold, and their continuation is with the brain, which is the highest member;
but let the medicine be soft, such as warm washings in fresh water, and mixed with rose oil, and cooked washings also in fresh water, and other mineral stones according to this manner, and moist ointments.
And if the wound is large, sew it and bind it with bandages, then treat it until it is healed.
And if the wounds are deep and it is swollen and full of pus, pierce it in the lowest place;
and if the artery is cut, and a flow of blood comes from it, unbind it, and bind it up, and cauterize it if necessary;
and if the spine of the throat is cut, or the heart, and the conduit is guarded, through which the flesh goes, sew the heart to the throat-pipe, and do not touch the throat but reset it according to its natural shape; and then bind it carefully, and leave it for some days, then treat it with drying ointments until it is healed;
and if the wound has made an impression on the bone, then search for it; and if there are pieces of bone, remove them all if you can, and those that you cannot get, leave until the wound festers, and the opening is cleansed and aligned;
and if the wound is fresh, sprinkle on the powder that I have mentioned. And if there is bone in the wound and there is a fistula, treat it as I have said in its chapter.
If it is a wound from a lance or a knife, and the wound is deep, observe whether air escapes from the wound when the patient breathes: know then that the wound is mortal;
and if it is not deep, and it is fresh with all its blood, do not apply powder at the first hour, nor bind it up, lest the blood be stopped within, and return to the heart, and kill the patient; but apply an attractive ointment, and bind it twice a day;
and if you have no ointment, place old cotton in the wound to suck out the moisture, and make the patient sleep on the wound for three days, or four, or more; so there will be no spasm, nor ill tremor of the heart nor shortness of breath; and when you see good signs, know that the wound is healed. Treat it then with tents and other treatments, until it is healed;
and if it cannot heal, and festers, always know that there is a fistula;
then treat it as one should. And if the wound is from a sword or knife incision, and it is simple, whether on the chest or back, treat it as one would treat the front; if it is large, by suture;
and if it is small, with powder, and if it is close to the bone, and has cut pieces, cleanse the wound, and draw out splinters if they are detached; and if they are not detached, let the wound suppurate, this will facilitate extraction;
and for other wounds in other limbs, the judgment is as we have said.
of the rupture of the belly
The ruptures of the belly are large, medium, and small;
from the large wound sometimes the intestines, or the nerves of the intestines, protrude, causing their intromission;
and the suturing is more difficult, and sometimes the small wound is worse than the large one, because it is more difficult to put the intestines back in, if one does not put them back in immediately;
because the intestines swell as soon as they feel the cold, so they are more difficult to replace, and therefore the medium-sized wound is better, because one replaces the intestine more easily to its place than in the other two.
And know that the rupture of the belly is according to four manners:
the two common sutures occur in the suturing of the belly, and the suturing of other wounds of the body and two other proper sutures are common to other wounds;
and yet they are more proper with the suturing of the belly, and I will say each one and explain.
I say that when the wound is small, and something of the intestine comes out, and it is difficult to put it back, this is by one of the two manners: either because of the smallness of the wound, as we have said, or because the intestine is swollen from the cold.
And when it is cold, warm it in this manner: moisten a sponge or a soft cloth in lukewarm water only, or you boil in water squinant and cypress and spike, and sprinkle the intestine until the swelling is removed;
and sometimes astringent wine does this, and is better than water alone for reducing swelling.
And when you see the swelling depart, then moisten the intestine with water in which althea and mallows have been boiled, for by this the entry is easily closed;
and if it cannot enter, then slightly open the wound with the instrument with which one cuts hemorrhoids;
and the first treatment is better than cutting, that no one should cut without great necessity;
and these are the instruments for splitting it:
cut inside the curve and not outside, and here is the form: And when the wound is enlarged, and the intestine protrudes, put it back in its proper place according to its natural form, if you have the power, for this is worth much.
When the wound is large, and it is in the lower part of the belly, you must make the patient lie on his back, and put his legs higher than his head; and if it is in the lower part of the belly, put the head and chest higher than the lower parts, and also if the rupture of the belly is in one of the two parts, put your attention to that the injured part be higher than the other;
and thus you must administer what I say in large and medium wounds.
In small wounds, put what you have prepared, then have between your hands a pitiful minister who holds the entire rupture with his hand, and brings the edges together;
and this is the common manner of sutures, and it is that you take a needle or several, according to the quantity of the width of the wound, then leave from the head of the wound one finger's breadth of space, and there insert a needle where there is a good strong thread; and pierce the two edges of the skin with the two edges of the siphac, which is under the skin inside, until you make it pierce from that part, and bring together the two edges of the siphac the four together;
then twist a double thread around the needle on two sides, then bring together the two edges of the wound evenly, and then leave one finger's breadth of space, and there insert another needle;
then tie the thread as you did the first needle, and do not cease doing this according to what you need of needles, until the entire wound is closed;
and let the needles be medium, between fine and thick, for fine needles cut all the flesh, and those too thick cannot enter well: therefore it is necessary that they be medium;
and it is not necessary to push the needles too far outside the flesh and skin, lest they cut and open the wound before the closing;
and then cut the heads of the needles, that they may not injure the patient while sleeping, and put tents or small cloths at the heads of the needles to keep them in place, and leave them until the wound is healed;
and this method of suturing with needles is more suitable for small wounds, because one or two needles suffice.
The second suture is common, and is that you bring together the two edges of the skin and the two edges of the muscle with a needle on which there is a strong, medium thread;
and when you have pierced these four edges together, then return the needle to the part where you began, in the manner in which cloths are sewn;
and put between each suture the thickness of a little finger;
this suture is used by men, and I sewed a wound that a man had in his belly, which was wounded by a knife, and the wound was more than a palm wide, and two palms of intestines protruded, and the wound was in the middle of the belly.
I returned the intestine after it had been out for twenty-four hours, and the wound was healed in fifteen days, and I treated it, and it was healed.
And the physicians had judged that he would die, and this was a miracle;
and I did not treat it with ointment, because I was in a place where one found none, nor any medicines; and I put clean cotton on the wound twice a day, and washed it with honey water until it was healed.
Now I will tell you the two proper methods of stitching:
Take the needle, and put it from the outer part to the inner;
when it has pierced straight through, leave the head of the thread where you put the needle, and make it pierce from the other side, from the inner part to the outer;
and the meaning of this stitch is that you sew as the furriers sew furs, and that you leave the thread on one side, and take it up on the other, until the stitching is completely done.
The second method of stitching, which Galen properly described, is as some do, who join the two parts together naturally, and apply one end of the thread to the other end, in this manner:
insert a needle at the head of the nearest muscle, and make it pierce only that place, and leave the two ends of the thread; then turn the needle, and make it pierce from the outer part to the inner, at the two ends of the thread;
then make it pierce one and the other from the outer part to the inner, in two other parts of the muscle which are on the other side;
and this is the best and most common method of stitching.
Galen says this, and some testify to it, that one should sew the belly with two needles, with thread in each;
and one should insert one needle from one side, and the other from the other, in the manner of those who sew straps;
and know that when the rupture is in the middle of the belly, the stitching is more difficult than in other places of the belly.
The judgment of the wound is such as the judgment of other wounds:
and it is that when you find the wound fresh with all its blood, before the fire has changed it, then replace the intestine, and sew it;
then apply the flesh-generating powder, and if the fire has changed it, then apply any ointment that is present, until the wound heals; and cleanse the threads, and let the surfaces and the mirach be soldered; then treat the wound like the others, until it is healed;
and if you do not have medicines, then apply, as soon as it begins to produce pus, old cotton, and change it twice a day until it is healed.
For you do not need other medicine in many situations when the wounds are simple;
and if you doubt that the wound will affect the principal members, then you must moisten light wool in oil of moderate warmth, or in rose oil, and place it around the armpits, and under the armpits;
and if he feels pain or corruption in the bowels, and this often happens, then clysterize them with warm black wine, and especially if the corruption reaches the intestine;
and pierce it inside, and know that when it is the large intestine, it is easier to heal than the small.
The intestine that is called "jejunum" cannot heal when it is injured, and this is because of the abundance of veins that are there, and because of the subtlety of the whole body, and the proximity of its nature to the nerves.
And if the gut protrudes from the wound, put it back in like the intestine, while it is fresh;
and if it is old and has become green or black, then you must bind the place that is black, so that a flow of blood does not come there, for there are veins and arteries;
then cut what is between the ligature, and place the two ends hanging down from the part below the wound to the outside to facilitate the extraction when the gut falls, and the wound heals.
Of the rupture of the bowel
When the intestine is broken, and the wound is small, it can be restored in some men, because I saw that a man was wounded in the belly with a lance;
and the wound was on the right side of the stomach, and it became infected and a fistula, and the excrement and flatulence came out;
I treated it as best I could, and did not cease to refine the treatment until it was healed, and the place sealed.
And when I saw it sealed, I feared that the patient had harm in his belly; and there was no harm there, but he remained in better condition, eating and drinking;
and some practitioners said that when there is a small wound in the intestine, it should be bound in this manner: Take threads with large heads, then bring together the lips of the wound, and when the thread has opened its mouth, place it over the two lips, so that it tightens its mouth over them;
and then cut off the head, and this holds so that it cannot unbind, then put another thread afterwards in the same manner as before, until the wound is entirely closed; and sew the wound.
The ends are thus tied in the intestine, and no harm comes to the patient, and one can tie the intestine with a fine thread which is cut from the intestine of a beast, in this manner:
Take the end of this intestine thread that is very clean, and then tie to the end of this thread a fine twisted linen thread, then put the thread into the needle, and sew the intestine, and return it to the opening;
and this method of sewing with threads is not done except according to the way of trust and hope;
and if the wound is large and wide, especially when it is in one of the small intestines, there is no device or remedy, except subtlety.
of a fistula wherever it may be Know that every wound or abscess, when it becomes old, is universally called a "fistula," and especially when it is haired and suppurates.
And a fistula, in truth, is a hard, white, false knot, where no pain is felt, and is as hairy as a bird's feather;
and sometimes it oozes clear pus, and sometimes thick; sometimes little, and sometimes enough;
and I have spoken of it in the division of wounds, that every wound which is not healed, and there is no flesh, is only so because of one of the nine causes: that is to say, by the smallness of blood in the body; or because of its bad quality; or because there is hard flesh within, and on the lips, which does not allow flesh to grow; or there is too much swelling; or the place is rotten, and the matter is of bad quality; or the medicine is not good in the cure; or because the corruption is a kind of pestilence; or because the property in the region is slow in digestion, and health is slow, and swollen by nature; or there are veins or bones there;
and I have already shown all these causes, and the signs, and the cures of medicines in the division.
Now it is necessary that I make you know the cure of a fistula which is made by the work of hands.
Know that a fistula occurs in all the members of the body; for there are fistulas that come to the great veins, and to the arteries, and to the nerves, or to the syfac, or to the intestine, or to the bladder, or to some of the ribs, or to the spine of the back, or to some joint of the hands or feet; and so there is one that comes to the property of the principal member, and to similar places.
And all the fistulas that are of this manner are of difficult healing, and there is nothing but labor, and ignorance;
and if there is any fistula that does not reach the place that I have said, and you have confidence in the cure, and you wish to know it, then take a tent of bronze or iron, if the fistula is straight, then seek it;
and if the fistula is crooked, then search it with a subtle tent of lead, for the lead bends easily around the tortuosity;
and if the fistula has many openings and you cannot search it well with tents, then clysterize it through one of the openings, for the moisture runs from one opening to another, and cleanses it;
then search it wisely to your ability, that you may know if there is bone or nerve, and if it is deep, and ask the patient well about the pain that he feels at the pressure of your hand, and the place where he feels it;
and when you know truly the place where it is, and if it is far from a joint, or nerve, or artery or vein, or in any of the places that I have told you, then cut it according to what I have told you, and remove from there the pus and the corrupted flesh that are within;
and then cure it until it is healed, and if the fistula is very deep in a straight place, then it is necessary that you cut deeply, as far as you can, then put in moistened tents in medicated water, and push them to the bottom of the fistula, until the medicine corrodes the superfluity that remains at the bottom;
and then apply ointments which engender healthy flesh, until it is healed;
and if it is not healed by this, then cauterize it as we have said, and if the bone is corrupted by the fistula, then cut it.
If a vein or nerve does not hinder you in the principal limbs, as we have said;
and if the bone is exposed, and there is corruption and blackness, then cleanse it until all the corruption is removed, then cure it with things which engender flesh until it is healed;
and if it is not healed, and returns as before, know that you have not gone to the bottom:
then uncover and search until you are at the bottom, and remove all the corruption, then restore the place;
and if it is thus healed, it is well. If not, know that the corruption is too deep, that you cannot reach it; then there is no other remedy than to leave it to nature;
and if there is a small corrupted bone, and you can pull it out with tongs, then extract it with a suitable instrument for this, and if there are many bones, then extract them all, and leave none behind;
and if the moisture hinders you, and there is no danger or fear, then cut both moisture and flesh, and free the bones.
And if you cannot remove them at once, put something on the wound that encourages putrefaction, and leave it until the area is rotten around the bones, and then the bones will come out more easily;
and if it is a large bone, such as from the leg or thigh, then only clean away the corruption until all the blackness is removed, then dress the wound;
and if a large part of it is corrupted, and it reaches the marrow of the bone; then it must be sawn and cut all the way to the corruption, and then treat it until it is healed;
and I will tell you of a fistula that happened to a man in his leg, so that you may take example from it and help in your work.
He was a young man of about thirty years, who had pain in his leg from a cause that came from within the body, until the matter came to the leg, and it swelled with a large abscess, and there was no external cause for opening it;
but the physicians through their folly worked so much on it that the abscess opened, and much matter flowed out, and it became a fistula, and many holes appeared which all discharged pus and moisture from the body;
and many physicians treated it for about two years, and there was no wise man in the art of surgery, until I was called there, and saw his leg and the medicines with which it was treated, and what ran through the holes in great quantity; and the young man's flesh became red, and had a yellowish color.
I inserted a tent into one of these holes, and then searched all the holes, and found that one led to another from all parts of the leg.
I hastened then, and cut into one of the holes until I uncovered a part of the bone, and found it corrupt and perforated, and the corruption reached to the bone within;
I removed what appeared to me of the corrupt bone, and thought that there was no other corruption, except that which I removed;
and began to treat the wound with cauterizing medicines for a long time, and it would not heal;
and then I began again, and uncovered the bone as before, and found the corruption continued in the bone, and I probed it, and then removed it, and I tried to heal the place; but I could not until I cut around a palm's breadth of the bone, and removed it entirely with its marrow, then I treated it with medicines; and it was healed and mended quickly, and it was not necessary to begin the work again except for the weakness of the patient, who could not endure, and for the fear of death which I had for him. For because of the evacuation he bled often, but he was completely healed, and in place of the bone grew hard flesh, and it was of good disposition and had no harm or contrary at all, neither in going nor in coming.
And if the bone is broken in any part of the body, then it must be treated in this manner: take a linen cloth, and bind it to the end of the bone which appears, and instruct someone to pull it upward; and put another linen cloth thicker than the first cloth, and bind it over the flesh which is above the bone, and extend the head, so that you draw the corrupted flesh downwards, and uncover the flesh at the place where you wish to treat, so that the treatment does not injure the flesh;
and place a hot iron or a heated blade under the bone to cut the corrupted flesh;
and it is necessary to treat as much as one can see and feel the corruption, and to treat again another time.
And if the bone is corrupted, and does not appear, and the corruption is in the middle or in one part, then uncover all the flesh;
then put a hot iron underneath, and then treat from one part to another the corruption, and let the treatment be the length of the corruption a little, as we have said;
and if the corruption is in the joint, then cut the corrupted joint, and treat the bone where it contains from the other side;
and if the corruption is in the continuation of the two joints, then there is no other remedy than to cut;
and if the corruption is in the wrist of the hand, or in the ankle of the foot, that is a very serious matter, but still you must examine that corrosion, how it appears to you; and cleanse it in every way that you can, but that the vein or the nerve do not hinder you;
and know that the cutting instruments and saws for cutting these bones are many, according to the position of the bones and their appearance, and their thickness and thinness, and their size and smallness, and their hardness; and therefore it is necessary to prepare for each type of work its instrument;
and know that the work will show you the instrument you will need, according to the knowledge of this art, and the testimony of the types of illnesses; so consider the instrument you need according to what is necessary.
The heads (of bones) rot either from an internal cause, or from an external cause;
and when you have treated that corrosion with the cure of medicines, and they do not help, then it is necessary to cut off that member up to the place where the corrosion comes, so that the patient escapes death by this, or by the greater harm of the loss of the member;
and the sign is that the member becomes black, so that it seems that it is burned by fire, and rots after the blackness, then that corrosion goes from member to member, and takes over the whole body;
so hurry with the cutting, and if it is by the bite of some venomous beasts, such as a sea scorpion and viper and similar, if the corrosion is at the tip of the finger, cut it off, and do not give it space to come down to the hand.
And if it comes down to the hand, cut it off at the joint, so that the corrosion does not reach the arm;
and if it comes to the arm, cut it off at the elbow;
and if it passes the elbow, it is death, and no remedies are of use except the quantity of its virtue;
and do the same when the corrosion comes to the foot: if it comes to the first joint, cut it off after the other joint;
and if it comes to the foot, cut off the whole foot; and if it ascends the leg, cut at the knee joint;
and if it comes above the knee, there is no other remedy than to leave the patient to die;
and the manner of cutting or sawing off the limb is that you tie it above and below, and one assistant stretches one of the ties downwards, and another assistant the other tie upwards, and you sever the flesh which is between the two ties to a width of one fingerbreadth, until the bone is uncovered;
then cut or saw, and put on each side a linen cloth, so that the saw does not touch the healthy area, and another lesion and foul abscess comes to the patient.
And if profuse bleeding occurs when you operate, cauterize the area immediately, or apply some styptic powders;
then return to your treatment until it is complete, then bind the injured limb with a suitable bandage, and treat it until it is healed;
and I will tell you that it happened to a man in his foot:
a blackness befell him which resembled a burn from fire, and that corrosion first came in his toe, until it seized the whole foot;
and when the man saw the corrosion, he hastened to cut off his foot, and was healed;
and a long time afterwards the corrosion returned in a finger of his hand, and he came to me, and I applied repercussive things after the cleansing of the body, and the corrosion could not cease;
and he wanted me to cut off his hand, and I did not want to, because I had hope of repelling the matter; and I also doubted that if I cut his hand, that he would not die, for the man's strength was weak;
and he despaired completely, and returned to his land, and hastened to cut off his hand, and was healed;
and I have recounted this only so that one may do likewise, if one has need.
Sometimes an abscess comes in fleshy tissue, and remains so long that it forms a large collection of pus; and then it breaks and bursts, and the pus leaps out, and the place remains empty, like a vessel; and the skin that is above is as thin as a fine cloth, and it does not reach down to the bone, nor to the nerve, and such an illness is called "Sain," and is not called "fistula";
but if it is so deep that it reaches the bone, then it is called "fistula";
and the skin is such that you cut that skin all around, and especially when it is thin, like a cloth; and it does not heal because of its corruption.
And if you are confident that the skin will heal, and the corruption is not deep, and the skin is thick with flesh, then treat it with a clyster thus:
see if the swelling is large, and the pus that comes from it is foul-smelling, then clysterize it with Egyptian medicine which is made thus: take vinegar, and oil, and litharge, equally, and put to cook in a vessel over the fire, until the medicine is red, and becomes as thick as honey;
and then take of this according to your need, and mix it in water and honey, and clysterize the swelling, and draw out the pus; and leave the medicine in for two hours, then draw it out by squeezing;
do this many times, until the swelling is reduced, and the pus is removed;
and sometimes it is clysterized with ash water, when this medicine is not present, and it is that you take ashes of vine wood, and pour water over it, then filter it, and clysterize with it, until you know that the swelling is well cleansed;
and if the patient cannot tolerate it, neither the Egyptian medicine nor the ash water, then clysterize him with water and honey in which there is a little powdered litharge; or you may clysterize with honey and mulled wine, for honey has the property of cleansing and washing, and the wine helps to dry the swelling;
and when you have done this, and you are confident that the swelling is well cleansed, then clysterize it with that which causes flesh to grow in it, and that is that you take diafinitis plaster, and make it with rose oil and wine;
or you clysterize it with certain medicines and ointments, the properties of which I have described in the treatise on ointments;
and if the opening of the swelling is small, and the nozzle of the clyster cannot enter, then widen it slightly with an iron instrument, and insert a tent of Egyptian ointment, or basilicon ointment, until it is widened;
and if the wound is too large, then sew it and leave only a space where the clyster can enter, and if the opening that discharges pus is above, cut it in the lowest place that is there.
and if you cannot cut the swelling below as you wish, then prepare it in such a way that the pus runs to the lowest place that is there, for when the pus is deep, it does not allow flesh to grow there, and if you cannot cut the swelling below as you wish, then prepare it in this way: that the pus runs easily downwards, and leave nothing of the pus;
that the pus runs easily downwards, and leave nothing of the pus; and take consolidating medicines to put on the swelling, and spread them on a linen cloth that covers all the swelling; then cut with force at the opening of the swelling a little larger than the first, then spread soft ointment on another cloth according to the size of the opening, and put it over the opening of the swelling to drain the pus, and do not remove the large cloth except after many days once;
and the one that is over the opening of the swelling, remove it often to remove the pus, and know what comes from the pus, whether it is venom or little or much, or digested, or undigested;
and take care if the patient feels pain or not, and if there is an abscess or not, and when your medicine has been spread in this manner and you see the nature that oozes from the opening of the swelling, know that the swelling will heal, and health approaches;
and then unbind it in the morning, or on the third day, and when you unbind the wound, change to another cloth, and renew the ointment.
And if subtle venom flows after a long time, do not despair of healing, for health approaches.
For there are men whose flesh regenerates slowly in their wounds, and others who do the opposite;
and if undigested pus escapes from the swelling after many days, know that the swelling will not heal;
and if the swelling is slow to heal, and is protracted, add drying medicines, moist in substance and dry in effect, such as diafinitive ointment, for it contains a large part of vitriol, and it is the last medicine;
take diafinitive ointment, and it is made with rose oil, and rose wine equal in quantity;
then cook it and use it;
and this same thing, cooked thicker, is better when diafinitive ointment is not present, or you take myrrh and aloes and incense, and grind it, and powder it over the honey while it is over the fire;
and then glue a cloth to it, and spread it over the swelling, and sometimes one administers long birthwort, and roots of the lily of the valley, which is like bean flour and centaury; and use it of simples or of compounds: grind them, and make a powder, and put it on the honey that I have mentioned, and use it;
and if the cure is prolonged, and is not cured by this cure, then know that the corruption is profound, and makes an impression on the bone, or on the hard parts, or on the ligaments; then cure it with the cure of fistula, as we have said before.
A whitlow is an abscess that arises under the nail of the little finger of the hand, or of the foot, or by chance arises in other fingers;
and when it is neglected, and one does not take care of it, then there comes a hot abscess, and it runs and throws out matter until it reaches the root of the nail, and perhaps it corrupts the whole of it;
and the corrosion comes down to the bone, until there is foul pain, and the head of the finger is swollen, and the color is livid.
When you treat it as we have said in the chapter, and the treatment does not help, then you must cut away with an iron all the excess that remains of the nail, then cauterize the wound afterwards. Cauterization is a great help if the bone is healthy, and the nail is healthy;
and if the nail presses on the flesh, and begins to prick and wound it, then you must place a probe under the nail where it pricks the flesh, and lift it up, and cut away that flesh subtly and lightly, and put on the remaining flesh burning and corrosive medicines to remove everything; then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
And if the corruption is in the bone, cut it and draw it out, for as long as the corrupted bone is there, it cannot heal;
and if you see the finger corrupt, cut it at the joint as it is said above, then treat it until it is healed;
and if it is wounded and swollen, and it feels great pain, then you must heal it first;
then cut the nail with a sharp knife by cutting across from above, and be careful that the cut does not reach the flesh that is under the nail, for the patient would feel too much pain;
and if it happens, put something on that soothes.
The extra fingers that grow on the hands of some men by chance are all fleshy, and by chance there are some where there is bone, and sometimes there is a nail, and some of them grow at the root of the joint, or their growth is in some of the knuckles of the fingers.
That which grows in any knuckle of the finger does not move, and that which grows at the joint of the finger, by chance moves;
the treatment of that which is fleshy is light, in this manner: cut it at its root with a broad spatula.
That which grows at the root of the joint is difficult to cure: then refrain from cutting.
In that which grows on the finger at the last joint, it is necessary that you first cut the flesh roundly down to the bone, then cut the bone with a saw suitable for this, then cure it until it is healed.
The joining together that occurs between fingers comes from birth, or from the closing of a wound, or from a burn by fire, or from similar things.
It is necessary that you cut that joining, so that the fingers return to their natural forms; then place between them tents or cloths moistened in rose oil, so that they do not rejoin; or you place between them thin pieces of lead, until the place is healed, as is necessary.
If a joining occurs to any of the fingers with the palm, cut that joining as is necessary.
Varices are large, swollen veins full of melancholic superfluities, which appear in many parts of the body;
and it happens more in the legs of those who walk and work and carry, than in others.
Therefore, you should sometimes administer a purging of bile, and then bleed from the basilica vein.
The treatment with iron is according to two methods: one is that they are cut, and the black blood is drawn; and the other method is that you open the vein, and draw it all out.
The incision is according to this method: first bathe the leg in very hot water, until the thick blood is thinned, then bind the patient's leg from above the thigh down to the part below the knee;
then cut the vein in one, two, or three places, with a wide cut, then lift and draw out the black blood with your hand, from one end to the other, until as much blood comes out as the patient's strength can bear;
and then bind it, and instruct him to abstain from foods that produce black bile;
and repeat the evacuation and cleansing when the veins are full, and it harms the patient.
The raising of him is according to this manner: raise the leg of the patient, if there is much hair, then place him in the bath, and bathe the leg with warm water until it becomes red, and the veins swell;
and if you do not have a bath, then heat it by the fire, and then cut towards the vein lengthwise to the head of the knee, or in the part below at the ankle;
then open the skin with an instrument, and scrape the vein on each side, until it appears when one feels it;
and it is seen red and black, and when it enters the skin it seems like a white cord;
then put the instrument underneath, until it is raised from the skin, and then lift it slightly with the instrument, then cut it in another place above three fingers;
then scrape the skin over the vein until it appears, then lift it with the instrument, as you did, and lift it with another instrument, as you did before;
then cut another incision, or several if you need them, then lift it, and cut it at the toe, then pull and lift it to the second incision;
then extract it from incision to incision, until it is all out, then cut it;
and if you cannot pull and lift it, then insert a needle with a strong double thread, and tie it and pull it, and put an instrument underneath, and turn your hand from one side to the other, until it comes out; and be careful that it does not break, for if it breaks, then one cannot pull or lift it, and it causes harm to the patient;
and when you have pulled it all out, then put on the wound wool moistened in wine and rose oil; and treat it until it is healed.
And if the sinew is contracted and twisted and wrapped together, and it is not straight, as we have said, then you must carefully split it, but not cut it; and pull it as we have said before.
The shape of the iron with which one cuts the sinew is curved, and does not cut, lest it cut the vein;
and is of a large curve, for if it were thin, it would cut the vein, but let it be thick as we have said, and here is the form:
This vein is found in legs, in hot places where no herbs or trees grow, and in earth where there is no moisture;
and perhaps it arises elsewhere than in the legs, and this happens from the corruption that comes from under the skin, just as serpents and worms arise within the body, located between skin and flesh.
And if the signs of the beginning of this vein are that a very large inflammation arises in the leg, then the place changes, and the vein begins to protrude, like the root of a plant.
When the head opens, you must wrap around it a piece of lead from one and a half to two ounces, and tie it, and leave the lead hanging from the leg, and every time that a point comes out, wrap it around the lead, and tie it;
and if it is too long, cut off a part, and wrap the remainder, and do not cut it at its root, until it is entirely emerged; for if you cut it, it returns into the flesh, and causes an abscess and corruption in the place, and a bad illness;
because of which it is necessary that it be drawn out little by little to the head, and that nothing remains in the body;
and sometimes this vein, when it is drawn out, is five palms long, or ten, and a man once came to me, from whom it emerged ten palms long, and when you cut it, put a probe into the hole, and pierce it to the bottom, so that all comes out;
and let the matter that is inside be emptied, and administer to the place medicines preventing corruption for a few days, then cure it like abscesses.
And sometimes this vein has many roots, and especially when it appears in the joint of the foot, or in the foot, and many holes come from it, and from which many roots spring;
cure it then as we have said before.
of the worms which are born between skin and flesh This illness is called in our land "ox disease," because it often happens to oxen, and it is a small worm which is born between skin and flesh, and goes throughout the body ascending and descending, and one feels it well in going from limb to limb, until it breaks the skin where it goes, and pus comes out;
and is engendered by the corruption of certain humors, just as worms and serpents and lumbris and ascarides come in the belly;
and one doubts its malice, for when it goes through the body, and it ascends to the head, and it comes to the eye, by chance it enters, and destroys the eye; and this happens many times.
When you see it to cure and draw it out, then one can only do so when it is moving:
then it is necessary that you bind the place above and below with a strong band tightly, then cut above and pull it out, and if the worm is deep in the flesh, and you do not find it, cauterize it with fire above, until it dies;
and the greatest harm that it does is that it runs to the eye, as we have said;
and if you see it coming to the head near the eye, pull the eyebrow strongly from below it, then cut above, and pull it out;
and it is necessary to treat the patient with bodily cleansing with purgative medicines for the corrupt humors, and to abstain from foods engendering putrefaction.
of the pain which comes from flatulence This illness is called "vakirir" in our land, and is a pain that comes in some limbs, and then moves from limb to limb;
and I saw what I tell you. I was called to a sick woman, and she uncovered her arm, and I saw a small swelling in the vein of the arm;
and a little later, I saw it climb like a worm to the shoulder, faster than anything, like quicksilver when it runs from one place to another;
the pain departed from that place, and settled in the shoulder, and then a little later ran through the whole body, until it came to the other arm;
then she told me that it constantly turned around her body, as I saw it.
I marveled greatly how it moved thus from limb to limb, for I had never seen this illness in this manner. However, I had seen many who had felt pain move from one place to another, but I had not seen it as I saw it in the woman;
and I thought that it was because the woman had a dry body, and uncovered veins, and therefore that constrained wind appeared;
and it does not appear for this reason in those who are plump, and who have moist bodies and covered veins.
And when you wish to cure this illness, and the patient feels this pain, if it appears as we have said, then bind it above and below quickly, and then cut above until that constrained wind escapes from the place; and cauterize the place;
and if you do not see it with your eyes, then cure it with that which expels winds, such as fetid pills, and pills of serapinum, and similar others.
Arrows are diverse, according to their appearances and according to the places of the body where they strike.
The diversity of them is that there are some which have large points, and small, and barbed, and smooth; and of those which have two angles, and of those which have tongues, and of those where there are pieces;
and that which strikes in a limb strikes in two ways: or in a principal member vitally, such as brain, heart, liver, lung, kidneys, intestines, bladder, and similar members. When it then falls in any place of these members, and the signs of death, which I will tell you afterwards, appear: then you must beware of extracting this arrow, for death follows in many ways; and when these bad signs do not appear to you, and the arrow is not deep, then I draw it, and cure the wound.
And the signs of the brain when the arrow falls there and pierces the bone, and the dura mater which is over the brain leaks, are when there is scotoma and dizziness and vertigo and redness in the eyes, and inflammation and redness of the tongue, and spasms and confusion of mind, and vomiting of bile; and perhaps blood flows from the nostrils, or from the ears; and perhaps he loses speech and voice; and white moisture resembling pus flows from the wound, and also something like shredded flesh comes out;
and if these signs appear, abstain from treatment, and remove the arrow if it is not inside.
The signs that the arrow has struck the heart are that it is near the left breast, and it feels as if it were stuck in something hard, not empty; and perhaps the arrow moves like pus, and dark blood flows, and coldness and cold sweat come, and syncope; know then without doubt that death approaches.
And the sign that the arrow has injured the lung is that frothy blood spurts from the wound, and the throat swells, and the patient changes color, and sighs deeply and seeks cold air.
And if the arrow strikes the covering of the breast, it is near the small ribs; and he breathes heavily and feels great pain and sighs; and all the limbs of the shoulders move.
And if the arrow strikes the stomach, perhaps something of the undigested food will spurt from the wound.
And if the arrow strikes the belly, and some dung comes out through the ruptured intestine, there is no hope of cure, nor of extracting the arrow.
And if the arrow strikes the bladder, and urine spurts out and flows, and the patient feels great pain: know that the wound is mortal.
The other members, such as the face and neck and throat and shoulder and shoulder joint and spine and collarbone and thigh and legs, and similar members, are safe according to various dispositions. When the arrow is in the nerve or artery, and it is not venomous, as I will tell you happened to me, so that you may do likewise.
It happened to a man that an arrow struck him in the tear duct at the root of the nose: I grasped it, and drew it out from the other side, under the fat of the ear, and he was healed without harm.
And I drew out from a man an arrow that struck him in the fat of the eye, under the eyelid; and the arrow was broken, and I could scarcely reach but the point towards the shaft, and the arrow was as large as a Turkish bow, with a light iron head without barbs;
the man was healed, and no ill effects came to him.
And I drew an arrow from the throat of a Christian, and the arrow was an Arabian one with barbs:
I cut the barbs, and carefully worked until I drew it out, and the Christian was healed.
And I drew an arrow from a man, which had fallen into his belly, and I thought that he would die;
and after he had passed thirty days, his condition did not change; I cut the arrow, and I extracted it, and drew it forth, and there was no bad accident.
And I saw a man in whom an arrow fell into his back, and the wound was closed over;
and the arrow remained inside him, and did not change his natural disposition, nor did he find harm in any of his natural functions.
And I saw another man, into whose face an arrow fell, and the wound was closed; and it remained so without causing great pain;
and many others similar.
And I extracted an arrow from a man of the king's princes, which had fallen into his nose, and was slightly leaning towards the right side; and the arrow was completely embedded.
I was called to treat it after it had fallen three days. I found the wound very narrow.
I probed it with a thin probe, and did not feel it; and he felt a prick and pain under his right ear.
I thought it was from the arrowhead. I applied an attractive and digestive plaster to the place, so that the place would not swell; and the place of the arrowhead appeared to me.
and the place of the arrowhead appeared to me. I put the plaster there for many days, and the wound healed again, and the patient remained thus for a long time, until he felt the arrowhead one day inside his nose;
and he told me so. I put a corrosive liquid medicine on the wound for many days, until it was open, and I probed it, and felt the head of the arrowhead which was sticking in the place;
then I added to the opening of the wound with that liquid medicine, until the head of the arrowhead appeared to me visibly;
and the time passed well for about four months, and then I widened the wound so that I put in the forceps, and moved it from one side to the other, and it could not come out;
then I did not cease to refine and devise methods of instruments, until I took it one day with well-made forceps, according to what its form will be at the end of this chapter, until I pulled it out, and healed the wound.
And the physicians judge that the cartilage of the nose cannot be restored: I restored it then, and the wound was healed, and the patient was completely cured.
Now I have told you the quality of the extraction of certain arrows, so that you apply your care to that which I do not say, for the book cannot contain everything;
but the wise master compares on very little, and on that which is present and lacking, finds new work, and a new instrument, for the treatment of strange things that happen in this art.
I say that arrows do not come out of the limbs where they are stuck except according to two methods: either through the place where they entered, or through another part;
and that which leaps out through the place where it entered, that is an arrow entering fleshy places, and sometimes leaps out immediately.
And if it does not leap out immediately, leave it until the flesh is rotten around it, and the exit is eased;
and also if it is stuck in the bone, and it cannot come out, leave it thus for some days, and move it each day;
and then it will leap out, and if it does not leap out, pierce around it with a thin drill, until the area around is widened, and then pull it out.
And if the arrow is lodged in the body so that it cannot be seen, then search for it with a tent (probe); and if you feel it, then pull it out with a suitable instrument;
and if you cannot because of the narrowness of the wound, and the depth of the arrow, and there is no bone, nerve, or vein, then enlarge the wound;
and pull out the arrow if you can, and if there are barbs on the arrow by which it holds, then remove the flesh that is stuck in from both sides as much as you can, and then break or bend the barbs of the arrow, until you can pull it out;
and be careful that you do not break the arrow, for you would pull it out with more difficulty.
And if you cannot at once, then leave it until the surrounding area is rotten, then pull it out, for the extraction will be easier. And if the flow of blood hinders you, then administer what we have said of the treatment in its chapter;
and guard yourself from cutting the nerve and the vein, and devise how you can pull out the arrow without danger, whether quickly or slowly, or firmly or gently;
and place the patient according to the position he was in when the arrow entered him, for that is the greatest help there is, and if you cannot, then place him according to what the signs show you.
The arrow that comes from another direction, where something of it appears, or the skin is swollen where one sees or feels it clearly:
then cut above, so that the forceps can grasp it, and then pull it out: if it jumps out immediately.
And if it is lodged in the bone, turn your hand round and round until it enters the bone and widens the bone, then pull it out.
And if it cannot come out, leave it for now, and then begin the extraction again until it comes out;
and if the shaft of the arrow is there, push it out with the whole shaft;
and if the shaft breaks, and you wish to administer a push, administer a hooked instrument so that the point of the arrow enters the hook of the instrument;
and then push it out, and if the arrow is hooked, push in a pointed instrument to ease the extraction.
And if the arrow is poisoned, you must cut all the flesh around where the venom is, if you can, then treat the wound as necessary.
And if the arrow lodges in the foot or in the belly or in the bladder or in the side, and it is close, and you can cut over it, cut.
and be careful not to cut the vein and the nerve, and then extract it, and then sew the wound, if necessary; and treat it until it is healed.
The shape of the forceps with which one extracts arrows is similar to a bird's beak, and here is the shape:
And there are many kinds: large, medium, and small, according to the size of the arrow.
The shape of the pushing head is like the feather of a bird, to push at the point of the arrow, as here is the shape:
There are 31 veins from which one is bled, of which there are 16 in the head, namely: Two behind the ears, which are called the two "herbech"; and the two arteries which are apparent in the two temples; and two veins which are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes, which are called "aspires"; and the vein which is in the middle of the forehead; and the vein that is at the top of the nose; and the two jugular veins which are in the neck; and the two veins which are in the upper lip of the mouth, and these are the veins which are called "augeherich"; and two veins which are under the tongue.
The veins from which one commonly bleeds are five in each arm:
one is the cephalic, and is on the left side, and the lay people call it "the vein of the head"; and the middle one is called "median", and is composed of the cephalic and the basilic, and the lay people call it "the vein of the heart"; and the basilic is on the right side, and the lay people call it "the vein of the belly", and it is above the fossa, and it is that from which one bleeds, which appears clearly on the wrist.
And the salvatiella is the vein which is between the little finger and the ring finger, and it has two branches;
and in the leg and in the foot there are three veins: one is below the bend of the wrist on the left side, and the second saphenous which is at the ankle on the right side; and the vein which is called "nose", which is in the ankle on the other side;
and in the other leg are three veins below those.
Bleeding from the veins that are behind the ears helps with old catarrhs and with migraine;
and the quality of the bleeding, as I tell you, is that you raise the head of the patient, and rub the place where the veins are with a rough cloth; then the patient tightens his neck with a cloth, until the two veins appear behind the ears in two places hanging down from the head: then press them with your finger, and where you feel the pulse under your finger, bleed from there;
then take the lancet, and put it under the vein down to the bone, then lift your hand with the whole vein upwards, and cut both the skin and the vein well two fingers across, and let out blood as much as you wish;
then bind and tie it, until it is healed;
and I have already spoken of incision and cautery in the first book.
Bleeding from the two arteries that are in the two temples is good for chronic migraine, and headache, and habitual ophthalmia, and a flow of watery tears from the eyes;
and the qualities of bloodletting are as I have said: and it is that the patient should strain his neck, until the two veins appear clearly; and feel the pulse under your finger, and then bleed from there;
then lift the skin above the vein upwards with your index finger, and place the lancet underneath, and lift the vein upwards, and cut it, as you have done in the two other veins, and let blood flow according to your needs;
then untie the patient, and place your finger on the vein for an hour, then apply cotton; and then bind it tightly, and leave it until it is healed;
and we have already spoken of their cutting and their extraction, at the beginning of the book.
Bleeding from the frontal vein is as effective as bleeding from the cephalic vein for old facial diseases, and for migraine, and for redness;
and the method is that the patient twists his neck, until the vein appears; then take the instrument which is called a "fosseur", of which here is the form:
And place the point on the vein, and press down with your hand, or something else, and let the blood flow according to the quantity that you wish; then untie the patient's neck, and tie the vein until it is healthy, and sometimes the work is done with a wide blade.
However, it is not necessary that the blade be too sharp; and cut across, for the bone is near, and perhaps the blade will break when it is thin.
The incision of the two veins that are in the two temples helps the eyes, and ringworm, and redness, and hordeolum in the eye, and the diseases of the face;
and the manner of their incision is that the patient constricts his neck by twisting it with some cord, as before;
then incise, and let the incision be across, a little long with the blade a little wide, for there is no flesh there. And if the blade is thin, perhaps it will break;
then let blood flow, as much as you need, and then bind on cotton, and bind it well.
Incision of the vein of the nose is good for headache, and for raging fever, and for facial diseases, such as migraine and redness that comes in the face, and especially when it is old;
and the method of incision is that the patient grasps his neck, then you hold his nose with your left hand, and take a thin long blade, and insert it between the lips in the space that is between the two nostrils, for the vein does not appear well there, and the blood will immediately begin to flow;
and do not go too deep, and let blood flow according to your need, then bind it overnight, for it is very quickly restored;
Incision of the two temples helps with the narrowing of the windpipe, and with the beginning of leprosy, and with many diseases, and with impetigo, and with toothache, and with herpes, and with fistulas;
and the method of incision is that the patient grasps his neck underneath on both sides, as we have said;
and let the master stand over the head of the patient, and let the patient sit on a seat, then incise the vein lengthwise a little widely, then draw blood moderately, or as much as is needed;
then do likewise in the other vein, then untie the bandage, and bind both veins moderately, so that the patient does not strangle; and leave it until morning, that the wound may be healed.
Of the incision of the lips Incisions of the veins of the upper lip help with ulcers in the mouth, and with corruption of the gums, and fissures of the lips, and of the nose and around.
And the manner of the incision is to make the patient sit before you, and to restrain his neck as I have said; then turn the lip, and look at the two veins, of which one is in the right lip and the other in the left, and they are known by the fact that they are black, and by the fact that around them are small black veins:
cut then one and the other, and if you do not know them, and you are in doubt, then cut the largest on each side, and do the same with the two veins that are above and below, for it is the same method.
Of the incision under the tongue The incision of the veins that are under the tongue helps after the incision of the cephalic vein, and it is for the constriction of the throat, and for diseases of the uvula, and for diseases of the mouth;
and the quality of the bleeding is that the patient sits between your hands before the sun, and lifts his tongue, and looks on each side for a black vein:
Incise then one and the other, and do not go too deep, for underneath are the arteries.
The veins of the throat which are commonly incised are incised according to two methods:
either by piercing with a myrtle leaf wide, or an olive-shaped tool as sharp as a knife, and it is called "anesil"; and are wide and narrow according to the width and narrowness of the veins. The shape of the myrtle leaf is very renowned, and is wide as you see:
And it is necessary for opening hairy veins full of thick, apparent blood, and which contain thick and cloudy blood; and this is the shape of the olive-shaped tool:
and it is more subtly pointed, and is for bleeding the fine veins, where there is fine, citrine blood.
Bloodletting from the basilica vein, which is one of these veins, helps with illnesses that are below the throat, and in the neck, and in the chest, and in the abdomen;
and it is necessary for the bleeder that he bleeds wisely, and that he avoids the artery which is below. And if he cuts the artery, and a flow of blood comes, then he must stop it, as I have said; and the blade should not be pointed, but cutting like a chisel.
And if the basilica vein does not clearly appear, then you must search for it, and choose another; or you seek some branch of it, or you bleed in its place the vein in the middle of the arm: it appears clearly; and cut it with a chisel-like blade, as we have said.
And if you wish to know the place of the bleeding, it is necessary that you first extend the arm, that you touch the place until you feel the pulse; then mark the place with ink, and then tie the arm, and cut the vein with a chisel-like blade; and beware that you do not injure the artery when you see the place swollen, for it is the artery: wipe it then.
And if you see it spurt upwards like the urine of a child, and the blood is red and thin, know that it is arterial blood: Hurry then, and put your finger on it for a long time, then remove your finger if the blood stops, which often happens; if it is the arm, bind it up and leave it so, and the patient should not move it;
and let it be supported, and do not move it until it is healed.
And if the blood is not stopped, and it overwhelms you, and medicine is not at hand, then cut the artery if it is visible, for the ends of it retract; and stop the blood.
And take a piece of bark from a fig tree, and split it, and take one of the halves and bind it on tightly until the next day;
if the blood stops, it is well; if not, then treat it, as we have said, with powders that stop blood;
and the staunching is not difficult in many cases because of the small size of the wound, and the strength of the ligament of the arm.
The vein's health in the middle helps because it draws blood from the head above and from the body below, because it is composed of the basilic and cephalic veins, as we have said;
and it is necessary for the surgeon to beware of the nerve that is below, and if he probes too deeply, and he finds the nerve, and it swells and its health is impaired, and perhaps it cannot heal;
and this nerve appears many times, and if it does not appear in some men because of its subtlety, then you must protect it with a blunt instrument; and avoid the nerve to your ability.
And if there is a vein between the two nerves, then cut it lengthwise.
The bloodletting of the cephalic vein helps, because it draws blood from the head, and helps the eyes;
and it is necessary to bleed by pricking in the olive branch vein or the myrtle branch vein, for this is the safest of all the veins, because beneath it there is neither nerve nor artery. However, one must seek the easiest place, and it does no harm if one fails the first time, and one begins again; and perhaps the place swells in some men, when one fails the first time, but it does no harm.
The quality of the bloodletting is according to your judgment.
The first thing you must know about bloodletting is that bloodletting is not administered except to preserve health, and to avoid future illnesses;
and let the bloodletting be done in one of the three veins that are in the elbow: that is to say, cephalic, median, and basilic; and one should bleed at the beginning of spring on an empty stomach, and in autumn and winter after eating, when the signs of repletion appear;
and one should bleed on the first day or the third, after two or three hours of the day.
The bloodletting that is administered for illnesses has no determined hour, but whenever there is need, by day or by night, at all hours and at all times;
and one should not bleed children until fourteen years of age, nor a pregnant woman except from the fourth month until the seventh. Nor should the elderly who have passed sixty years be bled.
And when someone wishes to be bled, in whatever manner it may be, it is necessary that he cleanse the intestines with a light clyster, if he has much retained feces, so that the veins do not draw from the intestines the putrid superfluities harmful to the principal members;
nor should one bleed someone who is too full of food, nor who is drunk, until he is sober, nor those with dropsy;
and one should be wary of bleeding after a colic attack, and vomiting, and diarrhea, and frequent intercourse with a woman, and of labor, of wakefulness and fasting, and everything that diminishes the strength, whether by something of the soul or of the body;
then thin the humors, if the blood is thick, by food and drink and by medicines, if you have the power to do so;
then enter the bath, if nothing prevents it, to thin the blood, and bleed from the vein of the arm around the third, as we have said;
and guard yourself that day from work, and pain, and lust, and similar things;
and be cheerful and joyful, and let the bleeder be higher than the one being bled, and let him rub the arm two or three times, then tie the ligature above moderately, for when it is too tight or loose, the blood cannot flow;
and then rub the place with the hands, until the veins swell, and one feels them;
then the bleeder moistens the lancet with a little old oil, then places the finger of his left hand on that vein below the place a little where he wants to bleed, so that the vein does not flee and fail when struck.
For there are veins that flee like strings when bled, and there are some that are full of wind, so that when one puts the lancet on, it withdraws from the lancet, and the vein cannot be opened, and so it is with those; and if he opens the vein, the wound is too narrow, therefore the bleeder must be skilled in these things.
And if the vein opens the first time, that is good; if not, then begin again a little below or above that place quickly, if the place is not swollen.
And if the place is swollen, and the patient is frightened, leave it for one or two days, and do not bind the arm: by chance an abscess may form there;
nor enter a bath, then resume the bleeding if it pleases him;
and if the opening is small, or the blood flows thinly and you fear that not enough blood will come out as you wish, thrust into that same opening with the whole blade straight;
and work a little quickly, before the place becomes swollen; for this happens many times, when the wound is small.
If you see the place swollen, do not resume the bleeding, and put on a little oil of lye, for it thins the body of the blood, and lye is milder in this place than oil;
and thus administer the oil of lye in each bleeding where you bleed the veins, to staunch the flow of blood;
and the same does theriac and ox-gall, when it is put on the place; it thins the blood and disperses it when it is too thick.
And if a large abscess forms there, which happens many times, especially when it is not bled except at the time when the opening of the vein is small, hasten, and place on the area a sponge soaked in lukewarm water and salt, and hold it for an hour;
and you must do this after the bloodletting from the vein, and if there remains in the area after some days some blackness or greenness, it does not harm; and if you wish, apply something of aloe or myrrh mixed in juice of calamint, mint, or the like.
And many times an abscess and inflammation occur at the bleeding of the basilica vein:
then place your hand upon it, and if you find the area soft under the compression of the hand, that inflammation is bad. See then that you do not apply anything of what we have said, for by chance it might cut off the artery;
but make for it a dry plaster to harden the area, then treat it with another treatment, until it is healed.
And draw from each person blood according to the quantity of his strength, and the color of the blood.
For if the blood is black, let out so much that it becomes red; and if you see it thick, let it out until it is thinned; and if it is too hot, let it cool.
And it is necessary for one who is full and strong, and needs bloodletting, that a wider wound be made for him, and that the lancets be wide;
and for one who is weak, do the opposite, and he should bleed little and often, and one should bleed him by cutting across, not by pricking;
and this manner of bloodletting is safe from the flow of blood and the cutting of nerves, and is better than bleeding lengthwise or across.
And to one whose body fails during bloodletting, one should give bread soaked in pomegranate juice; if he is feverish, draw blood three or four times. And if he is of cold complexion, let him eat before bloodletting bread soaked in spiced syrup, or in aromatic honey syrup with spices, such as pepper, cinnamon, ginger, and chickpeas, and a well-scented syrup.
And if he faints during bloodletting, after the loss of much blood, then he should drink broth of meat, and a subtle aromatic syrup, and use the other things that we have said in the section or chapter on syncope, for the opening of a vein.
And if he wishes to bleed his arm again, and bleed another time, it is necessary, when he is weakened by great bloodletting, that he bleed little by little, according to the quantity of his strength continuously.
And whoever wishes to bleed his arm after the first bloodletting, and he has a strong body, let him bleed seven hours after the first bloodletting, or after the ninth hour.
And whoever wishes to be bled from another place, should be bled on the second or third day.
For there is much blood within the body which is already heated, and causes fever; therefore it is necessary to draw a great quantity, and widen the opening until it reaches the size of a pea; then, when you observe all the conditions of bloodletting, and place your hand on his pulse while he bleeds, that death may not come instead of a pea, and this happens many times, when the bleeder is negligent;
and it is not necessary, when you wish to untie the arm and make blood issue a second time, and the opening is closed, that you press strongly upon it; nor, if it is curved, that he extend the arm hastily, for that would be bad;
but leave it until it bleeds a second time; or you prick it with the point of a flame, until the blood which is congealed in the opening of the vein issues forth, and place upon it a little salt mixed in water, and press upon it lightly.
And if the vein is swollen, leave it and do not bind it, until the abscess is calmed.
And if there is need to draw blood a second time, bleed in the same place, or in another vein, or in the other arm.
The vein in the arm is bled in place of the vein in the head because it is composed [in the same way].
And the manner of bleeding is that the patient puts his hand in warm water until the lancet is red;
then it should be bound moderately, so that the vein appears well, then bleed it immediately across, not across the width or length;
and let the opening be wide, and let it be bled very near the joint of the hand, and if blood cannot come out, put the hand back in warm water, and let the blood run into the water until you have enough;
and if it is summer, do not put the hand back in warm water, for it is put in more in winter than in summer;
and bleeding from this vein is safer than all other veins, for there is neither artery nor nerve there.
Bleeding from the salvatory vein of the right hand is good for all liver diseases, and this is the method:
constrict the hand, and put it in warm water until the vein is swollen, so that one can see it; and if it bleeds across, and if you cut it completely through, it does no harm;
and do not go too deep, for the nerves are underneath, completely bare of flesh, and then put the hand back in warm water if the blood is congealed in the wound and cannot come out.
And when you have drawn as much blood as is necessary, put oil and salt on the vein to quickly cauterize, and do so for each incision.
Bleeding from the left hand is good for the disease of the spleen, and do exactly as I have told you for the right.
Bleeding from the saphena vein is good for all the illnesses that are in the lower body, such as diseases of the womb, and the retention of menses, and illness of the kidneys, and of the old thighs and legs, and similar illnesses.
And the quality of this bleeding is that the patient puts his foot in warm water, and rubs the vein until it swells, and binds above the joint of the foot; and the vein is at the ankle, and many veins go above the foot;
bleed then from the largest vein, or at the ankle, which is more effective.
And if you bleed it above the foot, be careful of the nerves that are underneath, and bleed it across as if cutting;
and let the blade be sharp.
And if the blood cannot flow out, put the foot in water, and let the vein empty well.
And if the bleeding fails the first time, begin again a little higher up the second time, for the place is salty;
do not worry about the nerve, as we have said, and do the same for the saphenous vein of the other foot equally.
The location of the sciatic vein is at the ankle, and its bleeding is good for hip pain, when it is due to hot blood.
And the quality of its bleeding is such that the patient enters the bath, and presses on the ankle with four fingers twisting, because otherwise the vein does not appear;
and if it appears, bleed it in every way that you can, and across; and it is better that you cut it, because the place is safe, and it is very responsive in many men.
and it is better that you cut it, because the place is safe, and it is very responsive in many men. And if you do not find it, bleed any vein that appears on the back of the foot, and towards the little toe, and beware of the nerves;
and make as much blood flow as you wish, and then untie the bandage, and apply cotton and bind it; it is now healed.
Cups are made of horn, or of brass, or of glass;
and cupping is done in two ways: either by cutting and drawing blood, or without cutting.
And this cupping which is without cutting is done in two ways: either it is with fire, or without fire;
and cupping which is done by cutting and by the extraction of blood is done in fourteen places of the body, of which one is at the very top of the head; and another is in the middle of the neck; and two others on the two sides of the neck; and the cupping below the chin; and the cupping on the two shoulders; and the cupping above the buttocks; and the cuppings between the two arms; and the cuppings on the two legs; and the cuppings on the two ankles;
and cupping does not draw blood, except from the small veins that are scattered in the flesh, and therefore it does not weaken one, as bloodletting from a vein does; and it is not necessary that it be administered, either with fire or without fire, in any illness that comes from repletion, until the whole body is emptied.
And if by necessity of illness it is necessary to cup, or by custom, then we administer it every hour at the beginning of the month, or at the end, and in between and at every time;
for there are some who, when they need cupping, have a heavy head;
and there are those who find repletion and redness in their face, and in their head, and in the neck, and darkness in their eyes;
and those who find a drop of blood in their mouth, and have a swollen tongue, and spit blood; and there are some who dream, and see at night blood and wounds and deaths and similar things.
And when we see these signs, and especially when it is mid-month, we order them to be cupped after three hours of the day.
The bloodletting of the temple helps the headache... that comes to the eyes, and it is not necessary that this be after the evacuation of the whole body;
and this cupping is in place of bloodletting from the cephalic vein, and it is not necessary that one who is of cold complexion use it, or who has catarrh, for it does them much harm;
and therefore it is not necessary that the elderly use it, nor those who have cold diseases in the head.
And he who is often bled, becomes forgetful, and therefore it is necessary to place the cupping a little lower because of the fear of forgetfulness.
Cupping in the neck is in place of bloodletting from the head and the basilic vein, and therefore it is good for the constriction of the chest, and for the splitting of the windpipe, and for cough, and for repletion;
and it should be applied lightly, for if it holds too firmly, it causes forgetfulness or stomach and heart problems.
Cupping at the two ribs of the neck is good for headaches, and ophthalmia and migraine, and for strangulation, and for pain at the roots of the teeth, and is in place of bloodletting from the basilic vein;
and you must instruct the bleeder to extend the arm when applying the cup, so that he does not cut the artery, and that blood does not flow excessively.
Cupping under the chin is good for mouth diseases, and for corruption of the gums, and similar diseases which are in the mouth; and is in place of bloodletting from the two lips.
Cupping of the shoulders is good for illness that comes from heat and fullness.
Cupping of the sides is as good as three veins of the arm, for it draws blood from these large veins;
and instruct the phlebotomist not to go too deep, for the place is bare of flesh, and lies beneath nerves and arteries.
The cupping glass that is on the rump is good for hemorrhoids of the fundament, and for diseases below, and it is necessary that the cupping glass be large, and be of brass, that it may draw well; and perhaps, if it were thin, it would break; and it makes large wounds.
Cupping on the legs heals openly, for they draw blood from the whole body, and are good for old pains of the loins, and of the womb, and of the bladder, and restore menstruation;
and are applied to the two popliteal spaces, and the two ankles, and yet they weaken the body after long use, and cause fainting in many instances.
The method of applying the cupping glass is that you first place it empty, and suck moderately, and place it quickly, and move it evenly, and do not cease doing this, until you see the place red and swollen, and the redness of the blood appears;
then heat, and reapply the cupping glasses, and take care in the constitution of the bodies, for there are some who have tender flesh, and clear pores: it is necessary to strike only once, and it is necessary to make wide wounds, and somewhat deep; and suck lightly.
And if the blood is thick, it is necessary to strike twice: the first time to refine the path of the thick blood.
And if the blood is very thick, it is necessary to strike a third time;
and when we want to draw blood little by little, one time is sufficient. And if we want a lot of blood, we begin again often;
and if the blood is thick, strike deeply, and the limit is that the heart be pierced suddenly, and it is necessary for those who have thick and hard skin, and who have narrow pores, that you anoint the places of the cupping glasses with aperitive and dissolving oil: if it is in summer, with violet oil, or almond oil, or pumpkin seed oil;
and if it is in winter, with cress oil, or lily oil, or chamomile oil, or something similar.
And if the superfluity is thick and cold, take marjoram oil, or balsamite oil, or dill oil, and the like.
And if the one whom you are treating has tender flesh and large pores, it is not necessary to put any oil there, but it should be washed after cupping with rose water, or cold water, or deadly nightshade water, or pumpkin water, or porcelain water, or something similar.
And he who has much moisture, should use vinegar, or myrtle water, and sumac, and similar things.
And those who have thick superfluities should use old wine, or beet juice, or a decoction of dill or chamomile, or other similar things;
and one should not use cupping before the bath or in the bath, but after the bath, one hour or two;
and do not sleep after cupping, and it is necessary that he be cautious, when he is about to be cupped and when he is cupped.
And beware if the one who is being treated is choleric, and if the blood is too sharp and inflamed; then he should take cold things, such as pomegranates and endives and lettuces with vinegar, and similar things; and eat young chickens, and the meat of a castrated animal, and moist foods.
and eat young chickens, and the meat of a castrated animal, and moist foods. And he who has a cold complexion, should take honey syrup, and moderately fragrant wine, which is between old and new, and eat little, and eat young chickens and small birds and pigeons;
and on the day that he is cupped, he should drink more than eat;
and it is necessary to give some men sometimes theriac or nutmeg before or after cupping, to strengthen the principal members; and let the blood be thinned, but it is not necessary that those who are hot drink it.
The cupping glasses which are applied without cutting are those which are applied to the liver, and to the spleen, and gout, and to the belly and the buttocks and the kidneys and the hip, for those members do not allow being cut upon, and it is only done to draw blood from one member to another, just as we apply them to the breasts when the nose bleeds;
to remove the viscosity which is in the member, just as we apply cupping glasses to the belly and to the buttocks to soften the member;
and removes the pain, when there is obstruction or stone, it removes by its attractive virtue perchance the obstruction, or loosens the stone from its place;
and so it does when one applies it to the liver and to the spleen when there is retained wind, and these cupping glasses are applied empty to only suck; and sometimes they are applied with fire, and sometimes full of warm water, as in illnesses of the pleurisy, and in such a manner that one fills the cupping glass with hot water alone, or with water in which suitable herbs have been boiled.
The form of the cupping glass applied with fire is this:
And let it be two fingers wide and half a palm deep, and let it have on the side around the middle a small hole, as for inserting a needle, and let it be of brass, smooth on the surface so that it does not wound the patient when placed on the limb;
and let it have in the middle a crossbar of brass or iron, to place a lit candle in, and let there be large and small ones according to the illnesses and the age of those who use them;
for the cupping glasses for children are different from those for old people, and those for thin people from those for fat people.
And one must thus apply this cupping glass to the limb:
take the candle of wax or a liniment, and place it in the cupping glass across the bar that is in the cupping glass, so that the flame is at the bottom of the cupping glass so that it does not burn the patient;
and then place it on the limb, and your fingers should be on the hole that we have mentioned, so that when one wishes, the vapor escapes, and one removes the cupping glass;
and one takes the liniment as before, and repeats it often, if you need to.
In the cupping glass then, which is administered in the illness of pleurisy, with hot water, there is no bar or hole, and it is not administered forcefully except when it is full of water, and it is placed on the limb only;
and this is the form:
Leeches are not administered except in limbs where cupping glasses cannot be placed because of their small size, such as lips and gums, and similar places; and in places devoid of flesh, such as a finger or nose, and others similar;
and the quality of the leech is that when you find leeches that are in clean fresh water without putrefaction, you take them;
and put them for a night in fresh water, until they are hungry, and have nothing in their bellies; and then be bled with a vein and with cupping, then rub the limb until it is red, and apply the leeches;
and when they are full, and fall off, if it is a place where one can apply a cupping glass, apply it, for this is very beneficial afterwards.
If not, raise the place with vinegar, and then with water, very well, and then dry it;
and if the place bleeds too much after the removal of the leeches, moisten a linen cloth in cold water, and apply it, until the bleeding is stopped;
and if the bleeding is excessive, apply crushed vitriol, or galls, and similar things, until it is stopped;
or you may put on the place halves of peeled beans, and leave them until they dry on the place, this will stop it immediately;
and if you need more, take other leeches.
And if the leeches will not attach, rub the place with fresh blood, or prick it with a needle until blood comes out, and then apply them, and as soon as they sense the blood, they will attach;
and when you see that they are falling off, sprinkle a little aloes and salt powder, or ashes, then they will fall off immediately.
Here begins the book of fractures. This chapter is often necessary in the art of medicine, and is the restoration of fractures and dislocations.
Know, dear son, that foolish people avoid this chapter, because they have never seen any of the ancient books, nor read any letters about it;
and for this reason the science is strange in our land, for I never found any good one;
and I know nothing, except through the science of ancient books, where I have studied so much that I have drawn the science from them, and through experiment, and through the experience of my life;
and I have described for you in this chapter what is contained, and have abbreviated it at the end, and have clearly shown the forms of the instruments that are used, as I have done in these two chapters before.
It is necessary then that we say in the prologue of this book the sums of the speech and the chapters where the wise man puts his understanding, and dwells on the truth, so that those who are experienced may know and learn this noble art, and teach it to others.
I say that when a fracture or dislocation or torsion or contusion comes to someone, it is necessary that you hasten to bleed the patient on one side and the other, if nothing prevents you, such as weakness of body, or a child, or an old man; or if the weather is not very hot, or too cold;
and eat cold things, that is to say cold pottage, and the flesh of birds and of kid, and let him not drink wine, nor eat any fatty meats, and let him not overfill himself with foods that fill the veins with blood, until you have doubt of a hot abscess, or of the spreading of matter in the limb;
then let the patient return to his former regimen that he had used.
And when the broken bone begins to heal, it is necessary that one nourish the patient with foods that give great nourishment, where there is viscosity, such as wheat cooked in water, and rice, and heads [of grain?], and feet [of animals?], and cow's paunch, and eggs, and fresh fish, and strong wine, and similar things. For with such nourishment, the flesh is repaired and the fracture heals more quickly.
And know that the broken bones of old and decrepit people cannot be well repaired nor knit according to their nature because of the dryness of their limbs, nor those also who are too tender, such as the bones of small children;
but without treatment, reset the broken bone with thick bandages that support and join the limb together, until it is strengthened as it was before; and do not leave it alone from its work, and for that reason it is necessary to nourish it with strong foods, as we have said.
And know that fractures are diverse in many ways.
For a fracture of the head is different from a fracture of the breast, or of the leg, and I will tell you in this chapter all kinds of fractures. For there is a fracture that goes across, and another in sharpening, like the cutting of a quill for writing.
For there is a fracture that goes across, and another in sharpening, like the cutting of a quill for writing. And there is a fracture with a wound, and a fracture with only a small fissure.
And each manner has its device, and its proper instrument in the restoration, according to what the remembrance brings to its place;
and a fracture of the bone is known because the place is twisted, and it appears clearly by swelling, and sounds when pressed by the hand;
and when there is no twisting or sound on touching, and the patient does not feel great pain, there is no fracture;
but there may well be a twisting, or fissure, or small fracture. Then you should not move it by hand, but apply the medicines which come next, and then restrain it very subtly.
And know that for a fracture which goes across, and the two parts are separated, it is necessary to set them equally, before abscesses form there;
and if hot abscesses form, leave it for a few days, until the abscesses are calmed;
then set it evenly so that you can easily and wisely, and know that the restoration of this is easier than the restoration of one where there are pieces;
then restrain it, as is necessary hereafter.
And if in the bone there are broken pieces, extend it from two sides, if it is a hand or foot, or with your hand if it is a small limb, or with two cords, or with one cord and your hand;
and put the limb according to its natural form, so that when the broken parts of the limb are separated, bring back by all means the additions to their places as best you can, and ensure that your work does not cause the patient injury or pain;
and join well the two ends of the bones according to the best forms.
And feel it well with your hand if it seems to you that it is not well set:
then straighten it beautifully, and do not bind it too tightly, nor press it as those do who cause by their work a hot abscess and contraction in the limb, as we have often seen.
And when the limb is set, instruct the patient well that he not move it, neither waking nor sleeping, nor turning, nor in any other manner; and ensure that the limb is so secure that it feels no pain. For when it feels any pain, it is not properly set, and it must be put in such a position that it feels no pain;
and ensure that the limb is so secure that it feels no pain. For when it feels any pain, it is not properly set, and it must be put in such a position that it feels no pain; and take care that it is set straight, that no crookedness comes when it is restored;
and the properties of the broken limb are according to what I tell you.
Know that broken limbs are diverse in smallness and in size and in form.
For there are small limbs, such as arms and fingers and the like: then it is necessary to wrap it with soft and fine linen cloths; and those that are large, such as thigh and leg:
then it is necessary to wrap it with a wide and strong linen, for the wide linen embraces the whole large limb, and constricts it equally on all sides, so that there is no swelling;
then bind around light tow, three or four turns according to the limb, and tighten your hand a little with all the linen, then go above the fracture and tighten less, so that the fracture then moves the fracture a little;
and soften the linen little by little, until you take a large part of the healthy area, then take another linen, and turn around again over the broken area;
then return to the area below the fracture, and tighten moderately, neither too strongly nor too weakly, as we have said in the first chapter above;
then place between the linens linen tow or cloths, until it is all even, then bind all over with a bandage, and then apply your well-made splints, if there is no abscess or swelling.
And if there is swelling or abscess, then apply something that soothes a hot abscess, and which removes the swelling, and leave it so for some days;
then tighten your splints, and let them be half of a wisely cut wide cane, or of wood from which crutches are made, or of palm branches, and let them be according to this figure:
but it is necessary that the splint that one places on the fracture be a little larger and wider than the others;
and let it also be as long as is necessary for the limb, small or large; then tighten the splints as you did in the first binding, then tie over it a suitable thread, as in the first binding over the fracture; tighter above, always less;
and the threads should be medium, neither too thick nor too thin, and should be of soft linen;
for if the threads are thick, as I have seen in the works of fools who make their bandages of twisted linen cords, and this is a great error, for the bandage cannot be even if it is too thin, and it is not necessary that there be less than a finger's breadth of space between each splint.
And if the patient is injured by the ends of the splints after tightening in healthy places, put under them linen or carded wool padding so that he is not wounded.
When the wound is with a fracture, and the bone is broken, I will describe the treatment later.
And know that it is not necessary to bind all broken limbs with splints on the first day. For when the limb is large, it is not necessary to apply splints except after five days or seven, or more, depending on your certainty of a hot abscess arising;
And here is the manner of ancient plasters for restoring fracture, dislocation, and torsion:
and it is that you take the flour that adheres to the walls of the mill, and cook it with plenty of egg, and apply this mixture, neither too thin nor too thick, and use it, and this is the common manner of the plaster restoring the fracture in many situations, and especially for women and small children, for it is neither too hot nor too cold.
Another manner of plaster restoring fracture and dislocation and torsion: Take 3 ounces of labdanum and enula and asafoetida and gum arabic and mugwort, of each 10 ounces; myrrh and aloes, of each 5 ounces; chamomile 9 ounces; and make it into a powder, and mix it with egg white; If the man's complexion is hot, use this plaster, for it is of good composition, and quickly restores broken bones, and is valuable to many men.
Another type of plaster that is good for a sprain: take mugwort and mallow, each 10 ounces; myrrh and aloes, each 9 ounces; gum arabic 6 ounces; Armenian bole 10 ounces, and grind well, and mix with water or egg white, and apply.
Another method of plaster for joints and bones dislocated from their places, and soothes the pain that occurs, and the splintering and fracture of bone: take new wool, and moisten it in vinegar and cooked oil, and apply to the place.
This plaster does not restore, but it is good for soothing a hot abscess, and properly removes pain.
Another method of plaster which restores broken bones: Take dried fig leaves and leaves of henbane, and grind them together, and make a plaster.
Another method of plaster for the restoration of bone fracture and for diminishing the remainder of the abscess. Take mallow root, chamomile, violet flowers, bean flour, one part of each;
and grind, and mix with wine, and if the limb is inflamed, mix it with moist coriander water, or with water, and use it.
Another method of plaster stronger than the first, when a hard abscess comes to the restoration of the limb. Take mallow roots, and flaxseed, balauste, melilot, and comfrey, and violet and chamomile flowers, of all one part each; and grind, and mix with salt water, or fresh water, or with wine, according to the heat of the limb, and its rest.
Hippocrates says in his book that one should not put anything on a broken limb for restoration except a cerate made of wax and oil, and nothing else, and says that it should be neither too soft nor too hard.
And it seems to Galen that one should put on the broken limb, for restoration, slightly warm dry things, such as myrrh and aloes and incense and similar things, as we have said.
Another type of plaster that is good for injury and pain: Take mugwort and cut human hair, or bird feathers, and mallow, and  mix them equally, and grind them, and make a plaster and bind it.
And then unbind it a little afterwards, and take care whether the patient feels no pain, or whether the bone has moved from its place; if not, unbind it in several days. And if pain or itching comes to the place, or restlessness or swelling, then hurry, and unbind it, and remove the plaster immediately;
and take a light cloth, and a moist sea sponge, and dip it in water, and wash the place, until the itching ceases, and the pain is calmed; then let the limb rest for an hour, then put on dry wool, moistened in water or rose oil, and bind on a nut, until you are sure of a hot abscess;
and the inflammation of the limb will subside, and the pain will be removed, then resume the subtle binding, and a little of the plaster, and do not bind it so tightly as before; and continue until it is healed.
And if you see that the hot abscess, redness, pain, and swelling are completely gone, and you need a plaster and bandage, then start again, as you did initially, equally.
And if nothing of what we have said comes to the limb, then do not unbind it before three or four or five or seven days; and sometimes leave it twenty days, according to what one sees, until the fracture mends, and the joining of the flesh approaches;
then bind it more tightly than before, and it will thicken its flesh, as I have said before;
and if you see the place drying out more than necessary, know that nourishment cannot come to it; therefore moisten it with lukewarm water, every time you unbind it, and this should be every third day, and loosen the binding a little;
by this method then nourishment comes quickly to the limb, and it quickly amends that which foolish surgeons do, who bind the limb too tightly:
that is bad, and it is dangerous work, and I see nothing but harm in it and in working wrongly.
There are many kinds of fractures, and diverse forms, and the causes are different;
for there are fractures that are made by the blow of a sword, and the neck breaks all the bone down to the spongy bone which is under the bone, as an axe or club does; and for this reason this kind of fracture is called "hacheure".
Or the sword cuts the bone from above without piercing, and this kind of fracture is called "absolute";
and the wound of these two fractures is large or small.
And if there is a blow with a blunt object, or a fissure, or a blow from a stone, or from falling on a stone, or similar things.
And if there is a penetrating fracture, which reaches down to the membrane which is under the bone, or which is on the bone, and this wound is either large or small.
And if there is a wound which is a crack in the bone as fine as a hair, and the fissure is small, and therefore this fracture is called "capillary";
and if the wound which is made either by striking with a stone, or by falling, or by a similar thing, and drives the piece of bone inward, and the place is swollen as do cauldrons when they are struck on the cauldrons; if the stone enters inside.
And this happens more to those who have soft bones in the head, such as the head of a child;
and it happens in all these types of fractures that small pieces are separated like stars; and I will speak in its place.
And we recognize all types of fractures by the pulling on them, and the probing with probes, and by the corrupted flesh which is on top.
The hair-like resemblance is known by this, that when one has uncovered the bone, and one rubs against it, the black fracture appears.
In the treatment of the fracture, pay attention to the accidents of the patient, and if you see any bad accident, such as vomiting of bile, and loss of consciousness, and extension, and fainting, and acute fever, and the eyes protruding and reddening, and other similar things in many conditions, then it cannot heal without doubt.
And if you see no frightening accident, and you hope for salvation, then begin the treatment.
And when the wounded man first comes to you, and it is in winter, then it is necessary to remove the bone before the fourteenth day, if you can.
And if it is in summer, then hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, before the flesh under the bone is corrupted, and the accidents that we have mentioned appear.
And if the fracture of the bone reaches the membrane that covers the brain, then it is necessary that you split the broken part thus:
and it is that you take the head of the wounded patient, and uncover the bone in every way that you can, and on the surface of the wound as gently as you can, and if bleeding occurs upon uncovering the bone, or a hot abscess, help him with what is necessary, and it is that you fill the place with cloths moistened in rose oil; and let the wound rest until the hot abscess is calmed, and you are assured of the cessation of bleeding; then begin around the bone to remove it, and this is done according to two methods of operation:
one method is that you cut with a narrow incision in front, and this is the form:
And then make another incision larger than the first.
And the second method is that you have a number of different incisions, some narrow and others wide, and they are pointed, and are of tempered iron;
and work lightly, so that you do not injure the head.
And if the bone is strong and hard, then you must pierce it around, before you apply incisions with a trephine, not so deeply that it pierces through the skull bone, and it should have above the point a margin or a circle, so that the point does not pass beyond the bone;
and you must have several, so that each comes to its place in the thickness of the bone, so that you have trephines for the whole head;
and this is the form of the three types of trephines:
The method for piercing around the fractured bone is that you place a trephine on the bone, and turn it with your fingers until you know that the bone is pierced;
then put the trephine elsewhere a little afterwards, and thus do it all around, then cut with the incisors the thickness of the bone which is between the holes, and do this as subtly as you can, and lightly, as we have said, until you draw out the bone with your hand, or with some of the instruments that you have, such as forceps, pincers;
and take care that you do not touch the brain or the dura mater.
And when you have pierced and removed the bone, it is necessary that you scrape away the remaining bone with another instrument similar to an incisor, but it must be thinner and more subtle than the other incisors;
and if any small bones or scales remain, remove them lightly with one of the instruments; then treat the wound with tents and ointments as we have said.
And the other method of operation is that which Galen described, which is safer; and he praised it highly, and that is his word. First, you must uncover a part of the bone where the fracture appears, so that when you have uncovered that part, you will place under the head of this lenticular incisor, of which this is the shape:
And it does not cut on one side, and the part is sharp on two sides, so that the cutting edge is towards the bone;
then strike with a small mallet above, so that you cut the bone lightly all around, and take good care of the membrane that is underneath;
if it is attached to the bone, remove it lightly, for it is removed well without harm and without fear.
And if the fracture of the bone does not pierce to the membrane, and the bone is only cut above, and there are small pieces, then it is necessary to remove that roughness, and to remove the splinters with a fine rasp, of which you must have various sizes, to apply in each place the most suitable, according to the work and the shape of the fracture.
So begin with large rasps, and then with finer ones, and do not cease doing this until it is well.
In each of the other hairline fractures and subtle breaks, you must apply a remedy according to its condition;
and this is something that is not unknown to one who has applied himself to this art.
And if the dura mater is exposed, then you must take a linen cloth, according to the size of the wound, and moisten it in rose oil, and place it on the wound; then take another cloth doubled over two or three times, and moisten it in wine and rose oil, and place it over the first cloth; and do this as gently as you can, so that you do not injure the dura mater, then apply another bandage on top, and do not bind it tightly, only enough to hold the wound;
and leave it like that for one or two days, until the swelling of the abscess has subsided, then unbind it, and apply medicines such as lily roots, and bean flour, and incense powder, and birthwort, and similar things;
and of these things make a powder, and put it on the wound, and always apply cleansing medicines without biting [i.e., without causing further injury];
and ensure that the wound is always clean, that you do not leave ointment on it, nor allow pus to collect, for when pus collects on the membrane of the brain, it eats away at it and causes it to rot, and great harm comes to the patient;
for when one puts something corrosive on the dura mater, it becomes necrotic on top. Therefore take care, if any bad accident befalls the patient, as we have said, it is undoubtedly doubtful.
And if blackness comes from only the medicine that has been applied, having such a property, then you must take one part honey, and three parts rose oil, and glue one cloth, and put it on the dura mater; then treat it with the necessary treatments until it is healed.
Know that sometimes the two parts of the nose above are broken, or one part alone, for these are two bones;
and that below is cartilaginous, and does not break, except to bend or twist, and then heals.
And if one of the two parts is broken, then you must put your little finger in the hole of the nose, and set the fracture inside with your index finger, and with the little finger outside, until the nose returns to its natural shape; and do this gently, and ensure that the patient does not feel pain from your work.
And if the fracture is in the upper part of the nose, and the finger cannot reach the place, then you must set it with the end of a slightly thick rod.
And if the fracture is in two parts, do likewise, and hasten to restore it on the first day, if you can;
if not, after the seventh or tenth day, when the swelling of the abscess has subsided, then place in the nostril tents of linen cloth, if the fracture is in one part.
Or you put one on the other side, if the fracture is there; and let the tents be so large that they fill the openings of the nose.
And some restorers say that one should moisten the tents in butter, and change them each day. It does not seem to me that this is good, but they must be moistened in a confection of egg white and mill dust; then leave the tent until the bone is firm, and the cartilage hardened.
And sometimes one puts goose feathers in the nose instead of tents, and a soft cloth is wrapped around it, and the fracture is held, and the patient blows through it; or do whatever you wish.
And if hot abscesses come to the nose while you are working there, put cerate or cotton moistened in rose oil, or in a little diachylon.
And if hot abscesses do not come, put a plaster on the outside, of chickpea flour and incense powder, mixed with egg white, then put light lint on top, and do not bind the nose;
and if the fracture of the nose is small, and it is broken into small pieces, extract it with instruments suitable for this, then sew the fissure, and treat it with things that generate flesh and heal, such as plasters and ointments suitable for this;
and if there is no wound inside the nose, treat it with tents, and put lead shavings in it, until it is healed.
When the mandible is broken underneath, and there is no external wound, and the fracture is only on the outside, and it is not broken in two, except perhaps inwardly, it is easily recognized.
It is necessary, if the fracture is on the right side, that you put your index finger in the patient's mouth; and if the fracture is in the left mandible, put your index finger of the right hand, and gently put the fracture in place, and adjust it with the other hand from the outside, and set it even.
And if the fracture of the mandible is separated in two, it is necessary that you administer extension from two sides, until they are even.
And if movement of the teeth occurs, or breakage, bind them with a gold or silver or silk thread, then place cerate on the broken mandible, and place a double cloth over it; and place on the cloth a well-made large plaster, or a piece of even leather, long and wide according to the mandible, and bind it on as well as you can, and instruct the patient to rest, and eat light foods.
And if you see that the shape changes, unbind it on the third day, and then readjust what has changed; and apply a plaster, of mill powder with abundant egg or bean flour, after you have removed the cerate;
and place light wool on the plaster, and if the plaster dries out, and the patient's condition does not change, leave it until it is healed; many times it is healed in three weeks.
And if hot abscesses come, administer what we have said many times.
And if there is a fracture and wound together, observe if any piece of the bone is removed; then carefully remove it with instruments suitable for this.
And if the wound is narrow, widen it with a blade according to your need.
And when you have removed all these pieces, and none remain, sew the wound, if it is large, and apply suitable plasters to it, to generate flesh, until it is healed.
The clavicle breaks many times in front, towards the shoulder, and the fracture is in three ways:
or it is broken and separated in two, and there are pieces, and it is the easiest to restore;
or there is a fracture with a wound.
And the procedure, when the fracture is without a wound, is that you have two assistants, so that one holds the shoulder that feels the broken clavicle; and the other extends the neck towards the part;
then set the fracture with your fingers, so that the shape is as it should be, and there is neither appearance nor shortness.
And if you need to extend further, then place under the patient's shoulder a round bolster of cloth, or of wool, and let it be thick according to your need; and extend and lift the clavicle, and pull the bolster with your hand, so that you set the fracture as it should be.
And if you cannot pull the head of the clavicle outwards, because it is deeply embedded, then it is necessary that the patient lie often on his back, and place under the shoulder a medium-sized pillow, and let the assistant lower the shoulder, until the bone of the clavicle is raised.
And then set the fracture with your fingers, and if you find it broken, then you must make an incision.
and draw the pieces out gently, and if the bone cannot join because of some obstacle, then cut it with one of the scalpels that you have; but that you place this instrument under the clavicle, to protect the soft tissue:
and it resembles a spoon, and is not pointed, and should be as wide as necessary, according to the size of the bone and the strength of the work;
and it has two ends, as you see, and one is wide, and the other narrow, as is the opening of the wound that you have made when you drew out the bones;
and when you are sure of a hot abscess, cut the wound, and if the opening is small, or you suspect a hot abscess, fill the wound with lint and tents, according to its size.
And if hot abscesses appear, moisten some lint in rose oil and vinegar and wine, and apply it.
The binding of the bone, when it is without wounds and without cuts, is that you apply to the bone a plaster of mill dust and egg white, and place light tampons over it, and place a splint under the armpit, if you need it; then take a very wide bandage, a palm wide, then place a double layer of lint over the tampons and the plaster; then take a fine strip three fingers wide and long, and wrap it around that bandage, so that the end of the bandage is hanging; and place the strip on the fracture, and turn the bandage over the neck, and under the healthy armpit, and under the affected armpit; and tighten it from each side, and when you see that the bandage holds the fracture properly, and you clearly see that the strip does not move on the broken bone, then check it each day, and when the bandage loosens, then tighten it;
and make the patient lie on his back, and place a small pillow under the armpit when he sleeps, to raise the shoulder; this will lighten the fracture of the collarbone by lightening the shoulder, or you bind his arm to his neck, and do not unbind it unless a bad accident occurs, up to twenty days;
then renew the plaster, if you see that it is necessary, and tighten it and leave it so, until it is healed;
and it is healed in at most twenty-eight days, and in less time for some men.
Of the fracture of the shoulder
It rarely happens that the shoulder breaks in a wide place or in the middle, and it is not known except by touch;
then set it according to the shape of the fracture, and reset it according to its natural form, in every way that you can;
then put on the place powdered millstone with plenty of egg white, and light lint, and put on a double cloth; then put on a wide and thin splint, a little wider than the shoulder, and if under the splint there is hair in any place of the shoulder, then fill that hair with linen lint, so that the splint sits evenly;
and then bind it all with a strong bandage firmly, so that the splint does not move from its place, and examine the bandage each day;
and every time that it loosens, then tighten it, and make the splint even if it is out of place, and let the patient lie on his side;
and the shoulder is restored in twenty days or in twenty-five.
And when this number is complete, then unbind it, and be sure, for it is not a bone that easily comes out of place.
And if a piece of the bone protrudes, and points below the heart, then cut it, and remove it, and do what we have said in the fracture of the clavicle to appease a hot abscess.
of the fracture of the breast
The breast is sometimes broken in the middle, but this happens rarely; but it often breaks on the outside.
And when it is broken in the middle, it inclines downwards, and the patient feels great pain, and shortness of breath, and quickly, and perhaps vomits blood, and the hair appears in the broken bone, and one feels it well.
And the restoration is that the patient lies often on his back, and one puts a cushion between his shoulders, then presses the shoulders, and brings together the ribs of the two sides with your hands, and subtly put it even in all the ways that you can, until the shape of the bone is as it should be;
then put on plasters and lint above with a fine layer of salt, or other light wood, and wrap it in a cloth, and bind it over the broken bone, so that it does not move; and turn the bandage round to the back, and tighten it properly, and check every hour the binding, and if it loosens, then tighten it;
and if it is necessary to unbind it, because of corrosion or itching that comes to the place, or pain or abscess, then hurry, and unbind it, and remove the plaster, and treat what has come there in the manner of cures;
then replace the plaster, and tighten it until it is healed.
Of the fracture of the ribs
Know that the fracture of the ribs only happens in the large places behind the back, and at the front, and they only break because they are brittle; and one feels it well on examination with the fingers.
And the restoration is that you set the fracture evenly, as is necessary. And then apply the plaster, and bind it with a bandage, if you need one.
And if the rib fracture is inward-leaning, the patient feels very great pain and a stabbing sensation, as from pleurisy, because the bone punctures the lung; and breathes with difficulty, and quickly vomits a large amount of blood, and this is a serious condition, and the ancients have devoted great skill to it.
And there are some who say that it is necessary to administer foods that inflate the belly, to push the fracture outward.
We do not do this, that hot abscesses do not come, if they have not already come. And if they have come, then heal them.
And some of them say that one applies cupping glasses to the area, to strongly suck, and this is similar to reason; however, there is doubt that the cupping glass does not attract superfluities to the place due to the disposition of weakness.
And some of them say that one should cover the area with wool soaked in hot oil, and put tents between the ribs to evenly distribute the bandage around, then it should be treated with the treatment for pleurisy, with meat and medicine.
And if the patient feels great pain that he cannot bear because of the bone that pierces the flesh, and the patient is in doubt, then it is necessary to cut open the area of the broken rib, and it is necessary to place an instrument underneath to protect the viscera;
and then one must cut the bone, and pull gently, and then sew the two lips of the wound, if it is large, and treat it with plasters, until it is healed.
And if hot abscesses come, then apply cloths soaked in rose oil, and place them on the area;
and treat the area meanwhile as is necessary for an abscess, and let him lie often on the side where it should be, until it is healed.
and also to the spine of the back.
And when this happens to someone, and you want to know if he will be healed or not, then take note if you see his hands softened and swollen and dead, and he cannot move or extend them, and when you prick them with a needle, he does not feel it.
Know that he is mortally wounded in several ways, and if he moves them and feels well when they are pricked and pulled, know that the joint of the bone is safe, and that the patient will be cured, if care is taken.
And if a similar thing happens to the spine of the back, and you want to know if he will be healed or not, then take note if the feet are softened, and if the symptoms are there which are in the hands, and on the back there is flatulence and involuntary excretion;
and when he is turned on his belly, there is involuntary excretion. And when he is turned on his back and he wants to sit up, he cannot. Know that he is mortally wounded: so do not labor in his cure.
And if these symptoms do not appear, the case is less serious.
And the treatment is that you observe if there is a hot abscess, then apply rose oil or egg yolk oil until it is calmed;
then apply one of the comforting and drying plasters, and bind it with a bandage, and instruct the patient to rest; and do not sleep on the part where he feels the pain, until he is healed.
And if any bone is separated, it is necessary to cut above the heart; and remove the bone, then join the two edges of the wound, if it is large, with a suture, then treat it with flesh-generating ointment, until it is healed;
and if the head of the bone is broken, which is called the "cow's head," put your left thumb there, and align it with the other hand as best you can, then apply the plaster and the bandage on top, if you need it;
then bind it, and if there is a separated bone, cut it open, and remove it, and treat the wound until it is healed.
Of the fracture of the hip bone
It rarely happens that the hip bone is broken, and if it does happen, it is only a slight weakening at the head; and it splits lengthwise, and is displaced inwards, and the patient feels pain at the site, and throbbing, and swelling where it is broken.
And the restoration is that you extend your hand above, until you are above the fracture; and know what the fracture is and its shape;
and if the fracture is only at the head, then set the fracture evenly, until it is of its natural shape.
And if the fracture is lengthwise, or it is displaced inwards, then have the patient lie on his stomach, until the resetting of that fracture is prepared for you. And when you have set it evenly, then apply the plaster, then place a splint of wood or horn, and bind the fracture so that it does not move;
and fill the space under the ribs, until the binding is even. And instruct the patient to sleep on his healthy side, or on his back.
And if hot abscesses occur there, do not touch them until the hot abscesses are calmed, and apply what we have said before; and then return to the restoration, and bind it as is necessary, if there is no bad accident;
Of the fracture of the shoulder
The shoulder joint is that which is between the elbow and the head of the shoulder, and if it is broken, then one must restore it according to one of the two methods:
one of which is that you take a straight piece of wood of moderate thickness, according to this form:
And tie two cords to the two ends, and hang them upwards, and let the patient sit on a seat;
then place his broken arm on the wood, until it reaches the armpit, and has in the middle a curve of wood, then hang on some heavy thing or the assistant stretches it downwards;
then let the surgeon place the fracture evenly with his hands together, until the fracture returns as it should.
And the other method is that one suspends the patient on his bed, and ties his hand to his neck, then instructs two assistants that one holds what is above the fracture with his hands, and the other holds below with a rope, and each stretches to his part.
And if you want the traction to be stronger, then tighten one rope below the fracture, and above the fracture, and let each of the assistants stretch to his part.
And if the fracture is close to the head of the shoulder, then you must place one rope in the middle under the armpit, and another towards the elbow, under the fracture;
and also if the fracture is towards the elbow, then you must place a rope lightly, without effort, until the fracture is even on the place, and on the elbow;
then set the fracture evenly, as is necessary, and tighten it, if no hot abscesses appear.
And if hot abscesses appear, then do not tighten it until seven days, and apply wool soaked in vinegar and rose oil, until the hot abscesses are calmed;
then tighten it, and the manner of tightening is that you place the plaster on the fracture, then assemble the arm to the shoulder, and place your hand on the shoulder or on the breast;
and place the cloth, and tighten it on the shoulder and on the arm, so that the arm is in its proper place, if nothing prevents it, or if the bone is not moved.
And if you doubt that the bone might move, then use splints, and place on the fracture one splint larger and stronger than the others, and let there be one finger's breadth of space between each splint, and let each splint be so large that it surpasses the fracture by three finger breadths on each side;
then tighten the splints, as I said at the beginning of the chapter on the fracture, more strongly and less as you move away.
And if you see the placement of the splints, and the tightening, as we have said, at the time that you restore the broken limb, and you suspect a hot abscess, then leave it to ripen until the seventh day, as we have said;
then examine every three days the bandage, that an itching or swelling does not come there, or that nourishment cannot reach the limb because it is too tight. If so, correct it, as we have said.
And if no such accident occurs, then do not unbind it except after three days or more, and let the patient sleep on his back, and have his hands on his stomach;
and place under the shoulder a cushion filled evenly with wool, and check every hour of the day or night, that the shape of the broken limb does not move, or that the bandages are not loosened;
then correct it by the virtue of medicine, and give him the food that we have mentioned before, in such a way that the food is at first subtle; and when he begins to recover, let it be thick.
And it is customary that the shoulder and the leg should be healed within forty days altogether; and then one should unbind it and administer baths and ointments to heal the place.
And if the constriction is severe and swollen, it remains unbound for fifty days or two months.
Of the fracture of the arm
The arm is composed of two bones, which are called the two "foscile", of which one is small, and it is the one that follows the elbow;
and the other is large, and it is the one that is below, towards the little finger;
by chance the large foscile is broken alone, or the small one, and by chance both together.
When the small foscile is broken, the restoration is easy, and the healing;
and when the large one is broken, the healing is difficult, and more serious than when both are broken together.
If it is the small foscile that is broken alone, then it should be slightly extended a little, and set even.
And if it is the large foscile, then it should be pulled harder;
and extend it on a cushion, and hold the little finger of the hand higher than the others, and the little toe lower than the other toes, and let the patient be crossed over himself, and a cushion in front of him higher, so that the patient suffers no pain;
then let the attendant extend his arm to the lower part of his hand, or to a ligature, and another attendant to the other above.
And then let the physician set it even, according to its best form.
And if in the fracture there are pieces, then put each one in its place, and if there is any separated that touches the heart, and you cannot restore it to its place, then cut it off and remove it, as we have said before.
And if with the fracture there is a wound, I have spoken of it in a separate chapter; then take care of it.
And if at the beginning of the restoration, hot abscesses occur, then glue a cloth of cerote made of rose oil and white wax, which is neither too hard nor too soft; and bind the cloth on subtly, until the hot abscesses are calmed.
And then remove the cerote, and apply a plaster of the mill powder with abundant egg, then apply the splints, and let the splint of the fracture always be stronger, and a little wider than the others;
and know that there should be six splints on the arm in several arrangements: whether the fracture is in one of the bones, or in two;
and bind more tightly above the fracture than elsewhere, and always less tightly as it moves away, as I said at the beginning of the chapter; and let the cloths that are over the fracture be soft and moist, and not hard or rough;
and let the cloths that are over the fracture be soft and moist, and not hard or rough; and let the thread, with which it is bound, be of linen, neither too thick nor too thin, as we have said.
And examine the limb and the binding after a few days. And if any bad accident happens to the limb, such as itching that comes to the limb, then you must bathe the limb with warm water until that itching is calmed;
and do not let the limb rest tightly.
And then recommence the binding, and if the binding is loosened and the bone separated, and similar things, then correct it.
And then take care that nourishment can reach the limb, for if it is too tight, you must loosen it a little, and leave it so for a few days until nourishment flows there, and then tighten it.
And if none of these things that we have said happens to the patient, then do not unbind it until twenty days.
or around, then hang his hands around his neck, and let his neck be straight, and beware of movement and fidgeting, and sleep on his back;
and know that this fracture is healed in thirty or thirty-five days, and perhaps in twenty days, according to the compositions and complexions of the virtues.
Of the fracture of the hand
Know that on the back of the hand and in the knuckles of the fingers, few fractures occur, and only bending happens many times.
And when the palm of the hand is broken or bent, the patient must sit cross-legged, and sit straight before him equally;
then he places his hand on the extended cloth, and the attendant extends the broken bones, and places them equally aligned, until they are well joined;
and applies the plaster and the lint, if no abscess forms, then applies a splint according to the size of the area; and it should be wrapped in a linen cloth.
And if the fracture is on the inside around the palm of the hand, make a sling of cloths, and instruct the patient to hold it to his broken palm; and then binds it with a long cloth, and let the splint be soft leather as large as the palm of the hand, and bind it, as is necessary.
And if the fracture is on the outside, you must place one splint on top, and another underneath on the palm, so that the hand is open and straight, then tie it all around the hand, and tighten the binding between the fingers.
And if the fracture occurs in any of the knuckles of the fingers, if it is the thumb, set it straight, as is necessary; and bind it with the palm, and if you wish, place a small straight splint to lift the fracture, and it will not move;
and if the fracture is in the other fingers, such as the index finger or one of the others, set it straight, and bind it with the healthy finger that is next to it; or you bind them all together in an "I" shape, whichever works better, or you place a splint on top, as with the thumb;
and take care in the restoration and in the preparation of a hot abscess, and help what comes from it, as I have said.
The thigh bone is often broken, and one sees it well when it turns forward and backward;
and the restoration is that one binds one ligature above the fracture, and another below. And the patient lies on his face, then each attendant extends his ligature to his part equally;
and this is when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
And if the fracture is close to the root of the thigh, let one of the ligatures be towards the groin, and the other ligature below the fracture.
And similarly if it is close to the knee, then let the ligature be near the knee, and let the extension be below;
then let the surgeon set the bone equally with his two hands, until it is according to its natural form, and then apply the plaster, and bind it, if no abscesses form there.
And if there is a hot abscess, let it subside, then return to your work and your treatment; The ligature is made in this manner.
It is necessary that you wrap around the fracture a hard bandage doubled in two or three, and the excess remains, then turn the leg until the heel comes to the root of the buttock, and put a long thread between the thigh and the leg, near the knee below, and let the ends of the thread come to the top;
then turn the bandage over the leg and over the thigh, then place splints over the fracture, and place a splint over the bone of the leg;
then fill the empty space between the leg and the thigh with soft cloths to make the tightening even, then begin to tie firmly three or four turns above the fracture; and the further you go above the fracture, the less you tighten it;
then take the two ends of the thread that you placed between the leg and the thigh, and tie the three splints that are above, then return below to the end of the thread, until you come near the foot;
and tighten it so that it does not move from its place, then leave it thus, until neither abscess nor swelling nor anything similar appears. And if it happens, then untie it, and treat what has appeared, as we have said many times;
and if there are pieces of bone that prick, it is necessary to remove them, if one can; and if one cannot, then it is necessary to cut open the place, and pull it out forcefully; and cure it as we have said, until it is healed.
And sometimes the thigh is broken so that splints are applied, as in the shoulder and arm;
nevertheless, in the restoration thus made, the patient does not limp.
And know that the thigh is restored in L days, or a little less or a little more, according to the diversities of complexions.
Know that in the kneecap there is little fracture, but it bends many times.
And if it breaks, it is only a fissure, or a hole, and it happens with a wound, and without a wound, and this one feels well.
And the restoration is that one puts what is round to its sides equal, until it is assembled as much as one can;
then put the plaster, and put a round splint there, if you need it, and bind it as is necessary, then observe all the conditions that we have mentioned in other fractures, such as hot abscess and other similar things; then apply to each accident what is necessary for it, until it is healed.
Of the fracture of the leg
Know that in the leg there are two bones, of which one is rightly called "mustelz", and the other is called "foscile";
and the same fracture occurs as in the arm, and therefore the restoration is the same as that of the arm, and the procedure is entirely similar. And if the two bones are broken together, the leg turns in every direction.
And if the thin bone is broken, it turns forward.
And if the large bone is broken, one feels great pain, and it is clearly visible; and it turns downwards.
Then administer extension, and set it straight, and bind the splints evenly;
but however, if the fracture is severe, and there are several pieces, the extension must be gentler and lighter; and ease it according to your ability.
And when you have completed your work, take two wooden splints that encompass the leg on either side, and are the length of the leg from the knee downwards;
then wrap around it in two places a bandage above and below, and bind it in the middle also, and with this binding the leg cannot deviate to the right or left, and so it is well;
and some administer a splint the length of the leg, which is made of wood, and in it the leg is placed to prevent movement, and this is properly done in a fracture where there is a wound;
and move the leg each day, to see if there is a hot abscess or other complication; then treat it until it is healed.
of the fracture of the bones of the foot
At the ankle, fracture does not occur, but at the bones of the foot fracture sometimes occurs and at the toes also, and there is only a crack in several ways.
And if a fracture occurs in the bones of the foot, and you see these bones overriding each other, then have the patient put his foot on the ground, as if he wanted to walk, and then immediately put your foot on his, where the bones are raised, then press it until they return to their place;
then apply the plaster and lint, and place under the sole of the foot a small board with two full ends, then bind it to the foot properly, after you have wrapped cloths around it, and other things that you need.
And when three or four days have passed, untie the binding, for you will find the bones even, whether fractured or dislocated.
And if any of the toes are broken, restore them as we have said for the fingers of the hand; then place on the broken toe a splint according to the length of the toe, and let it be a little wider, then place under the foot that board which I have mentioned, and bind it properly;
and if there are two or three, or more, broken, then place on each toe a splint according to its size, wrapped in a linen cloth, and bind the board under the foot; and let it rest on the head of the board above the belly of the foot, so that it holds it well.
And you must not forget the other things that I have said for other fractures, as we have said; and treat each accident as is necessary.
of the fracture of the bone of the wrist
When the bone of a woman's nature is broken, make her sit upright, then incline her to the back, and let her be held from behind;
then fill the vagina of the patient with cotton, and put in as much as will fit;
then stand the woman up, and lift her back little by little, and then the cotton will come out, until it reaches the entrance of the vagina, and the bone will return with the cotton;
and when she wants to urinate, remove the cotton, and when she has urinated, replace it, and do this for seven days or thereabouts: the fracture will be restored, and if you wish, take a sheep's bladder, and tie a string to the opening, and put the whole bladder into the vagina; then blow strongly into the string until the bladder is inflated inside; the fracture will then be restored to its natural position;
then it should be filled with cotton, and leave it like that for some days, until it is healed.
And when the bone of a man's or woman's wrist is broken, restore it in the same way as we have described for the hip bone;
and these fractures are not hidden from one who studies and practices them, and attends to my book.
For the fracture signifies in many ways the correct method of restoration: understand it then.
In the penis, when it is broken, take a goose's neck and put the penis in it; then wrap cloths around it, and leave it for three days or however long it takes, and it will be healed quickly.
Of fracture with wound
It is necessary for someone who has a fracture with a wound, especially if it is large, such as a bone in the thigh or shoulder or similar, that he be healed immediately, so that the healings that we have described testify to it.
And if the wound heals, then stop it with vitriol, if you have nothing else, then begin again to restore the fracture at that same time, or that day, if hot abscesses do not appear.
And if hot abscesses appear, then leave the restoration until the ninth day, until the abscesses are subsided, and do not touch it on the third or fourth day, for you would cause bad consequences.
And if the broken bone is apparent on the uncovered flesh, then you must put it in place lightly with your hands, with slight extension.
And if extension is not suitable for you to put it in place with your hands, then reset it with this iron instrument, which is seven or eight fingers long, and its width is according to the size of the wound; and for this reason it is necessary for the surgeon to have three or four, according to what he needs for each treatment of a fracture;
and let it be round and somewhat thick, so that it does not bend under compression on the limb during your work, and let it be sharp in front, and thick from the middle forward, thus:
And it is called a "palainche," therefore the curved head should be placed on the head of the apparent bone; and push it at once, until it returns, and is even one against the other. And if the fracture is subtle, and the instrument cannot easily grasp the bone, then you must cut the head of the bone, until the instrument has power over it.
And if you cannot reset the bone, as we have said, then cut it with an instrument suitable for this, either an incisor or a saw, as you are able;
then clean that which remains on the bone of roughness and small splinters.
And when the bone is reset, and the patient feels great pain afterwards, know that it is not in its natural place.
Then do what is necessary so that it is in its place, then moisten a cloth in black styptic wine, and properly if it is summer; and do not put on the wound cerate or anything else where there is oil, lest it cause putrefaction and corruption;
then administer stitches when you have restored the bone, and leave the wound uncovered, and cut the covering all around, according to the size of the wound, and take good care that the wound is not constricted with the fracture;
and many times foolish surgeons have done this, and have caused the patient death or corrosion sometimes; and let the bandages be softer and smoother than for other fractures.
And if the wound is bad or large, and you fear that bad complications may arise, as we have said, and you find pain in the place, then you should not put stitches there; but wrap around, instead of stitches, hard cloths, and bind them.
And when you see after one or two days, proud flesh forming on the wound, then remove everything you have put on with wine, and apply an ointment that heals wounds, such as tetrafarmacum ointment and similar.
And you must unbind the limb twice a day, morning and evening, until it is healed and sound.
And it is necessary that the limb be positioned in such a way that the proud flesh runs down slightly.
And if many days pass, and it cannot heal but keeps producing proud flesh, know that there are small pieces of bone, wherefore you must probe the wound with a tent, and remove all those separated pieces which cause this pain.
And if a fistula develops there, or another kind of corruption, then you must treat it, according to what is said in the chapter before this.
And when the bone is broken, and open on the limb, like the bone of the thigh or the shoulder, and others similar of the great limbs, do not remove it, for many times death results, but leave it until it rots;
perhaps it will fall out by itself after twenty or thirty days, then cure the wound, if you can;
and if you cannot, then leave it.
Many swellings come after the healing of the fracture, especially when it is near the joint, and the appearance of the limb is an ugly thing to see; and perhaps the limb cannot perform its natural functions.
Take care then if the bone is fresh: administer styptic medicines, such as aloes, incense, and myrrh, and sarcocol, acacia, and similar others, so that you take some of these things, or all together, and mix them with styptic wine or with egg white or with vinegar; and apply them to the wound on lint, and bind it tightly, and do not unbind it for several days;
and apply them to the wound on lint, and bind it tightly, and do not unbind it for several days; and then unbind it, and begin again with another, until the inflammation is gone;
or you bind on a well-made piece of lead; for the property of lead is that it removes all swellings from the limbs;
and if the inflammation has already turned to hardness like stone, and it is necessary to remove it, then cut it open, and remove the excess that is visible; or you scrape it with a razor until it is removed, and treat it until it is healed.
of the limb which is weak after healing
When the fracture of the bone is healed, and the limb remains weak and thin afterwards, this happens for many reasons: one of which is that it was bound too tightly, and was not bound as it should have been; or because there were too many bandages, and nourishment could not reach the limb; or because of excessive inflammation; or because of too much movement, not at the proper time; or because he has little blood in his body, and is weak.
And the cure is that you make the patient eat, and make the body soft, until the blood is multiplied in him; and administer baths, and give him joy and gladness;
then put poultices on the limb, so that the poultices draw great nourishment to it, and often moisten it with warm water, until the nourishment flows to the limb; and returns to its natural form.
of the limb twisted after the healing When the limb is twisted after the restoration, and the broken bone is apparent, and the shape of the limb is ugly, yet it does not lose its natural function:
do not believe the fools who say that one should break the limb again, and many foolish people have done this in our land;
and this practice is blamed, and great harm comes from it, and perhaps death;
however, if the knots and the stiffness are fresh, then they should be bathed in warm water, or softening herbs should be cooked, such as mallow leaves, and roots, and melilot, and similar things;
and make a softening plaster, such as well-made diachylon, and you take the mucilage of mallow, and cook it with hen grease or sesame oil, and make a plaster on top;
or you take fat figs, and crush them with pigeon dung, and similar medicines that reduce the swelling.
And sometimes the knot is removed by rubbing continuously and for a long time with moist hands. And let movement be given to the limb every hour.
And if the tortuosity is old and hardened, like stone, and it needs to be removed with iron, then it must be cut to the bone, with a fine, light scalpel; and put care and diligence into the treatment.
Dislocation occurs when a joint moves out of its place, which prevents it from moving, and the limb is misaligned, causing the patient great pain and injury.
When a dislocation occurs in someone, it must be immediately reduced without delay.
For if one delays, the place swells, and perhaps one can only reset it with difficulty;
therefore one must not move it when it is swollen: often it causes spasms and other pains;
however, when this happens, bleed the patient, then leave it until the abscesses are calmed;
then bathe the limb with warm water and oil, then gently reset it, and treat each limb as its treatment dictates.
And I have ordered the chapters on dislocations from the head to the feet.
It rarely happens that both jaws are dislocated, and the dislocation of both is according to two manners: or they are a little removed from their places, and softened a little; or they are completely dislocated, and hang towards the breast, and the saliva runs from the mouth that he cannot hold it, nor can he close his mouth, and his tongue is entangled with speech.
When the dislocation is small, it returns by itself in several positions.
And if it is complete and accomplished, then you must reset it quickly, and not delay;
and in such a manner that the assistant holds the head of the patient, and puts the little finger of one of his hands into the root of the dislocation of the mandible inside the mouth, if the dislocation is on two sides; and the other two fingers of the hands should be outside, to make it even;
and instruct the patient to soften his jaws, and move them in all directions. And the little finger places it evenly, until it returns to its place.
And if the reduction is difficult, especially if it is the two mandibles together, then bathe them with warm water and oil, until you soften them slightly;
and do not delay in the reduction, as we have said.
And when they are reduced evenly, and the patient's mouth closes well without softening, then apply cloths moistened in a cerate made of rose oil and wax, then bind it lightly with soft bandages;
and let the patient sleep on his back, and his head be supported between two cushions, so that he does not move it neither to the right nor to the left, nor strain to chew, but take light food, until the pains are gone, and the mandibles are healed;
and then he may eat what he wants lightly, and he should not strain to open his mouth when eating and drinking, until the mandible is well healed and sound.
And if the two mandibles cannot be immediately reset, and are not returned to their place, then there comes fever and accustomed swelling, and perhaps looseness of the bowels, and perhaps vomiting of pure bile.
And when you see this, then know that it is perilous; and many times he who this happens to dies within nine days.
The clavicle cannot be dislocated inwards towards the continuation of itself and the breast, and it is sometimes dislocated outwards, and this is easily felt.
And the restoration is such that the patient lies often on his back, and extends his arms; and then press the place firmly with your palm, and it will return;
then apply the plaster and bandage it, and bind it tightly;
and the head which is towards the rib cannot be dislocated; unless slightly, and if it dislocates sometimes, then reset it in its place, as we have said;
then apply the plaster and bandage it tightly, and instruct the patient to rest until healed;
and in the same way is the head of the shoulder reset, when it is separated from its place.
Of the dislocation of the shoulder
Know that the shoulder is dislocated only in three ways:
one is that it dislocates towards the armpit below; and the second is towards the breast; and by chance it dislocates upwards, and this happens rarely;
and it does not dislocate backwards because of the shoulder, nor inwards because of the nerves;
and many times it dislocates downwards towards the armpit, especially in those who have little flesh, for in them it jumps easily;
in those who have enough flesh, it jumps with difficulty, and returns with difficulty.
And by chance it happens to some men that there is a percussion or fracture, and the shoulder swells with a hot abscess, and they think that it is dislocated because of this.
Therefore, you must test it until you are certain; and then begin the treatment.
And the dislocation is known when it is lowered towards the armpit, and it shows a difference between the diseased shoulder and the healthy one, and you will find a manifest difference between them; and you will find a hollow at the head of the shoulder, and beneath the armpit, when touching the head of the shoulder, as if it were an egg; and the patient cannot bring his hand to his nose, nor move it in any way;
and also, if it is dislocated upwards, it is not hidden, for you find it manifestly by touch;
and this kind of dislocation is not difficult to reset, when it is recent, or if the child is ill.
And the method is that the attendant raises the patient's hand upwards, then places his fists under the armpit, and forcefully raises the joint upwards into place; and the attendant raises the hand, and extends it upwards, then puts it downwards; it will come quickly.
And if it does not come as we have said within a few days, then it is necessary that the patient be bathed in warm water; and the attendant should apply a softening and soothing poultice, such as a decoction of mallow, fenugreek, and melilot in water, and it should be administered;
then the patient should be laid on his back, and a pad of wool of equal thickness should be placed under the armpit, neither too soft nor too hard, then the physician should place his heel on the pad, and gently raise the head of the shoulder, and pull the patient's hand;
and another attendant should hold the patient's head, so that it does not move downwards; that shoulder will return immediately, and if you wish, reset it in this manner:
and it is that you cause to be present one man who is larger than the patient; and let him be straight towards the side, and put his shoulder under the patient's armpit, and lift the armpit upwards, so that the patient hangs in the air; and another attendant pull the patient's hand downwards towards the belly. And if the patient is too light, let him hang with something heavy, and the dislocation will return immediately.
And it is reset also in another manner:
and that is, one sticks a long firebrand in the earth, of which the head should be as round as a pestle, and should be neither too thick nor too thin; then it is placed under the patient, but so that he has soft cloths on top, and the patient stands along the length of the wood;
then let his hand be pulled down strongly on the other side, and the joint will return to its place quickly;
and if it does not want to return for all these things that we have said, then do this treatment: take a firebrand of two spans long and four fingers wide, which has a round head to enter easily deeply under the armpit, according to this form:
then tie soft cloths to the head of the wood, so that the wood does not injure the patient, then place it under the armpit of the patient;
and extend his arm along the length of the wood, and tie the shoulder to the wood, and the arm at the wrist, then place the arm on a rung of a ladder that is wide, and let the hand be extended downwards, and let the body hang on the other side: the joint will return immediately.
And when it is in, in whatever manner that may be, you must place under the armpit an equal ball of wool, then apply the plaster prepared with powdered millstone, with incense and egg white, over the whole shoulder and around, then bind it tightly under the armpit, and turn the bandage over the plaster, and clasp the hand to his neck, and let the hand remain thus.
And it is necessary that he eat little, until the limb is strengthened, for it will heal more quickly;
and then eat more after five or seven days, and move it; and if it is firm and not softened, it is healed.
And if the joint is out of place because of moisture that has entered, or for another reason, you must apply cautery to three points, as is described in the chapter on cautery.
And if you do all this, and it loosens after seven days, and the joint does not hold, and he cannot raise his arm, then know that the nerves at the head of the shoulder are cut or stretched or softened; and know that the joint will never be fixed in its place.
The dislocation which is towards the breast and nipples, or behind, is caused by a blow and stretching of the hands, and another treatment is administered there;
and treat until it is healed.
And if after healing there is stiffness in the limb, and slowness in movement, let the patient use a bath many times, until that stiffness is lessened, and it returns to its former nature.
of the dislocation of the rib
Know that the joint of the rib is dislocated with difficulty, and returns with difficulty;
and it is dislocated on all sides, and especially in front and behind, and the dislocation is not hidden, for one sees it well and feels it well; and dislocated according to each form. And when you join the diseased rib with the healthy one, you can see it clearly. For the joint is broken, and he cannot bend his arm, nor touch his shoulder at all.
And you must reset it before hot abscesses come there, for if hot abscesses came there, it would be difficult to reset it;
and perhaps it cannot be reset at all, especially when it is at the back; it is worse than other dislocations, and is more painful, and death may result.
And the restoration is, when it is such that it can be reset, that you extend his hand with your two hands; and his arms should be spread out, and the hands of the doctor around, above and below, and put the joint to its sockets together, or at the root of its palm, until it returns to its place.
And if the dislocation is in front, it returns when he doubles his hand to his hand, and strikes the root of the palm where the dislocated joint is.
And if it will not return to its place, administer strong extension;
and it is that two assistants extend the arm, and two assistants hold it, so that it does not move during the extension;
then turn the arm on each side, after you have wrapped a long and wide double cloth;
and when the physician joins the joint with his hand, he should anoint it with some oil to soften the joint, then put the joint forcefully, until it returns;
and when it is in place, apply a dry plaster with egg white, and bind it firmly, and hang the arm around the patient's neck, and leave it for some days, then unbind it.
And if the joint is firm in its place, untie the binding, and leave it;
and if you see that the joint does not hold well, redo the plaster and the binding, and leave it like that for some days, until it is firmly set; then unbind it.
And if he feels pain after the resetting of the joint, and it moves, bathe and rub it gently, and press until it is soothed; or you put on the joint a poultice of fat mutton, then leave it one day and one night, then remove it, and make him enter the bath; and when he sweats, rub the joint moderately, then put the poultice back on, and then enter the bath; and thus do it two or three times, until he is healed;
and if you wish, put on warm, moist cow dung mixed with butter, and bind it on;
then it will return to its proper place.
The dislocation of the hand
The joint of the hand dislocates, and its reduction is easier than other joints. However, it must be returned to its place quickly, at the very moment it is dislocated, before the place is swollen, or a hot abscess forms there.
And the reduction is that you place the affected hand on a table, and the assistant extends the hand, and positions it evenly, so that he places his palm on the appearance of the joint, and pushes until it returns.
However, you must check if it is well in place; then the patient places the back of his hand on a table during extension and reduction. And if the dislocation is on the back of the hand, the patient places the back of his hand on the table, and the assistant places his hand on that part of the joint.
If it returns immediately, it is good. If not, restrain it with soothing plasters applied warm, and leave it thus without restarting.
And if he cannot endure it, and you cannot put it back in place after a few days, the joint remains crooked;
and it harms the patient not at all except that the hand is weakened, and cannot grasp anything at all: then know that the nerves or arteries are severed;
there is no other remedy except to cauterize near the wound, and perhaps nothing else will help.
And when the hand is in place, apply the plaster we have described, then bandage it and leave it for five days, then unwrap it and leave it thus.
And if he cannot move it well, and there is any stiffness, moisten it with warm water, and rub it until it is healed.
of the dislocation of the fingers of the hand
Sometimes the fingers of the hand are dislocated on either side, sometimes on the back of the palm or on the belly;
then extend the finger, and push the dislocation with your thumbs until it returns, then support the head of the finger, and bend it towards the part where it is disjointed;
and leave it for two days, and then set it even that day;
and at night bind it, as we have said, and unbind it by day, and make it move, and bind it at night;
and do this often, until it is tight, and do the same, if it is dislocated on the palm of the hand, and do as you have done before, until it is healed;
and do likewise, when it is dislocated elsewhere.
Of the dislocation of the spine of the back
When the spine of the back or neck is dislocated, or if there are several dislocations, there is no cure, for death quickly takes the patient.
And the sign is that excrement leaps forth without will, nor can he hold it, and often some limbs are softened, whether the two thighs, or the two arms, or one.
And many times the spine moves in four directions;
That which moves backward is called "gibbosity":
The cure is that you observe if the gibbosity came from infancy: then there is no cure or healing at all.
And that which comes from a fall or from blows or similar things, the ancients described methods of cures with grand words, where there is not much benefit in all;
but I have shortened it according to my intention, and have devised instruments in various ways.
I say that in the gibbosity that comes to the breast in front, there is no remedy nor health;
and also that which comes straight to the two sides, and one cannot cure except that which properly comes to the back, as I say;
and it is that the patient be stretched on his face in a level place, and have a cushion beneath him, that he not be injured;
then stick a firebrand firmly in the ground at the head, and another at the feet, and tie a rope across the patient's armpits, and another at the hips, and knees, and ankles;
and two assistants hold the ropes, one at the head and the other at the feet, between the two firebrands;
and let them be well secured, the firebrands as we have said, and the physician place his palms firmly on the spine, until it returns.
And if it does not return by this treatment, then take a board three arms long, and place it under the wall, and let the patient be on his side, and place the end of the board under the wall, then place the middle of the board on the spine; and let the physician place his feet on the other end of the board, and press firmly, until it returns to its place;
and if you wish, do it with a lathe that turns by hand. And it is that you place two firebrands at the head of the patient a cubit apart, and towards the feet two others, and let there be between each firebrand, above and below, a palm's breadth of space;
and let there be in each firebrand one hole, where the lathe runs, and let the firebrands be firmly in the ground, so that they do not move;
and between each two firebrands let there be one turning firebrand, upon which the cords turn, and let there be on the two turning firebrands two small firebrands a palm's length long, to turn the lathe;
and then tie the cord which is through the armpits to the lathe towards the head, and the other cord towards the feet to the other lathe, and each of the assistants turns his lathe with the whole cord, and the master places the spine evenly as we have said.
And when it is even, then put on a drying plaster with egg white, and then the lint, and then the splint of a tablet three fingers long, which covers the place of the gibbosity and the part of the healthy spine, then bind it with a cord, as we have said, and let the patient use a light diet, until he is healed;
and if anything comes at the end of the healing, then it is necessary to administer softening and soothing medicines, with the splint that we have mentioned above; and sometimes one administers a piece of lead, and sometimes the appearance comes in the posterior spine of the back, and one thinks that it is a dislocation; and it is the bone that appears, wherefore one should not have presumption there: by chance it would bring death.
Know that at the joints of the hip and at the joints of the shoulder, only dislocations occur, not as in the other joints;
and the hip joint is dislocated in four ways: inwards and outwards, and forwards and backwards;
and more inwards than elsewhere, and slightly dislocated forwards and backwards.
And the recognition of its inward dislocation is that when one joins the diseased leg with the healthy one, it is longer, and the diseased knee is more open than the healthy one, and the patient cannot bend his knee to the fire; and the place which is nearby is swollen with a hot abscess, because the head of the thigh comes there.
And the sign of that which comes outwards, is that these symptoms are contrary to those above.
And the signs of that which happens in front, are that he extends his leg well according to its length; nevertheless, he does not bend his knee without pain, and if one wants to make it move, it cannot go forward, and he retains his urine, and his groin swells, and when he walks, he steps on his heel.
And the signs of that which happens behind, are that he cannot extend his knee, nor bend it, and that leg is more twisted than the other, and the groin is softened, and the head of the thigh is in the place under the ribs.
The treatment of this type of dislocation is that you should observe if the dislocation is old, and if it remains according to its position, there is no cure; and there is no need for presumption.
And in that where the dislocation is fresh, and it is of the four kinds of dislocation, hasten that you turn the joint, and extend it inwards and outwards, and move it to the right and left; by chance it will return, and needs no other treatment.
And if it does not return in this manner, then you must prepare a strong assistant, and extend the leg strongly with two hands, or with a linen cloth that is tied above the knee; and another assistant extends his hand above in such a way that he puts his hands under his armpits, then grasps him with a soft cloth above the thigh; and another holds the head of the linen;
and they extend upwards and downwards all at once, until the patient is lifted from the ground at once, and remains hanging.
This method of extension is common to the four similar cases, and if the dislocation has returned, as we have said, it is well.
If not, then it is necessary to treat it similarly.
When the dislocation is inward, it is necessary that you place the patient on his healthy side, then place the linen on the root of the thigh, and the place which is under the groin, then extend the linen upwards towards the groin, and towards the shoulder;
then let another assistant take his arms, and embrace the large part of the affected thigh, and extend it outwards strongly; then it will return to its place immediately;
and this type of dislocation is easier than the others.
And if you cannot reduce it in this manner that we have described, it is necessary that you bind the two feet of the patient together with a strong, soft linen above the two heels, and above the two knees, and let the affected leg be extended two fingers more than the other;
then let it be hung from the top of a pole, and let it be two arms-lengths above the ground;
then instruct an assistant to embrace the head of the thigh, and let another assistant hang with the patient, who firmly embraces the thigh, for the joint returns immediately and quickly.
And when the dislocation is outward, let the patient lie down, as we have said in the case of one who has a gibbosity, and draw a linen tightly around the affected leg properly, and also around the foot;
then place two burning coals, one at the head and another at the feet, then insert a burning coal between the thighs of the patient in the middle of the groin; and have moistened cloths placed around, so that it does not burn the patient, then let each assistant stretch towards him, and let the physician place the dislocation equally with his hand.
If it returns, it is good.
If not, place it on a table, and press it as we have said in the case of gibbosity, and let the patient lie on his healthy side.
And when the dislocation is in front, it is necessary to extend the affected leg quickly, and according to what I have said; and let the physician put his effort on the affected angle, then press with the other hand, and extend it downwards towards the knee.
And if the dislocation is behind, it is not necessary to extend the affected limb downwards, nor to raise it from the ground, but it should be as if the hip were dislocated behind, as we have said about lying on the two hips; and let him be on his face, and the limb extended as we have said before, and one should press on the joint against the table; and it will be right when the patient extends his legs, and they are equal; then join the thighs, and apply the plaster, and bind it with a bandage, so that the hip does not move; and let it rest for three or four days, then unbind it, and apply the plaster again;
and if you see that they are equal, then bind it, as before, and leave it for three days;
then unbind it, and make him walk gently, until the limb is strengthened.
Of the dislocation of the knee
The knee is dislocated in three ways: that is to say, inwards and outwards, and backwards;
and it does not dislocate forwards.
And the sign is that you instruct the patient to bend his leg to his thigh, and if it does not bend to his thigh, know that it is dislocated;
and the restoration of all is that you make the patient sit upright, and extend his leg if he can, and place your back against his face, and place his foot on your feet;
then take his knee in your palms, and pull it between your fingers, then bend the two sides of the knee strongly; and another assistant extends his foot, until the knee returns to its place, and the sign is that he bends his leg easily to his thigh;
and apply the plaster, and bind the leg to the thigh, and bind them together tightly for three or four days, then unbind it;
and the patient should not exert himself to walk, until the limb is strengthened.
And if the limb is not straight, administer strong extension, as we have said in the treatment of the hip, until it is healed.
of the dislocation of the heel
The heel is sometimes displaced, and sometimes completely dislocated, both inwards and outwards.
And the sign is that the ankle is swollen, and tense towards the part where it is dislocated:
The reduction is easy, and one should gently extend it with one's hands when it is only displaced.
And when it is completely dislocated, you must make the patient sit upright, and hold him firmly by the leg, above the ankle;
then pull the foot towards you with your right hand, and then with your left hand twice, then extend it upwards, and gently place the foot upwards;
and do this twice, as we have said, by pushing and pulling the foot;
If it returns, it is good;
if not, then begin the procedure again, for it will return;
and if it cannot return thus, then make the patient lie on his back on the ground, and firmly fix a stake in the ground between his thighs, and tie cloths around it, so that it does not injure the patient;
then let the assistant hold the thigh, and another assistant extend the foot with his hands or with a strap, which he ties above the ankle; then let each assistant extend equally, and the stake shall always be between the patient's thighs to restrain the patient when he is extended;
then let the surgeon equally set the dislocation with his hands, and another assistant hold the healthy leg underneath, and the dislocation will return quickly.
And when it is in place, then apply the plaster and lint, and bind it firmly, and tie the foot to the leg, and guard the nerves which are on the ankle behind, that the binding not be too tight;
then leave it two or three days, and if the binding loosens, then tighten it;
then unbind it on the third or fourth day, and forbid the patient from walking for four days; and if he walks before that time, it is not certain that it will not dislocate again.
And if hot abscesses occur, then you must soothe it, as we have said elsewhere, until it is healed.
of the fingers When the fingers are dislocated, they must be gently extended without effort, and that is an easy thing.
And if the dislocation is in any knot of the back of the foot, then you must have the patient sit on a level place or on a completely straight table, and place your foot on what is visible of those joints, then press firmly with your foot until it returns;
and when it is even, and nothing appears there, then place a two-legged table under the sole of the foot, then bind it tightly, and leave it for three days, then unbind it; and make him rest until he is healed.
of wound and dislocation together
When a wound occurs with the dislocation, and one wants to restore it, many times it happens that the patient dies:
so do not be presumptuous in the treatment, if you are not wise in the art and you have not practiced it for a long time, and if you are not patient and merciful and slow, not rash;
and use at the beginning of things soothing warm poultices, and leave the patient in God's hands, if you see no hope of health; and when you see hope, then immediately restore the limb to its place, before the warm poultices arrive there;
and when the limb is in place, then administer soothing warm poultices, and treat the wound, as is appropriate, with drying ointments;
and if with the dislocation there is a fracture, and small bones separated, then remove them, and do what we have said in simple illnesses;
and guard yourself from entering a path of fear, according to what I have said, for that is worth more to you according to your Creator, and for the salvation of your soul and your body.
