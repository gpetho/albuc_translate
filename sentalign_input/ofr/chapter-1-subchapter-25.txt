On the dislocation of the shoulder
When the head of the shoulder is dislocated due to moisture, and it is reset but cannot stay in place, repeatedly dislocating with slight movement as we have experienced, then you must first reset the dislocation.
After, the patient should be laid on their back and on their side; then lift the core which is within the armpit with the fingers of your left hand; and if the joint is dislocated inwards, heat the cautery which has two prongs of which here is the form:
and cauterize the core until it pierces through to the rib, and the mark of the cautery would resemble four cauteries; and therefore, cauterize with the cautery which has three prongs, whereby the marks of cauterization are six cauteries; and the prongs are the thickness of a tent and this is the form of the cautery which has three prongs:
And sometimes another prong is added to this, whereby there are eight cauteries.
Then apply crushed leeks with salt onto the cautery; then let the patient rest, and the limb should not be moved for a long time until it is well strengthened.
And if it is dislocated upwards, which happens rarely, then apply cautery on the thick part of the collarbone, with many cauterizations by pricking.
For the joint is closed, and the moisture is removed and the patient is healed.
