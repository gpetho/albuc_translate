CHAPTER SEVENTY-TWO.	Chapter 72.	0.6049656
This condition is when a woman's pudenda have no opening or have only a tiny opening; it may be either congenital or acquired.	Alratica is a condition where a woman’s vulva is either imperforate or has a very small opening. It is either congenital or acquired.	0.7182147
The acquired sort is due to some preceding disease; either to a fleshy growth or to a membrane, thick or thin. It may be in the fundus of the uterus or in its walls or in the upper part or in the lower part; and it prevents intercourse, conception, and delivery; it often also hinders the menses.	The acquired form results from a previous ailment and may occur due to excess flesh growth or a membrane that is thin or thick; it may occur deep within the womb, on its sides, at its upper part, or lower part, and it obstructs intercourse, impregnation, and childbirth, and sometimes even menstruation.	0.90375555
This is recognized by inspection by the midwife, if the obstruction be obvious and low.	Diagnosis is made by a midwife’s examination if the obstruction is visible and close.	0.7518134
But if it be not visible she should palpate with her fingers or with a probe.	If it is not visible, then seek it out with your fingers or with a probe.	0.8338375
And when the obstruction is due to a thin membrane near the labia you should lose no time in breaking it down.	If the obstruction is due to a thin membrane and is close to the labia, then proceed quickly and rupture it.	0.64708906
This is done by applying some sort of pad to the labia; then put both thumbs upon it.	This is done by placing small cushions on both labia.	0.69694537
The woman should be upon her back with her legs spread wide apart; then the labia are to be stretched strongly till the thin membrane is ruptured and the obstruction is laid open.	Then place the index fingers of both hands together, while the woman lies on her back with her legs spread. Then extend the two labia firmly until the thin membrane is ruptured and the obstruction is opened.	0.7845705
Then take wool soaked in oil and apply to the place, and let the woman engage in coitus every day lest the place close over.	Next, take some wool, soak it in oil, and place it on the area; let the woman have intercourse daily to prevent the site from sealing again.	0.8202539
If the membrane be thick and strong you should incise it with a broad myrtle-leaf scalpel.	If the membrane is thick and dense, then you must cut it with a broad spatula shaped like a myrtle leaf.	0.86250675
But if the obstruction be due to a growth you should catch hold of it with two hooks and cut it away. And have at hand remedies for allaying haemorrhage without pain, such as acacia and dragon's blood and olibanum, all mixed with egg-white.	If the obstruction is due to excess flesh growth, suspend it with hooks and cut it away, and have on hand medicines that stop bleeding without causing irritation, such as acacia, dragon’s blood, and frankincense mixed with egg white.	0.74338704
Then use a cannula of lead to prevent the wound healing up too quickly. She should keep it in position for some days and employ a bandage of dry linen. Then treat with the usual healing dressings until it heals.	Then insert a broad lead tube to prevent the wound from closing too quickly, leaving it in place for a few days; apply a wick made from dry linen, then proceed with usual wound care until it heals.	0.85993636
Sometimes other growths of flesh arise in the uterus itself; you should cut away in this manner all except cancerous tumours; for a cancerous tumour arising in the uterus is under no circumstance to be treated with the knife.	Sometimes, new flesh growths arise in the womb. These must be excised as described here, provided there is no cancerous abscess; for a cancerous abscess in the womb, surgery with iron should not be performed at all.	0.82465184
