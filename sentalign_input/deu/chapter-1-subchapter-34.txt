Chapter Thirty-Four:
On the cauterization of old hemorrhoids.
When old hemorrhoids are present, or there are thick, cold humors or corrupted humidities, and they are treated as previously described without success, then cauterize with three cauterizations on the lower vertebrae of the small triangular back, and one cauterization above the navel, two finger-widths apart.
If you suspect that the patient's stomach is cold and the food is not digested, and their face appears swollen, then cauterize the stomach with a large cautery as previously described; also cauterize once on the liver, and once on the spleen with a nail-like cautery, leaving the cauterized area open for a while, and treat it until it is healed.
