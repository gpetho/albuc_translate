On the Cauterization of Chronic Tearing.	On cauterization of persistent lachrymation.	0.81479514
When chronic tearing of the eyes is due to manifest veins and arteries on the exterior of the head, indicating cold phlegmatic excesses, cauterize the patient with the same cautery mentioned for the onset of water falling into the eyes, and a cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries on the neck below the two temples, and two cauteries on the neck below the two bones. If additional cautery is needed, cauterize on each side of the eyeâ€™s tail at the end of the eyebrow with a small cautery.	When tears are constantly in the eye and arise on account of the arteries and veins visible on the outside of the head, and you are sure that they are from cold thick phlegmatic superfluities, burn him with the very cautery that I taught for the beginning of cataract, namely, a cauterization in the middle of the head and two on the temples, and two on the back of the neck below the two bones; and, if you are compelled to add more, one cauterization on the side of the outer corner of each eye at the end of the eyebrow, with a small cautery.	0.8688213
