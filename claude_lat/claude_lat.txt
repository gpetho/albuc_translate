Preface.
After I completed this book for you, O Sons, which is the last [book] of medical science with its completion, and I achieved its end through its expositions and explanations, it seemed right to me to complete it for you with this Treatise which is the part about operation, that is, surgery by hand.
Since operation by hand has been laid low in our region, and in our time is entirely absent: until perhaps its science has perished, and its trace has been cut off: and nothing remained of it, except small descriptions in the books of the ancients, which hands have altered: and error and uncertainty befell them, until its purposes were closed off, and its power was diminished: It seemed right to me to revive it with the arrangement of this Treatise according to the way of exposition, and declaration, and abbreviation: and to present the forms of cautery instruments, and other instruments of the work: as it comes from the addition of explanation, and from the hastening of what is necessary.
The reason why a good practitioner of it with his hand is not found in this time of ours, is: because the art of medicine is long, and its author needs to be exercised beforehand in the science of anatomy, which Galen narrated, until he knows the uses of the limbs, and their forms, and their connections, and separation, and has knowledge of bones, and nerves, and muscles, and their number, and their exits, and of the pulsing and quiet veins, and their places of exit.
And because of that Hippocrates said, that the name with the name is much, but with work is little, and especially in the art of the hand.
We indeed have already spoken about that in the introduction of this book.
Since whoever is not knowing what we said about anatomy, cannot avoid falling into error, by which men are killed: as I saw many of those, who are formed of this science, and boast about it without knowledge, and without experience.
Which is, because I saw a foolish physician who cut a scrofulous abscess in a woman's neck, and cut certain arteries in the neck: wherefore the woman's blood flowed, until she fell dead between his hands.
And I saw another physician, who presumed to extract a stone from a man, who had advanced in age, and the stone was large.
He therefore reached it, and extracted it with a piece of the bladder.
Wherefore the man died on the third day.
And I indeed had already been called to extract it: and I saw from the size of the stone, and the condition of the patient, that he would die.
And I saw another physician, who accepted payment from one of the Dukes of our land for medicine: and it happened to a black eunuch, who was with him, that there was a fracture in his leg near the heel: and the physician hastened with his ignorance, and bound the fracture over the wound with cushions, and splints with strong binding, and did not allow the wound to breathe.
Then he released him according to his desires.
Then he left him for several days, and ordered him not to loosen the bandage: and it remained thus until his leg became swollen, and his foot, and came to destruction.
Therefore I was called to him: and I hurried to loosen the bandage: and tranquility followed, and he escaped from his pains.
However, corruption was already confirmed in the limb: and I could not restrain it.
Therefore the corruption did not cease to spread in the limb, until it perished.
And I saw another physician, who pierced a cancerous abscess: and it became ulcerated after days, until its malignancy increased with its owner.
Which is because when cancer is pure from melancholic humor, then one should not approach it with iron at all, unless it is in a limb that can tolerate having all of it cut off.
And because of that, O Sons, it is necessary for you to know that operation by hand is divided into two divisions: namely, operation associated with health: and operation with which there is danger in most conditions.
And I have already warned in every place of this book where an operation occurs in which there is terror and fear.
Therefore it is necessary for you to beware of that and leave it alone: so that fools may not find a way to speak and dishonor.
Therefore take measure with care and protection, and your patients with ease and firmness, and use the better way leading by God's grace to health and praiseworthy success: and leave terrible diseases of difficult healing: and remove your souls from that which makes you fear, lest hesitation enter upon you in your faith and your benefit.
For it is more remaining to your glory, and more sublime in this world, and finally to your measures.
For Galen has already said in some of his admonitions.
Do not treat a bad disease: lest you be named bad physicians.
I have already divided this Treatise according to three Chapters. ¶

Part I.
¶ On the Benefit and Harm of Cautery: and which complexions it suits, and at what time: and whether with iron or gold.
Chapter I.
But Before Indeed I recall operation with it, it is necessary that I speak of the quality of its Benefits, and of its Harms: and in which complexion it should be administered.
I say therefore, that discourse on the quality of the benefit of Cautery, and its harm, is a lengthy discourse, and subtle, a science, and a hidden secret.
Indeed many wise men have spoken about it, and disagreed about it: and for me a little of their discourse suffices, fearing prolongation.
I say therefore, that Cautery is universally beneficial for every complexion that is with matter and without matter: except for two complexions, which are the hot complexion without matter, and the dry complexion without matter.
However, regarding the hot and dry complexion with matter, they disagreed.
For some said that Cautery is beneficial in it.
And others said the opposite of this, namely that Cautery is not suitable in illness which is from heat and dryness: since the nature of fire is heat: and it is unsuitable that a hot and dry illness be cured with something hot and dry.
And he who says the opposite of this said: that through Cautery benefit occurs in every hot and dry illness which happens in human bodies: since when you compare the human body, and its humors, to the complexion of fire, you find the human body cold.
And I indeed say through his discourse: because experiment has already revealed this to me several times.
However, none should attempt this unless they have already been tested and trained in the chapter of Cautery with ultimate training, and has known the diversity of human complexions, and the disposition of illnesses in themselves, and their causes, and their symptoms, and their duration.
Concerning the remaining complexions there is no fear upon you: and especially in cold and wet illnesses.
For all physicians have agreed about these: and they have not disagreed about the benefit with Cautery in them.
And know, sons, that from the secret of treatment by Cautery with fire, and its goodness over Cautery with burning medicine is: since fire is simple, whose action does not reach except to the member that is cauterized: and does not harm another member connected with it, except with small harm.
But the action of burning medicine reaches that which is distant from the members: and perhaps causes in the member an illness difficult to heal, and perhaps kills.
Fire however, because of its subtlety and the goodness of its substance, does not do that, unless it is excessive.
This has indeed become known to us through experiment, because of long service and study with the art, and standing upon the truth of things: and because of that I am excused from length of discourse.
And if it were not that it is not permitted in this book of mine, I would bring you a hidden secret about fire, and the quality of its operation in bodies of its expulsion, by which it expels illnesses with philosophical demonstrative discourse, which would be sharpened by your minds.
And know, sons, that they disagree about the time in which it is suitable to perform cautery, and they place the best time as spring.
And I say that cauterization is suitable at any time: because the harm that occurs due to timing is outweighed by the benefit that is drawn from cauterization.
And especially if cauterization is for pains among necessary, severe, urgent pains, which do not tolerate delay: because it is feared from them that harm may occur which is greater than the small harm entering because of timing.
And do not let it fall into your minds, O sons, that which only the common people and foolish physicians believe, namely that the illness which is cured by cauterization never returns: and they make this a rule, but things are not as they think: because cauterization is nothing but a substitute for medicine, which alters the constitution and dries up the humors which are the causes why pains occur.
However, cauterization surpasses medicine through the speed of its effectiveness, and the power of its operation, and the vehemence of its dominion: and it is possible that the illness may return at some time according to the constitution of the sick person, and the location of their illness, and its strength: and what is prepared in their body from the accumulation of superfluities in it: and what reaches it in its acquisition from foods, and similar things from causes, unless it is an illness in which cauterization is administered.
A subtle illness in a member with few superfluities and humors, like cauterization of a tooth for pain, and similar to it, it is indeed possible that that pain may not return in it.
But this happens in few cases.
But again the saying of the common people, that cauterization is the last resort of medicine, is a correct saying: not in the way that they intend it: since they believe that there is no cure that helps with medicine, nor with anything else after the setting of cauterization.
The matter is actually contrary to that, and the intention that cauterization is the last resort of medicine is nothing but that when we administer modes of treatment in any of the illnesses, and those medicines do not help: then we administer cauterization at the end of the matter, and it helps: then from this it follows that cauterization is the last resort of medicine, not according to the intention which the common people and many foolish physicians understand.
The ancients moreover said that cauterization with gold is better than cauterization with iron: and they did not say that except because of the evenness of gold, and the sublimity of its substance: and they said that the site of cauterization does not produce pus.
But this is not absolutely true: since I have already tested it, and found that it does not do that in certain bodies as opposed to others.
And cauterization with it is good, and better than with iron, as they said.
However when you heat the cautery in fire made from gold, it is not clear to you when it is heated according to the amount that you want, because of the redness of gold: and when cold hurries to it, and if you increase the heating upon it, it melts in the fire, and turns into sheets.
Therefore the practitioner falls from it into occupation: and because of that cauterization with iron among us is quicker and closer, from correctness to operation.
And I indeed have already arranged this Chapter on Cauterization, according to chapters: and I arranged them from head to feet: so that they might ease for the seeker that which he wants from it.
¶ On the method of cauterizing the Head at the coronal suture.
Chapter II.
Here cauterization helps against the dominion of humidity and coldness over the brain: which two are causes of headache, and abundance of fluid flow from the head to the parts of eyes and ears, and abundance of sleep, and tooth pain, and throat pain: and universally every illness which occurs from coldness, like paralysis, and headaches, epilepsy, and apoplexy, and similar things from illnesses.
The method of cauterization is that you should instruct the sick person: that they should be evacuated first with purgative medicine cleansing the head for three nights, or four, according to what the strength of the sick person requires, and their age, and their custom.
Then command him to have his head shaved with a razor.
Then have him sit squarely before you, such that he has placed his hands upon his chest.
Then place the base of your palm above the bridge of his nose between his eyes.
Wherever your middle finger reaches, mark that spot with ink.
Then heat the Olive-shaped Cautery: of which this is the form.
Then place it on the spot marked with ink, descending with your hand gradually restrained, and rotate it.
Then lift your hand quickly, and examine the spot.
If you see that a portion of bone the size of an alkiel or a zeuherb has been exposed, then lift your hand.
And if not, repeat with the same iron, or with another if it has cooled: until you see the bones I told you about.
Then take some salt, and dissolve it in water, and soak cotton in it, and place it on the spot: and leave it for three days.
Then place cotton soaked in butter on it, and leave it on the spot until the fire scab is destroyed.
Then treat it with tetrapharmacon ointment until it heals.
They have said that the longer the wound remains open, the more pus it releases: therefore it is better and more beneficial.
And some of them said to cauterize the skin down to the bone: and hold the Cautery until some thickness of bone is burned.
Then scrape away what has been burned from the bone, then treat it.
And others say that one should proceed with the cautery to the ultimate point, until it makes a strong impression in the bone, so that the bone falls away, which becomes like the form of a carat: or the instrument that women use with a small alphabet infusion: and they believe that vapors of the head are expelled from this place, and the wound should be left open for a long time.
Then it should be treated until it consolidates.
However, these two types of Cautery do not seem to me at all except in certain people by way of fear.
And leaving it alone, in my opinion, is better for their safety.
For the head is weakened by the breaking of its natural continuity: as we have witnessed in other limbs: and especially when the patient's head is naturally weak: and indeed the first species of Cautery is safer and better in my opinion, and I use it: therefore operate with it safely.
¶ On the method of cauterizing the head for pain in the whole head.
Chapter III.
When chronic pain occurs in the whole head: and it persists in the patient, and he uses hieras, and cochias, and head purgatives, and oils, and poultices.
And especially if it has already been cauterized with one cautery, which we described, and none of those things helps him: then consider.
For if the patient's head is of strong natural creation, and is not weak, and he experiences severe cold: then cauterize with another cautery slightly below that one.
Then cauterize him over every corner of his head with the cautery, until it passes through the skin, and exposes bone to the quantity we described.
And cauterize him with one cautery at the back of his head, in the place which is called the vessel: and it is the place where the cupping glass is placed: and lift your hand in this, and do not expose the bone.
For the patient experiences because of that severe pain, different from the pain of all other cauteries of the head.
And I will discuss this Cautery in its place: and it is necessary that the cautery, with which the corners of the head and its back are cauterized, be more subtle than the cautery with which the middle of the head is cauterized.
And this is its form.
On the method of cauterizing in migraine, both with burning medicine and with iron.
Chapter 4.
When pain occurs in part of the head and migraine, or the pain extends to the eye, and it is evacuated with medicines that cleanse the head, and the remaining treatment that I mentioned in the division of diseases is administered, and all that does not help: then cauterization in it is according to two methods: either cauterization with sharp burning medicine or with iron.
Cautery with sharp burning medicine is when you take one clove of garlic, and peel it, and cut off its ends from both sides.
Then cut the site of pain at the temple with a broad lancet, until there is a space under the skin in which the clove can be held.
Therefore insert it under the skin until it is hidden: then bind it with a compress with appropriate pressure, and leave it for about fifteen hours then loosen it, and remove the garlic, and leave the wound for two or three days: afterward place cotton soaked in butter on it, until the site produces pus: then treat it with ointment until it heals.
And if you wish, do this with certain burning medicines, which I wrote about in the twelfth treatise, concerning burning Medicines.
But its cauterization with iron is according to this method.
Heat the Cautery, whose form is this.
And it is called Clavilis: because the form of its head is like the form of a nail, in which there is some curvature, and in its middle there is a small protrusion.
Then place it on the site, and hold your hand steady: and rotate the iron gradually with speed: and let the amount that is burned of the thickness of the skin be about half of it.
And lift your hand, so that the artery which is below is not burned, and bleeding occurs.
Then soak cotton in salt water, and place it on the site, and leave it for three days: then place cotton with butter: afterward treat with ointment until it heals.
And if you wish, cauterize this migraine with the second knife-like end of the Cautery.
And beware of cutting the artery in this migraine, especially if not chronic.
On the method of cauterizing in chronic migraine.
Chapter 5.
When you treat migraine with what we mentioned from the preceding treatment, and what we mentioned in the division of diseases, and the treatment does not help: and you see from the disease that what we mentioned from the first cautery with medicine or with cautery with fire is not sufficient, then it is necessary that you heat the knife-like Cautery until it becomes white after you mark the site of pain with a line whose length is half a finger or thereabouts: and lower your hand once, and press it until you cut the artery and reach the bone.
However, it is necessary for you to beware of the continuity of the jawbone, which moves during chewing, lest the side or the nerve that moves it be burned, whereupon spasm occurs.
And be on guard and cautious about the bleeding of the artery which has been cut.
For in cutting it there is danger, especially for one who is ignorant of what he is doing, and is not studious nor experienced: and abandons the operation with it at first.
And I will come with the remembrance of the management of bleeding occurring from the artery according to its method, and in its place in this book.
But if you see from the disease that this Cautery is not sufficient for it, and you see the body of the patient tolerating cautery in the middle of the head, as we narrated, treat the wound until it heals.
And if you wish, administer the Cautery which we mentioned in the chapter on extraction of the artery with the Cautery having two knives.
For it is better cauterization than this and more beneficial.
On the method of cauterization for ear pain.
Chapter 6.
When pain occurs in the ear from cold, and is treated with solvents, and the remaining treatment which we described in the division, and the pain is not removed, then cauterize with fire: and this is what is called the Point, whose form is this.
Then puncture with it after heating it around the entire ear, as it revolves: or around both, if the pain is in both simultaneously.
And distance yourself with the cautery from the root of the ear a little, after you have marked the places with ink: and let the amount of cauterization be ten points in each ear, or thereabouts.
Then treat the areas until they heal.
On the method of cauterization for Facial Paralysis.
Chapter 7.
Facial paralysis which is treated with cauterization is only from the types that occur from phlegm, according to what we said in the division of diseases.
And avoid cauterization of the type that occurs from dryness and spasm of the nerve.
When you treat this type of facial paralysis with hierae [medicines], and head purgatives, and gargles, and your treatment doesn't help, then you should cauterize the patient with three cauteries: one at the root of the ear, and the second a little below from its temple, and the third at the junction of the two lips.
And place your cautery on the opposite side of the affected part.
For the softening occurs only in the part that appears healthy.
And the form of cauterization is that you cauterize with the cautery in line with the upper extremity of the ear slightly below the horn of the head: and another at the temple: whose length should be according to the length of the thumb.
And lower your hand with the cautery until half the thickness of the skin is burned.
And this is the form of the cautery, and it is a type of knife-like instrument, whose form was mentioned before: however it is not much more subtle than it, as you see: and the knife in it should be slightly more thick than usual.
Then treat the areas with what was previously mentioned: until it heals.
On the method of cauterization in chronic Apoplexy.
Chapter 8.
When apoplexy becomes chronic, and you treat it with what we mentioned, and your medication doesn't help, and the patient doesn't have fever, then cauterize him with four cauteries above every horn of his head, and a cautery in the middle of the head, as we said, and a cautery in the back of the head, according to what preceded: and let the method of cautery be according to what preceded.
Also cauterize with a cautery above the mouth of the stomach: and this is most ultimate.
Then let it be treated with what preceded.
On the method of cauterization for Memory Loss.
Chapter 9.
First, the patient should be given great hierae to drink, and pills that purify the brain.
Then shave the patient's entire head, and place on his occiput the mustard plaster described in the treatise on plasters: and apply it several times.
For this is a method of cautery: and do it according to the same order that I described there.
If therefore he is healed by that, it is good.
If not: then make three cauteries in the posterior part of his head, which should descend from the upper part of the head to the lower part of the eye: and place between each cautery the thickness of a finger.
Then treat the cautery with what preceded.
But if you want an addition, and the patient can tolerate it: then make him a cautery in the middle.
And if you want an addition: then cauterize him above the two horns.
Then treat him until he heals: and let the cautery be olive-shaped according to the form which was mentioned before.
On the method of cauterization in Paralysis and softening.
Chapter 10.
You should proceed in purifying the head with hierae, and with what we mentioned.
Then shave the patient's head: afterward cauterize him with a cautery in the middle of the head, and a cautery above every horn of the head, and a cautery above its posterior part, and three above the vertebrae of the neck.
But if you need more than those in the disease of softening of the body, and the patient can tolerate it, and the disease is severe: then cauterize him with four cauteries above the vertebrae of the back, and finish with the cautery, until most of the skin is burned, and lift your hand.
Then treat him until he heals: and thus the olive-shaped cautery.
On the method of cauterizing in Epilepsy.
Chapter 11.
An epileptic person should not be cauterized, except one whose epilepsy is from phlegm.
Therefore it is necessary that you first cleanse their brain with hierae [herbal medicines], and with the remaining treatment which we mentioned in the division: when the patient is grown, or is tolerant in accepting medicines.
If however it is a child, who does not tolerate medicines, then administer gargling, and chewing substances that cleanse the brain, before that for many days with improvement of foods.
Then shave their head, afterwards cauterize it with one cautery in the middle of the head, according to what was previously described in the method: and with another cautery at the back of the head, and over every corner of their head with a cautery.
But if the patient is strong, and is tolerant, then cauterize them with the cauteries which I described for one having paralysis and softening of the body over the vertebrae of the neck and vertebrae of the back: and let the cautery be olive-shaped according to the method which preceded.
If however the patient is a child, then apply a fine cautery, according to this method.
On the method of cauterizing in Melancholia.
Chapter 12.
When the causes of melancholia are corrupt humidities and thick phlegm, then cauterize them with the cauteries which we described for one having paralysis.
And if the cause of melancholia is an excess inclining to melancholy, and the patient's body is moist, then give them to drink what will cleanse their brain, according to what preceded in the division: then shave the patient's head, and afterwards make a properly made circular pad from linen, like a circle.
Then place it in the middle of the head: and let the patient sitting square be held from all sides.
Then present the liniment.
And it is most worthy from old sheep's butter.
And heat it over fire with moderate heating to a measure which a finger tolerates when it is inserted into it.
Then empty it in the middle of their head in a circle, and leave it until it cools.
Do that to the patient once every week, with the rest of their good regimen, until they are healed.
Or if you wish, cauterize them making many small points, beyond which you do not hold the hand with the cautery: rather let it be by sensing.
For this type of cautery moistens the brain with its quality.
Then place cotton soaked in butter or chicken fat over it.
On the method of cauterizing in water descending to the eye [cataract].
Chapter 13.
When the beginning of water in the eye becomes clear to you through the signs which I mentioned in the division, then begin and give the patient to drink what will cleanse their head.
And guard them from all moistures, and make them sit in the bath, fasting for some days.
Then command them to shave their head, and cauterize them in the middle of their head.
Then cauterize them over the two temples with two cauteries, if it is the beginning of water descending in both eyes together: or from one side, if it is the beginning of water in one eye: and cut with the cautery all veins and arteries which are under the skin: and let the cauteries in it be long in the width of the temples: and beware of blood flow.
But if you see any of it, then cut it off immediately with whatever medicine is possible: and I will come with wisdom, which is in the extraction of arteries, and cutting them, and caution against blood flow.
And sometimes it is cauterized in the neck, under the two bones, with two cauteries ultimately produced.
On the method of cauterizing in Ancient Tears.
Chapter 14.
When the tears of the eyes are ancient, constant: and are over veins and arteries which are manifest externally on the head, it is verified that this is from cold, phlegmatic superfluities: then cauterize with the same cautery that I narrated in the beginning of descending water, with a cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries over the two temples, and two cauteries in the neck under the two bones.
And if you need addition, then cauterize them on every side of the eye cavity, over the extremity of the eyebrow with a small cautery.
On the method of cauterizing for foul smell of the Nose.
Chapter 15.
When you treat it with what we described in the division, and the treatment doesn't help: then hurry, and give the patient to drink for three nights: then shave his head, and cauterize it with a medium cautery, using an olive-shaped cautery.
Then cauterize it with a nail-shaped cautery using two cauteries, above the two eyebrows slightly under the hair.
And be careful of the artery, lest you cut it.
And this is the form of the nail-shaped cautery.
On the method of cauterizing for laxity of the Eyelid.
Chapter 16.
When the eyelid of the eye becomes lax from illness or moisture: then cauterize the eyelid with one cautery, using this crescent-shaped cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize it above the two eyebrows slightly with two cauteries on each side: and let them be distant from the two temples: and let the length of each cautery be according to the length of the eyebrow: and do not extend your hand with the cautery, but rather according to the amount that burns a third of the eyelid.
And this is the form of the cautery according to this method of the crescent-shaped cautery.
On the method of cauterizing the Eyelid when hairs turn inward pricking the eye.
Chapter 17.
Cauterization in this case is according to two methods: either cautery with fire: or cautery with burning medicine.
In cautery with fire, instruct the patient beforehand to let his hairs grow, if he is among those who trim them, until they become long and even.
If however they prick him at their growth: then bind his eyes with a band, so they don't move, until they grow.
When therefore they grow and become even, then place the patient's head in your lap: then mark on his eyelid with ink, a mark that should be in the shape of a myrtle leaf: and let the beginning of the mark be near the hairs.
Then place cotton soaked in egg white: or in psyllium mucilage over the eye.
Then heat the cautery, whose form is this.
Then cauterize over the figure which you marked gradually in many passes, until the surface of the skin is burned, which is like the figure of a myrtle leaf, all visible specifically.
And the sign of the success of your work is: that if you see the eyelid of the eye has contracted, and the hairs raised at the point where they prick the eye.
Therefore lift your hand then: and leave it for three days.
Then place Cotton with butter on it, until the scab falls off.
Then treat it with ointment until it heals.
But if any of the hairs return after a while, and the eyelid becomes lax: then repeat the Cautery over that place, as you did at first.
If however the hairs are in the lower [eyelid]: then cauterize it, until it rises to its natural place: and becomes even so that the hairs don't prick the eye.
On the method of cauterizing with burning medicine in the same case.
Chapter 18.
It is that you should instruct the patient to let the hairs grow until they become long and even.
Make from paper or cloth the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Then take of known soap and of unslaked lime, of each one ounce or thereabouts: then grind them together with good grinding, and do this quickly, so that it does not cool.
Then spread this over the paper which you made in the shape of a myrtle leaf, and place it over the eyelid of one eye, or both.
And place under the eye cotton soaked in egg white: and let the patient's head be in your lap.
And place your index finger over the medicine, and press it slightly.
And move it whenever the patient feels the stinging of the medicine: for its stinging feels like fire.
While therefore the stinging that he feels persists, then leave the medicine, and move it with your finger.
When therefore the stinging subsides, then remove the medicine, and wash the eye with water.
And observe then, if you see the eyelid rising, as it rises during contraction with fire, or with incision, it is good: and if not, then repeat with the medicine over the same place, where the medicine did not make an impression, and did not blacken, until your operation is even, and the eye contracts.
Then place upon it cotton with butter, until the burnt skin is removed.
Then treat it with diaphinicon ointment, or another, until it heals.
And it is necessary for you during the operation to guard with utmost care, lest anything from the medicine falls into the eye.
But if the eyelid softens after days, and some of the hairs fight in the eye, then repeat the medicine over that place which is softened from the eyelid specifically, as you did at first.
Then treat it until it heals.
And this is the shape of the myrtle leaf.
And know that people's eyes differ in size, both large and small.
Therefore according to that should be your consideration: and the path of correctness is not hidden from one who has studied this art.
On the method of cauterizing in lachrymal fistula.
Chapter 19.
When you treat a fistula with what we have described in the divisions of diseases, and your treatment does not help: then, it is necessary that you cauterize it according to this method.
Command the patient to place his head in your lap, and let an assistant hold his head between his hands in such a way that he does not move, nor shake with his head.
Then place cotton soaked in egg white, or in psyllium mucilage over his eye: then heat the cautery, whose shape is this.
Let it be hollow, like the shape of a vulture's feather quill at one end, with which the cauterization is done: and if you wish it may penetrate to the other end, and if you wish it may be held up thus.
However, this hollow one is better for your work.
Then squeeze the fistula, if it is open, and extract the pus from it, and dry it: and if it is not open, then open it, and extract its pus.
Then place upon it the cautery, which should be very hot.
And hold your hand with it a little while during cauterization away from the eye, toward the nose, so that your hand does not err, or the patient become disturbed: and you place the cautery in the fat of the eye, and corrupt it.
If therefore you reach in the beginning of your cauterization all the way to the bone, it will be good.
And if not: then repeat the cauterization once, or twice, if you need that: and leave it for three days.
Then place cotton with butter, and treat it with drying ointment, until it heals.
But if forty days pass, and it does not heal: then place upon it sharp corrosive medicine, until the bone is exposed: and scrape it according to what comes in its chapter.
And there is another method of cauterizing a fistula, which some of the ancients have described.
Look to the location of the fistula, and split it open: then place in this split a thin camahan, that is, a thin tube, whose form is this.
And pour into it the quantity of a drachm of melted lead, and hold your hand with the tube with a good grip, and the patient should not move at all, so that the melted lead does not run or reach their eye.
And it is necessary that you place over the patient's eye cotton soaked in egg white, or in water.
For the lead burns the site of the fistula, and heals it with wonderful healing.
If the fistula is healed with what we have described of cautery and treatment, it is good.
And if not, then it is necessary to work on the opening of the nose, and redirect the fistula to the passage of the nose, according to what will come in its own proper place.
¶ On the method of cauterizing in fissures of the Lips.
Chapter 20.
Often fissures occur in the lip, which are called Pili, and especially in the lips of children.
When therefore you treat these fissures with what we have described in the division of diseases, and the treatment is not effective, then heat a small knife-like cautery, according to this form.
And let its concavity be according to the thinness of the knife.
Then place it heated quickly in these fissures, until the cautery reaches the depth of the fissures.
Then treat it with wax salve until it heals.
¶ On the method of cauterizing in fistula of the Mouth.
Chapter 21.
When an abscess occurs in the root of the gum, or in the palate, or in the roots of teeth: then it makes pus, and bursts: afterwards it becomes chronic, and pus runs, and becomes a fistula: then you treat it, and if treatment is not effective, then it is necessary that you heat a cautery according to the size that will fit in the fistula.
Then introduce it heated into the opening of the fistula, and hold your hand, until the heated iron reaches its depth and its end: do this once, or twice.
Then treat it after that with what we have described of treatment until it is cured.
If therefore the discharge is cut off, and it heals, it will be good.
And if not, then it is necessary to expose the area, and remove the corrupted bone according to what will come in its chapter.
¶ On the method of cauterizing in Gums and loosened Teeth.
Chapter 22.
When the gum is softened because of moisture, and the teeth move, and you treat it with medicines, and it is not effective: then place the head of the patient in your lap.
Then heat a cautery, whose form will come after this, so that you place the tube over the tooth: and introduce into it the heated cautery quickly: and hold your hand a little while, until the patient feels the heat of the fire has reached the root of the tooth.
And lift your hand: then repeat the cautery several times, according to what you wish.
Then let the patient fill their mouth with salt water, and hold it for one hour: and spit it out.
For the loose tooth becomes firm, and the softened gum tightens, and the corrupt moisture dries up.
On the method of cauterizing for tooth pain.
Chapter 23.
When tooth pain is due to cold, or there is cold in it, or a worm, and treatment with medicines does not help: then Cautery for it is according to two methods: either Cautery with butter or cautery with fire.
The cautery with butter is when you take cow's butter and boil it in an iron spoon or in a vessel.
Then take cotton and wrap it around the end of a probe.
Then submerge it in the boiled butter and place it quickly on the painful tooth, and hold it until it cools: then repeat this several times, until the power of the heat reaches the root of the tooth.
And if you wish, submerge wool or cotton in cold butter, and place it on the aching tooth: and place a heated iron over it, until the heat reaches the depth of the tooth's cavity.
The cauterization with fire is when you use a bronze tube or an iron tube.
And there should be some thickness in its body, so that the sharpness of the fire does not reach the patient's mouth.
Then heat the Cautery, whose form will come: and place it on that tooth: and hold your hand until the Cautery cools.
Do this several times, for the pain will be removed either on that same day or another day.
And in the application of that Cautery, the patient should fill their mouth with good butter and hold it for one hour: then spit it out.
And this is the form of the Cautery.
Cauterize with whichever end you wish according to what is possible: and this is the form of the Tube.
On the method of cauterizing Scrofula.
Chapter 24.
When Scrofula is from phlegm and from cold humors, and they are not responsive to digestion through medicines, and you want their digestion quickly: then heat a hollow Cautery, whose form is this.
Having two open ends, so that smoke may exit during Cautery from the other end: and place it heated on the abscess once, and a second time if you need it, until it reaches the depth of the abscess.
If the abscess is small: then apply the Cautery according to the size of the abscess.
Then leave it for three days, and place cotton soaked in butter on it, until what the fire burned is removed.
Then treat it with tooth ointment until the form of the tube heals.
On the method of cauterizing for hoarseness of voice and constriction of breathing.
Chapter 25.
When humors overcome the pulmonary canal, and especially when this is with coldness of complexion, then it is necessary that the patient first be evacuated with purgative medicines.
Then cauterize them in the depression at the root of the throat: and be careful not to reach the throat with the Cautery, nor in the skin, except a little of it.
Then cauterize them with another cautery at the joint of the neck at its last vertebra finally: and let the Cautery be nail-shaped according to the method that preceded.
Then treat them with what preceded until they heal.
On the method of cauterizing in diseases of the Lungs and Cough.
Chapter 26.
When Cough and disease of the Lungs are from cold humors, and the patient does not have fever, nor consumption, and the disease is chronic: then cauterize them with two cauteries above the collarbone in depressed, smooth, empty places.
And with another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two breasts: and let the cautery be tube-shaped according to the form that preceded.
And if you wish, let your cauterization be by puncturing with the cautery which is called Point, whose form preceded in the puncturing for ear pain: and let the points be from thirty points up to about others.
Then treat them with what preceded until they heal.
And now let there be a cautery having three branches: according to this form.
Whereby cauterization is made easier, when you make with it three Cauteries at once.
On the method of cauterizing in the Armpit, in dislocation of the Humerus.
Chapter 27.
When the head of the humerus is dislocated due to humidity, and is not fixed at the time of its return from its dislocation, until this becomes a habit of returning, then it dislocates from a small motion that occurs as we have already testified, then it is necessary that you first reduce the dislocation.
Then let the patient lie on his back, or on his healthy side.
Then lift the skin, which is in the inner Armpit upwards with the fingers of your left hand: and if the joint dislocates inward.
Then heat a Cautery having two prongs.
Whose form is this.
Then cauterize the skin, until it penetrates it to the other side, and the figure of cauterization will come with four cauteries.
And sometimes cauterization is done with a cautery having three prongs, whereby the figure of cauterization then becomes six cauteries: and the prongs are according to the thinness of the probe.
And this is the form of the cautery having three prongs.
And sometimes one is added above this method, whereby there are eight cauteries.
Then place crushed leeks with salt over the cautery.
Then have the patient remain still, so that the limb does not move for some time, until it strengthens.
And if the dislocation is upward, and this rarely happens, then cauterize it above the shoulder with a nail-shaped cautery, or with many cauteries by puncturing.
For the joint becomes firm, and humidity is removed: and the patient is healed.
On the method of cauterizing the Stomach.
Chapter 28.
When cold and many humidities occur in the Stomach, until they draw it from its complexion, and catarrhs multiply to it, and you have tried continuous modes of treatment, and it does not help: then it is necessary that the patient lie on his back, and extend his legs and his hands.
Then cauterize with three cauteries, a cautery below the breast bone the measure of one finger with a nail-shaped cautery, and two cauteries below from the two sides of one cautery, until the figure of the cauteries becomes triangular.
And separate between both so they do not join when they make pus.
And let the depth of the cautery be the measure of two-thirds of the thickness of the skin.
And let the figure of the cauteries be according to this form without addition: and if you wish cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form: and let the cautery by which this is done be one according to the figure of a circle according to this form.
And the stomach is cauterized by puncturing for one who is terrified of this cautery: and it is, that you mark upon the stomach points according to the quantity that you wish with ink: then cauterize it with a point cautery: then treat it with the treatment which preceded until it heals.
On the method of cauterizing a cold Liver.
Chapter 29.
When pain occurs in the Liver from coldness and humidity, or from thick windiness, until it departs from its natural complexion in excessive departure, and the patient is treated with what we have said, and it does not benefit in that: then it is necessary that the patient lie on his neck, and you mark with ink three cauteries according to this figure, and this same quantity over the Liver below the hypochondria, where the elbow of the person reaches: and let the space that is between every cautery be according to the thickness of a finger: and let the cautery be straight according to the length of the body: and do not press your hand with the cautery much.
And let the quantity of what is burned from the thickness of the skin be the quantity of half of it not added: and let the patient be standing on his feet.
If however he is not standing, then let him be lying, who has already extended his legs and raised his arms.
This is the form of the cautery.
And it is indeed possible for you to cauterize these cauteries with a knife-shaped cautery, when you have subtlety and prudence in the art.
And guard yourself, that you do not proceed ultimately in cauterization, and the thickness of the whole skin is burned, whereby the whole body is burned, and it reaches to the intestines: since the skin there is thin, know therefore that.
¶ On the method of cauterizing liver abscesses.
Chapter 30.
When an abscess occurs, and you want to know if that swelling is in the liver tissue or in its membrane: then if it is in the liver tissue, the patient is seized by pain and heaviness without sharpness; and if it is in the liver membrane, there is severe sharpness with the pain; and you see that its treatment has already exhausted the physicians.
Therefore, the patient should lie back on their neck.
Then mark the location of the abscess with ink; then heat the cautery that resembles a rod.
And this is its form.
And cauterize with it one cautery until the whole skin is burned and reaches the peritoneum, until all the pus comes out; then treat it with the treatment for abscesses until it heals.
And one should not use this type of cautery unless one's study in the medical art has been prolonged, and through whose hands these illnesses have occurred with some experimentation; only then should one dare to perform such an operation.
But to leave it alone is, in my opinion, better.
¶ On the method of cauterizing in Pleurisy.
Chapter 31.
The ancients spoke of cautery with birthwort roots for cold pleurisy in this way.
That is, take from the dried long birthwort roots one of the longer roots that can be found, and let it be about the thickness of a finger.
Then submerge it in oil and light it in the fire.
Then cauterize with one cautery in the area between the joint of the collarbone with the neck, and with two small cauteries below the guidezi slightly inclined to the part below the beard.
And also with two cauteries in the area between the fifth and sixth rib inclined slightly backward; and another cautery in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach.
And three cauteries from behind: one between the shoulder blades, and two cauteries on the two sides of the chest, below the cautery that is between the shoulder blades.
And you should not press your hand with the cautery, but rather it should be evident on the skin by smell.
And some ancients have said that there are among men those who use an iron cautery similar to a rod: and they heat it and insert it between the ribs until it reaches the abscess itself and the pus comes out, as we said regarding the liver abscess.
But in this perforation with cautery there is the fear that either the patient dies immediately, or a fistula occurs in the place, for which there is no cure.
¶ On the method of cauterizing the Spleen Chapter 32.
When you treat a disease of the spleen with what we mentioned about treatment in the division of diseases, and your treatment does not help, then cautery for it is according to three methods, all of which are correct.
One of which is that you make three or four cauteries in a line according to the length of the spleen following the pattern of liver cauteries, whose form preceded.
And let there be between each cautery the width of a finger, or a little more.
And let the method of cautery be what we mentioned in the liver cautery equally.
And do not press your hand with the cautery: and let the patient lie on their back.
And another method of cauterization is: that you heat a cautery having two prongs, which we mentioned in the chapter on shoulder dislocation: and lift the skin that is in line with the spleen, where the patient's left elbow reaches: and let your lifting of the skin be according to the width of the body, so that the cauteries fall according to the length of the body.
Then insert the two prongs very hot, until you penetrate the skin with them from the other side: then remove the cautery: thus four cauteries are made.
And if you wish, cauterize with another cautery having three prongs.
Then treat the cautery after you let it discharge pus for many days: for it is more beneficial than the other treatments that preceded.
On the Method of Cauterizing in Dropsy.
Chapter 33.
Cauterization is not applicable in dropsy, except specifically in ascites.
When you treat a dropsical patient with the methods of treatment that we mentioned in the classification, and the treatment is not effective, then you should cauterize them with four cauterizations around the navel, and one cauterization over the stomach, and another cauterization over the liver, and a cauterization over the spleen, and two cauterizations behind the back between the vertebrae, and one directly on the chest, and another directly on the stomach: and let the depth of cauterization be close to the thickness of the skin.
Then leave the cautery open, so that it may discharge pus for a long time.
And do not cease treating the patient after cauterization with this: for it is necessary that two intentions be combined for him: and healing will hasten to him with God's help.
The form of the cautery with which the belly is cauterized should be nail-shaped: according to its previous form: and that with which the back is cauterized should be olive-shaped according to its previous form.
On the Method of Cauterizing Feet and Legs.
Chapter 34.
When they swell in a dropsical patient, and are filled with yellow water: you should cauterize over the top of the Foot in the nocrati, which is between the little finger and the ring finger: and lift your hand with the cautery, and do not twist it: then lift your hand: and do not repeat it at all.
For the yellow water will seep out, and let the cautery be according to this form.
Then make two cauterizations on the two legs on each leg, and let the cautery be made with the knife-edge of the cautery: and let the cautery be made along the length of the leg, one below the knee, and the other lower than it, around the middle of the leg: and two cauteries on each hip: and leave the cautery open without treatment for a long time: so that some of the water may seep out: then treat it with the remaining things we mentioned.
On the Method of Cauterizing in Looseness of the Bowels.
Chapter 35.
When there is looseness of the bowels from cold and moistures, until it weakens the retentive and digestive powers, which are in the stomach and intestines: and this is treated with methods of treatment, and is not cured: and you see the patient able to tolerate cauterization of abundant strength, then cauterize them with a large cautery over their stomach, according to what preceded in cauterization of the stomach with a circular cautery, and four small cauterizations around the navel, with a small nail-shaped cautery: and a cautery over the lower back above the sacrum large, or with two cauteries.
And if you see abundant moistures, and the patient tolerating it, then cauterize them with a cautery over the pubic region, and a cautery over each flank: and perhaps you may add two small cauteries over the stomach near the large one.
For it is a beneficial treatment, whose help does not fail.
On the Method of Cauterizing Hemorrhoids.
Chapter 36.
When in the anus there are many old hemorrhoids, or one, and they are from thick, cold humors, or corrupt moistures, and they are treated with what we mentioned in the classification, and the treatment is not effective: then cauterize with three cauteries over the lower vertebra of the back below the coccyx a little in a triangular pattern, and with a cautery below the navel about two fingers' width.
And if you think that their stomach has become cold, and their food is not being digested, and you see their face swelling, then cauterize them over the stomach with a large cautery, according to what preceded: and with a cautery over their Liver, and another over their Spleen, with a nail-shaped cautery: and leave the cautery open for some time: then treat them until they are healed.
On the method of cauterizing althelul (hemorrhoids) after cutting them off.
Chapter 37.
When you cut off the althelul, then heat a cautery that resembles a rod.
Then insert this heated instrument into the cut althelul: and move your hand until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which blood flows: do this once or twice.
If therefore there are many althelul, then cauterize each one with the cautery as we have described.
Then treat them with whatever ointments benefit them until they heal.
And if you cauterize it with a large cautery over the hip, it is most effective in helping.
On the method of cauterizing a fistula in the anus.
Chapter 38.
When the patient does not submit to the incision and procedure which we described in its place, and is frightened of it, perhaps he can be healed with cautery.
When therefore someone develops a fistula, and it becomes chronic, pus flows from it, and corrupted fluids.
Therefore what is most proper is to probe it with a fine probe.
Then determine the depth of it with the probe.
Then heat a cautery which is similar to a rod.
Then insert the heated instrument into the fistula to the same depth that the probe entered.
And repeat the cautery on it until all those corrupted tissues are burned, once, or twice, or three times, according to your need.
And guard yourself from burning a nerve, if there is one there, or a large vein: or if the fistula goes to the body of the bladder, or to the body of the intestine, then guard yourself from all these places.
And do not do this unless the fistula is in a fleshy place: and you think that it is not penetrating.
Then treat the area until it heals.
If however the area seals up, and the discharges cease from it, and it remains so for a long time: then know that it has healed completely.
And if the discharges do not cease from it, then know that it is penetrating, or in its depth there is corrupted bone, or something like that among those things: mention of which will come in its place.
On the method of cauterizing the Kidneys.
Chapter 39.
When pain occurs in the Kidneys from cold, or from thick wind, and because of this the patient's strength diminishes, then you should cauterize him over the back over the kidneys themselves, with a cautery over each kidney with a nail-shaped cautery, mention of which came before.
And perhaps we cauterize him a second time in the same place.
Wherefore three lines will come.
Therefore they will be most effective in helping.
On the method of cauterizing the Bladder.
Chapter 40.
When weakness occurs in the Bladder, and softening from cold and moistures, until the patient cannot retain urine, then cauterize him in the lower part of the abdomen over the Bladder, where the pubic hair begins, and with a cautery on the right side of the abdomen, and another on the left of it: and let the length of that lateral cauterization be according to the size of the thumb joint: and cauterize him with a cautery on the lower back, or with two cauteries, if you need that: and let it be according to what preceded with the nail-shaped cautery.
On the method of cauterizing the Womb.
Chapter 41.
When cold and moistures occur in the Womb, and because of this she is prevented from becoming pregnant, and her menses are corrupted, and their onset is delayed, and pain occurs to her at their arrival, then it is proper that she be cauterized with three cauteries around the navel, as we said in the cauterization of the bladder, and with a cautery over the hip lower on the back, or with two cauteries: and let it be a nail-shaped cautery.
On the method of cauterizing the Hip in dislocation.
Chapter 42.
When mucous humors flow into the hip socket, and become the cause of its exit from its place: and the sign of this is that one leg becomes longer than the other when they are compared: and the site of dislocation is found empty in it.
Therefore you should cauterize the patient on the hip socket itself with a circular cautery: after you mark with ink around the socket, as it revolves: and so that the socket itself falls in the middle of the circle.
And let the cautery be of the form that was previously described in the cauterization of the stomach.
If this cautery is not available to you, then cauterize it with three cauteries, using a large olive-shaped cautery: and let the depth of the cauterization be according to the thickness of the entire skin.
Then treat it until it heals.
On the method of cauterizing in Sciatica.
Chapter 43.
When pain occurs in the hip socket, and cold and humors are the cause of it: and the patient is treated with what we described in the division, and the treatment does not help, and it becomes chronic: then you should free the patient from thick humors with foul pills, or with artificial pills, and similar ones.
Then cauterize him.
And the method of cautery in it is according to two modes: either cautery with burning medicines, or cautery with fire.
Cautery with fire is according to many modes.
One of which is that you cauterize above their hip socket with three triangular cauteries, according to this form.
And make them of good depth, or bad.
And let the space between each cautery be the width of a finger: and let the cautery be olive-shaped.
Sometimes the cautery is made in the middle over the head of the hip itself.
Therefore there are four cauteries.
And if you wish, cauterize with a circle, whose form was previously described in the cauterization of hip dislocation, one: so that the circle contains the entire hip.
And burn through the thickness of the entire skin.
This is the method of cautery in Sciatica, when the pain is adhering to the hip itself, and does not extend to the thigh and leg.
But if it extends to the thigh and leg, then cauterize it with two cauteries above the thigh, above the place where the patient indicates there, where the pain is, and with your cautery above the ankle four fingers toward the outer part slightly: and let the cautery be knife-shaped.
And let the depth of the cautery be according to the depth of the skin's thickness.
But if the patient indicates that the pain extends nearly to the toes of the foot, then cauterize there where he indicates with a point cautery, three, or four, or more, if that is needed.
And if he indicates the pain is below the knee toward the leg, then cauterize there with one knife-shaped cautery.
And in all your cauterization, beware that you do not go so far with the cautery as to burn a nerve, or a major artery, and thereby bring upon the patient severe harm, or contraction.
And I indeed have seen one and another, of those who cauterized above the ankle, and went too far in cauterization, and the leg swelled up, until the swelling reached the foot, and it was all perforated, and the whole foot was corrupted: then diarrhea occurred, and death after that.
If the pain is in both parts simultaneously, cauterize both according to this method.
And certain wise men spoke about cauterization of the hip, whose cautery is of this mode.
Make an iron similar to a forceps, whose diameter should be half a palm: and at its opening it should be according to the thickness of a date pit, or a little less: and within that forceps should be a third forceps.
And let the space between each forceps be the size of a thumb joint: and let the forceps be open on both sides: and let their height be about one joint, or two joints: and make them an iron handle properly fitted to the forceps.
And this is its form.
Then let it be heated in fire until it becomes red and throws off sparks: then let it be placed over the hip socket with the patient lying on their healthy side.
So cauterize it with three round cauteries at once.
Then leave it for three days.
Afterwards dress it with butter: and leave the wound open for many days.
Then treat it with ointment until it heals.
Albucasis said, "O my sons, we have used this type of cautery little, because of its terrifying appearance: and because we find few who can endure it.
However, it is among the good cauteries for one who can bear it, and finds relief with it.
The cautery with burning medicines is done thus: you make two curved pieces having a perforated ring, into which descends the hinge of its gate made of bronze or iron, the length of the wall: in their height there should be two knots, or something like them.
And let the space between both be the width of a finger, and let them be open below and above: and let them hold together, according to this form.
Then place it over the hip socket, with the patient lying on the healthy side.
And press your hand firmly over the hip socket.
Then pour between the two circles hot water, which has been heated somewhat with fire, and hold it for about an hour: and let the patient endure its biting and burning, for he will feel a biting like fire, until the biting subsides.
Then lift your hand with the instrument, and clean off the hot water from the entire hip with fresh water: then leave it for three days.
And put butter on it until the blackness of the burn is removed: and leave it for several days, and pus will flow from it.
For this is ultimate in benefit.
Then treat it with ointments until it heals.
If the pain extends to the thigh or leg: make for it a vessel containing water, just as you did for the hip in the same way.
And this is the method of hot water: and I have already written about it in the treatise on the preparation of medicines.
Take alkali and unslaked lime, one part each: grind both and put them in a new pot whose bottom part is perforated with one small hole, according to the size that a rod might enter it: and place under the bottom of the pot another glazed pot: and pour over the alkali and lime sweet water that covers both by a finger's width: after you compress them well with your hand: and leave the pot until the sharp water descends to the lower part of the glazed pot.
Then collect all that water and pour it over other lime: and strain until it is renewed.
For it will then be of very strong sharpness, which is used in many medical operations and in cauterization of other limbs.
Because it produces the effect of fire itself.
And among the medicines with which the hip is cauterized are also like euphorbias, and cashew honey, and lime with soap, such that both are mixed. ¶
And Galen indeed reported in narration a certain ancient man's cure, by which hip pain and sciatic vein were treated: and he greatly praised its effectiveness.
And he said that he needed no other treatment, and that he was cured in one session, until he reported that he perhaps entered the bath carried and left it already healthy.
And it is thus: take green seitaragi: and if green is not found, take dry, fresh: and grind it well with some fat, and place it on the hip where there is pain, or leg, or in the thigh: and bind it, and leave it for about three hours, or for the time until the patient feels relief from the burning.
Then bring him into the bath.
When therefore his body becomes dewy, put him in the tub.
For the pain recedes, and he is healed.
And know that no one should use cautery with these medicines except after evacuation of the body.
And Dioscorides indeed said that when goat dung is used to cauterize the sciatic vein, it helps it: and the cauterization is done in this way.
Take wool, and soak it in old oil, and place it over the deep spot which is between the toe of the foot and the shin bone, and is closer to the shin bone.
Then take dried goat dung, and inflame it in fire until it becomes charcoal.
Then place it on the wool, and leave it until it is extinguished.
Then repeat that.
Do not cease doing this until the sensation reaches through the middle up to the hip, and the pain subsides.
And this method of cautery is called the Bovine cautery.
¶ On the cauterization of Back pain.
Chapter 44.
Sometimes pain occurs in the Back from many causes, either from a fall, or from a blow, or from excessive evacuation, and similar things, from the infusion of cold and wet material: and cautery indeed is only applicable in this single type, which occurs from the infusion of cold material.
Therefore after evacuating the patient with foul pills and similar things, it is necessary that three lines be made over the Back where the pain is, according to the width of its medial part, after you mark with ink in every line five cauteries, or more according to the amount that comes from the patient's tolerance of his strength: and let the cauterization be done with a pointed cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauteries, with a medium nail-shaped cautery, according to this form.
¶ On the method of cauterizing at the beginning of Hunchback.
Chapter 45.
This illness often occurs in small children.
And the sign of its beginning in children is: that constriction occurs in their breathing during elevation and movement: and you find in the last vertebrae of the Back and its nodes, that it has already begun to protrude above the other vertebrae.
Therefore when you see that, and you wish to do it, then cauterize it with a cautery that is circular according to this form.
And let the cautery take hold equally over every part of the vertebra: and if you wish cauterize around the vertebra with a point cautery in two or three lines: and let the points be close to each other.
Then treat the area until it heals with what we have mentioned.
And beware, do not apply cautery in hunchback which occurs in nerve spasm.
¶ On the method of cauterizing in Gout and pains of the joints.
Chapter 46.
When joint pains are from cold humidities, which are poured out to any members of the body, then when pains occur in the feet, it is the custom of physicians to name that specifically Gout.
Therefore when Gout of cold cause is treated with methods of treatment, and the pains are not removed, then cautery removes them.
And it is that you cauterize it after evacuation around the joint of the feet, with many cauteries: and let the cautery be Olive-shaped.
This is its form.
And if you need to make points on the surface of the foot, then do it with a point cautery.
But if the pains ascend up to the knees, or other joints, and this often occurs, then cauterize above every knee with three or four cauteries on every side, with this same nail-shaped cautery.
If however more than this cautery are necessary for you, then cauterize it.
And do not submerge your hand with the cautery, rather let it be about the thickness of the skin only.
If however the pains ascend to the knees and back: then administer what we said about cautery in its chapter.
But if the pains are in the hands only, then make points around the arm bones, as two lines revolve.
If however pain remains in the fingers, then make points over every joint a point, and over the back of the hand.
If however the pains ascend after days to the elbows or to the shoulders, then cauterize both on every side.
And do not empty the patient from good regimen, from the receiving of medicines.
For if good regimen is maintained, and phlegm is evacuated, he will be healed with God's help with this cautery.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in Ruptures.
Chapter 47.
When a Rupture occurs in the groin, and intestine or omentum descends to the testicle, and it is in its beginning stages and nearby: then it is necessary that you instruct the patient to stop eating on that day.
And he should use laxatives, by which stool may descend from his belly.
Then he should sit before you on his back: and instruct him to hold his breath, until the omentum or intestine comes out or appears.
Then return it with your fingers, and mark with ink below the Rupture above the pubic bone, with a mark whose end is similar to half a circle toward the upper body.
Then heat the cautery, which is of this form, until it becomes white and throws off sparks.
Then return the intestine or omentum to its cavity.
Then let the assistant place his hand over the spot, so that the intestine does not come out: and you have already opened between the patient's legs, and placed a pillow under him, and another servant is on his legs, and another on his chest who holds his hands.
Then place the cautery on this mark, your hand holding the cautery straight.
And hold it until you reach bone with it: or repeat with it a second time, if you did not reach the bone with it on the first try.
And carefully watch for the exit of intestine during your cauterization, lest you burn it, and through that either death or great harm comes upon the patient.
And know that when you do not reach bone with the cautery, your operation is not effective.
And it is necessary that the cautery for children be thin, according to their size.
Then treat with the remaining ointments until it heals.
And let the patient lie on his back for forty days, until the wound seals.
And it is necessary that you arrange his nourishment throughout the duration of his treatment to be that which loosens his belly: so that the intestine does not come out during straining and defecation.
Then when he wants to rise after forty days, then apply a properly made bandage, and let him keep it for another forty days.
And let him reduce labor, and fullness of food and drink, and violent voices.
For when he follows this regimen, he is thus healed with complete healing.
And I will describe the treatment of Ruptures with incision in its chapter.
When however Ruptures occur in the rest of the belly, and they are beginning, and you wish that they not increase, then cauterize its Rupture with a round cautery according to its size: and let that which is burned be like a third of it.
Then treat it with what we have mentioned: and it will not increase.
And some of the ancients have already said: that the Rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery, according to this form.
After it is marked with ink, and a line is placed which goes across the upper side of the Rupture, and another line to the lower part.
And place your hand in the middle with a nail-shaped cautery.
But the first cautery is easier and better.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in pains due to falls or blows.
Chapter 48.
When pain occurs in certain limbs from a fall or blow: and that pain persists for a long time, and treatment with medicines is not effective: then it is necessary that it be cauterized with a Point cautery.
And let the cautery of each limb be a cautery according to its size and its smallness, and its weakness and its strength, and the location of the twisting and pain in it.
If therefore it heals from the first cautery, it is well.
If not: then repeat the cautery on it.
For it is the habit of these pains to move from one limb to that which is near it.
Therefore it is necessary that you follow them with the cautery until the patient is healed.
On the Method of Cauterizing in Leprosy.
Chapter 49.
Lepers are sometimes helped by cautery with the greatest benefit.
And especially the type of Leprosy which occurs due to putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy: when therefore you wish to cauterize it, consider the following.
If therefore the Leprosy is beginning, and you have treated it with what we mentioned in the division, and it neither descends nor stays: and you fear for the patient that corruption might overtake his entire constitution: then cauterize him on the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the known head, and a second lower towards the forehead near the hairline, and two above the corners [of the forehead], and one behind on the nape of the neck.
And [apply] your hand with the cautery gradually, until it makes a small impression in the bone, and scales are displaced from it: so that the expiration of thick vapors from it is relieved, and also cauterize with cautery over the spleen, according to what was previously stated.
But if the Leprosy has already spread over the patient and appears manifestly: then it is necessary that you cauterize with these cauteries which we mentioned in the head, and with cautery on the tip of the nose, and two cauteries on the two jaws, and two cauteries on the vertebrae of the neck, and six on the vertebrae of the back, and one large one on the coccyx near the tail bone and one above it, in the same sacral region: and two on the hips: namely one on each hip, and two on the knees: one on each knee, and two on the shoulders, and two on the elbows, and two on the tender parts of his chest: and cauterize him on every joint of the joints of his hands and feet: and cauterize on every heel of his feet and the bones of his hands.
And beware of the nerves that are on the back of the heel, so that you do not burn them.
And sometimes it is cauterized with cautery over the pubic bone, and another over the stomach bone, and another over the liver.
And know that the more cautery you add, the greater the benefit and the more helpful it is.
And know that the patient does not feel pain from the cautery as healthy people feel it: because his body has already become numb.
And the cauteries should be of size and smallness according to the limbs and joints: according to what was previously stated about the types of iron instruments.
Then treat the cautery with vetch flour with honey, and the remaining treatment, until it heals.
On the Method of Cauterizing in Numbness.
Chapter 50.
When any limb becomes numb, and is treated with medicines, and oils, and plasters, and does not heal, then cauterize the numb limb itself with cauteries, according to what the size of the limb or its smallness deserves.
And let your cautery penetrate slightly into the thickness of the skin.
Then treat it with ointment until it heals.
And sometimes it is cauterized for certain numbness, which occurs in the hand and foot, in the vertebrae of the back near the exit of the nerves, which move that limb: and the numbness is removed.
But let no one presume to do this unless they are knowledgeable in the anatomy of the limbs and the emergence of the nerves moving the body.
On the Method of Cauterizing in Vitiligo.
Chapter 51.
When vitiligo becomes chronic, and nothing from medical treatments helps in it: then cauterize over it with a somewhat deep cautery, according to the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness is removed and its color changes.
Then treat it with vetch flour and lentils with rose oil, and plantain leaves, and dove's blood, and swallow's blood: of each take one part: mix all these, and spread them on a cloth, and apply to the place until it heals.
On the Method of Cauterizing in Cancer.
Chapter 52.
When Cancer is beginning, and you wish to stop it: then cauterize it with a circular cautery around its circumference, as it revolves.
The wise ones however said to cauterize with a final cautery in the middle.
This does not seem right to me: since I fear that it might ulcerate: and I have already seen this several times.
And it is more correct to cauterize around its circumference with a circle, as we said: or with many cauteries.
On the method of cauterizing in Adubelati.
Chapter 53.
When someone has Adubelati, and it is slow to mature, either due to excess matter causing it, or due to the age of the patient, when he is decrepit with little blood, or due to timing, and you wish to hasten the maturation of Adubelati, then cauterize around its circumference with many small cauteries by puncturing.
Then leave it.
For it will hasten with maturation.
If however you wish to perforate it with a cautery, then heat the cautery, which has this form.
And place it in the middle of the Adubelati, until it penetrates the skin: and let the cautery be from that which the patient follows, so that the flow of pus may be relieved.
Then treat it until it heals.
On the method of cauterizing in corrosive disease.
Chapter 54.
Corrosive disease is nothing but corruption moving in a limb, and it corrodes it: like fire consumes dry wood.
If therefore you see corrosive disease in a place that can tolerate cautery with fire, then heat many cauteries, small and large nail-like ones, according to what is suitable for that place where the corrosive disease is.
Then cauterize it from all sides until you eradicate all corruption, and nothing remains of it at all.
Then leave it for three days, and place ground sulfur with oil over the cauterized areas, until all scabs and all corruption are eradicated.
Then treat it with ointments that generate flesh.
If therefore you see that after three days flesh grows with healthy growth, in which there is no corruption, it is good.
And if not: then repeat the cautery over what remains of the corrupted areas.
And corrosive disease is sometimes treated with sharp medicine.
For it rises in place of the cautery.
However, cautery with fire is of swifter benefit: and I indeed have already spoken about its cauterization with sharp medicine in the division: therefore take it there when you need it.
On the method of cauterizing in Nails and Warts.
Chapter 55.
Many times this illness occurs in the lower parts of the feet: and it is a thick, compacted thing, which harms the foot.
And cautery indeed in these is according to two modes: cautery with fire, and cautery with hot water.
As for with fire, it is that you heat a concave cautery similar to a vulture's feather: which should be made of iron, of such size that it contains the nail from all sides: and it should have thin edges.
Then place it heated over the nail.
Then rotate your hand with the cautery around the circumference of the nail, until the cautery reaches the depth of the nail: and leave it for three days, until it begins to emit pus.
Then plaster it with wild mallows, ground with salt: and leave the plaster on it overnight.
For it will be eradicated from its roots.
Then treat the area with flesh-generating ointment until it heals.
But if they are not converted, and frequently occur on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet: then administer in them cautery with hot water: that is, take a small tube of brass, or iron, or from a vulture's feather: and place it over the nail, or althelul.
Then pour a small amount of hot water into the tube: hold your hand, and rotate it with compression of your hand a little, so that the edge of the tube is impressed in the root of the nail, and the hot water finds a way to the depth, to the root of the nail: and let the patient wait a little over the stinging of the hot water for one hour.
Then leave it, for the nail will be eradicated with its roots.
Do thus with them one after another, until you come upon all of them that are in the body.
Then treat them after they are eradicated, with that which generates flesh from the ointments.
On the method of cauterizing for Tremors.
Chapter 56.
When someone experiences tremors from cold in the nerve, or from quartan fever, or something else: then it is necessary that you cauterize them with four or five cauterizations above the vertebrae of the back, and between each vertebra with a cautery, and on their chest with a cautery, and above their stomach with a cautery.
Indeed, tremor subsides with olive-shaped cautery, and healing of cold illness hastens.
On the method of cauterizing Albathir [pustules].
Chapter 57.
Sometimes foul Albathir appear on the body, that is, pustules, which form from thick corrupted matter.
Therefore it is necessary when they first appear, that they be cauterized above every pustule head with a fine cautery using myrtle wood, whose end is lit with fire.
Or with the root of long aristolochia.
Or with a lentil-shaped cautery.
And sometimes ademenul are cauterized, at the beginning of their emergence according to this method: and they do not increase: and the excess causing them breaks open, and is healed from these.
However, it is necessary that this be done after evacuation through bloodletting.
On the method of cauterizing for blood flow from an artery in a wound.
Chapter 58.
Often blood flow occurs from an artery which is cut near a wound that happens externally, or near the incision of an abscess, or cautery of a limb, and similar things: and it becomes difficult to stop it.
When therefore this happens to someone, then hurry with your hand to the opening of the artery, and place your index finger over it: and press it firmly, until the blood is contained under your finger, and nothing comes out from it.
Then place small and large olive-shaped cauteries, several in number, in the fire: and blow on them until they become very hot.
Then take one of them, either small or large, according to the wound and location where the artery is torn, and place the cautery on the vein itself, after you quickly remove your finger: and hold the cautery until the blood stops.
If it spurts out when you lift your finger from the artery opening, and the cautery cools, then quickly take another cautery from those prepared in the fire.
Do not cease doing this with one after another, until the blood stops.
And take care not to burn the nerve that is there, lest another misfortune befall the patient.
And know that when blood flows from an artery, then it is not possible to stop it: especially when the artery is large, except by one of four methods.
Either with cautery, as we have said.
Or with extraction, when it has not been extracted.
For when it is extracted, its ends contract, and the blood stops.
Or it may be tied with thread in a strong binding.
Or medicines may be placed over it whose property is to stop blood, and it may be compressed with a cushion with proper pressure.
But he who attempts to stop it with bandaging, and tightening with cloth, or placing burning things and similar items, it helps him not at all, except rarely.
If however this happens to someone, and no physician or medicine is present: then let him begin by placing the index finger over the opening of the vein itself, as we have described, and pressing it very firmly, until the blood is contained from the upper part of the wound, and above the artery.
And the finger should not be removed, [but] pour very cold water over it continuously, until the blood congeals, and thickens, and stops.
And meanwhile consider what is needed from cautery or from medicine.
End of Part One.
Surgical Book of Albucasis Part II.
¶ On Incision, Perforation, and Bloodletting in wounds, and similar matters.
We have already spoken in the First Chapter about every illness in which cauterization with fire and burning medicine is appropriate, and its occasions, its causes, and its instruments, and the forms of cauterization.
And I have placed chapters there from head to foot.
And I shall proceed in this chapter in the same way: so that the search may be made easier for the seeker.
And before I begin it, you should learn, O sons, that in this chapter there is as much terror as there is in the first chapter about cauterization.
And because of that it is necessary that caution in it be more vigilant, since in the operation which is in this chapter, many times evacuation occurs with blood, with which life stands, during the opening of a vein, or incision upon an abscess, or opening of a swelling, or treatment of a wound, or extraction of an arrow, or incision for a stone, and similar things: from all of which trembling and fear are associated, and in many of them death occurs.
And I warn you, lest that in which there is hesitation should fall upon you, for sometimes in this art types of men come to you with types of infirmities.
Among them is he who becomes angry with his illness, and death is light to him: because of the severity of what he finds from his infirmity and the length of its malice.
And with the illness there is fear which signifies death.
And among them is he who gives you his wealth, and enriches you with it, hoping for health, while his illness is fatal.
Therefore you should not consent to him who comes to you from among them, whose manner is such.
And let your caution be more vigilant than your desire and your greed.
And do not presume upon anything from that, except after certain knowledge, which verifies for you that to which praiseworthy success leads.
And use in the treatment of all your patients, prognosis and indication of that to which health suitably follows.
For in that there is help for you in acquiring fame and glory, and memory and praise.
May God inspire in you, O sons, His understanding, and not take away from you guidance and inspiration: since that is in His hand.
And indeed I have arranged this Chapter by distinguishing it into chapters, according to what preceded in the chapter on Cautery, from neck to feet: so that the quest which you want from it, and which you need, may be made easier for you.
¶ On the treatment of Water which collects in the heads of children.
Chapter 1.
Know that this illness often happens to children at birth: or when the midwife squeezes the child's head without gentleness.
And sometimes it also happens from a hidden cause which is not known.
And indeed I have not seen this illness in others than in children: and death hastened to all of them whom I saw: therefore because of that it seemed to me better to abandon operation in it.
And indeed I saw among them a child, whose head was filled with water, and the head grew larger every day, until he could not sit up by himself, because of the size of his head: and the moisture increased until he died.
And indeed this moisture either collects between the skin and bone: or collects under the bone over the membrane.
And the operation in that, if the moisture is between the skin and bone, and the swelling is small, then it is necessary that you make in the middle of the head one incision in width: and let the length of the incision be about two knuckles, until the moisture runs out.
And this is the form of the spatula.
If therefore the moisture has increased more, and the swelling is larger, then make these two incisions, according to this form. 
And if moisture is under the bone, and its sign is that you see the sutures of the head open from all sides: and the water is depressed when you compress it with your hand towards the inside, and this is not hidden from you: then it is necessary that you make three incisions in the middle of the head, in this way. 
And after the incision extract all the moisture. 
Then bind the incisions with cloths and small pads. 
Then foment it from above with wine and oil until the fifth day. 
Then loosen the bandage, and treat the wound with probes and ointments. 
And do not cease to bind the head evenly. 
And feed the patient every dry food of little moisture, until the limb is strengthened and healed. 
And another method of incision is that you observe where the size of the swelling appears, and the collection of water. 
Since sometimes it is more in the occiput, or in the sinciput, or on the right, or on the left. 
Therefore ascend with the incision where the swelling and fullness of water appears to you: and cut it according to what is possible for you. 
And observe, lest you cut an artery, and bleeding occurs, and the patient dies from that flow with the evacuation of moisture. 
¶ On the Incision of Arteries which are behind the ears.
Chapter 2. 
When catarrhs occur to someone in the eyes, or in the chest, and this becomes chronic, and treatment with medicines does not help: then the most ultimate treatment in that case is the incision of these two arteries. 
Therefore it is necessary when you wish to cut them, that the patient shave his head. 
Then rub the area with a rough cloth, so that the arteries appear. 
Then let the patient bind his neck with whatever cloth of his. 
Then observe where the vein pulses. 
And the locations of both are the depressed places which are behind the ears: and rarely is it hidden, except in certain men. 
Then mark with ink over both: and cut both with a double-sharp spatula, with an incision reaching to the bone: and let that be done across the width of the head. 
And if you wish, insert the spatula under the artery, and cut it upwards with an incision. 
And let the length of the incision be about two joined fingers. 
For when the vein is cut, blood exits in a pulsing manner, which leaps inward with frequent jumping. 
If however the artery does not appear to observation, then it is necessary that you measure from the ear the space of three fingers. 
Then mark with ink, and cut until reaching the bone. 
And that which is necessary to emit of blood is 6 ounces and perhaps you emit more or less from it. 
All that according to the amount which appears to you from the patient's strength and the fullness of his artery. 
Then attend to the wound. 
Then if anything remains of the membrane at the bone, then cut it, so that a hot swelling does not occur: then bind the wound with linen cloth strips. 
Then treat it with ointment, until it heals.
On the extraction of arteries that are in the temples.
Chapter III. 
When a person suffers from chronic migraine, or acute catarrhs due to sharp humors, and heat in the muscles of the temples, or chronic severe headache, and similar conditions: and when treated with methods of medical treatment, and it does not help: then we have tested in these illnesses the extraction of arteries from the temples, or their cauterization, as we have described. 
And the method of operation in extracting them is that the patient should shave the hairs that are on the temples, and attend to the visible artery in the temple. 
For it shows itself to you by its pulse, and rarely is hidden except in few people, or in extreme cold. 
But if it is hidden from you, then the patient should bind his head with any of his cloth: then rub the area with a rough cloth. 
Or steam the area with hot water, until it appears to you with clear appearance. 
Then take the spatula, which I formed a little while ago. 
Then carefully strip the skin with it until you reach the artery. 
Then insert a hook into it, and pull it upward until you extract it from the skin, and make it free from the membranes that are beneath it on all sides. 
If the artery is thin: then wrap it with the end of the hook. 
Then cut a portion of it according to the length by which its ends separate and contract, and bleeding does not occur. 
For if it is not cut, and if it is not severed, blood does not rise at all. 
Then drain from the blood six ounces, up to three. 
If the artery is large: then you must tie it in two places with a strong double thread, of silk: or with strings of gut, so that decay does not hasten to it before the wound consolidates, and bleeding occurs. 
Then cut off the excess that is between the two ligatures. 
Do that in that hour, or after another hour. 
And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery up to the bone, with a knife-like cautery: until its ends are cut, and it will remain in place of the same operation. 
And it is the better procedure, unless the patient has fever, or is of hot complexion. 
Since cautery is among those things that help to end humidities. 
Therefore it is the better aid. 
And after the extraction of arteries, it is necessary that the place be filled with old cotton: and properly made compresses be placed upon it. 
And after loosening treat with dry medicines, which make flesh grow, and with lint pledgets, until it heals. 
But if meanwhile while you are operating bleeding occurs from the artery, then hasten to stop it with cautery, or to fill the place with vitriol: and press your hand, until the blood stops. 
But if none of those things is present with you, then place your finger over the place, until the blood congeals. 
And bathe the place with very cold water, until the sharpness quiets, and it is bound as necessary. 
And among what is lighter and easier than extraction of the artery, is that you cauterize the vein with this cautery having two knives: and let the sharpness of the two knives be similar to almagdatem. 
However they are of much less sharpness than two knives. 
For if they are sharp, like two knives, cold hastens to both: and they do not cut flesh quickly. 
When therefore there is some thickness in them, the heat of fire is retained in them, and flesh is cut quickly: with this therefore the procedure is better than every procedure, and lighter, and easier. 
And let the space that is between the two knives be the thickness of a finger, after you mark two places with ink: and set both down very hot, until they reach the bone, and cut the vein in two places: so that what is between its ends separates. 
For they do not consolidate at all with this cautery. 
And this is the form of the cautery.
¶ On the treatment of constant acute tear flow from the eyes.
Chapter 4.
When tears are constant, and their flow is from the veins that are on the outside of the skull of the head: and no medical treatment with medicines helps them, and you see the patient's face becoming red, and he feels in his forehead a movement, like the movement of ants: and his eyes are weakened, moist, so that their eyelashes have been eroded with corrosion: and his eyelids are heated from the sharpness of tears: then the ancients needed this operation in treating them, and they called it treatment with the Sword.
And it is that you should order the patient to shave the hair that is on his forehead.
Then make three equidistant incisions in the forehead according to the length of the forehead: and let the length of the incision be about two fingers, and let one incision be parallel to the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second along the length slightly away from the movement of the muscles, and the third on the other side: and beware of cutting the arteries that are on the two sides: and keep your hand away from the connection of the two jaws, and let the space of each incision be the width of three joined fingers: and have a piece of sponge prepared, or many dried cloths, with which to dry the blood.
Then insert a spatula with two sharp ends, whose form follows next.
From the incision which is on the side of the temple, up to the second incision: and scrape with it all the skin that is between the two incisions, with the membrane that is over the bone.
Then do that also from the middle incision up to the second incision.
Then remove this spatula, and insert into the first incision again another instrument, which is called a sharp knife, sharp on one side, not sharp on the other side.
And this is its form.
And place its sharp side toward the flesh attached to the skin, and its smooth side toward the bone: and push it until it reaches the middle fissure: and cut with it all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes: except that the incision should not continue up to what appears of the skin.
Then do that in the middle fissure up to the other fissure.
And after an equal amount of blood has flowed, squeeze the areas to remove pieces of clotted blood.
Then place in every fissure a wick of old cotton, and place over them compresses soaked in wine and oil, or vinegar.
And see that no hot inflammation occurs.
And on the third day loosen the bandage, and apply plenty of infusion with lukewarm water.
Then treat it with basilicon ointment and the other things with which wounds are treated: until it heals.
¶ On the treatment of acute tears and catarrhs to the eyes from the interior of the head.
Chapter 5.
When someone experiences acute, sharp, constant catarrhs: and you see his eyes weakened, small, and their sight has already been weakened: and the eyelids ulcerated, and hairs fall from them, and in the depth of the head there is sharp, harmful pain, and consequent sneezing: then take from these symptoms, that those materials and catarrhs come only from many veins.
And the best treatment for them is this.
And it is that you should order the patient to shave his forehead.
Then make one incision in it in the middle of the forehead, or slightly to the other side across the width, and begin with the incision from the left temple to the right temple: and let the incision be down to the bone: and keep your hand away from the muscles of the temples, which move during chewing: until when the bone is exposed: and you will dry all the blood with a sponge.
Then separate between the two lips of the fissure with old cotton, or with linen wicks.
Then bind over it with compresses: and soak the compresses with wine and oil, so that no hot inflammation occurs.
And when you loosen it, and you see that the hot inflammation has already diminished: then it is necessary that you rub the bone until flesh begins to grow on it.
Then treat it with a drying regimen that makes flesh grow: as if you take two parts of wheat flour, and four parts of colophony: and prepare from them a plaster, and let it be administered for the growth of flesh in these wounds.
On the treatment of what falls into the Ear.
Chapter 6.
Everything that falls into the Ear is one of four types: either a mineral stone, or something similar to stone, like iron and glass; or it is from a plant, like chickpeas and beans; or it is a flowing substance, like water and vinegar and similar things; or some animal. 
When therefore a stone falls into the ear, or a type of stone from those which neither expand nor grow in the ear, expose the Ear to the sun: if therefore you see the stone, then drip into the Ear something from violet oil, or sesame oil. 
Then administer its extraction, and cause sneezing with condisi, and block the nostrils at the onset of sneezing, after you place pieces of cloth or wool around the ear, and stretch the ear upward. 
Many times indeed it comes out with this treatment. 
If however it does not come out, then administer its extraction with Gesti, that is, fine tweezers: whose form is this. 
If therefore it comes out with tweezers, it is good. 
And if not, then administer its extraction with a fine blunt hook of little doubling. 
If therefore it does not come out by that means, then make a tube from bronze, and insert the end of the tube into the ear canal deeply, and block what is around the tube with wax softened with oil, so that there is no path for air except through the tube: then extract with your breath by strong suction. 
Many times indeed it comes out with what we have described. 
If however it does not come out this way: then take from helkalimbat, or from birdlime, that is, prepared glue, with which birds are caught, a small amount: and place it on the tip of a probe after you wrap it with cotton properly positioned: then insert it into the ear canal with care, after you dry the ear from moisture. 
If therefore it does not come out with all that we have described, then hurry to cut, before a hot abscess occurs, or spasm. 
And the method of cutting is that you first bleed the patient in the cephalic vein: and draw blood from him according to the measure of his strength. 
Then have the patient sit between your hands, and turn his ear upward, and make a small incision at the root of the ear near its fatty part in the depressed place there: and let the incision be crescent-shaped, until you reach the stone: then remove it with whatever instruments are possible for you. 
Then sew the incision immediately with speed, and treat it until it heals. 
But if the thing falling into the ear is from one of the grains that grow and swell: then administer its extraction. 
If however it does not yield to you for exit, then take a thin, fine spatula, according to this form. 
And administer with it the cutting of that type of grain which falls into the ear, and do not do that when you think that grain has already been moistened by the vapor of the ear, until you make it into many pieces: then extract them with hooks, or with fine tweezers, or with suction, as we said, for its extraction is made easier. 
For water however which enters the ear, it is necessary that the patient use sneezing with condisi first: and he has already filled his ear with some old cotton: and he is lying on that ear in which the water is. 
If therefore it comes out by that means, it is good. 
And if not: then take many stones, the length of a finger, thin, smooth, and heat them with fire a little, and let the patient insert one of them into his ear canal: and let him hop on one foot on that side, and strike with another stone upon the stone which is in the ear. 
Therefore he should not cease doing that with stone after stone, until all the water comes out. 
And water indeed comes out so that you take from papyrus, or from reed one piece, and insert one end of it into the ear: and light the other end with fire, until most of it burns. 
Then repeat with another reed, and do that many times, until all the water comes out: and extract it with a tube according to what was described previously for the stone.
In extracting small animals that enter it (the ear), if it is of small body, like a flea or similar, treat it as I described in the division. 
But if it is of large body, which is visible to the senses: then perform its extraction with forceps and hooks: and this matter is easier than all things that are held in the ear. 
In extracting a worm generated in the ear, when you treat it with what we described in the division and in the treatise on distillations, and your treatment does not help: then you should examine the ear in sunlight. 
If therefore something appears there from the worms, then extract it with forceps or with fine hooks. 
If however nothing appears there, then take a small tube, which has this form, narrow below, wide above: and insert the narrow end into the ear according to the amount that the patient can tolerate: then suck with it using strong suction. 
Do this many times, until all worms come out. 
If however they do not yield to you for exit, then seal the circumference of the tube with wax, as I said regarding the stone. 
But if they do not come out with what we described: then administer the distillations which the ancients have already tested in killing worms: and you will find that in the treatise on distillations. 
And let your pouring with which you pour oils and medicines into the ear be with this instrument, whose form is depicted here. 
As you see make it from silver, or bronze, narrow below, in which there should be a small opening, wide above. 
Therefore let the plunger which is in the cavity of the tube be made appropriately from bronze. 
And if you wish, take a probe, and wrap cotton at its end with a proper wrapping: then pour the oil, or juice, or whatever you want from these medicines into the tube: and let it be in the ear: then insert the probe with cotton from above, and press it with your hand with moderate pressure, until the oil is forced into the cavity of hearing, and the patient feels it inside: and let that which is poured into the ear be already slightly warmed with fire: and take care that the thing which is distilled into it is not very cold: for medicines do not tolerate that.
On the treatment of blockage occurring in the Ear.
Chapter 7. 
Sometimes certain infants emerge from their mothers' wombs with [ears] not perforated.
And blockage in the ear canal also happens to some people from a wound, or flesh growing in it.
And this blockage sometimes occurs deep in the ear hole, which sight cannot reach: and sometimes it occurs near the exterior of the hole, and sight can reach it.
Therefore that which occurs deep in the ear, and which sight cannot comprehend, is in most cases difficult to cure.
And for that which sight can reach, you should place the patient's ear in the sun, and look into it: then if you see an apparent blockage, open it with a thin spatula, whose form follows here, let its tip have some small width, of which some part should be sharp: and let the rest of the spatula have two smooth sides: so that it does not harm the ear. 
If therefore the blockage is from flesh grown in the ear canal: then hold it with a fine hook, and cut it with careful force, until all the flesh is removed.
But if the blockage is deep in the ear: then take a thin, smooth probe, and heat it slightly with fire: then insert it into the ear canal.
If therefore you sense the blockage with it, which the patient finds with difficulty of hearing, attempt to open it carefully: and beware, lest you wound the ear nerves.
Then place in the ear a lint according to the size of the hole's width, which you have wrapped in Egyptian ointment: do this for several days, until you are assured of the wound's healing.
Or take lint, and soak it in rose water, and sprinkle ground vitriol over it, and use it. 
If you see the ear becoming infected: then you should remove the lint, and replace it with another lint, which you will wrap in a wax preparation made with rose oil, until the hot inflammation subsides: then treat it until it heals.
But if bleeding occurs: then submerge a sponge, or cloths in cold water, and place them over that ear: and use the remaining treatment, which stops bleeding as described in the treatise on distillations. 
On the treatment of warts of the eyelids.
Chapter 8. 
These warts that occur on the eyelids of the eye are sometimes moist, and are dry.
Therefore you should hold them with forceps: or with a hook, and cut them with a spatula from their roots.
Then place ground vitriol over the areas.
But if blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a fine lenticular cautery.
And cauterizing them is better after incision.
For they often return when something remains from their roots.
And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned, and do not return. 
On the treatment of Hailstones of the eye's eyelids.
Chapter 9. 
Often occurs in the eyelids something that resembles Hailstone in its hardness, and its firmness, and because of that it is called Hail: and it is an accumulation of thick moisture in the upper eyelid, and lower eyelid.
Therefore the operation on them is, that you should consider then, if it is Hail proceeding in what appears of the eyelid, and they move to every part, and its matter is easy.
Therefore make an incision over it lengthwise.
Then carefully excise it from all sides until it comes out.
Then suspend it with a hook, and cut it off.
But if its removal is not possible for you, except after you penetrate the eyelid with a small incision, then that harms the patient somewhat.
But if the incision is large: then bring it together with sutures: and treat it until it heals.
And if it is small, no harm will come to you from it.
For ointment restores it, and makes it heal.
And if the hail is declining toward the interior of the ear toward the inner surface, then invert the eyelid, and suspend the hail with a hook: rather than needing incision, and press it from all sides.
But if the eyelid is elongated by the incision, that does not harm in any way.
Then wash the eye after the incision of the hail, with salt water: and treat the area with that which heals, until the patient recovers.
On the treatment of Axirnath of the eyelids.
Chapter 10.
Axirnath is a fatty substance that forms in the layers of the upper eyelid: and indeed it occurs mostly in children: and it weighs down their eyes, and they get catarrhs in the mornings, and they cannot look at sunlight, because tears come quickly to them, and because of this you see them always lying on their faces, and they sleep on them, and their eyelids under the eyebrows are moist, which swelling has already covered: and indeed the prominence of Axirnath is visible to the eye, and when you press the area with your fingers, you feel Axirnath between them. 
And the method of operating on it is that the patient should place their head in your lap. 
Then take a linen cloth, and prepare strips from it, and make from that strip a circle according to the size that contains the Axirnath from all sides. 
Then place it over it, and press with your fingers from all sides, so that the Axirnath gathers in the middle of the circle. 
Then make an incision in the middle of that moisture with a cutting spatula, making cuts across the width, and let the incision not be deeper than what is made in phlebotomy. 
Either it is necessary that you cut the entire skin, until you reach the Axirnath for in many cases the Axirnath comes out of the incision in the form of a piece of white fat. 
Therefore extract it with a cloth, which you have worked between your fingers toward the outside: and you turn your hand to the right and left, until it disperses: and take care not to deepen the incision, lest you reach the eye with the spatula and harm it. 
If however the Axirnath does not appear to you at the beginning of the incision, you should deepen the incision a little bit carefully, until the Axirnath comes out. 
Then extract it, as we have said. 
Then soak cloths in vinegar and water, and place them over the area, and bind it with small cushions. 
And among people there are those who grind salt and place it in the cavity of the incision, so that what remains of that moisture may dissolve. 
Then treat it until it heals. 
If however a hot abscess occurs in the area, then treat it with soothing plasters until it heals.
¶ On the types of Ataxmir of the eye, that is, when the eyelid becomes soft, whereupon it wrinkles in a way it shouldn't.
Chapter XI.
When additional hairs grow in the eyelids beneath the natural hairs and become established: then they harm the eye and cause various types of ailments, such as constant tearing, softening of the eyelids, and white spots, until this becomes the cause of the eye's destruction.
And indeed Ataxmir of the eye is treated in four ways.
Either by cautery with fire.
Or with sharp medicine, according to what was described in the chapter on cautery.
Or Ataxmir is treated by incision and suture.
Or by tubes, according to what I will describe.
It is necessary that you place the patient's head in your lap.
Then turn the eyelid with your left hand.
If therefore it turns, it is good.
And if not: insert a needle with thread from the lower part of the eyelid, and make the needle penetrate through with the thread from above, and let this be near the hairs themselves, that is, near the margin of the eyelid where the hairs grow: and pull the thread upward with the eyelid, and turn it with a probe.
Then make an incision in the inner part of the eyelid under the additional hairs with a cutting spatula from the larger tear duct to the smaller tear duct.
Then remove the thread, and place under the eyelid a small pad of cotton or cloth: then mark on the eyelid with ink a figure like a myrtle leaf.
However, it is necessary that the figure be according to the size and elevation of the eyelid: since this varies among people.
Among them indeed is one who needs to have cut from the eyelid a large amount, according to the amount that has become soft from the eyelid.
Then with the spatula cut along the two lines which you marked, and begin from the larger tear duct up to the smaller tear duct, and let one cut be near the natural hairs, like the thickness of a probe.
Then insert a hook into one of the two angles of the skin.
Then excise all of it.
Then join the two edges with sutures, using a needle and fine wool thread: and wipe away the blood, and make what is excess of the threads adhere above the two eyebrows, with certain sticky substances, if you wish to do this: and if not, don't worry about it.
Then leave the suture and threads for three or four days: afterward treat it.
And if you wish, leave the wound without sutures, and treat it with something that dries and constricts.
For the eyelid is elevated during the sealing of the wound and its joining: but suturing is better.
The ancients taught this method of treating Ataxmir.
However, in it there is concern for the patient, and it is from good practice, and there is no fear in it.
And there is another method also in Ataxmir: and it is that you mark on the eyelid a figure that is like the figure of a myrtle leaf, as we described.
Then elevate the eyelid with three hooks separated or joined, according to this form which follows, then cut what is excess with small scissors, according to this form, with evenness of incision.
If however it is not possible for you to hold the hook, and that is not even: then take a needle with thread, and insert it in the middle of the figure: and insert another thread near the larger tear duct, and a second thread near the smaller tear duct: and gather the threads between your fingers evenly.
Then raise your hand with an even elevation: and elevate the skin over which the cotton is marked, as we described.
Then join the two edges of the wound with sutures: and treat it until it heals.
If however swelling occurs at your incision or your cut: calm that swelling with wax ointment, and similar things, from soothing ointments.
And sometimes it also happens to the eyelid that its hairs turn inward.
Therefore it is necessary that you use in it what we said in incision: but suturing in both cases is more skillful.
On the treatment of Ataxmir with reeds. 
And it is thus: you turn over the eyelid and make an incision in the inner fissure, according to what I have described. 
Then skillfully make two reeds, or two thin pieces of wood: their length should be according to the length of the eyelid, and their width should be less than the width of a spatula: and you have already made cuts in the extremities of both on both sides where you hold the threads. 
Then carefully bring both together over what protrudes from the eyelid, and bind the two reeds tightly on both sides with a strong binding, and leave it for several days. 
For the constricted skin will die, turn black, and rot, until it falls off by itself. 
If therefore it is delayed, then cut it with scissors. 
Then treat it until it heals. 
When therefore it heals, the eyelid is raised: and the hairs do not prick. 
And this is the form of the two reeds, which you will make according to this figure and measurement in length and width. 
On raising pricking hairs in the eye with a needle.
Chapter XII. 
The operation in this case is that you take a fine needle, and insert into it a fine, smooth silk thread. 
Then gather its ends, and tie both with a very fine knot: and let the length of the threads be one palm. 
Then arrange in the Alinxotati another fine thread below it briefly, and tie its ends if you wish. 
Then let the patient place his head in your lap, and let it be near the sun so that the operation is clear: since it is a delicate or minute operation. 
Then insert the needle with the alinxotati into the root of the eyelid, and make it penetrate the eyelid quickly, until you draw it out above the natural hair. 
Then draw the hair up above the alinxotati: and insert into the alinxotati that hair: whether it is one, or two, or three, not more. 
Then pull your hand with it, until the hair comes out with the alinxotati in the eyelid with the natural hair. 
But if the alinxotati is pulled and the hair does not come out with it: pull the alinxotati downward, with the thread that you arranged in it, until the alinxotati comes out from the upper opening, and you see it with your eye: then indeed pull the alinxotati and the thread: and extract both, and close the eye: and leave it closed for two or three days, until the hair adheres to its place, and flesh grows over it. 
But if the hair is short, then either join to it a long hair from the natural hairs, and it is raised with it: or leave it until it lengthens after a time, and then raise it. 
On the treatment of Alxatrati which occurs in the upper eyelid.
Chapter XIII. 
When this Alxatrati occurs in the eye, it is called Leporina (Hare-eye). 
And this Alxatrati is either natural or accidental. 
The accidental therefore occurs from the healing of a wound, or an incision, or a cautery, and similar things to these. 
And the method of operation in it is that you split that healed area, and separate its edges, and place between them a lint of flax, and bind it until it heals. 
And it is not proper that you use in its treatment things which dry out and constrict: for if you do that, the Alxatrati returns worse than it was: rather use in it things which soften, like fenugreek: and foment with water in which marsh-mallow and flaxseed have been cooked: and with diachylon ointment, which has been liquefied with some of the oils: and wrap the lint with it, and treat with it. 
And the treasure of your treatment is that you strive with all ingenuity, that it does not heal according to the form which was there at first. 
And this operation which we have described is nothing but a certain rectification of Alxatrati, so that the form of the place does not return entirely to what it was.
Concerning the treatment of Alxatrati which occurs in the lower eyelid, and is a wrinkling or contraction upward to the right and left.
Chapter 14.
This Alxatrati which occurs below is what is truly called Alxatrati.
And it is natural, and it is accidental.
And the accidental type occurs from a wound, or a fissure, or cauterization, and similar things.
And the method of operation for it is that you should take a needle with a double thread, and push it into the flesh, and make it penetrate from the left tear duct to the right tear duct, until the thread reaches both ends of the flesh.
Then stretch the flesh upward with the needle, and cut it with a broad spatula.
If therefore the shape of the eyelid returns as it should, it is good.
And if not, take a probe, and place it in the fissure, and turn the eyelid with it: and make two fissures on the inner side of the eyelid, and let the ends of the two fissures be from the two angles of the incision, until they meet and form an angle from them: until when they are joined their shape becomes this figure, which is the Greek letter lambda.
Then remove that flesh by the amount that is its sharp lower edge, from what follows the eyelid.
Then join the separated parts: sew it with wool thread.
Then treat them with what we mentioned, with softening medicines, and lint, until they heal.
And if Alxatrati occurs from a fissure, and suture, or cauterization: then you should make a flat fissure under the eyelid hairs, also according to what preceded.
Then separate between the two lips with lint, according to what we said.
And the summary of the discussion about treating Alxatrati, whether it is above or below, is that the operation should proceed in it according to how the form of Alxatrati presents itself.
For it has many variations in form: and the skilled craftsman prepares his technique in whatever way is possible for him, until he makes the shape return to its natural form, or close to it, and the patient himself, according to what suits him in terms of operation and instruments in most conditions.
Concerning the adhesion of the eyelid with the conjunctiva, or cornea.
Chapter 15.
Sometimes this consolidation happens to many people, such that the upper eyelid consolidates with the white of the eye, and prevents it from its natural operations.
Therefore it is necessary that you insert the end of a probe under the eyelid, and raise it upward: or stretch it with a hook: then cut the adhesion with a fine spatula, which should not have a sharp cutting edge, rather it should be somewhat blunt: so that the patient is not disturbed during the operation, and the spatula is removed, and does not harm the eye with its sharpness: and your incision should be as if you are skinning that adhesion with ease, until when the eyelid returns to its natural form, and the entire adhesion heals.
Then pour salt water into the eye, wash it with water: or drip into it from an eye-salve made from verdigris dissolved in water.
Then separate between the eyelid and eye with linen lint: and place over the eye wool soaked in egg white: and after the third day use eye-salve, and with healing agents, until it heals.
¶ On the incision of the pterygium and the prominent flesh of the tear ducts.
Chapter 16.
Know that the pterygium occurs in two forms.
Either it is fibrous: and it is similar to a hard, thin membrane.
Or it is non-fibrous, similar to white congealed fluid: which when iron touches it, or when you try to grasp it with a hook, it breaks apart, and the hook does not hold in it.
And both types begin only from the larger tear duct, until it gradually progresses until it covers the vision, and blocks light, and movement of the eye.
And the method of operating in its incision is: that the patient places their head in your lap.
Then open their eyes, and lift the eyelid with your hand.
Then gather the pterygium with a hook of little doubling, and extend it upwards.
Then take a needle, and insert into it a hair from a horse, and ox, or cow: and let the thread be strong, and double the end of the needle slightly, and fix it in the middle of the pterygium: and penetrate it with the needle, and tie the pterygium with the thread, and extend it upwards: and strip away with the hair the side of the pterygium that follows the pupil, as if you were sawing it with the hair all the way to its end.
Then cut the remainder at the root of the tear duct with a fine spatula, or with small scissors: and leave the natural flesh of the tear duct, so that constant tearing does not occur from its incision.
And sometimes the pterygium is extended with just a hook: or with thread, as we have said.
Then it is stripped away with a smooth spatula, whose form is this.
And be careful, lest the spatula touch the cornea, and a rupture occurs in it, and the pupil is perforated.
Then after the incision, throw into the eye some ground salt, or from an eye-salve made from verdigris, and leave it until another day.
Then treat it with what is appropriate, until it heals.
But if the pterygium is non-fibrous, and you cannot insert a needle into it, nor does a hook hold in it, then many times this type of pterygium is treated with medicines, and heals as I described in the division.
But if you wish to cut it, then open the patient's eye, and take a fine spatula, smooth, of weak sharpness, according to this form.
And scrape the pterygium from above with a scraping motion with delicacy.
But if you see that it becomes thin and breaks apart, and the scraping makes an impression in it, then drip at that time into the eye from an eye-salve made from verdigris, or from red eye-salve, or ground salt: and cover the eye until another day.
Then repeat the operation upon it, until all of it is removed.
Unless there is opposing you in the eye a hot abscess: then indeed leave it, and treat the abscess, until it heals.
Then repeat the operation upon it with scraping, until it heals.
The prominence of the tear duct flesh, however, if it causes great harm in the eye, let it be suspended with a hook, and cut from it a part of it: and do not complete the incision, so that constant tearing does not occur.
Then drip into the tear duct red eye-salve, or one made from verdigris, until it heals.
On the incision of Alguardenic, and flesh growth in the eye.
Chapter 17. 
Sometimes in certain human eyes there grows red flesh, either composite or superimposed, until it covers the pupil, or approaches it, or binds over the eyelids, and perhaps turns the eyelids outward: and it resembles a pomegranate flower. 
And the operation for this is also that the patient should place their head in your lap. 
Then open their eyes, and gather all that flesh with hooks suitable for that purpose: and hold it with one forceps, or surgical instrument. 
Then first cut the flesh, until all of it is removed with the cutting instrument. 
And be careful with the eye, so that you do not harm it during the operation: and let your incision with which you cut it be either with the small spatula, which we described in the section on pterygium incision: or with small scissors, with which asebel is collected, according to the form that will come after this chapter. 
Therefore when your incision is complete, and all of the alguardenici is removed, then fill the eye with ground salt: or drip in red powder, and similar corrosive medicines: and place externally on the eye a cotton pad with egg white: so that it may be protected from hot inflammation. 
If any of the alguardenici remains, and hot blood dominates you, and you fear hot inflammation: then leave the eye, and treat it with that which calms inflammation. 
Then return to it with the operation, until it is healed. 
And similarly do with additional flesh which occurs in the eye of this type. 
However, it is necessary that you avoid treating any eye that is weak by nature or by accident by operating with iron: and do not introduce your hand in any of these operations until you see that that member can tolerate that operation. 
On the collection of Sebel from the eye.
Chapter 18. 
Sebel are red veins which are woven over the eye, and prevent vision its operation: and weaken the eye with the length of days. 
Therefore it is necessary for you first to consider if the eye in which there is Sebel is strong, and there is no other illness in it besides Sebel: then collect its Sebel. 
And it is that you should instruct the patient to place their head in your lap. 
Then suspend those veins with one hook, or two according to your judgment: and let the hook be of subtle doubling, according to this form, or let there be two hooks graduated in one body, according to this form. 
Then collect with subtle scissors those veins with subtlety, and wipe away blood hour after hour, until you see those veins removed from the eye, and they are dissolved: and be careful not to harm the eye with the ends of the spatulas. 
And let your operation be at noon before the sun, and be very firm in your operation: so that you cut nothing except those veins. 
And when you have finished, then drip green or red sief into the eye: so that by its sharpness it may corrode what remained of the sebel. 
If however it is not possible for you to collect all of it in that hour, then plaster the eye with that which sedates the pain of the eye: and leave it for some days, until its pain is sedated: and it is secured from hot inflammation: then return to it in the same way, until it is healed. 
And this is the form of the scissors.
On the Reduction of Arissati to the Nose.
Chapter 19.
Doctors call Arissati a Fistula, which you treat with cautery, or with sharp burning medicine, according to what was previously described.
And if it does not heal, then there is no technique for it except to cut open above the abscess at its origin, and extract all the moisture that is in it and the pus, until the bone is exposed.
When therefore the bone is exposed, and you see corruption in it, or blackness, then scrape it with an instrument, whose form is this.
And it is called "of the rough head."
Let it be made from Indian iron, and let its head be round like azir, which should be dotted with file-like dotting, or with aliskilfer dotting with fine points: and place it over the corrupted part of the bone.
Then rotate it between your fingers, and press your hand slightly, until you know that the corruption has been scraped away: and do this several times.
Then restore the area with drying astringent medicines.
If therefore the area heals, and flesh grows in it, and the flow of pus stops: and it remains for forty days, and does not renew, and does not form an abscess, and no complication occurs in it: then know that it has healed.
And if not, then there is no technique for it except to redirect the fistula to the nose opening, according to this form.
That is, expose it from the second bone with iron, or with sharp medicine: and when the bone is exposed, then take a drill of this form, let the iron tip be triangular: and its wood should be a pyramid tapered to the tip, as you see.
Then place it on the bone itself: and let it be near the tear duct: and keep your hand a little distance from the eye.
Then rotate your hand with the drill, until it penetrates the bone, and the patient feels it: by this that he finds wind coming out of it, when he holds his hand over his nose.
Therefore then restore the area with astringent drying medicines, as I taught you.
When therefore flesh grows, and the area hardens: then the matter which was pouring to the outside returns to the nose: this is therefore easier for the patient.
On the Reduction of Eye Protrusion.
Chapter 20.
When the Eye protrudes in its entirety, and no harm occurs to vision, nor diminishment: then it is necessary that you loosen the patient: then perform phlebotomy on him: afterwards place cupping glasses on the neck without scarification, but with suction.
Then place on the Eye a liniment which is made from acacia, and aloe, and olibanum, and sarcocolla.
Then bind the Eye from above over the plaster with many compresses.
And the method of compresses is: that you take many soft cloths, and each cloth from them should be folded in four: make many of these: then place them one above another, according to the quantity that the Eye needs: then bind over them with a hard cloth with strong binding.
And repeat the cupping glasses with suction without scarification.
Then remove the cupping glasses, and leave the eye bound for a day and night.
If however the bandage becomes loose again, then it is necessary that it be bound tightly: then remove the bandage after a day and night, as we said.
If therefore you see the eye has returned to the uveal tunic, it is good: and if not, then repeat the plaster, and compresses, and binding, and cupping glasses, until it heals.
On the Incision of the Uveal Membrane.
Chapter 21. 
When a rupture occurs in the uveal membrane, and then it protrudes and proceeds outside the eyelids like a grape, and the person's appearance is disfigured because of it, and you wish to cut it: then the operation on it is as I describe: that is, you should insert a needle at the root of the uvea from the lower to the upper part. 
Then insert another needle with a double thread from the lacrimal side, and make it penetrate: and leave the first needle in its position. 
Then cut the place of the double thread, and tie with it the part of the uvea around the needle: and tighten it firmly. 
Then remove the needle, and place wool soaked in egg white on the eye: and leave it until the thread falls off with the uvea. 
Then treat the eye with that which strengthens it, until the wound heals. 
And sometimes the uvea is constricted from all sides with a circle of cloth, until the eye produces a large protrusion. 
Then it should be perforated with a fine spatula, which should reach to the depth of the eye, and the albuminous fluid should flow, and the eye should descend, and enter immediately: then compress it until it heals. 
On the Treatment of Alcomnati.
Chapter 22. 
This Disease which is called Alcomnati is nothing but pus, which collects in the eye, similar to descending water, but is not the same. 
And the method of operating on it is that you should have the patient sit on a prepared or straight seat. 
Then take his head in your hands from both sides, and move it until you see the pus reach the lower part with your eyes. 
Then it should be fixed, and not descend, and light should be released: and the patient should see things as he used to see: and if it does not descend lower, know that it is water. 
If however the descent of pus is not achieved with what we have said, then have the patient sit between your hands. 
Then take a fine spatula, and make a small incision with it above the corneal membrane at the junction of the conjunctiva with the corneal tunic in the corona, until the pus comes out. 
When therefore it comes out, then drip warm water mixed with honey into the eye: or water in which you have already boiled fenugreek and honey: then it should be treated with the remaining treatment until it heals.
On the treatment of water that descends in the eye, or cataract.
Chapter 23. 
We have already discussed the types of water in the division, and what is suitable for piercing with explanatory and expository discourse, so take that same according to health. 
Therefore you should have the patient sit square between your hands, facing the light, near the sun: and bind his healthy eye, and bind it tightly: then [hold] his eyelid with your right hand, if the eye in which there is water is the left eye: or with your left hand, if the eye is the right one. 
Then take the needle (almagda) in your right hand, if the eye is left: or in your left hand, if the eye is right. 
Then place the tip of the needle near the corona [iris] about the width of a radius in the white of the eye appearing at the smaller tear duct: then push the needle with force: and you rotate your hand with it, until it penetrates into the white of the eye: and you feel that the needle has reached an empty space. 
And the measure of the needle's path to the depth should be the measure of the space that is from the pupil to the end of the blackness: which is the corona of the eye. 
For you will see these things in the pupil itself by visual inspection, due to the clarity of the corneal membrane. 
Then place the needle up to the place where the water is. 
Then press it downward one time after another. 
If therefore the water descends immediately, then the patient sees that upon which he opens his sight immediately, with the needle still in his eye. 
Then rest for a little while. 
If therefore the water descends, then lower it a second time, before the needle comes out. 
When therefore it is fixed and does not rise: then extract the needle with care: and you rotate your hand gradually. 
Then dissolve some clear rock salt in water: and wash the inside of the eye with it. 
Then place outside the whole eye either tow or wool soaked in rose oil and egg white: and bind the healthy eye with it. 
We moreover, and those of our time, place ground cumin with egg white upon it. 
But if the needle does not yield to you for entry into the eye due to its hardness, since among men there are those whose eye is very hard: then you should take the small spatula which is called Alberid, of which this is the form. 
Therefore perforate the conjunctiva itself only with it, and do not complete your hand in the hole: and it is only so that you make a subtle path to the place for the needle. 
Then insert the needle, according to what we have said. 
And at the completion of your operation, let a properly made sleeping place be prepared for the patient, in which he may sleep on his back in a dark room: and let him be prohibited from all movements and from coughing: and make his food that which softens his nature: and let him not move his head right or left at all. 
And let the bandage remain according to its arrangement until the third day. 
Then loosen it in that dark room, and test his vision: and make him look at things. 
Then replace the bandage until the seventh day. 
And he should not do that at the time of treatment, or immediately after the incision: rather you should keep that away: because the water rises quickly through intense looking. 
But if a hot swelling occurs: then you should loosen the eye before the seventh day: and correct it with that which calms the swelling, until it is calmed: then free his vision, and place over his face a veil by which his vision may be regulated under it for some days, while he remains in that dark room. 
Then let him leave the room gradually, and spend time in his houses. 
And know that in surgery the student cannot be excused from observing sometimes: for then he may dare to perform the operation. 
And indeed there has come to us someone from those who are from Alayrach, who said that in Alayrach a perforated needle (magdan) was made, by which water is sucked out. 
But truly I have not seen anyone in our land who has done that: nor have I read it in any of the books of the ancients: and it is possible that this is new. 
And these are the forms of the types of needle, so that one who is ignorant of them may understand them. 
Let them be made specifically from brass: and let their ends be with this same subtlety triangulated, and the end sharp. 
Forms of the needle.
¶ On the Treatment of Flesh Growing in the Nose.
Chapter 24. 
Various types of additional flesh sometimes grow in the nose, among which is one that resembles a scorpion with many feet; and among them is cancerous flesh, stone-like, of dark color; and among them is flesh that is smooth, not of dark color. 
Therefore in the case of flesh among these that is smooth, not deceitful, nor cancerous, you should have the patient sit before you facing the sun, and open their nostrils, and insert a hook into that flesh; then draw it outward, and cut what you have grasped of it with a thin sharp spatula from one side, until you know that all the flesh has been removed. 
If any should remain whose removal is not possible: then scrape it with one of the fine instruments gently, until nothing of it remains. 
If however blood overwhelms you, or a hot swelling occurs: then treat it as appropriate: or if it is among the malignant swellings, then hasten to cauterize it, until the blood is stopped, and all flesh is removed. 
Then after the incision, pour vinegar and water, or wine into the nose. 
If however the nose opens, and moisture proceeds from it down to the palate, then know that it is already healed. 
If truly the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then know that within it there is flesh grown on the upper bones of the nostril, which the instrument cannot reach with cutting. 
Therefore then it is necessary that you insert a linen thread of some thickness, and tie many knots in it: and place between each knot the distance of a finger, or less: and the patient should contrive to insert one end of the thread into the nose with a probe, or with whatever is possible for them after making it similar to azer: and draw in their breath until it reaches the palate and comes out above their throat. 
And indeed many times the school boys do similar to this in schools: and it is an easy thing for one who wishes. 
Then place the two ends of the thread, one end which comes out above the nose, and the other which remained in the nose. 
Then administer the sawing of the flesh with the knots that are in the thread. 
Do this until you know that the flesh has been caught with the knots of the thread. 
Then extract the thread: and place in the nose after cleaning the blood a plug which you have soaked in Egyptian ointment: do this for three days, or more, until the ointment corrodes all that remained of the flesh. 
Then at the end of the matter place a lead tube in the nose, for several days, until it heals. 
If however it needs treatment that dries, use that. 
For making head-purging, with which oils and other medicines are dripped into the nose, make that from silver, or bronze: which should be similar to a small lamp, open like a small shell: and its passage likewise. 
And if you wish make a closed tube, like a reed. 
And the shell of the instrument for making head-purging should be full, uncovered: which should have a handle at its back, with which you hold it when you heat oil in it, or whatever you want from juices and flowing substances. 
And this is the form of the instrument. 
¶ On the Treatment of Thelul of the nose.
Chapter 25. 
Many times Thelul is born at the extremity of the nose, and grows large, and increases with days, until its appearance becomes foul. 
And because of that it is necessary that you cut it at the beginning of its appearance, and root out all of it. 
Then place over the spot either cautery, or burning medicine which serves in place of it. 
If therefore its cutting is delayed until it grows large, then consider, if it is stone-like, hard, of dark color, with little sensation: then do not touch it with iron: since it is a cancerous swelling. 
For many times I have seen one who cut such a swelling, and great harm occurred from it to the one who had it. 
And if the swelling is soft to touch, not of dark color, and you see that cutting is possible in all of it, then evacuate the patient, and cut it without fear, without dread: and treat the spot with that which dries and constricts, until it heals.
On the suture of the nose, lip, and ear.
Chapter 26.
Know that when a break in continuity occurs in one of these cartilages, treatment is of little benefit, except in certain people.
Therefore when something of this sort happens to someone, you should consider whether it is a fresh wound with its blood: and then join the two lips of the wound with a suture: then treat it until it heals.
And if the lips of the break in continuity are already separated, and each part has become healthy: then you should scrape each part from its visible skin until it bleeds.
Then join the two lips with a suture, and bind them, and sprinkle over it dragon's blood and ground frankincense: and place above the powders a piece of diaphoenicon plaster, and some other consolidating plasters: and leave it bound for two or three days.
Then loosen it, and change the medicine: and leave it until the threads fall off by themselves.
Then treat it with ointment until it heals.
The method of suturing is to join the break in continuity, either with needles, as we described in the suture of the belly: or join the break with thread, as I made known to you. 
On the extraction of nodes from the lips.
Chapter 27.
Indeed, many people often develop hard swellings similar to vetch seeds on the inside of their lips: and some of them smaller, and larger.
Therefore you should turn the lip, and cut into each of its nodes, and lift it with a hook, and cut it away from all sides.
Then fill the place after the incision with ground vitriol, until the bleeding stops.
Then let it be washed with vinegar, and let the area be treated with something astringent, until the wounds heal. 
On the cutting of flesh grown over the gum.
Chapter 28.
Often flesh grows over the gum additionally, which the ancients called abuluss.
Therefore you should lift it with a hook: or hold it with forceps, and cut it at its root, and let the pus or blood flow.
Then place ground vitriol on the spot, or other astringent, drying powders.
But if that flesh returns after treatment, for it often returns, then cut it a second time, and cauterize it: for it does not return after cauterization. 
On the scraping of teeth with iron.
Chapter 29.
Sometimes rough, unsightly crusts gather on the surfaces of teeth from the inside and outside, and between the gums, and sometimes they become black, and yellow, and green, until corruption reaches the gum from this, and the teeth become foul because of it.
Therefore you should have the patient sit before you, and their head in your lap, and scrape the molar and tooth in which crusts and things similar to sand appear to you: until nothing of them remains, and similarly do this with blackness, and greenness, and yellowness, and others until they are cleaned.
If therefore what is in them is removed from the beginning of scraping, it is good: and if not, then repeat the scraping on them another day, a second, and third time, until finally you achieve what you want.
And know that the tooth needs scrapers of different forms, of many shapes: according to what is prepared for your operation: because the scraper which scrapes the tooth from below is different from the scraper which scrapes between teeth, according to other forms.
And these forms of scrapers should be prepared with you, which you see.
¶ On extracting tooth pain.
Chapter 30.
It is necessary that you treat the tooth and its pain with all skill, and delay its extraction.
For there is nothing that can replace it when it is extracted: since it is an elevated substance: until when there is no excuse for its extraction, then it is necessary when the patient is forced to extract it, that the painful tooth be confirmed and verified by you.
For many times the pain deceives the patient, and he thinks that it is in a healthy tooth and extracts it: then the pain does not go away, until the diseased tooth is extracted.
We have indeed seen this from the work of bloodletters.
When therefore the painful tooth itself is verified by you, then it is necessary that you scarify around the tooth with a small spatula, in which there should be some force, until the gum is loosened from all sides: then move it with your fingers, or with fine forceps at first gradually, until you shake it loose.
Then place large forceps on it with good positioning, and the patient's head between your knees: which you have already held firmly, so that it does not move: then pull the tooth straight, so that you do not break it.
If therefore it does not come out, then take one of those instruments, and insert it under it from all sides with care, and attempt to move it, as you did at first.
If however the tooth is perforated, or corroded: then it is necessary that you fill that hole with cloth: and tighten it with the end of a fine probe, so that it does not break at the moment of your gripping it with the forceps.
And it is necessary, that you act precisely with scarification around the gum from all sides extensively.
And guard your strength, so that you do not break it, and part of it remains, and return to the patient from it an evil which would be greater than his first pain.
And beware, lest you do what ignorant bloodletters do in their haste, and their boldness in extracting it, without administering what we have described.
For many times they cause great illnesses to happen to people, the more difficult of which are that they break, and all or some of their roots remain: or that they extract it with some bones of the jaw: as we have witnessed many times.
Then after its extraction it should be washed with wine, or with vinegar and salt.
If bleeding occurs from the sites (for it often occurs) then grind some vitriol, and fill the place with it: and if not, cauterize it if the vitriol does not help you.
The forms of fine forceps with which the tooth is first moved, should be of long tips, short handle, thick, so that they do not bend when pressed upon the tooth with them: they should be as you see of thick handles, so that when you grip with them, they do not give way, nor bend: of short tips, and they should be made of Indian iron, or of steel properly made, with straight tips: and in their tips there should be teeth, some of which enter into others, and grip with proper, strong constraint.
And sometimes the tips are made like the form of the mouth of a bird which is called a stork, and they are of strong grip.
¶ On the Extraction of Teeth and Removal of Broken Jaw Bones.
Chapter 31.
When something remains broken during the extraction of a tooth, then it is necessary to place cotton with butter on the spot for one or two days, until the area softens: then insert the forceps, or pliers whose tips resemble the beak of a bird called the stork.
This is the form of the forceps.
Let their tips be made like a file on the inside: or like the aliskilfegi.
If therefore it does not yield to extraction with these forceps, then it is necessary that you hollow out above the root, and expose all the flesh, and insert the instrument which is called a small lever, whose form is this.
Let it be short at the tip, somewhat thick: and not be absorbed, so that it does not break.
If therefore the root comes out by that means, it is good: and if not, one must assist with these other instruments whose forms are these.
Form of the first with triangular tip, in which there is some thickness.
Form of the thin triangular tip.
Also one is aided by this instrument having two branches, whose form is this.
And with other instruments and iron tools which preceded in the scraping of teeth.
Also there is help with this instrument which resembles a large hook, of this form, with a twisted triangular tip, in which there is some thickness, so that it does not break: and let it not be absorbed.
And know that dental instruments are many: and similarly the remaining instruments are not counted, and the prudent craftsman, skilled in his art, finds by himself an instrument, according to what the operation and the illnesses themselves indicate to him.
For among illnesses there are those for which the ancients did not prescribe an instrument, because of the diversity of their species.
If however a bone from the jaw breaks, or from other bones of the mouth, or decays: then examine it in its place with what is suitable for it from the instruments and forceps which I mentioned in the extraction of roots, and assist with the gesti, whose form is this.
Let there be in it some thickness gradually, so that the bone may be gripped, or held with it, and not escape and go away, until the bone comes out: and restore the place with medicines suitable for that.
If however there is small decay in the bone, then scrape it from its decay, and treat it until it heals.
On the Filing of Teeth Protruding Above Others.
Chapter 32.
When teeth protrude not according to their natural course, the form becomes ugly: and especially when this happens in women, and girls, namely those for sale.
Therefore it is necessary that you consider.
For if a tooth is born after another tooth, and is not located, or its filing is possible, nor its smoothing: then extract it: and if it is attached to another tooth, then cut it with this instrument, whose form is this.
It is similar to a small beak, and is made from Indian iron, with a very sharp tip.
And let your cutting with which you cut it be over many days, both because of the hardness of the tooth, and so that another of the teeth is not moved.
If however it is protruding exposed to its filing: then file it with a file made of Indian [iron], whose form is this.
Let it all be from Indian [iron], and its handle very finely pointed, like the file with which needles are made: with which the tooth should be filed gradually over many days with ease, so that the tooth is not moved and falls: then smooth it, finally scrape it with certain scrapers.
But if it is a tooth, from which a part breaks, and hurts the tongue: then it is necessary that you also file it, until the roughness of that break is removed, and it is made even: and smoothed, and does not hurt the tongue, nor corrupt speech.
¶ On Binding Teeth with Gold Wires
Chapter 33 
When the front teeth suffer concussion and loosening from a blow or fall, and the patient cannot bite firmly on what they eat without it falling, and you have treated them with astringent medicines without success, then the clever solution for them is to bind them with gold wire, since silver turns green and deteriorates after some days, but gold never changes. 
And let the wire be medium in thinness and thickness according to the space it must fit between the teeth. 
And indeed the form of binding is thus: take a wire and insert its double between two healthy teeth; then weave with the two ends of the wire between the loose teeth, whether one or more, until you arrive with the weaving up to a healthy tooth on the other side. 
Then repeat the weaving back to the side where you began, and tighten your hand with subtlety and wisdom until it does not move at all; and let your tightening with which you secure the wire be at the roots of the teeth, so it doesn't slip away. 
Then cut off the excess wire ends with scissors, and bring both together, and turn them with a tool, and hide them between the healthy tooth and the loose tooth, so they don't harm the tongue; then leave it bound thus while it remains. 
If however it loosens or breaks, bind them with another wire, and it will stay thus for the entire time. 
And this is the form of the teeth and the figure of the binding of two healthy teeth and two loose teeth, as you see. 
And sometimes it happens that one tooth or two return after the fall of either in their places, and are retained as we have described, and remain; and none does this except a skilled, prudent, and experienced craftsman. 
And sometimes something from cow bones is fitted, and is made into the form of a tooth, and is placed in the spot from which the tooth was removed and is bound, as we said; and it remains, and serves for a long time. 
¶ On Cutting the Ligament that Occurs Under the Tongue and Prevents Speech
Chapter 34 
Sometimes this ligament that occurs under the tongue is either natural, with which a person is born, or accidental, from a wound that has already healed. 
And the operation on it is thus: open the patient's mouth with their head in your lap, and raise their tongue; then cut that sinewy ligament across its width until the tongue is freed from its restraint. 
But if there is any hardness and knotting in it, and this is from the healing of a wound, then insert a hook into it and split it across its width until you cut the ligament and the knot is loosened. 
And beware lest the cut be too deep in the flesh, and you cut an artery there, and bleeding occurs. 
Then immediately wash the incision with rose water, or with vinegar, or cold water. 
Then place under the tongue a linen plug, which the patient should keep there every night, so it doesn't heal a second time. 
If however bleeding occurs, then place ground vitriol on the spot. 
But if the blood overwhelms you, then cauterize the spot with a lentil-shaped cautery, which is suitable for this; then treat it with the remaining treatment until it heals. 
¶ On Removing the Ranula that Forms Under the Tongue
Chapter 35 
Sometimes an swelling occurs under the tongue that resembles a small frog, preventing the tongue from its natural operation; and perhaps it grows so large that it fills the mouth. 
And the operation on it is thus: open the patient's mouth facing the sun, and examine the swelling. 
If therefore you see it is of a dark or black color, hard, which the patient cannot feel, then do not touch it, for it is cancer. 
And if it tends toward whiteness, in which there is moisture, then insert a hook into it and cut it with a fine spatula, and free it from all sides. 
But if blood overwhelms you during your operation, then place ground vitriol on it until the blood is stopped; then return to your operation until you extract it completely. 
Then let it be washed with vinegar and salt; and treat it with the remaining suitable treatment until it heals.
On the treatment of apostemes (abscesses) of the two Tonsils.
Chapter 36. 
Sometimes there occur between the throat godad, that is, glands, which resemble the algodad that occur externally: and they are called the two Tonsils: when you treat them with what we have described in the division, and they do not heal, then consider. 
If therefore the aposteme is hard, of dark color, with little sensitivity: then do not touch it with iron. 
And if it is of red color, and its root is thick: then do not touch it also with iron, fearing blood flow, but rather leave it until it matures. 
And then either you will pierce it: or it will break by itself. 
And if it is of white color, round, and its root is thin: then it needs to be cut. 
And the operation on it is that you should consider before its operation, if its hot aposteme has completely quieted, or has diminished somewhat: then therefore have the patient sit facing the sun, and his head should be in your lap: and open his mouth, and let a servant take between his hands, and press his tongue down with an instrument, whose form is this. 
Let it be made from silver, or bronze, which should be thin like a small knife. 
When therefore you press the tongue with it, and the aposteme is shown to you, and your sight falls upon it: then take a hook, and fix it in the tonsil, and draw it outwards as much as you can, without pulling with it anything from the membranes. 
Then cut it with an instrument, whose form is as follows. 
It resembles scissors: however its ends should be curved, so that the orifice of each of them is directly opposite the other sharply: hence ensure that it is made from Indian iron, or soaked alfuled. 
If however this instrument is not present, then cut it with a spatula, whose form is this. 
Let it be sharp on one side, not sharp on the other side. 
And after you cut one tonsil, cut the other according to this same type of incision. 
Then after the incision let the patient gargle with cold water, or with vinegar and water. 
But if bleeding occurs, let him gargle with water in which pomegranate peels have been boiled: or myrtle leaves, and similar astringent things, until the blood flow is stopped: then treat him until he is healed. 
And sometimes other apostemes grow in the throat, besides the two tonsils. 
Cut them therefore according to what I said in the incision of the two tonsils equally. 
And I indeed once treated a woman for an aposteme, which had grown between her throat, which tended toward darkness, with little sensitivity, which had already nearly closed the throat: and the woman was breathing through a narrow passage, and it had already prevented her from eating, and drinking water: and she would have reached death, if she had remained one day, or two days. 
And the aposteme had ascended so much, that it had sent out two branches, until they came out above the two nostrils. 
I hurried therefore hastily, and fixed a hook in one of them. 
Then I drew it, and a large portion was drawn from it. 
Then I cut it off, where I had grasped it from the nostril. 
Then I did the same to what had proceeded from the other nostril. 
Then I opened her mouth, and pressed her tongue: and afterward fixed the hook in the aposteme itself: then I cut off part of it, and only a little blood ran from it: therefore the woman's throat was freed, and she immediately began to drink water, then she took some food. 
Therefore I did not cease to cut from that aposteme many times over a long time: and the aposteme would succeed in the place of what I had cut, until it was prolonged excessively with her. 
Therefore I devised, and cauterized the aposteme between the throat. 
Therefore it stopped from increasing: then I went away, and I did not know what God did with her after me.
On the incision of an abscess of the uvula.
Chapter 37.
When catarrh descends to the uvula, and it becomes swollen, and is long: then it is called perpendicular; and if it is thick and round in its lower part, then it is called grape-shaped.
When it is treated with what we described in the section, and the treatment does not help: and you see that the hot swelling has subsided from it, and it is thin: then it is necessary to cut it.
And that which of it is collected round, and has no length, and is bloody, or of dark color, or black, and has no feeling: then you must avoid cutting it.
For in it there is danger to the patient.
Therefore when you see it according to the manner I described with whiteness and length, you should have the patient sit facing the sun: and press his tongue with the instrument, whose description preceded: then fix a hook in the uvula, and pull it downward: and cut it with one of the two instruments which I mentioned in the incision of the two tonsils.
And you should not cut from it except that which extends beyond the natural limit without addition.
For if you cut more from it, you will harm the voice and speech.
Then after the incision use what we described in the incision of the two tonsils: and treat it until it heals.
But if the patient is frightened of the incision: then you must use skill in cauterizing it without fear and dread.
And the method of cautery in it is only with sharp water: and it is that you place the head of the patient in your lap.
Then press his tongue with the instrument we mentioned.
Then take from the water which I described to you in the chapter on cauterizing, and mix with it unslaked lime, and place it neither thick nor thin, and fill with it the cavity of this instrument, whose form is this.
Let its extremity in which the medicine is placed have a cavity like the cavity of a probe's spoon.
And place the instrument with the medicine on the uvula itself: and let the patient lie on his side, so that saliva may run from his mouth from the internal medicine, so that none of it descends to his throat and harms him.
Then hold your hand with the medicine.
And press it on the uvula for half an hour, until you see it has become black, and the stinging of the medicine has subsided.
And if you wish to take cotton, and wrap it around the end of the probe, and soak the cotton with the medicine, and insert the probe with the cotton in the tube from above, until the cotton adheres to the uvula.
Do that many times, until you achieve what you want from cauterizing the uvula.
Then leave it: for it will dry up and fall off after three or four days.
If you need to repeat the medicine, repeat it: and after cauterization wipe around the uvula with cotton soaked in butter, and clean what is around it from the medicine: and let it be rinsed with cold water.
And let it be treated externally with embrocations, and internally with gargles, until it heals.
This type of treatment is therefore safer than incision and further from danger.
And sometimes the uvula is also treated with what is more subtle than cautery and incision: for it is treated with fumigation, according to this method.
Take calamint, and hyssop, and oregano, and rue, and sseah, and chamomile, and southernwood, and similar herbs: and gather them all, or some of them in a pot, and submerge them with vinegar, and let them boil: and let the pot be properly sealed with clay: and let there be in the middle of the pot a hole, over which a hollow instrument is placed according to this method.
Let it be made from silver or brass: and let the extremity, in which there is a pomegranate, be inserted into the patient's mouth, until the vapor rises to the uvula through the tube, until the uvula becomes quite dark.
Then repeat over it many times, until it dries up.
And beware, do not perform this treatment at the beginning of the appearance of the swelling.
For it often increases the swelling: and you should not do it except during the decline of its hot swelling.
If however this instrument is not available to you, then take a reed, and attach an eggshell at its end: so that the patient's mouth is not burned: since the eggshell prevents the vapor from burning the mouth: and this is among the good treatments with safety.
¶ On the extraction of thorns and bones from the throat.
Chapter 38.
Often a bone, or fish bone, or something else gets stuck in the throat.
Therefore you should extract what is visible of these upon which sight falls, after you press down the tongue with an instrument in sunlight, and what is in the throat becomes clear to you.
And what is not visible to you and is hidden in the throat, you should make the patient vomit before the food is digested in the stomach.
For perhaps the attached thing will come out through vomiting.
Or let the patient swallow a piece of turnip, or lettuce root, or swallow a morsel of dry bread: or take a piece of soft dried sea sponge: and tie it with a thread, then let him swallow it.
When therefore it reaches the place where the thorns or bone are, and is withdrawn, then it comes out.
If therefore it does not come out with what we have mentioned: then use a lead instrument according to this form.
Let it be somewhat thicker than a probe, and at its end let there be a curve, which he should insert into his throat with ease: and he should have his head raised upward.
And he should beware of touching his epiglottis, lest coughing occur, and push the bone or thorn with it, or let the physician insert it with his hand.
Indeed it is better that the patient insert it: because of his knowledge of the location of the attached thing: and push downward, or pull his hand with the instrument upward, all that according to the amount that is prepared for him, until it comes out.
¶ On the extraction of Leeches.
Chapter 39.
When a leech is treated with what I mentioned in the division about treatment with medicines, and it does not help, then examine the patient's throat in front of the sun, or by the sun after you press his tongue with the instrument I described to you.
If therefore your sight falls upon the leech, extract it with a small hook, or with fine forceps appropriately.
But if it is not possible with these: then take a hollow reed, and insert it into the patient's throat up to near the throat: then insert into the hollow of the reed an iron heated with fire.
Do this many times: and let the patient abstain from water all day.
Then let him take a glass full of cold water, and open his mouth in it: and let him rinse his mouth with it, and not swallow any of it: and let him move the water one hour after another with his hand.
For the leech immediately falls when it senses water.
If however it does not come out with what we have described, then fumigate the patient with bedbugs, or with asafoetida using the instrument I described for fumigation of the uvula.
Do this many times, for it will fall.
And the method of operation in fumigation is that you take a pot, in which there are live coals with fire: and let the pot be covered with a lid, in whose middle there is a hole: and let the end of the instrument be placed in that hole.
Then cast the fumigation, and let the patient put his mouth on the end of the reed, and close his mouth, so that the fumigation does not escape, until you know that the fumigation has already reached the leech.
For the leech will immediately fall.
But if it does not fall, then repeat the fumigation many times.
And let the patient endure thirst, and eat salty things, and garlic, and not drink water.
It is therefore necessary that it come out with this regimen.
And this is the form of the instrument with which the leech is extracted from the throat, when sight falls upon it.
It is similar to forceps, as you see: except that it has this curve which is inserted into the throat.
And its end is similar to the mouth of a bird which is called a stork, in which there is the roughness of a file: when it grasps something, it does not let it go at all.
On the opening of Abscesses, and their incision, and treatment in general.
Chapter 40.
There are many types of abscesses, of many kinds, according to what has been mentioned about them, namely one by one in this book: and they differ in their perforation and incision in two ways.
One of these is from the type of abscess itself, and what it contains of fluids.
And the second way is because of the places in the body where it occurs.
For an abscess occurring in the head is different from an abscess occurring in the anus: and an abscess occurring in a fleshy place is different from an abscess occurring in the joints: and each of them has its own judgment regarding treatment.
And among abscesses there are those which should not be opened except after the maturation of pus in them and its completion: and among them are those which should be opened while they are raw and not fully matured.
Like abscesses that are near to joints.
For when an abscess occurs near a joint and its existence is prolonged until what is around it putrefies, perhaps the ligaments or nerves of that joint are corrupted: which is a more immediate cause of contraction of that limb.
Or it is an abscess near a principal member: for if you delay its opening until it matures, it will harm either it or through it the principal member.
Or it is near the anus, therefore pierce it while immature: and you should not pierce a raw abscess of incomplete digestion, except what is near the anus, so that it does not putrefy deeply and extend to the interior of the anus, and become a fistula, or reach a point where it cannot be healed.
You should know the time for opening an abscess that is fully matured: and it is upon the settling of pain, recession of fever, and diminution of redness and pulsation, and sharpness of the head of the abscess: and other signs.
And you should make the same perforation in the lower part of the abscess and at its most prominent point: and let the perforation go in the length of the body, if the abscesses are in parts of the hands and feet, and in places of muscles, tendons, nerves, and arteries, and finally in all even places which have no bend.
In those that do bend, proceed with the perforation according to that member.
When the abscess is in fleshy places: then it is better to postpone its perforation until its digestion is confirmed, as we said, to completion.
For if you pierce it before that, the flow of virus from it is prolonged, and there is much filth and dirt, and perhaps its lips and its depth become hardened.
And certain abscesses are perforated according to the width of the body when necessary: or according to what the member needs.
And you should administer in small abscesses a small perforation, and in large abscesses a wide perforation: or many incisions according to the similarity of the size of the abscess.
And there are among abscesses those in which it is necessary to hollow out the skin: and cut it when it has already become like cloth, and has reached the point where it is already dead: like that which occurs in many, such as dubelet and buboes.
And among them are those which are cut with a triangular incision.
And among them is that from which is cut like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Like the abscess of the groin.
And among them are those in which a round incision and a lunar incision are administered: and similar ones from incisions.
That which has no head, like superficial smooth abscesses, you should pierce it with a superficial or flat perforation only.
And it is necessary, when the abscess is large and has already collected much pus, and you pierce it, that you do not hurry and extract all the pus at that time: rather extract a portion of it.
Then plug the abscess until another day.
Then extract some more pus again.
Do this many times gradually until it comes out: especially if the patient is weak in strength, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or a decrepit old man: for the vital spirit often leaves the body with the release of pus: and perhaps the patient dies, and you do not perceive it.
Therefore be very careful with this chapter.
And after your perforation, with which you pierce these abscesses, you should clean the wound: and observe.
If therefore the wound of the abscess is small, or the incision is flat, then apply lint made from linen or old cotton.
And if the abscess is large, and there are many fissures from the perforation, then it is necessary to insert lint into every fissure, until they meet each other.
And if in the abscess you have cut away part of the skin, or hollowed it out around the circumference: then you should fill it with old cotton, or as when cloth is woven, or with scraped flax fiber without moisture: and bind it until the third day.
Then remove it, and treat it with whatever ointment is necessary, until it heals.
If however bleeding occurs at the time of your operation, then apply cold water and vinegar, after a cloth has been soaked in them: and place it over the site of bleeding many times.
If however the bleeding persists, then you should administer the regimen, and treatment, and powders, which I have described in many places of this book of ours, and from the division.
If however it is in winter time, and the site of the abscess has many nerves: then you should soak the compresses with warm wine and oil: and place them over the areas.
And if it is in summer, and the areas are fleshy: then you should place compresses soaked in water and oil, or with wine and oil, and all of that cold.
Until when it will be the third day, as we have said, then you should loosen the abscess, and clean it, and administer in its treatment what is suitable for it, until it heals.
This therefore is what is necessary to know about the treatment of abscesses in general.
According to the path of distinction, I have already spoken about every abscess, how there is a way to its treatment chapter by chapter individually.
On the incision of abscesses that occur in the skin of the head.
Chapter 41.
Small abscesses occur in the skin of the head, and they are of the types of Nodes, which are contained by tunics that are like sacs to them: as if they were like the crop of a chicken.
And their types are many.
Among them are fatty ones: and among them are those that contain moisture similar to mud: and among them are those that contain moisture similar to ground grain and porridge: and similar things, and among them are those that are stone-hard.
And in the incision of all of them, and their extraction there is no fear, as long as during their incision no artery presents opposition.
And the procedure in cutting them is that you examine them with an instrument, whose form comes after this, which is called the Probe, until you know what it contains.
For if it is that which contains fluid, then cut it with an incision along the length with a superficial cut: according to this form.
And begin with the incision from line b. to line g. Then when the fluid is evacuated, strip away the cyst which contains that fluid, and do not leave any of it at all.
For many times it returns, if anything of it remains.
Then submerge cotton in Egyptian ointment, if it is available: and if not, in water and salt: and fill the wound with it, and leave it until another day.
For it will corrode what remained of the cyst.
Then repeat the cotton with Egyptian [ointment] a second and third time, and if you need it, until you are confident that nothing remains of the cyst, then treat the wound with ointment until it heals.
But if the abscess contains a fatty node: then cut it according to this form, with an incision having the form of a cross: and insert hooks between the two lips of the incision, and strip it away from all sides: and concentrate your strength in extracting the tunic which contains it.
But if an artery presents opposition to you, then do what I will tell you later.
And similarly do in the case of an abscess, if it is stony, with the same incision and treatment, according to what we have said.
And the incision upon a stony abscess is easier: since it has little blood and moisture.
And sometimes there are certain of these abscesses which are in the head in some people, with which there is absolutely no moisture.
That is: because I cut into an abscess in the head of an old woman, and found the abscess like a solid and hard stone, rough, white, which could not be broken: and if someone were struck by throwing it, it would wound them.
In other abscesses occurring in the head, besides these namely abscesses which occur in the heads of children, and near the roots of the ears, the incision of all of them should be a superficial incision.
Or place their perforation always at their lower part, so that the flow of pus is eased downward.
Then treat them with what is suitable for them in terms of treatment.
On the Excision of Scrofulas in the Neck.
Chapter 42.
These swellings often occur in the neck, and under the armpits, and in the groins: and sometimes they occur in the rest of the body.
And those of them that occur in the neck are single or multiple: and they generate from one another: and every Scrofula among them is within its own membrane, as is the case with nodes and swellings of the head, as we have described.
And the types of these Scrofulas are many.
And among them indeed some are stone-like: and some of them contain fluids: and some of them are malignant, which do not respond to treatment.
Therefore, for the one among them that you see to be of good condition to the touch, whose appearance is close to skin color, and moves in all directions, and is not attached to the nerves of the neck, nor to the jugular, nor to the artery, nor is deep: you should cut it with a superficial incision from the upper part to the lower part of the body from line b. to line g. and separate it from all sides: and stretch the two lips of skin with a hook, or with many hooks, if you need that, as we said regarding swellings of the head, and extract it gradually.
And one must be cautious not to cut a vein or nerve.
And let the spatula not be too sharp: so that it does not slip in your hand during cutting, or disturb the patient, and you cut what is not necessary.
If however you cut a vein, or artery, or it prevents you from operating, then place ground vitriol in the wound, or certain powders which stop blood, and bind the wound, and leave it until the acuteness of the swelling subsides, and the wound softens: or it begins and wants to putrefy.
For the blood is stopped at once. Therefore return to your operation, until you complete it.
Then investigate with your index finger if any other small Scrofulas remain: therefore cut them out and clean them.
But if there is a large vein at the root of the Scrofula: then you should not cut that Scrofula from its root: rather you should tie it with a strong doubled thread, and leave it until it falls off by itself without harm.
Then fill the wound with old cotton, which you have already immersed in Egyptian ointment.
Then treat it.
If the whole Scrofula is cut out, then you should bring together the two lips of the wound: and suture it immediately, after you see that absolutely no excess remains.
If however you see that excess remains due to the size of the Scrofula, then you should aim to cut its root, and extract it: and apply the suture which we mentioned.
And for those Scrofulas which contain fluids, pierce it with a superficial perforation: so that its point of maturation appears to you: and make the perforation from that which follows below the body, as we said.
Then after perforation, apply dressings with ointment, and similar things, to remove what remains of the corruption, until when you see the wound is now clean: then treat it with flesh-generating ointment until it heals.
¶ On the incision of the Epiglottis from an abscess occurring inside the throat.
Chapter 43.
The ancients spoke of this incision in the Epiglottis, and I have not seen anyone in our land who has performed it: and this is the writing of their discourse.
In those having quinsy, the cutting of the Epiglottis should be avoided: since no benefit comes from it: because all the veins and the lung are weak.
But in those who have a hot abscess in the mouth, or throat, or both tonsils, when there is no disease in the airway, it is necessary to use incision of the Epiglottis, to escape from the destruction that comes from suffocation.
Therefore when we wish to do this, we should cut the Epiglottis below three rings of the Epiglottis, or four, with a small incision across the width, in that which is between two rings by such an amount, that the cut is in the membrane, not in the cartilage: and this indeed is the suitable place for cutting, since it is devoid of flesh, and blood vessels are far from it.
But if the physician is timid, then he should stretch the throat skin with a hook.
Then split the skin, until when he reaches the airway: avoid blood vessels, if he sees any of them.
Then cut the membrane which we described: and the cutting of the airway is indicated by phlegm which comes out of it, with that which bursts forth, and loss of voice.
And leave the wound open for some time.
When therefore the time passes in which suffocation is feared, bring together the two lips of the skin wound, and sew it alone without the cartilage.
Then apply medicines which cause flesh to grow, until it heals.
Albucasis says:
The sum of this discourse which we have related, the explanation is only when they see that one of these abscesses has already blocked the throat of the sick person: and the sick person has been raised above death, and his breath wants to be cut off: they proceed to cut the Epiglottis, so that the sick person may breathe through the wound site with some breathing, and be saved from death: and because of this they instructed to leave the wound open, until the malignancy of the disease is consumed, and its malignancy is three days, and almost the same: then therefore they instructed to sew the wound, and treat it until it heals.
And that which I saw myself is that a maid took a knife, and put it in her throat, and cut with it part of the lung's airway.
And I was called to treat her, and I found her moaning, like the moaning of the dying.
I thus uncovered the wound, and found the blood which had come out from the wound was little.
I was thus confident that she had not cut a vein, nor the jugular: and wind was coming out of the wound.
I hurried therefore, and sewed the wound, and treated it until it was healed: and nothing happened to the maid, except hoarseness in her voice: and after days she returned to her better conditions.
Hence therefore I say: that in cutting the Epiglottis there is no fear.
¶ On cutting the Hernia of the throat.
Chapter 44.
This Abscess named Hernia of the throat, is a large abscess, according to the color of the body: and it is common in women.
And it is of two types: for either it is natural: or it is accidental.
In the natural certainly there is no remedy.
But the accidental is of two types: of which one is similar to fatty nodes.
And the other type is similar to an abscess which occurs from knotting of the artery.
And in it there is danger, and one should not make an attempt at it with iron, except in that which is small: and you test it, and investigate it with a probe.
If therefore you find it similar to a fatty node, and it is not suspended with any of the veins: then cut it, as nodes are cut: and extract it with that which contains the cyst, if it is in a cyst: and if not, then search out all of it.
Then treat the area with what is necessary from treatment, until it heals.
¶ On the surgical treatment of various types of Nodes
Chapter 45.
There are many types of Nodes, and I have already described all their types in the classification: and here I must explain the difference between a Node and an Abscess, since it can cause confusion.
Therefore I say that with an Abscess there is heat, and fever, and severe pains, until the boiling of the superfluity subsides, and putrefaction is complete: for then the fever and heat cease.
With a Node however there is no heat, nor fever, nor pains, and they are contained within a membranous cyst, which is their proper sac, and it is the same color as the body: and they begin the size of a chickpea, and become like a melon, and larger and smaller.
And they are of two types: either fatty, or containing fluid.
And the colors of the fluid are many, according to what I said in the classification.
Therefore, when you come to treat a Node, you must examine it and investigate it first with an instrument called the Probe, according to the form that will be shown in the chapter after this.
And the method of investigating swellings and all Nodes is that you take this instrument and insert it into the most fluid place that you find in the swelling: and you rotate your fingers with it gradually until you know that the instrument has penetrated the skin.
Then advance your hand according to the size of the swelling.
Then withdraw the Probe and examine what comes out in its track.
If therefore fluid comes out, whatever color it may be: then cut it with a superficial incision, according to what I said regarding other swellings.
And if no fluid comes out in the track of the Probe, then know that it is fatty: therefore cut over it with a cruciform incision, according to this form, as I taught you: and hold it with hooks, and carefully separate the skin from all sides: and preserve the cyst if you can, so that you may extract it intact with the Node.
But if the cyst ruptures during the operation, and it is not possible to extract it intact, for this often happens, then extract it piece by piece until none of it remains.
For if any of it remains, whether little or much, the Node usually returns.
But if it defeats you, and a little remains: then fill the wound upon your completion with some sharp corrosive powders: and bind the wound, and place upon it what calms a hot swelling, and treat it with the remaining treatment until it heals.
If therefore the Node is large, then suture its two edges, and treat it with what causes flesh to grow.
But if you encounter a pulsating or non-pulsating vein: then hurry and fill the place with ground vitriol, and leave it bound for two or three days, until the wound putrefies and the blood's boiling subsides: then return to cutting what remained of the Node.
¶ On the forms of instruments for cutting and perforation.
Chapter 46.
Among these are the forms of probes, and they are of three types.
Of these, one is large, one is medium, and one is small.
They are made of iron with squared ends appropriately, so that they may quickly enter into abscesses.
And these are the forms of probes, and of perforating instruments: and one of them is called beris, that is, perforator: and they are of three types.
Of these indeed is large, medium, and small.
They are suitable for investigating abscesses, lesions, fistulas, and swellings from what lies between them in the bones.
And others are made round, smooth, polished, like large needles with which cushions are sewn, made from brass, or from bronze, or iron, or silver.
And the best of them are those made from brass.
And probes are also made from black lead, which are suitable for examining fistulas that have bends in their cavity, so that they may bend with their smoothness along those curves.
And again they are of three types.
For among them are long ones, medium ones, and short ones, according to the size of the width of the fistula and its narrowness.
The form of hooks, and they are of many types.
For among them are simple ones, namely those which have one curve: and they are of three types as you see, Large, Medium, and Small.
And among them are blind hooks: and they are of three types.
And among them are hooks having two curves, and they are of three types: and among them are hooks having three curves, and they are of three types: and all these are necessary in their place.
And these are the forms of scalpels, with which nodes and abscesses are cut and excoriated: and they are of three types: for among them is large, medium, and small.
Their ends with which cutting is done are sharp, the other ends are not sharp: and they are not made thus, except that with them help may be given in the excoriation of nodes when there is fear of cutting a vein or nerve: and that through them the patient may be healed, and find some relief from the burning which occurs during the excoriation of an abscess.
These are probes (Magda), and they are of three types.
They are made of bronze, and are similar to the stick with which kohl is applied: and in the broad end there is a hidden spatula point: and in it runs to the interior and to the exterior when you wish, as you see.
The form of spatulas which are hidden between the fingers when perforating abscesses: and patients do not perceive them: and they are of three types, large, medium, and small.
The forms of cupping vessels with which blood flow is stopped: and they are of three types, large, medium, and small.
They are made of bronze or brass, round, somewhat elongated, as you see: and they should be rather thin.
And it is necessary that these types of cupping vessels be available to you, large and small: so that you may stop blood flow quickly when necessary, and then when medicine is not present to you.
However, do not use them for stopping blood in every part of the body, and do not use them except in fleshy places: such as the muscles of the leg, and thigh, and muscles of the arms, and breasts, and belly, and groin, and similar to these, from among the fleshy, moist muscles.
And sometimes small instruments are made from these similar to pistachio shells, according to their form: with which blood is stopped when it flows from the place of bloodletting, or during the cutting of a vein or artery: and sometimes they are made round according to this form.
On the treatment of men's breasts which resemble women's breasts.
Chapter 47.
Sometimes the breasts of certain men swell at the completion of sleep (that is, when they begin to have nocturnal emissions) until they resemble women's breasts: and they remain swollen in an unsightly way.
Therefore, whoever abhors this condition should cut above the breasts with a lunar incision, according to this form from line b. to line g. Then strip away all the fat.
Afterward, fill the wound with flesh-generating medicine.
Then bring together the two lips of the wound with sutures, and treat it until it heals.
If however the breast droops downward and becomes soft due to its size, as happens in women: then it is necessary to make two incisions on its upper sides similar to the lunar figure, each of which connects with the other at both ends, so that the larger line contains the smaller one, according to this form from line b. to line g. Afterward strip away the skin that is between the two lips, and remove the fat, and apply what we mentioned about sutures and powders, which is necessary for treatment, until it heals.
If however you cannot complete the incision of what you need to cut, due to the patient's restlessness, or due to blood flow: then you should fill the wound with cotton soaked in corrosive ointment, and leave it until it corrodes what remains of the fat.
Then treat it until it heals.
On the perforation of swellings that occur under the armpit.
Chapter 48.
These swellings that occur under the armpit are of the types of hard scrofula which contain cysts, and some of them contain fluids.
Therefore those of them which contain fluids should be cut with a lunar incision, according to this form, from line b. to line g. When therefore all the pus that is in the swelling is evacuated, then fill it with old cotton, and leave it until another day.
Then remove the cotton, and treat it with suitable ointment until it heals.
But if the swelling is of the type of scrofulous nodes, then cut into it, just as we described in the section on scrofula similarly.
If however the wound extends to emit pus, then apply cautery to it, according to what we described previously.
On cutting swellings that occur due to arteries and veins.
Chapter 49.
When an artery ruptures, and the skin above it heals over, then often a swelling occurs from this: and similarly it happens with veins also, that swelling and inflammation occur in them.
And the signs by which it is known that the swelling and inflammation are due to an artery and vein are: that when the swelling is due to an artery, it is long, gathered in the depth of the body: and when you push the swelling with your fingers, you feel as if it has a whistling sound.
And that which is due to a vein is round and visible on the body's surface.
And cutting into this type of swelling is an error, especially that which is under the armpits, and groin, and neck, and in many places of the body: and it is very dangerous.
Therefore its treatment with iron [surgical instruments] should be avoided, and those of them which are in the extremities, or in the head, should be avoided.
Therefore for that which is from inflation of the artery's opening, make an incision in the skin lengthwise.
Then open the incision with hooks, then the artery: and free it from its coverings, until it is exposed.
Then introduce a needle under it, and make it penetrate to the other side, and tie the artery with a double thread in two places, according to what I taught you in the extraction of the two arteries which are in the temples.
Then puncture the place which is between the two ligatures with a spatula, until all the blood which is in it comes out, and the swelling is resolved.
Then administer treatment which generates pus, until the ligatures fall off: afterward treat it with ointments suitable for that, until it heals.
If there is an abscess due to cutting a vein, then you should hold with your hand as much of the abscess with the skin as you can.
Then insert a needle under the place which you held with your hand, and make it penetrate: and let there be a double thread in it, until you draw it out from the other side.
Then bind the abscess with this thread with a good binding: according to what I told you about binding a grape, from two parts with the two ends of the thread.
If however you fear that the thread might come out, then insert another needle with another thread under the whole abscess near the first needle's incision: press, and tighten your threads in four places.
Then cut the abscess in its middle, until what is inside comes out: then cut away the excess skin, and leave what is bound from it.
Then place upon it a compress which you have soaked in wine and oil.
Then administer treatment, which is done with lint and ointments, until it heals.
¶ Concerning the abscess which occurs from twisting of Nerves.
Chapter 50.
Just as an abscess occurs in Artery and Vein, similarly an abscess occurs in Nerves: which occurs in them from a blow, or occurs from excessive work, and similar things: and it happens most often in those places of the upper arms, or heel, and in every place where joints move: and it is a serious abscess.
Its color resembles the rest of the body, and is in most conditions without pain: and when it is pressed firmly, the patient feels something like numbness in it.
And it is not an abscess gathered in the depth of the body, but rather is under the skin, and it moves to every part, and does not go forward, or ahead, nor backward to the rear.
Therefore those of them that are in joints, should not be invaded with iron.
For perhaps contraction will occur.
But in that which is of them in the head, or in the forehead, split the skin with a spatula.
If therefore the abscess is small, then hold it with forceps, and cut it off from the root.
And if it is large, then suspend it with a hook, and flay it: then remove it, and join the wound with suture: and treat it until it heals.
¶ Concerning the cutting of an abscess, which occurs in the belly.
Chapter 51.
There occur in some people many times in their bellies, and in other parts of their bodies, warts, which are called Fungal, due to their similarity with mushrooms.
Whose root is thin, and their head is thick, and their edges are turned outward.
And some of them are small: and some of them become very large.
And I indeed have seen a man, and in his belly there were two warts, which were more similar to mushrooms than other things: there was no difference between them, white, of minute root, and their edges were turned outward, and they were split, and moisture always ran from them.
Therefore I cut them, and found in the weight of one about 18 ounces and in the other about 6 ounces And the operation in cutting them is, that you consider then, if the patient is moist, and the color of the wart is white, moist, of thin root: then cut it with a broad spatula, and let there be cauteries in the fire in your presence.
For many times during its cutting much blood is expelled: hurry therefore if blood overcomes you, then cauterize it.
But if you see the patient fearful and afraid of cutting with iron, then take a thread of lead properly made, and bind the wart with it: whose method is what we have said, and leave it for two days.
Then increase in the tightness of the lead.
Therefore do not cease to tighten the lead, as often as it makes an impression in the wart, until it is cut off, and falls by itself without effort.
If however the wart should be of thick root, then in cutting it there is something of fear and dread: especially that which is in the belly.
Nevertheless it is possible, that you cut half of it.
Then cauterize it, so that it does not return.
Then treat it, until the wound heals.
And beware lest you presume to cut a wart which is of dark color, of little sensation, of foul appearance: for it is a cancerous abscess: and I will come with the remembrance of Cancer after this.
On the Treatment of Protruding Navel.
Chapter 52.
A protruding navel occurs from many causes.
Either from tears in the sifac [abdominal wall] which is above the belly: and from it emerges the althub [omentum], or intestine, according to what happens in other ruptures.
Or from blood that flows from a Vein, or from an Artery, according to what was mentioned before.
Or from trapped wind in it.
If however it is due to a tear in the sifac, and exit of the omentum: then the color of the swelling is similar to the color of the body: and it is smooth, without pain: and appears in different positions.
And if it is due to the protrusion of intestine, then its position, with what we have described, is of greater variability.
When therefore you press it with your fingers, it disappears: then returns, and perhaps there is a sound with it: and it greatly increases upon entering the bath, and with vigorous exercise.
If indeed it is due to fluid, it is smooth, then it does not disappear when you press it with your hand, nor is it constricted, nor does it increase.
But if it is due to blood, then with these signs the swelling appears declining toward blackness.
If however it is due to grown flesh: then the swelling is heavy, thick, hard, and fixed in one size.
If indeed it is due to wind, then its touch is smooth.
And the procedure in that case is, that you should consider then, if the protrusion of the navel is due to blood from an Artery, or Vein, or wind: then you must refrain from treating it.
For in that there is fear and dread, as I taught you in the chapter in which I spoke of swellings due to artery and vein.
But if the protrusion of the navel is due to intestine, or omentum: then you must instruct the patient to hold their breath, and stand upright extended.
Then mark with ink around the entire navel.
Afterward command them to lie back between your hands upon their back.
Then encircle with a broad spatula around the navel above the place which you marked with ink.
Afterward extend the middle of the swelling upward, with a large hook.
Then bind it around firmly with thread, or with silk cord in a secure binding: and let the knot of the binding be of the alenxotati type [special surgical knot].
Then open the middle of the swelling extended above the binding.
If therefore you find it has been caught by the binding: then remove the alenxotati, and insert your index finger, and push the intestine to the interior of the belly: and if you find omentum, then take it with a hook, and cut off its excess.
If however an artery or vein opposes you: then encircle it extensively.
Then return to your procedure.
And take two needles, and insert in them two strong threads: and insert the two needles around what you made around the swelling in the form of a cross, which you make penetrate.
Then tighten the swelling in four places above the needles: and if you wish, remove the needles, and leave the place until the extended flesh putrefies: and falls off by itself: or cut it when it becomes thin and putrefied.
Then treat it with what is necessary from ointments, until it heals.
But if the protrusion of the navel is from flesh grown in it, or from fluid: then you must hollow out the swelling, as we said.
And extract the blood, or fluid, which you find in it.
Then treat it with what solidifies the area.
On the treatment of CANCER.
Chapter 53.
We have already discussed in the classification the types of Cancer, and how it may be treated with medicines: and that treatment with iron [surgery] should be avoided, lest it become ulcerated: and we discussed Cancer generated in the womb, and the precaution in treating it.
And the ancients said that sometimes Cancer is in a place where its eradication is possible: like Cancer that is in the breasts, or in the hip, and similar ones, from members situated for extracting all of it: especially when it is small and beginning.
When it is old and large, you should not approach it.
For I have not been able to cure any of it: nor have I seen another before me who achieved that.
And the operation on it, when it is situated as we said, is that you should proceed first and purge the patient of black bile several times.
Then bleed them if you find obvious fullness [of blood].
Then prepare the patient with preparation, in which they are positioned for the operation.
Then cast suitable hooks into the Cancer.
Afterwards hollow it out from all sides with the skin, according to careful examination, until none of its roots remain: and let the blood flow, and do not cut it off quickly, rather compress the areas, and wipe away all the thick blood with your hand, or with whatever instruments are possible there.
If however the flow of thick blood from cutting an artery or vein gives you trouble: then cauterize the vein until the blood is stopped.
Then treat it with the remaining treatment until it heals.
On the treatment of DROPSY.
Chapter 54.
We have already described in the classification the types of Dropsy, and how water accumulates: and the signs of every type, and its treatment with medicines.
And that which is treated with iron is only the ascitic type alone: and the tympanitic type should not be approached with iron: nor the hyposarca type at all: for that is fatal.
When you have already treated this tympanitic type of Dropsy with medicines, and your treatment has not helped: then consider.
For if weakness has already followed in the patient, or there is another illness besides Dropsy: such as if they have a cough, or looseness of the belly, and similar things: then beware of treating them with iron: since that is dangerous.
But if you see the patient has abundant strength, and they have no illness besides Dropsy alone: and is neither a child nor elderly: then the method of operation on them is that you raise the patient standing between your hands, and an assistant behind them compresses their belly with their hand pushing the water to the lower part of the pubic area.
Then take a spiny spatula, according to this form.
Let it be of two sharp parts, long, with a sharp end like a Spatula.
However let there be some gradual shortness in it, so that you do not pass through with it during the operation all the way to the intestine, and harm it.
Then consider.
For if the generation of Dropsy is from the part of the intestines, then you should distance yourself with the incision from the navel by the amount of three fingers, downward in line with it above the pubic area.
If however the generation of Dropsy is due to illness of the liver: then let your incision be to the left of the navel by three fingers.
And if its generation is due to the spleen, then let the incision be on the right side: and also the incision should not be on the side on which the patient wants to lie, so that excess fluids do not run to that weak place.
Then pierce through the whole skin with the instrument.
Then introduce into that incision, and raise your hand with the Spatula between the skin and the peritoneum, as if you are skinning it: and let the amount that is skinned be the amount of a fingernail, or thereabouts.
Then pierce the peritoneum, until the Spatula reaches the empty space: which is the place of the water.
Then remove it, and introduce into the hole an instrument, of which this is the form.
And it is like a small tube: made from silver, or bronze, or brass, smooth, polished: which has a small hole in its lower part, and in its sides are three holes, two on one side, and one on the other side: and its end is cut, in the manner of cutting a reed, as you see: at its upper end is a ring.
For when the instrument reaches the water, then it descends immediately upon the instrument, therefore evacuate half the quantity of water at that time.
Since if you evacuate more of it than necessary, at that moment the patient may die through the dissolution of his vital spirit: or he may suffer a fainting spell that approaches death.
Indeed, evacuate from it according to the measure of his strength, and according to what the patient's conditions indicate to you from his pulse strength, and from its quality.
Then withdraw the instrument, and retain the water.
Which is because it is retained immediately due to the skin that holds the opening which is above the peritoneum: about which I told you to pierce it according to that method.
Then repeat the instrument the next day, if you see the patient can tolerate it: and draw out also a small quantity of water.
Do this for several days without fear, and guard yourself from error: until nothing remains of the water except a little.
But if you are worried about the patient, and you leave much water: then treat him with burial in hot sand, and much sweating in the bath and sun, and let him endure thirst: and treat him with drying medicines, until he is healed: and cauterize above the stomach, and liver, and spleen, after extracting the water: according to what I described in what preceded.
¶ Concerning the treatment of infants who are born with their urinary passages not perforated.
Chapter 55.
When any of the infants emerges from his mother's womb, and the head of his penis is not perforated, or the opening is narrow, or not in its proper place.
Therefore it is necessary to assist with its perforation immediately when he is born with a very fine probe, according to this form.
Then place in the opening a thin nail of lead, and bind it: and keep it there for three or four days.
Therefore when he wants to urinate, let it be removed, and let him urinate.
Then replace it.
And if you do not place the lead, it is indeed possible that the urine which flows over the area will not allow it to close.
He whose opening is narrow is treated with lead, as we said, for many days, until it is widened.
Those in whom the opening is not in its proper place are harmed.
Which is because among those who are born, the opening is at the end of the head of the penis: wherefore he cannot urinate forward, until he lifts the penis with his hand upward.
Nor does he have procreation, because the sperm cannot reach the womb in a straight line: and it is a very foul illness.
And the method of operation in that case is that the patient should lie back upon his back.
Then extend the head of his penis with your left hand with strong extension, and cut the tip of the head of the penis from the place of the priapus, with a sharp point, or sharp probe: like the cutting of a reed, or as you scrape something, so that its middle comes to resemble the head of the penis: and so that the opening falls in the middle as it should.
And guard yourself during your operation from the flow of blood.
For this often happens.
Therefore oppose it with that which stops blood, and treat the wound until it heals.
¶ On Albather (warts) which occur on the foreskin and head of the penis, and on corruption, blackening, and adhesion.
Chapter 56.
These Albather often occur on the penis, and it is an emergence of unsightly flesh.
And of these, some are malignant, and others non-malignant.
For the non-malignant one, you should suspend it with a fine hook, and cut it away until you have cleaned it all away.
Then place upon it cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment.
Then treat it afterward with diafinicon ointment until it heals.
But if the Albather is malignant, of foul color, then you should apply cautery to it after cutting and scraping it.
If however the Albather is on the foreskin of one uncircumcised, and part of the Albather is between the foreskin and part of it outside: then you should first remove the Albather that is inside, until when it heals, then treat it externally: because when you treat it all at once, the foreskin is not secured from being perforated.
And blackening and corruption also occur in the testicles and foreskin.
Therefore, you should hollow out all that has already blackened, and what is about to corrupt, or has already corrupted.
Then spread over it afterward honey that has been mixed with powder of pomegranate peels, and sifted ground vetch.
Then treat it with the remaining treatment until it heals.
If however there occurs a flow of blood, then apply cautery with a lunar cautery, according to this form.
For cautery is beneficial for two conditions simultaneously, namely for blood flow, and when the wound becomes corrupt.
But if the head of the penis is corroded, and is completely destroyed in an hour: then you should insert into the urinary passage a small tube of lead, so that the patient may urinate through it.
Regarding adhesion of the foreskin to the head of the penis, and this adhesion indeed does not occur except in one whose foreskin is healthy and circumcision is not required on it: and sometimes adhesion occurs because of a wound or abscess: therefore you should separate it with a blunt spatula until the attachment is loosened, and the head of the penis is freed on all sides.
But if it is difficult to separate them precisely, then you should scrape something from the head of the penis and from the foreskin.
This is because when the foreskin is thin, perhaps it becomes perforated quickly because of its thinness.
Then separate between the foreskin and head of the penis with a thin linen cloth, which has been moistened in cold water, so they do not adhere again.
Then let it be treated with astringent wine until it heals.
On the cleansing of infants, and the treatment of errors occurring to them.
Chapter 57.
Circumcision is not a break in continuity like other wounds: however, since it is done by our operation, by our will, and its practice is specifically for boys, it is necessary that we indicate in it the better operation and the easier way leading to health.
Therefore I say that the ancients did not speak of circumcision in any of their books: since they do not use it in their laws, and it is nothing except what we have acquired through experience.
Which is because I found the greater part of practitioners and phlebotomists using cleansing, circumcising with a razor and with scissors: and they use the thimble, and binding with thread, and cutting with a fingernail.
And I indeed have already tested all these methods, and have not found better than cleansing with scissors and binding with thread.
Since in cleansing with a razor, many times the skin escapes.
Since the skin of the foreskin has two layers: therefore perhaps the upper skin is cut, and the lower membrane remains: thus one is forced to cut to cut the other, and future pain.
And with cleansing which is done through the thimble, that is, the finger-guard which cobblers use, the cutting of the extremity of the male member is not secured: since perhaps it enters into its opening.
In cleansing with the fingernail, perhaps the iron slips and corrupts your operation: and indeed a boy's skin is naturally short, and many times they are born such that they do not need cleansing: and I have seen this.
However, cleansing with scissors and binding with thread, good experience has revealed to me: since scissors are of proportional cutting: because the sharpness which is above is like the sharpness which is below.
Therefore when you press your hand, the two sharp edges are proportioned, and they cut according to one operation in one time: and the compression happens in a similar figure, containing the skin of the penis from all sides, with which error does not occur at all.
And the mode of proper operation is that you make estimate, especially the boy, if he is among those who understand a little, that you do nothing except that you bind a thread on his penis only: and you leave him until another day.
Then make him happy and joyful in every way possible for you, from that which his understanding receives.
Then make him stand between your prepared hands in position, and let him not be sitting: and hide the scissors in your sleeve, or under your foot, lest the boy see them at all, or any of the instruments.
Then introduce your hand to his penis, and blow on the skin, and pull it upward, until the head of the penis comes out.
Then clean it from that which gathers in it of dirt.
Then bind the marked place with a double thread.
Afterward bind a little below it with a second binding.
Then hold with your index finger and thumb the place of the lower binding with good retention, and cut between the two bindings.
Then lift the skin upward quickly, and extract the head of the penis.
Then let the blood run gradually (for it is better) and put powder above: and above the powder a cloth in which has been spread egg yolk cooked in rose water, mixed with fresh good rose oil: and leave it upon him until another day: and treat him with the remaining treatment until he is healed.
However, this is the form of scissors for cleansing.
Let the two extremities be blunt, and let them be cutting: let no branch of nail protrude in them: and let the length of the two sharp edges be like the length of the two handles equally.
Indeed the error falling in cleansing is: since perhaps the inner skin escapes entirely, or part of it during cutting.
Therefore it is necessary that you extend it from your time with your nail before swelling of the place: and cut it according to equality.
But if you cannot hold it with your nail, then extract it with a hook, and cut it.
If three days have passed, and what remains under the penis is swollen and inflamed: then leave it until the hot inflammation subsides, and carefully remove the skin, and cut it according to what is prepared for you: and be careful of the head of the penis.
Indeed this will not harm him.
Therefore treat it with that which consolidates the wound from the powders, which we described in the treatise on powders: and if it is cut from the skin above measure, and escapes to the upper parts, this also does not harm him.
Therefore treat it with what we have said, until it heals.
¶ On the extraction of Urine retained in the bladder.
Chapter 58.
Retention of urine in the bladder occurs from blockage caused by stone, or congealed blood, or pus, or flesh growth, and similar things from those which we mentioned in the types of treatment in the division.
And if the Urine is not released, and you see its retention is because of a Stone, which is now in the neck of the bladder: then the patient should be on his knees bent over.
Then his feet should be placed on his back, and he should extend his belly from the upper part of his back, and the patient should hold his breath as much as possible for him.
Therefore he is compelled with the neck of the bladder to expel the Stone to the posterior: whereby the Urine is released.
But if it is not released with what we have said, and the matter becomes severe for the patient: then you must administer its extraction with an instrument, which is called a syringe, whose form is this: Let it be of silver, and let it be thin, smooth, hollow like a bird's feather quill in the thinness of its shaft, long in the likeness of one and a half palms: which should have a thin tube at its head.
And the method of urine's exit through it is that you should take a doubled thread, and tie wool or cotton at its end with a good knot: and insert the end of the thread in the lower part of the Syringe: and cut with scissors if anything from the wool protrudes, but insert it into the tube with force, like alzer.
Then anoint the syringe with oil, or with butter, and egg white: and have the patient sit on a seat, and bathe the bladder and his penis with moist oils, and olive oil, and warm water.
Then insert the syringe into the penis carefully, until it reaches the root of the penis.
Then double it above from the region of the navel.
Then push the syringe within it, until it reaches the Bladder, and the patient feels that it has already reached an empty space: and this does not happen according to this order, except because the passage, in which it goes, is one in which there is tortuosity.
Then extend the thread with the wool gradually.
For the urine will follow the wool.
Then extract it, and make the Urine flow through the urinary path: and repeat the syringe, and do not cease doing this, until the bladder is emptied, and the patient finds relief.
¶ On the method of administering an enema to the bladder with a Clepsydra.
Chapter 59.
When an ulcer occurs in the bladder, or blood congeals in it, or pus becomes confined in it, and you want to instill waters and medicines into it: then it should be done with an instrument which is called Clepsydra, and this is its form.
For it is deaf, that is, closed.
And in it there are three holes, two on one side, and one on the other side, as you see.
And the hollow space, in which is that which pushes, should be of such size that it blocks itself without addition, until when something is drawn with it, from the fluids it is drawn up: and when it is pushed, with it it is expelled to a distance: just as does the clepsydra, with which naphtha, that is, Greek fire, is thrown in the battles of Mars.
Therefore when you want to inject fluids into the bladder, insert the end of the clepsydra into the fluid, and draw with that which pushes upwards, for the fluid is drawn into the cavity of the clepsydra.
Then insert its end into the penis, according to what we described in the syringe.
Then push the fluid with that which pushes for that fluid reaches the bladder immediately, so that the patient feels it.
Form of the fine clyster with which the bladder is given an enema.
Let it be made from silver, or brass: whose higher end should be similar to a small alcama, and below it a cavity between which the ligament may fall.
Then take a ram's bladder, and put in it the fluid with which you wish to give an enema to the bladder.
Then bind it between two cavities with a strong binding with a double thread: and warm that fluid a little over fire.
Then insert the end of the clyster into the penis, afterwards squeeze your hand over the bladder with the fluid with proper pressure, until the patient feels that the fluid has now reached the bladder.
But if you do not have a bladder present, then take a piece of parchment, and make from it a circle, and perforate it around its whole circumference.
Then insert a strong thread in those holes, as they are wound around.
Then gather the circle, as the alsofratu is gathered: after you put in it what you want from fluids, and oils, and waters.
Then bind it to the instrument: and do with it as you did with the bladder by squeezing with your hand, until the fluid reaches the bladder.
¶ On the extraction of Stone.
Chapter 60.
We have already spoken about the division of types of Stone, and its treatment with medicines: and I have spoken about the difference between Stone generated in the kidneys and bladder, and the signs of all that: and I have spoken about Stone in which operation by hand and cutting is appropriate: and it is Stone generated specifically in the bladder: and that which becomes fixed in the penis: and I am narrating that with clear exposition and brevity.
Therefore I say that Stone generated in the bladder most often occurs in boys.
And among its signs is that urine exits from the bladder similar to water in its thinness: and white sand appears in it, and the patient rubs his penis, and struggles with it, and many times it hangs down.
Then it becomes erect, and the anus comes out with it in many of them.
And the healing of boys is easy, from it until they reach fourteen years.
And it is difficult in old men.
In young men however it is intermediate, in what is between that: and he whose Stone is larger, treatment is easier: and if small, its treatment is the opposite of that.
Therefore when we come to treatment, it is necessary first that we clean out the patient with an enema, which extracts all the feces that is in his intestines: for it sometimes prevents the finding of the Stone during examination.
Then let the patient be taken by his feet, and shaken, and moved downwards: so that the Stone may descend to the bottom of the bladder, or let him jump from a high place several times.
Then make him sit between your hands prepared, and his hands should be under his thighs, so that the whole bladder becomes inclined downwards.
Then examine him, and touch him from the outside.
If therefore you feel the Stone in the space, then proceed immediately with an incision over it.
If it cannot be felt under your touch at all, then you must clean the index finger with oil of your left hand, if the patient is a child: or the middle finger if it is a grown youth: and insert it into his anus, and search for the Stone, until it comes under your finger: and gradually turn it toward the neck of the bladder.
Then press upon it with your finger, and push it outward toward the place where you wish to make the incision: and instruct the assistant to press the bladder with his hand, and instruct another assistant to pull the testicles upward with his right hand: and with his other hand, to remove the skin that is under the testicles in the part from the place where the incision is.
Then introduce the cutting Spatula, whose form is this.
And make an incision in the area between the anus and testicles, and not in the middle, but to the side of the left buttock: and let the incision be over the stone itself, with your finger in the anus: and let the incision be transverse, so that the external cut is wide and internally narrow, according to the size that would allow the Stone's exit, no larger.
Perhaps indeed the finger that is in the anus compresses the Stone at the incision, and it exits without difficulty.
And know that among Stones there are those that have angles and edges, which makes their exit difficult because of that.
And among them are smooth ones, similar to an acorn, and round: and their exit becomes easy.
For those that have angles and edges, increase the incision.
If it does not exit thus, then you must devise a way to deal with it: either grip it with a suitable instrument whose tip is like a Moon, which grips the Stone and doesn't let it escape: or introduce beneath it a thin instrument with a curved end.
If however you cannot manage it, then widen the opening a little.
If some blood overcomes you, stanch it with vitriol.
If the stone is more than one, then first push the large one to the mouth of the bladder.
Then cut over it.
Afterward push the small one after that: and similarly do if there are more than two.
If it is very large, then it is ignorance to cut over it with a large incision.
For one of two things happens to the patient, either he dies, or continuous urinary dripping occurs: because the area does not heal completely.
Rather, manage its expulsion until it exits: or devise a way to break it with forceps, until you extract it piece by piece.
When therefore you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with frankincense, and aloe, and dragon's blood: and bind it, and place over it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or rose oil, and cold water: to calm the hot swelling.
Then lay the patient back on his neck, and do not loosen the bandage until the third day.
When therefore you have loosened it, bathe the area with water and plenty of oil.
Then treat it with diaphoenicon ointment and basilicon ointment until it heals.
If however there occurs in the wound increased hot swelling, and erosion, and similar things: as if blood congeals in the bladder, and urine is prevented because of it: and this is recognized by the exit of blood with urine.
Therefore insert your finger into the wound and extract that blood.
For if it remains, it leads to corruption of the bladder and its putrefaction.
Then wash the wound with vinegar, and water, and salt: and counter each type with what is suitable from the treatment, until it heals.
And it is necessary during all hours of treatment to bind the two thighs together, and gather them, because of the medicines which are placed over the area.
If the stone is small and is lodged in the passage of the penis, and gets stuck there, and blocks the exit of urine: then treat it with what I will describe before you proceed to cutting.
For many times you may be spared from cutting through this treatment, as I have indeed proven it.
And it is that you should take a Perforator made of iron from Africa, which has this form: with a triangular end, sharp, fixed in wood.
Then take a thread and tie the penis with it below the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
Then insert the perforating iron into the penis carefully, until the Perforator reaches the stone itself: and rotate the Perforator with your hand on the stone gradually: and attempt to perforate it until you make it penetrate through the other side.
For the urine is released immediately.
Then press your hand over what remains of the stone on the external part of the penis.
For it breaks and exits with the urine, and the patient is healed.
But if this treatment is not suitable for you, due to something that prevents it: then tie a thread below the stone, and another thread above the stone.
Then cut above the stone in the penis itself between the two ties.
Then extract it.
Afterward, loosen the binding, and clean away the congealed blood that forms in the wound.
And the binding of the thread below the stone is only necessary so that it does not return to the bladder: and the other binding above, only so that when the thread is loosened after the exit of the stone, the skin returns to its place and covers the wound: and because of that it is necessary for you when you tie the upper thread, to lift the skin upward, so that it returns upon your completion and covers the wound, as we said.
¶ On the Extraction of Stones in Women.
Chapter 61.
Stone rarely forms in women.
But if a stone occurs in any of them, then the treatment is difficult and is prevented for many reasons.
One of them is: that the woman perhaps is a virgin.
And the second is, because you do not find a woman who will reveal herself to a doctor, when she is chaste, or among those having husbands.
The third is, because you do not find a woman well-versed in this art, especially operation by hand.
And the fourth is the distance to the location of the stone: wherefore it requires deep cutting, and in that there is fear.
But if necessity drives to that, then it is proper that you take a female physician, well-knowledgeable: and few are found.
But if you are deprived of her, then seek a chaste, skilled physician, and present a midwife well-trained in women's matters, or a woman who in this art suggests a portion of skill: therefore make her present, and instruct her especially, that she do everything that you instruct her regarding the investigation of the stone.
First what is necessary, is that she look if the woman is a virgin: then it is proper that she insert her finger into her anus, and search for the stone.
If therefore she finds it, let her constrain it under her finger, and then instruct the midwife to insert her finger into the vulva of the patient, and investigate the stone, after she places her left hand over the bladder, and compresses it with good pressure.
If therefore she finds the stone, then it is proper that she gradually move it from the orifice of the bladder downward with the full extent of her strength, until she arrives with it at the root of the hip.
Then let her cut above it at the opposition of the middle of the vulva at the root of the hip, from whichever part is prepared for her, and feels the stone in that part: and let her finger not be removed from the stone, constraining under it: and let the cut be small at first.
Then let her insert the probe over that incision.
If therefore she feels the stone, then let her increase the incision according to the proportionate amount that the stone exits from it.
Know that there are many types of stones.
Among these there is small and large, smooth and rough, long and round having branches.
Therefore know its types, so that through this you may be informed about what you want.
If therefore blood overcomes you, then add ground vitriol to the place, and hold it for one hour, until the blood is stopped.
Then return to your operation until the stone comes out: and prepare with you the instruments which I mentioned for extracting stones in men, so that you may be aided by them in your operation.
But if the flow of blood overcomes you, and you know that the discharge of blood is from an artery that has been cut: then put powder on the place, and bind it with bandages with proper binding: and do not change it: and leave the stone, do not extract it.
For perhaps the sick woman will die.
Then treat the wound.
When therefore the sharpness of the blood subsides after days, and the place becomes putrid, then return to your operation until the stone comes out.
¶ On cutting for watery Hernia.
Chapter 62.
A watery hernia is nothing but a collection of fluid in the white sifac [membrane], which is under the skin of the testicle containing the egg: and it is called sifac.
And sometimes it is in its own proper membrane, which nature prepared for it in the part of the egg, until it is thought: that it is another egg, and it is the skin of the testicle between the white sifac, which we mentioned: and this happens only rarely.
And indeed the generation of this hernia is from weakness which happens to the testicles: wherefore this matter flows to them.
And sometimes it happens from a blow to the testicles.
And this fluid has many colors.
For either its color tends toward yellow, or it is bloody red, or murky, black, or it is watery white, and this is what is more common.
And the signs by which it is known where the collection of water is, are these.
For if it is in the white sifac which we mentioned, then the swelling is round with slight length like the shape of an egg: and the testicle does not appear, since the fluid contains it on all sides.
And if the fluid is in its own proper membrane, then the swelling is round with part of the egg, and because of this one thinks that it is another egg.
And if the fluid is between the skin of the testicles and the white sifac, then it falls under perception.
When therefore you want knowledge of the color of the fluid, then test the color of the fluid in the swelling with the square probe, whose form preceded.
According to that therefore which comes out in the trace of the probe, judge what is within it.
When therefore we come to treatment with the iron [surgical instrument], then it is necessary that you order the patient to be bled if that is possible for him, and you see his body is full.
Then let him lie back on his back on something slightly elevated, and place many cloths under him.
Then sit you on his left, and order the assistant to sit on his right, who should extend his penis to one of the two sides of the skin of the testicles, and to the part of the abdomen wall.
Then take a broad spatula, and cut the skin of the testicles from the middle lengthwise, up to near the pubis: and let the cut be according to the straightness of the parallel line which divides the skin of the testicles, until it reaches the containing white sifac: and excise it and observe, or beware of this, that you cut it: and let your excision by which you excise it be from the part which is suspended with the egg more: and carefully scrutinize with the excision according to the amount that is possible for you.
Then perforate the sifac full of water with a wide perforation, and extract all the water.
Then separate between the two lips of the cut with hooks, and extend the sifac upward, and do not touch the containing skin of the testicles: and cut the sifac however it is possible for you to cut it, either in its totality, or piece by piece, especially its thin side.
For if you do not carefully examine in cutting it, there is no security that the water will not return.
But if the egg proceeds outside from its skin at the time of your operation: then when you will have completed the cutting of the sifac, return it.
Then bring together the two lips of the skin of the testicles with suture.
Then treat it like other wounds, until it heals.
If you find the testicle corrupted by another blackness, then you must tie off the vessels which are the suspensory, fearing blood flow.
Then cut off the testicle with its suspensory, and remove the testicle: afterward treat it as we have described.
If water is collected in both parts, then know that there are two hernias: therefore cut the other part just as you did in the first one equally.
And if it is suitable for you to make it one operation, then do so: then wipe away the blood.
And insert into the incisions wool soaked in oil, or in rose oil: and place outside other wool which you have soaked in wine and oil, and spread it over the two testicles and the abdominal wall: and place folded cloths above, which are small cushions: and tie them above with a bandage, which has six [parts] according to this form.
Then let two cloths be taken and sewn, and filled with carded wool, according to this likeness: and let the ends which press be made from cotton, or moist wool: and let them be gathered with tightness in the waistband of the breeches: and let one end extend over the anus up to the back, and the second extend to the pubic region: and two ends over the two thighs below, and two other ends over the two groins, and let all the tightness be gathered in the waistband of the breeches.
And sometimes this hernia is skillfully treated with cautery in place of cutting with iron: that is, take a fine knife-like cautery, and cut the skin of the testicles with it: and it is heated, as we have described: until when the white membrane containing the water is exposed: then take a cautery, according to this form.
It resembles a Greek letter.
Then pierce that membrane with it while it is heated, until all the fluid comes out.
Then stretch the membrane with hooks, and strip it away with a fine heated cautery, and cut it as much as is possible for you, until you remove all of it.
And be careful of the testicle, lest the fire touch it.
And know that this operation is safer, and further from blood flow, and better than the operation with cutting.
If however during the time of cutting, or during the time of cautery, you encounter opposition from a hot swelling, or blood flow, or something else: then you must treat whatever opposes you from that with the treatment that suits it, according to what was previously stated.
If however the patient is fearful, and does not await this operation, because of its horribleness: then perform the perforation according to what I describe: which is.
When it is certain to you through what we said about the signs, that the hernia is watery: then you must have the patient sit on a raised seat.
Then pierce the swelling in its lower part with a broad spatula: and make the perforation according to the length of the body, and let the opening be wide, until all the water runs out.
Then place cotton on the spot, and bind it, and leave it so that the remaining water runs out: then treat it until the wound heals.
If however there is resistance to the water's exit at the time when you pierce it: and this is only because the white membrane creates resistance at the opening of the wound, and prevents the water's exit: then you must insert a quill into the wound, or the instrument with which dropsy water is extracted, whose form was described before: or increase the operation of the wound slightly.
And know that the water returns and collects after six months, or thereabouts.
Therefore when it collects, let it be pierced in the same way, and the patient will pass his days.
¶ On the treatment of fleshy hernias.
Chapter 63.
Know that in cutting into this hernia, there is a fear leading to destruction in most conditions.
Therefore it seems to me better to leave it alone than to operate on it.
And I am recalling the operation for it, and the types of swelling.
I say therefore, that many swellings occur in the bodies from which the testicles are composed: and this happens from many causes, namely:
Either from sharp or acrid excess fluid, which flows down to the testicles.
Or from a blow.
And the color of the swelling matches the color of the body, and no pain is found in it: and it is a heavy swelling.
And perhaps it is a stone-like swelling, whose color is dark, and it has no sensation.
And sometimes it occurs from knotting of arteries, and their inflation: as has already been mentioned before: or from inflation of veins.
That which is from inflation of arteries is recognized by the condition of the swelling, when you compress it with your fingers.
And you should not touch it at all.
That which occurs from inflation of veins does not disperse at all when compressed with fingers.
And it is indeed possible that an incision be made on this type and on the remaining flesh: that is, that you cut the skin of the testicles.
Then pull the egg upward, and extract it with the white membrane: and free the suspensory from the vessels, and tie off the vessels: and cut the suspensory after you free it from every part of the egg parts.
If therefore the egg is consolidated with those grown flesh parts, then you must pull the egg and cut it.
And if there is adhesion between any part of the membrane, or in what is between the vessels: then you must free all that adhesion, and cut it with a circular incision.
If however there is flesh growth in the place of adhesion which is behind: then you must cut all of it, and extract the egg, as we said.
When therefore your operation is complete, then fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine: then treat it with the remaining treatment until it heals.
¶ On the treatment of hernia which is with Vine.
Chapter 64.
Vine is a swelling wrapped in a certain wrapping, similar to a grape cluster, with softening of the testicles: and movement and exercise become difficult for the patient, and walking.
And in the treatment of this illness there is fear, because of that which was mentioned before.
But it is necessary that we describe the operation for it according to what the ancients did.
I say therefore, that you must have the patient sit on an elevated seat.
Then push the suspensory of the testicles downward.
Then hold the skin of the testicles with your fingers, with the vessels that are near the penis: and let another assistant hold them, and stretch them with strong extension.
Then cut with a broad sharp spatula a transverse incision in line with the vessels, until the vessels are exposed.
Then peel back from every part, as we told you in the extraction of arteries which are in the temples.
Afterward fix in them a needle in which is a double thread, and tie it in the first of the places where the Vines occur: and tie it again in the last of them.
Then cut them in the middle with a straight incision according to the length of the body, and extract what is collected from the corrupt feculent fluids.
Then treat the wound with the treatment of other wounds, in which you want pus to form, so that the vessels which nourish one of the testicles fall off.
For there is no harm in that.
If however Vine occurs in all vessels, then you must extract the testicles with the vessels because of this: so that the egg is not deprived of nourishment, because of the incision, and wastes away, or dries up, and there is no benefit with them.
On the Treatment of Intestinal Hernia.
Chapter 65.
The occurrence of this hernia is from a tear that happens in the peritoneum stretched over the belly in the region of the groin from the abdominal wall.
Therefore the intestines descend from that rupture to one of the testicles.
And this rupture is either from the peritoneum, or from its stretching.
And these two types occur from many causes: either from a blow, or jumping, or shouting, or lifting a heavy object, and similar things.
And the sign, when it is from stretching of the peritoneum:
It is that it happens gradually over a long time, and does not happen suddenly: and the swelling is even towards the depth: because the peritoneum compresses the intestine.
And the sign when it is from a tear in the peritoneum, is that it causes from its beginning a sudden severe pain: and the swelling is irregular, appearing close under the skin: and that is because of the exit of the intestine, and its path to the outside of the peritoneum.
And sometimes the omentum comes out with the intestine: and this is called intestinal and omental hernia: and sometimes it occurs with gas.
And sometimes feces run into the intestine, and are retained there: and with this is the patient's peril: since it causes terrible pain, and especially when pressed.
And in the treatment of the types of this disease with iron [surgery] there is fear: therefore one must be cautious of mishap in it.
And the method of operation is that you instruct the patient to return the intestine with his hand to the interior of its cavity, if it submits to return.
Then he should lie back upon his neck between your hands: and raise his legs.
Then stretch the skin that follows the skin upwards, and cut the whole skin of the testicles lengthwise.
Then fix hooks in the two lips of the incision, according to what you need to open the incision with them: and let the incision be of such size that it is possible for an egg to come out through it.
Then strip away the covering membrane and what is under the skin of the testicles, until when the white, hard peritoneum is exposed from all sides: then insert your index finger into what follows the testicle, into what is between the white peritoneum, which is under the egg's skin, and between the second peritoneum, and free with it the adhesion which is in the posterior part of the egg.
Then move the skin of the testicles inward with your right hand: and with this pull the white peritoneum upward with your left hand: and lift the egg with the peritoneum to the part of the incision: and instruct the assistant to pull the egg upward: and you release the adhesion which is behind with complete separation.
And search with your fingers so that there is not anything there from the intestine wrapped in the hard white peritoneum.
But if you find something of it: then push it down into the belly.
Then take a needle in which there is a thick thread, made into a wick from ten threads: and insert it at the end of the peritoneum, that is, of the membrane which is under the skin of the testicles which follows the incision: then cut the ends which protrude from the thread, until there are four threads.
Then arrange some of them over others in the form of a cross: and tie with them the peritoneum, of which we spoke, which is under the skin of the testicles with a strong ligature, until none of the vessels which nourish them can send anything to them: so that no hot swelling occurs from it.
And place again a second ligature outside the first ligature, distant from it less than two fingers.
And after these two ligatures leave from the peritoneum, which is under the skin of the testicles, the quantity of the size of a finger: and cut all the rest according to the circle, and remove the egg from it.
Then cut in the lower part of the skin of the testicles an incision, from which blood and pus flows: as we narrated in what was presented before.
Then apply wool soaked in oil, and place in the wound: and apply the ligature which we described.
And sometimes the white peritoneum which we mentioned is cauterized, after its incision fearing the flow of blood.
For many times that happens.
And leave the ligature until it falls off by itself.
But if its falling is delayed, then foment it with hot water: and place upon it that which we mentioned, until it falls.
Then treat the wound with the remaining treatment of wounds, until it heals.
¶ Concerning windy hernia.
Chapter 66.
In this type of hernia, I have not seen anyone who dared to treat it with iron [surgical instruments].
And indeed the ancients said that it is done as we described in the hernia which is with the vine.
That is, that you should bind the vessels after cutting above them with care below: then cut in the middle, and finally treat it with what opens it, until the vessels fall off: and treat the wound, according to what we said, until it heals.
¶ Concerning the rupture which occurs in the groin.
Chapter 67.
When a rupture occurs in the groin, as we said, and the area protrudes, and nothing from the intestines descends to the testicles: and if it descends, it is little, and returns at all times: but if time prolongs with it, the fissure in the peritoneum increases, until the intestines descend into the peritoneum.
And this occurs from the extension of the peritoneum, which is in the groin, as we said.
That is, because the peritoneum stretches: then it softens, and the area swells, and protrudes.
And its treatment is with cautery, as was previously described.
And sometimes it is treated with iron [surgical instruments], in this way: that is, that the patient should lie on his back between your hands.
Then cut the swollen and protruding area of the rupture, with a cut across the width, about three fingers wide.
Then compress the peritoneum and what is under the skin, until when the white peritoneum that is under the skin following it is exposed.
Then take a probe, and place it over the protruding area of the peritoneum, and press it toward the depth of the belly.
Then sew the two protruding places over the end of the probe from the peritoneum, and bind them together with sutures: then remove the end of the probe.
And do not cut the peritoneum at all, nor stretch an egg, nor anything else, as I made you know in the treatment of intestinal hernia.
Then treat it with treatment of wounds.
When you therefore cut the threads, clean it, and restore the wound, until it heals.
Indeed the peritoneum contracts, and the protrusion of the rupture does not increase.
And cautery is better in this place: since it is closer to safety.
¶ Concerning the softening of the skin of the testicles.
Chapter 68.
Often the skin of the testicles becomes soft in some men, because the flesh between them softens, and its appearance becomes unsightly.
Therefore it is necessary for one who is asked to treat it, to make the patient lie on his back, and cut all the skin that has softened above the natural skin.
Then join the two lips with sutures: and if you wish, first sew the excess of softened skin with three or four sutures, and secure the suture.
Then cut between the sutures.
Then treat with the treatment of other wounds, until it heals, and the threads fall out.
¶ Concerning Castration.
Chapter 69.
Know that Castration in our law is excommunicated: and because of that it would be permitted for me not to mention it in this book of mine: and its mention is not necessary, except for two reasons.
One of which is that it should be in the physician's knowledge when he is asked about it: and that he should know its treatment when it happens to someone.
And the other reason is that we often need castration of certain animals, for our benefit through that, such as rams, goats, and cats, and similar animals.
I say therefore, that Castration is done according to two methods.
Either through crushing.
Or through splitting and cutting.
In that which is done through crushing, the way of operation is: that we make the animal sit in hot water, until its testicles soften, and become smooth, and hang down: then crush them with your hand, until they dissolve and do not appear under touch.
In castration through splitting and cutting, it is necessary that you hold the animal, and press the skin of its testicles with your left hand.
Then tie the suspensory, and cut above each egg with one cut, until when the two eggs come out: then cut them after you have skinned both, and do not leave on them any of the peritoneum except the thin peritoneum, which is over the vessels.
And this method of castration is better than that which is done through crushing: since crushing perhaps leaves something of the testicles, wherefore the animal desires coitus.
Then treat the wound until it heals.
On the treatment of two types of Hermaphrodites.
Chapter 70.
A hermaphrodite in men exists in two forms.
One of them is when there appears in the following space, or in the skin of the testicles, in what is between the two testicles, a structure like a woman's vulva, in which there are hairs: and sometimes urine flows from what is in the skin of the testicles.
In women however there is one type, and it is when a woman's vulva above the pubic area has what look like very small male testicles, protruding outward: of which one is like a man's penis, and two like two testicles.
And the treatment of the three types, two in men and one type in women, is: that you should cut away the additional flesh until their impression disappears.
Then treat them like other wounds.
In the second type in men, from which urine exits, which is in the skin of the testicles, there is no operation, nor is there any treatment at all.
On cutting the Clitoris and protruding flesh in women's vulvas.
Chapter 71.
The clitoris sometimes grows beyond what is natural, until its appearance becomes unsightly and ugly: and sometimes in certain women it grows so much that it expands like in men, and reaches the point of coitus.
Therefore you should hold the excess of the Clitoris with your hand, or with a hook, and cut it: and do not cut too deeply, especially at the deep root: so that bleeding does not occur.
Then treat it like wounds, until it heals.
The grown flesh is flesh that grows in the opening of the womb, until it fills it: and sometimes it extends outward like a tail: and because of this some of the ancients call the condition "tailed."
Therefore we should cut it as we cut the Clitoris, and treat it until it heals.
On the treatment of Alratica, which is an unpierced woman's vulva.
Chapter 72.
Alratica is when a woman's vulva is not pierced, or has a small opening.
And it is either natural or accidental.
The accidental type is from a previous illness: and it indeed occurs either from additional grown flesh, or from thin or thick membrane: and occurs either in the depth of the womb, or in its sides, or in its upper part, or its lower part: and it prevents coitus and pregnancy, and birth, and sometimes prevents menstruation.
And knowledge of it comes through the midwife's examination, if the blockage is visible and close.
If however it is not visible, then seek it with your fingers, or with a probe.
If however the blockage is from thin membrane, and is close to the two lips: then proceed quickly, and break it open.
And it is done by placing cushions under the two lips.
Then place the index fingers of your two hands together, and the woman should lie on her back with her legs spread.
Then stretch the two lips forcefully, until the thin membrane breaks, and the blockage opens.
Then take wool, and soak it in oil, and place it on the spot: and let the woman have intercourse every day, so that the area does not heal over again.
If however the membrane is thick, dense: then you should cut it with a broad spatula similar to a myrtle leaf.
If however the blockage is from grown flesh, then suspend it with hooks, and cut it: and have with you medicines that stop bleeding without causing pain, such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and frankincense mixed with egg white.
Then apply a wide lead tube, so that the wound does not heal too quickly, keep it there for several days: and apply a dry linen wick, then treat with the remaining treatment until it heals.
And sometimes other flesh growths occur in the womb: therefore they should be cut according to this method: as long as it is not a cancerous tumor for a cancerous tumor that is in the womb should not be opposed with iron at all.
On the treatment of hemorrhoids, athehelil, and red bothor in women's vulvas.
Chapter 73.
Hemorrhoids are indeed openings of vein orifices, from which much blood flows continuously.
When hemorrhoids become old, they become thelil: and I have already discussed their types in the classification, and their signs: and I will say here which of them receive treatment, and which do not.
Therefore I say that hemorrhoids which are in the orifice of the womb and are not apparent to the senses: then there is no treatment with iron [surgical instruments].
However, those of them that are in the orifice of the womb which can be sensed are those which can be treated.
Therefore it is necessary to bring the woman into a cold room.
Then extend the athehelil with forceps, or with rough cloth, and cut them from their roots.
Then powder them during the blood flow with one of the cutting powders without causing pain: such as acacia, dragon's blood, frankincense, and similar things.
Then have her press her feet against the wall for one hour.
Afterwards, place her in cold water.
If the blood flow persists: then make her sit in a decoction of sumac, pomegranate rinds, galls, and similar things.
Then take barley flour, mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster with it on her back.
If therefore the blood is stopped with this, it is good: and if not, apply cupping vessels to the back and breasts, without scarification.
Then take wool, and submerge it in tarathit juice, or plantain juice, or juice of alaulat branches, that is, oak, with Pontic wine, and apply it to the area.
When therefore the swelling subsides, then treat the area with ointments until it heals.
The red albarth is similar to the heads of alhaasse, and has a rough appearance.
Therefore it is necessary that you cut what appears of it, according to what I said about thelil equally: and treat it until it heals.
On the perforation of Swelling which occurs in the womb.
Chapter 74.
Many types of swellings occur in the womb, such as cancer, and stony swelling, and ulcers, and adubelati, and alekilati, that is, herpes, gangrene, and fistulas, and hemorrhoids, and fissures, and thelil, and hot swelling.
And I have indeed already discussed all these diseases and their types, and their signs, and their treatments in the classification: it is necessary that I discuss in this treatise the hot swelling that occurs in the womb, when it is among the swellings that collect pus, and you want to know how its opening is made with iron [surgical instruments].
Therefore it is necessary that you consider.
Then if the pain of the swelling in its beginning is acute with its striking, and inflammation, and fever: and you see it redden: if sensation falls upon it, then do not hurry with its perforation: and treat it with that which helps with maturation, until when the acuteness of the symptoms subsides.
Then it is necessary that you make the woman sit on a seat that has two seats, and let her recline, or lean back on her back, and gather her feet to the lower part of her belly: and let her thighs be spread, and let her place her arms under her knees, and bind both with a binding suitable for that.
Then let the midwife sit at the right side, and administer the instrument by which the orifice of the womb is opened.
Whose form comes in those which are after.
And it is necessary when you want to administer this instrument, that you fix with the Probe the depth of the woman's womb: so that what enters from the instrument is not more than the depth of the womb, and harm the patient.
If however the instrument should be greater than the depth, then it is necessary that you place small cushions above the covering of the depth of the womb: so that the entrance of the whole instrument into the depth of the womb is prevented: and it is necessary that she place the pivot, which runs in the instrument, from the upper side: and that she hold the instrument, and that the assistant turn the pivot, until the depth of the womb is opened.
When therefore a swelling appears, and is touched by hand, and is soft and yielding: then it is necessary that you cut it at its head with a broad spatula.
When therefore the pus is evacuated, then it is necessary that you place in the wound a pledget soaked in rose oil: or green oil, in which there is some astringency: and place the pledget, and draw out the incision in the depth of the womb.
And place externally over the womb and over the pubic region clean wool soaked in water in which mallows have been boiled.
Then after two days it should be treated with an ointment that is suitable for that, until it heals.
And sometimes the womb and wound are washed, such that it is cleansed with water and honey: then with water in which lily root or long birthwort has been boiled: then return to the ointment.
But if the wound should be hidden inside the womb, then you must refrain from treating it with iron, rather treat it with what we have described in the division.
¶ Instructions for Midwives, how they should treat living embryos that have emerged in an unnatural position.
Chapter 75.
It is necessary for the Midwife to know first the form of natural birth.
Among its signs therefore is that when you see a woman bearing down, and desiring to breathe air, and what is above her of the birth becomes lighter for her, and the exit of the embryo hastens: then know that this birth is according to the natural position, and its exit is upon its head, and the afterbirth with it: or suspended, or hanging from the umbilical cord.
When therefore you see these signs, then it is necessary that her belly be compressed, so that the embryo descends quickly.
For when it descends upon its head, the afterbirth descends with it, and it is cleansed from those superfluities with good cleansing.
But that which is other than this birth is unnatural, unfavorable.
For sometimes the fetus emerges upon its feet, and its body emerges before its head, and its feet, and one hand, or one foot: or its head and its hands emerge: or it emerges belly-first: and perhaps it turns upon its neck, and similar unfavorable positions.
It is necessary therefore for the Midwife to be prudent, subtle in all these matters, and to beware of error and deception: and I am showing every position of these, and what the technique is in it, and it is signified through that, and one should stand upon it.
When the fetus emerges upon its head in its natural emergence, and this becomes difficult for the woman, and birth becomes hard for her, and you see her strength now weakened: then make her sit upon a seat, or let women hold her: and steam her vulva with cooked fenugreek, and with moist oils.
Then let the Midwife introduce between her fingers a small spatula, and split with it the afterbirth, and cut it with her nail, until what is in it of moisture runs out: and press the woman's belly until the fetus descends.
If however it does not descend, then it is necessary that the woman be given an enema of fenugreek mucilage, with sesame oil.
Then command her after the enema to bear down: and make her sneeze with condisi, and hold her mouth and her nose for one hour.
For the fetus will emerge immediately.
But if two hands of the fetus emerge first, then it is necessary that you return them with ease gradually.
If however it does not obey in entering, then place the woman upon a seat, and raise her feet upward: then shake the seat upon the ground: and let the woman be held, so that she does not fall during the shaking.
If therefore the hands do not emerge, and the fetus dies: then cut them, and extract the remainder of the fetus: and bind its hand with cloth, and extract it with evenness: for it will emerge.
¶ Exit of the embryo by its feet.
When the fetus comes out by its feet, then it is necessary to push them upward: then turn the fetus gradually: afterwards straighten it.
Then take one of its feet, and extend it gradually.
When therefore they come out up to the hips, then instruct her to push, and make her sneeze with condisi: for it will come out, if God wills.
And if it does not come out with what we have described, then return the fetus gradually, until you place it according to the natural position.
For it will then come out with an easy exit.
And if it is prevented with all that we have described: then take from marshmallow mucilage, and sesame oil, and dissolved gum: and pound everything in a mortar with good pounding: then anoint with it the woman's vulva, and lower belly.
Then make her sit in tepid water, until it reaches the hypochondria.
When therefore you see that her lower parts have been warmed, then make for her a suppository of myrrh: and insert it.
When therefore she holds the suppository for one hour, then make her sit upon a seat.
Then make her sneeze: and close her mouth and nose: and press the lower part of the belly with gentle pressure.
For the fetus will come out immediately.
¶ Exit of the fetus upon knees and hands.
When it comes out according to this form, then be ingenious in introducing your hands gradually.
Then let the woman lie back upon her neck, and let her feet hang downward: and let her be lying upon a bed, and fold her hands.
Then press above her belly gradually.
Then remove what is under her feet from the pillows, until she is prepared in the lower part.
If the fetus does not come out, then take its feet, and move them with vigorous motion.
Then press what is above the hypochondria gradually, until the fetus ascends to the upper parts.
Then let her introduce her hands, and straighten the fetus gradually: and instruct the woman to push, until the fetus comes out.
¶ Exit of the fetus hanging laterally from the hands.
Be ingenious in returning its hand.
If however one cannot return it, then raise the woman, and make her walk.
If truly she cannot walk, then make her lie upon a bed: and shake her legs with vigorous shaking.
Then administer the liniment which you prepared from the mucilages.
If labor takes her, then make her sit upon a seat.
Then work on returning the hand, and straighten the fetus according to the natural position: and make the woman sneeze, and instruct her to push herself, until it comes out.
¶ Exit of the fetus upon its neck, with hands spread, and its face is to its mother's back.
It is necessary that the Midwife hold the hand of the fetus, then turn it gradually, and straighten it with ease.
When therefore it is straightened, then place upon her vulva what we described of oil and mucilages.
Then instruct her to move gradually.
When therefore you have done that, then make her sit upon a seat, and instruct her to lean to the right side.
Then instruct her to push: and make her sneeze with condisi.
¶ Exit of the fetus prepared upon the side.
When it descends to the opening of the womb according to this manner with the afterbirth, then cut the afterbirth with your nail, until it is emptied of moisture.
If therefore it hangs over the face of the fetus, and its neck, then cut it from the navel: so that it is not retained, and dies.
Then push the fetus to the interior, until you place it according to what is necessary: and instruct the woman to push herself several times: for it will come out with a light exit.
On the Delivery of Twins or Multiple Fetuses:
Know that twins are often born: and sometimes three and four are born.
However, this is unusual, and rarely happens.
Five indeed is something against nature, and they do not live at all: and one placenta contains them, however many they may be: and they are separated by a membrane, distinguishing between them, attached to each of their umbilical cords.
And sometimes they come out as one fetus does in a natural, easy delivery: and they come out in an unfavorable delivery, as we have described.
But if some of them are difficult during birth, and arrive in what we mentioned about unnatural positions, then treat them as we have described: and let the midwife be skillful, and do what she does with ease and patience, and let her be ingenious according to each position with what is prepared for her from ingenuity leading to safety.
On the Remembrance of What Forms in the Womb from Embryos, and Abortions:
Sometimes one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and more than ten form in the womb: and it has been verified by me that a woman in miscarrying expelled seven, and another fifteen, all formed.
This was done by the measurement of the glorious wise one.
All this therefore should be in the knowledge of the Midwife.
For perhaps something similar will come to her: therefore let her oppose it with what is necessary.
On the Extraction of a Dead Fetus:
Chapter 76
When you treat a dead fetus with what I said in the section on medication, and it does not come out, and you are forced to use operation by hand, then you must consider.
If therefore the woman is of sound strength, and is not with any of the conditions from which destruction is feared for her: then the woman should lie back on a bed, on her back, and her head should be inclined downward, and her legs elevated: and an assistant should hold her on both sides, or she should be tied to the bed, so that her body is not pulled during the extraction of the fetus.
Then moisten the mouth of the womb with humid oils with marsh mallow mucilage, and fenugreek, and linseed.
Then let the Midwife anoint her hand with these oils and mucilages: then let her insert it into the womb with ease.
Then let her seek with it a place where she may fix hooks into the fetus, and places suitable for that.
Consider therefore then, if the fetus is prepared to descend upon its head: then fix the hooks in its eyes, or in its neck, or in its mouth, or in its palate, or under its chin, or in its throat, or in places near the ribs, and under the hypochondria.
But if the descent is upon its feet, then in the pubic area, and its middle ribs.
And it is necessary that she hold the hook with the right hand: and place its curve between the fingers of the left hand: and insert it with the hand with ease, and fix the hook in any of those places which we mentioned, until it reaches an empty space.
Then fix opposite it another hook, or a third, if you need: so that the traction is equal, and does not lean to one side.
Then let it be extended with equal extension, and let the extension not be only according to straightness, but rather moved to every side, so that its exit may be easier: as is done with a tooth during its extraction.
And it is necessary in what is between that, that the extension be softened.
But if a part of it is retained, then the Midwife should anoint some fingers with oil, and insert them from the side, so that she may turn with them what is retained.
If therefore a part of the fetus comes out, then let the hooks be moved to another place which is higher: do this until the whole fetus comes out.
If therefore a hand comes out before the others, and it is not possible to reduce it, because of its constriction: then it is necessary that a cloth be wrapped around it.
Then pull it until when it comes out completely, cut it either at the joint of the palm, or at the elbow: and thus it is necessary that you do with the other hand, and with the two feet.
If however the head of the fetus is large, or experiences constriction during exit, or there is water collected in its head: then it is necessary to insert between the fingers a spiny spatula, and split the head with it, and extract the water: or break it with the instrument which is called Almisdac: whose form comes with the forms of the remaining instruments in the chapter which follows this.
Similarly one should do if the fetus has a naturally large head, then it is necessary to cut the cranium: or extract it with the misdach, as we said.
Then pull the bones with forceps.
But if the head emerges, and is constricted at the collarbone: then let it be split, until the fluid which is in the chest is poured out.
If however it does not fold, nor yield to exit: then cut the head piece by piece, according to what is possible for you.
But if the lower abdomen is swollen, or there is dropsy in it: then it is necessary to pierce it, until fluid runs out of it.
If truly the fetus is on its feet, then its extraction is easy, and its direction to the mouth of the womb is light.
If however it is constricted at the belly, or chest: then it is necessary to extract it with a cloth which you have wrapped around your hand: and split the belly, or chest, until what is in them runs out.
If however the remaining limbs are removed, and the head returns: then let the Midwife insert the left hand.
If therefore the mouth of the womb is open, then let her insert the hand into the depth of the womb, and seek with it the head, and pull it with the fingers up to the mouth of the womb: then insert in it one hook, or two hooks, and pull it with it.
But if the mouth of the womb is constricted, because of a hot swelling which happens to it: then one should not labor over it, rather it is necessary then to administer pouring of moist, fatty things: and administer plasters: and let her sit in waters which soften and moisten.
But if the fetus is on its side, then it is possible that it may be straightened: then let be administered what we said regarding the living fetus.
But if that is not possible, then let it be cut piece by piece, and extracted.
And it is necessary that you do not leave anything from the afterbirth inside at all.
When therefore you have completed your operation, then administer what we said regarding hot swellings which occur in wombs.
But if bleeding occurs, then let her descend into styptic waters, and administer the remaining treatment.
And I indeed have seen a woman, in whose belly a fetus was dead: then she became pregnant over it another time, afterward another fetus also died.
Therefore after a long time a swelling occurred in her navel, and it became inflated, until it opened: and began to emit pus.
I was therefore called to treat her, and I treated her for a long time: and the wound was not consolidated.
I therefore placed upon it some plasters of strong attraction: and a bone came out from the place.
Then some days passed for her, and another bone came out.
I therefore wondered at this, since there is no bone in the belly.
I therefore thought that they were from the bones of the dead fetus.
I therefore examined the wound, and extracted many bones, with the woman being in her better conditions: and she has now lived thus for a long time, and emits a little pus from the place.
And I have not confirmed this strange thing here, except because in it there is knowledge, and help for that, which the skilled physician administers with the hand from treatment.
On the Forms of Necessary Instruments for Extracting a Fetus.
Chapter 77.
Here below is the form of the Constrictor, with which books are flattened, which has two pivots equally placed at the two ends of two wooden pieces.
However, this Pivot should be more delicate than the constrictor: and it should be made either from ebony or from boxwood.
And the width of each wooden piece should be about two fingers: and the margin of each of both is about one finger, and the length of each of them is a palm and a half: and in the middle of the two wooden pieces are two extensions of the same kind of wood, which are already firmly fixed in both, whose length is half a palm and a little more: and the width of each is about two fingers, or a little more.
And these two extensions are inserted into the mouth of the womb, so that it may be opened with them when you turn the two Pivots.
Form of the Pivot by which the womb is opened.
Another form similar to that one, more delicate and lighter.
It should be made from ebony or boxwood, similar to forceps.
However, at its end there should be two extensions, as you see here above: and the length of each extension is about a palm: and the width of each is two fingers.
Therefore when you want to open the womb with it, then have the woman sit on a bed, with her feet hanging down, with what is between her legs opened.
Then insert these two joined extensions into the womb: and you are holding the lower end of the instrument between her thighs.
Then open your hand with the instrument, as you do with scissors, evenly according to the amount you want from the opening of the mouth of the womb, until the Midwife does what she wants.
Form of another Pivot which the ancients called the Form of the Impeller by which the fetus is pushed.
Form of the Almisdac, with which a large head is crushed: and it resembles forceps, which has teeth at the end, as you see.
And sometimes it is made elongated, like forceps according to this form, as you see, which has teeth like the teeth of a saw, with which it cuts and crushes.
Form of the Almisdac with which a small head is crushed.
Form of the Hook having one spine.
Form of the Hook having two spines.
Form of forceps which has saw teeth, with which the head of the fetus is crushed.
Form of the Spatula having two ends for cutting off the head.
Form of two broad Spatulas also.
All these instruments are practiced with, and the more their types are multiplied, and are prepared at the craftsman's, the quicker he is at his operation, and the higher among people, due to his quantity.
Therefore do not despise any of these instruments, rather let it be prepared with you.
For their necessity is inexcusable.
¶ On the Extraction of the Afterbirth.
Chapter 78.
When the afterbirth is retained during childbirth, then it is necessary that you instruct the patient to hold her breath.
Then make her sneeze with white hellebore: and press your hand over her mouth and her nostrils.
If therefore it comes out by this means, it is good.
If not: then take a pot, and make a hole in its lid: and put in it herbs that open the mouth of the womb, such as calamint, rue, and dill, and chamomile, and wormwood, and cinnamon bark, and centaury: take all these herbs, or some of them, and submerge them in water, and put them over fire.
Then place a reed tube over the hole in the pot's lid, and the other end in the mouth of the womb: and hold it until the vapor reaches the cavity of the womb.
Then make her sneeze, as we said.
For the afterbirth will come out with ease.
But if it remains after this treatment, and does not come out: then instruct the midwife to dip her hand in sesame oil, or marshmallow mucilage.
Then let her insert it into the vulva, and search with it for the afterbirth.
When therefore she finds it, then let her take it, and extend it gradually.
But if it is attached deep in the womb, then let her insert her hand, according to what we have described, until when she finds the afterbirth, and extract it gradually in a straight line, so that the womb does not prolapse during violent pulling: rather it is necessary that it be moved gently to the right and left sides: then increase the amount of pulling.
For it will yield then, and be preserved, and escape from adherence.
But if the mouth of the womb is constricted, as we have already described: treat it with sneezing, and with the pot treatment with herbs.
However if it does not come out with all that we have described, then beware lest you tire yourself with repeated extraction attempts.
Indeed it is necessary that whatever protrudes to the mouth of the womb from it, you tie to the woman's hip.
Then give her an enema with tetrapharmacon ointment.
For it will cause it to rot after some days, and it will dissolve, and come out.
However when it rots, a foul odor rises from it to the stomach and head, and this harms the patient.
Therefore it is necessary that suitable fumigations be administered for this.
Indeed some of the ancients have tried fumigation with watercress and dried figs.
Form of the instrument by which a woman is fumigated during retention of the afterbirth and menses.
Let it be made of glass similar to an alembic, or of copper: and let the wide end be placed over fire: and let the fumigation be placed over coals: let her hold it, until that fumigation is consumed: and repeat with another.
¶ On the Treatment of an Imperforate Anus.
Chapter 79.
Many children are born, and their anuses are not perforated, which a thin membrane has already blocked.
Therefore it is necessary that the midwife perforate that membrane with her finger: and if not, perforate it with a sharp spatula: and let her beware of the muscle, lest she touch it.
Then place over it wool soaked in wine and oil.
Then treat it with ointments, until it heals.
But if you fear that it may become blocked, then place in the opening a lead tube for many days, and let it be removed when the child wants to defecate.
And blockage of the anus also occurs from the healing of a wound, or abscess.
Therefore it is necessary that that healed tissue be cut, then treated with what we mentioned regarding treatment and lead.
On the Treatment of Fistulas that Occur in the Lower Part.
Chapter 80.
Fistulas that occur in the lower part are Nodules and Swellings that occur near the anus externally: or in the space of one of its parts: and it is either one Fistula, or many.
When therefore this Nodule becomes old, it opens, and from it runs a white watery fluid, or thin pus.
And sometimes these Fistulas are penetrating.
Therefore penetrating ones are recognized by that which comes out with defecation, and wind, when the patient defecates: and perhaps a worm comes out of them.
And among them are Fistulas which, when they are in this space, penetrate up to the bladder, and up to the urinary passage.
And among them are those penetrating up to the hip joint, and up to the tail bone.
That by which a Fistula penetrating to the anus is known, also from a non-penetrating one, is that you should insert your index finger into the anus: and insert a thin probe into the Fistula made of bronze or iron: when there is no tortuosity.
But if there is tortuosity in it, then insert into it a thin lead probe, or a horse hair, until you feel the probe or hair with your finger.
But if you do not feel it at all, nor does anything come out of the opening from defecation, nor wind, nor worm as I said: then know that it is non-penetrating: therefore hasten to treatment.
And when the Fistula is penetrating up to the bladder, or to the urinary passage: then its sign is the exit of urine from it, and its prevention from healing with medicines.
If indeed it is penetrating up to the hip joint, or to the hip bone: then its sign is that the probe reaches there, if there is no tortuosity in it up to the bone: and the finding of pain in the surrounding area, and that pus always comes out of it: and that treatment does not work on it, nor does it heal with ointment.
And in all these penetrating Fistulas there is no cure at all: and their treatment is labor and vanity for him, from foolish physicians, upon whom it is imposed.
In that which is not penetrating, and not old, healing is hoped for with iron: according to what I tell you, and I have already tested: and it is that the patient should lie between your hands on his back: and raise his legs up above his hips, and his hips should be inclined toward his belly.
Then insert a lead or bronze probe, if there is tortuosity in the Fistula, until you know where the probe reaches.
If however the patient feels it near the anus, then it is necessary that you insert your index finger into the anus.
If therefore you feel with your finger that the probe has already penetrated by itself exposed, without feeling between your finger and it membrane or flesh: then therefore know certainly that it is penetrating: therefore do not labor on it, since there is no cure for it, as we said.
They have said however, that flesh heals in some men, and from treatment by which help is hoped for it, it is that you should heat a thin cautery according to the width of the Fistula, as preceded, and insert it heated into the Fistula, until it reaches near the anus.
Then repeat that twice, or thrice, until you know that all those added filtered flesh parts, which are similar to bird quill tubes, have already been burned.
Then treat that with wicks wrapped in butter, until those flesh parts which were burned come out: then treat that with ointments generating flesh and consolidating.
If therefore it heals, it is good.
And if not, then it will never heal with another treatment.
And if the probe comes out, and does not reach up to your finger, which is in the anus, and there is between it and the probe a thick covering of flesh, or membrane: and you see the Fistula in that which follows the surface of the skin, then cut the skin from the beginning of the Fistula, and you go cutting with the probe what is in the fistula, until the cutting reaches where the probe's tip reaches, and the probe is freed and falls.
Then clean those filtered flesh parts, which resemble bird quill tubes, so that nothing remains of them.
If however the blood overcomes you, and interferes between you and your operation to cut those tissues: then the best thing to do, and of quickest benefit, is to cauterize it with fire, or with sharp medicine.
For cauterization with fire combines good conditions: the burning of those additional tissues, the stopping of blood, and the drying of moistures.
Then treat that with lint rolls soaked in butter, or with ground cabbage, until the site releases pus, and those burned tissues come out in pus.
Then treat the wound with consolidating ointments that generate hard flesh: and these are medicines which have astringent and drying properties.
For when they are restored, then it is already healed: and you need not fear recurrence.
If however the Fistula has already reached to the depth of the anus, and extends from the excess of the body: then insert your finger into the anus, and investigate with it.
If therefore you feel the probe, and between you and it there is a membrane of peritoneum, or flesh, and it is close to penetration: then there is no operation in that case, except according to the way of confidence and hope.
Which is, because one of three methods is administered in it: either that you cauterize it, as we said: or cut it, until you reach its cavity, so that it becomes possible for you to insert lint rolls, and treatment from nearby.
And do not proceed much with the cutting, lest you cut the muscle containing the anus, and involuntary defecation occurs in the patient.
Then treat that with what we mentioned.
Perhaps indeed it will heal: or you may extend that membrane, and clean it after you cut it up close to the anus, as we said, either with a probe, or with another instrument with a sharp tip.
Then clean those filtered tissues which are in the incision, as far as you can with examination.
Then attempt restoration of the whole wound with the incision, and the upper orifice where it consolidates: and the Fistula remains open in the interior part of the anus, and it will be easier on the patient.
And sometimes the Fistula is sutured according to this method: that is, when you insert the probe into the Fistula: and it is on the side of the anus near the surface of the body with skin and the margin of the anus: then take a probe with a perforated tip, which is like the needle of aleskef, that is, of leather preparers, according to this form.
And insert into it a thread wound from five threads, and around them.
Then insert the probe with the thread into the Fistula, until it reaches its cavity.
If therefore it is penetrating in the margin of the anus internally nearby, then extract the thread from that hole: so that you insert your finger into the anus, and extract the end of the thread, and gather the two ends together: and tighten both, and leave that for one day, or two days: and the more the thread cuts into the flesh, tighten it well, until those tissues which are between the two ends of the thread are cut, and fall: then treat the wound, until it consolidates and heals.
If however the orifice of the Fistula is not penetrating: then make it penetrate in whatever way is prepared for you, unless it is very deep.
For it is not for you to do that because of the muscle, lest you cut it.
Then do with it as we said, until it heals.
Form of the spiny Spatumilis with which the Fistula is split, whose curve is very sharp, and the other part is not sharp, so that it does not cut what is not necessary, as you see.
On the suturing of Hemorrhoids, from which blood flows after their incision: and the treatment of fissures.
Chapter 81.
Hemorrhoids are of two types.
Either they are inside the anus, similar to coal or ember blisters: or as if they were grape seeds.
And of these some are small, and some large: and blood flows from them constantly, and there may be one, or many.
And they are outside the anus, and at its edges.
However, those that are outside the anus mostly have little moisture, from which flows a yellow liquid, or a small amount of blood in continuous flow: and they are the color of the body.
And the treatment of those that are inside the anus is that you should instruct the patient to sit down: and to strain until the anus protrudes and the hemorrhoids appear to you.
Therefore, either suspend them with hooks: or hold them with your nail.
Then cut them at their roots.
If however the hooks do not hold them, due to their moisture and softness: then grab them with rough cloth, or with cotton from a woolen doublet, and pull them with your fingers.
Then cut them, and sprinkle over them after the incision certain hot powders, to serve in place of cauterization.
Or cauterize them according to what was described in the chapter on cauterization.
Then treat them with the remaining treatment until they heal.
But if the anus does not yield to protrusion, then give the patient an enema in which there is a small amount of irritant, so that what is in the anus may be washed, and it may yield quickly to protrusion when the patient strains.
If however the hemorrhoids are external to the anus, then their matter is light, easy: and it is that you should grab them with your nail, or grab them with a hook, and cut them.
Then treat them with what we have mentioned, until they heal.
And for one who abhors cutting with iron, then it is necessary that you administer their suturing according to this method.
Take a wound thread, and insert it into a needle.
Then pull the hemorrhoid upward, and make it penetrate with the needle at its root from the other side: and wind the two ends of the thread at the lower part of the needle, and let them be widthwise: and bind the hemorrhoid with a strong binding.
Then tie the thread, and remove the needle.
Do this with all hemorrhoids, and leave one of them: do not suture it, so that the excess blood may flow from it.
Then place over the anus a cloth soaked in rose oil, or wax salve, and place it over the anus: and instruct the patient to rest.
Then leave it until it falls off.
When therefore the hemorrhoids fall off, treat them with ointments, and the remaining treatment, until they heal.
On the Treatment of Fissures.
For they often occur from the drying of feces, and constipation of nature.
When therefore they become chronic, and medicine does not help them: then it is necessary that you scrape with the point of a Spatumilis, or with your nail, until they become moist, and the upper layer which prevents them from healing is removed from them.
Then treat them, until they heal as necessary.
If however they do not heal: then repeat them with scraping more vigorous than the first, until they bleed much, and are excoriated then treat them, until they heal.
On the treatment of inverted and non-inverted Almirmar, and dry Athelil, and Formica.
Chapter 82.
Know that Almirmar is nothing but a round nodule of the same color as the body, similar to the head of a nail: and it occurs all over the body, especially in the lower parts of the feet and toes: and pain occurs from them when walking.
Therefore it is necessary that what is around the nail be cut, and held with forceps, or with a hook, and uprooted from its root.
Then treat it: and if you wish, cauterize it according to what was explained in its chapter.
Of the dry athelil, one is a small protrusion, rough, filtered, round above the surface of the body.
And they often occur on children's hands.
And its treatment is that you stretch the athelil and cut it: or bind it with a silk thread: or with a hair, until it falls off.
And if you wish, cauterize it as was previously mentioned with fire, or with sharp medicine: and indeed inverted and non-inverted athelil are uprooted with an instrument that I will describe.
Formica is also a small filtered protrusion, thick, on the surface of the body, going very deep: and when cold affects it, it feels like an ant's bite, and it occurs all over the body: and most commonly occurs on the hands.
And its treatment is that you take a small tube from a goose feather, or from a strong vulture feather: and place that tube over the Formica, until the circle of the tube contains its parts.
Then rotate your hand with the tube, until you cut what is around the Formica: and place it deep in the flesh, and uproot the Formica from its root.
And if you wish, do this with a tube of brass or iron, according to this form.
Let the top of the tube be drawn up to a height with a dull spiral, so that its grip and rotation may be easier on the finger.
And if you wish, cauterize the Formica as was previously mentioned in the cauterization of Athelil in the chapter on cautery.
On the forms of Instruments which are administered for Clysters in diseases of the Anus, and loosening of the bowels, and colic.
Chapter 83.
Sometimes a Clyster is made from silver, or from brass, or from cast or hammered copper.
And sometimes small and large ones are made from these Instruments, according to those on whom they are administered.
Therefore that which is administered in the treatment of small children should be small: and for those whose anuses are weak or painful, so too should their clysters be.
Large clyster.
Small clyster.
Its tube, that is, the upper head in which the bladder is tied, should be wide according to this manner: and it should have a distinction so that the bladder may be tied as you see, and its lower extremity which is inserted into the anus should be dull, that is, not open, very smooth, drawing to fineness: and on one of its sides there should be two holes, and on the other side one hole.
And the width of the hole should be according to the thickness of the rays, and a little thicker, and the bladder in which medicines are placed should be from an animal's bladder: or from egg membrane, which should be according to the form of a small asofrati: whose root should be one palm.
And it should be perforated with many holes as it is rotated, and the space between each hole should be the thickness of a finger.
Then insert into those holes a strong thread of raw thread, which should be of ten threads, or thereabouts, and gather with it the bladder like an asofrati.
Therefore when the bladder is placed in it, it should be bound at the head of the clyster between two distinguishing points with strong binding.
Then administer the clyster.
And this is the form of the circle of the bladder depicted here, and of the holes.
The proper method of administering an enema with it is: fill a leather bag or bladder with medicine, which should be warmed according to what the patient can tolerate: and take care that it is neither too hot nor too cold.
Then let the patient lie back on his back, and raise his legs upward: and place under him an inthaan, that is, a leather mat on which people lie, or a linen cloth.
Then anoint the tip of the clyster with oil, or with egg white, or with fenugreek mucilage, or similar substances.
Then insert it into the anus gently.
Then let the assistant take the leather bag with both hands together, and squeeze it forcefully until all that is in the clyster is emptied into the intestine.
Then remove the clyster, and let the patient raise his legs against the wall.
If the medicine compels him to evacuate, then let him hold it as long as he can.
And if he sleeps with it the whole night, it is most beneficial.
If you give him an enema for diseases involving looseness of the bowels, and evacuation happens quickly: then repeat the enema until he is healed.
If there are hemorrhoids in the anus, or painful swellings, then let the clyster be very thin and gentle, from among the clysters used for children.
And this should be the form of a thin clyster over which the skin is tight.
¶ On the treatment of head wounds without bone fracture.
Chapter 84.
I have already spoken in the division on wound treatment what was appropriate for the book, and I will speak here about their treatment by hand and with medicines in full detail.
Therefore I say that wounds differ according to that by which the wounds are made, and according to the place where the wound falls.
The things by which wounds are commonly made are like the throwing of a stone: or cutting with a sword or knife: or striking with a lance, or wood, or arrow: and similar things among many objects.
Wounds that occur according to body locations are like a wound that falls on the head, or neck, or chest, or belly, or liver: and similar body parts.
And I am narrating the treatments of certain wounds, to establish it as reasoning and rule for the remaining wounds.
And I will begin with simple head wounds: since mention of compound wounds will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
Therefore I say.
When a simple wound occurs in the head, and there is no bone fracture: consider then, if it is from throwing a stone, or similar things, and it has only broken the skin: and the wound is large, and you fear the occurrence of hot swelling in the patient: then hurry, and immediately bleed the cephalic vein: and do not delay it: and draw blood from him according to the measure of his strength: if there is nothing preventing bloodletting, especially if the blood coming from the wound is little.
And let the bloodletting be from the opposite side of the wounded part.
And let the patient guard himself against fullness, and wine, and heavy foods.
If however something prevents bloodletting, then let him reduce his food, and not approach meats, nor wines.
And place upon the wound if hot swelling occurs, cotton soaked in rose oil alone, or with wine which has astringency.
If however you are safe from hot swelling, then place upon the wound, if it is fresh with its blood, and the air has not changed it, the powder which I will describe shortly: and if the air has already changed it, then place upon it certain ointments, until it heals.
If however the wound is large, or is from a sword cut, and similar things: and the lips do not come together with compresses, then bring them together with suture, according to what I will describe in wounds of the belly about their suturing.
If however the wound is already separated from the bone, and is hanging, and there is no retention of it, except in a small suspension: then cut it off.
Then treat the wound with medicines, and restore in it hard flesh in place of skin, and prescribe to the patient, that he be nourished with foods in which there is thickness, such as heads, and cooked wheat until it is like porridge: and similar things to these.
If you find putrefaction in the skin, and it does not adhere to the bone: then cut out all the putrefied matter, and remove it: then treat that area.
If however in these wounds there is an artery, or vein from which blood flows: and it is not stopped by medicines, then investigate the artery.
If therefore you find it not cut, then cut it with a Spatumile, or bind it.
If necessity demands when what we have mentioned does not help, then cauterize it, until the blood is stopped.
If however these wounds are small, simple, then their treatment is easy, light: such that you should powder over them this powder: since it will heal them before the air changes them.
¶ Method of Making Incarnative Powder.
Take one part frankincense, and two parts dragon's blood, and three parts unslaked lime: grind all of it thoroughly, and sift it: and fill the wound with it, and bind it with good binding, until it adheres well to it, and coagulates with the blood.
Then bind it from above with small compresses, and leave it, and do not loosen it while it remains, so that it does not form an abscess.
For the medicine is not removed from it until it heals.
And sometimes lime alone does this, when you do not have frankincense at hand, and dragon's blood also performs the same operation in many of the large wounds, when it is appropriate to place it upon them and bind them, and they are fresh wounds with their blood, which the air has not altered.
But if the air has already altered them somewhat, especially when it is in summer time, then there is no purpose in applying this powder: therefore treat it with what we have mentioned, such that you place upon them certain digestive ointments: or place upon them poultices made from barley flour, made with water and honey, until they discharge pus.
Then treat them with the remaining treatment, until they heal.
If however a fracture occurs with the wound in the bone, and it is small, then extract it with a Gesti: and I will already speak about the treatment of head fractures in what is to come.
¶ Concerning Wounds of the Neck.
Chapter 85.
If however a wound occurs in the Neck, then there is no difference between it in treatment, and between a head wound when it is simple.
If however a nerve of the Neck is already cut, or an artery: then if it is a nerve, there is no remedy in it, except that its treatment should be avoided with that which causes severe stypticity, such as verdigris, and vitriol, and similar things to them.
Because they harm nerves, and contract them.
And do not place anything cold at all upon the wound: because the substance of nerves is cold, and its continuation is with the brain, which is the most noble of members: and let that with which it is treated from medicines be gentle, like lime washed with sweet water sometimes infused with oil, or with rose oil, and tutty, when it is also washed with sweet water: and other mineral stones, according to this method, and moist ointments.
If however the wound is large, then administer suturing: or compress its lips with small compresses.
Then treat it until it heals.
If indeed the wound has depth, or a cavity occurs in it in its lower part, in which pus has already collected, then perforate it in the lowest place in it.
If indeed an artery is already cut in the wound, and its blood flow has followed: then separate, or cut it, and bind it: or cauterize it, if necessity drives to that.
If however the vertebrae of the throat have already been cut, or all, and the spinal cord is saved: then gather the lips of the skin with suturing over the windpipe, and do not touch the throat, rather straighten it, and return it to its natural shape.
Then bind it with appropriate binding, and leave it for some days.
Then treat it with ointments in which there is stypticity and drying, until it heals.
If however the wound has made an impression in the bone, then examine it: then if there are bone fragments in it, extract all of them, or what you can of them: and what is not prepared, leave it until the wound putrefies, and separates and its removal becomes easier.
But if the wound is fresh, then sprinkle over it the powder which I described.
However if bone appears in the wound, and it becomes a fistula: then treat it with that which was mentioned in its chapter.
¶ On Wounds in the Shoulder Blades.
Chapter 86.
IF It is a wound from a lance, or knife: and you see its depth, then consider.
Therefore if air exits from the wound when the patient breathes through it, then know that the wound is fatal.
But if it does not have depth, and is fresh with its blood: then do not put powder in it from the first hour, nor bind it, lest blood be retained in its depth, and return to the heart, and kill the patient: but place on it an attractive ointment, and loosen it twice per day.
If indeed the ointment is not available to you, then place old cotton in the opening of the wound, so that it may absorb what exits from it of fluids: and have the patient sleep on the wound, so that what accumulates in it may flow out.
If indeed three days or more have passed since the wound, and neither spasm nor bad heart tremor nor tightness in breathing has occurred to the patient, and you see his other conditions are good: then know that the wound is safe.
Therefore treat it both with lint and the remaining treatment, until it heals.
If however its healing is prevented, and it keeps opening, then know that it has now become a fistula.
Therefore treat it according to its chapter.
And if the wound is from a sword cut, or knife, and is simple on the surface of the chest, or back: then treat it with what was previously mentioned about suturing, if it is large: or with powder, if it is small.
However if it has made an impression in the bone, and pieces have broken off from it: then examine the wound, and hasten to extract those pieces, if they are separated.
If indeed they are not separated, then leave them until the wound putrefies, for their extraction becomes easier.
The judgment in treatment of other wounds occurring in other limbs is the judgment of what we have said.
¶ On Wounds of the Belly, and exit of intestine, and their emergence.
Chapter 87.
The disruption which occurs to the belly is large, medium, and small.
From the large one therefore sometimes the intestine exits, or multiple intestines.
Wherefore their insertion and their suturing becomes more forceful and more difficult.
And small disruption also becomes difficult in another way.
It follows therefore that their reduction becomes more difficult, if you do not hasten in its insertion to its place immediately: since it swells, opens, and thickens: wherefore its entry becomes difficult.
Because of this therefore the medium disruption becomes better than disruptions: since with it the reduction of intestine does not become difficult, as it becomes difficult in these two types.
Know that the suture of the belly is according to four modes.
Two common sutures are suitable in suturing the belly, and in suturing the remaining wounds of the body: and two other sutures properly share with the remaining wounds.
Nevertheless they are more proper with suturing of the belly: and I will tell you about each one with exposition and declaration.
I say therefore that when the wound is small, and something of the intestine exits from it, and it becomes difficult to reduce it: then that is because of one of two modes.
Either because of the smallness of the disruption, as we said: Or because there is swelling in the intestine due to the coldness of the air.
When therefore it is thus, then it is necessary that you warm it, so that you submerge a sponge, or damp cloth in tepid water alone.
Or cook squinant and cyprus and spikenard in water, and foment the intestine with it, until the swelling resolves.
Sometimes wine in which there is astringency does this: and it is better than water alone in resolving the swelling.
When you see that the swelling has already subsided, then moisten the intestine with water in which marshmallow or mallow has been boiled.
For through this its entry is eased with a small matter.
If however its return is prevented after this treatment, then make a small incision in the rupture with the instrument used to cut hemorrhoids.
And the first treatment is better when it is prepared than cutting: and there should be no compulsion to cut after necessity and lack of instrument.
Let one part of it which is twisted be sharp, and its other part not sharp, and let the thin end not be with the thinness of a Spatumilis, but rather somewhat blunter: and that is what resembles a caiada, as you see.
When therefore the wound is widened and the intestine enters, then it is necessary that its reduction be according to its natural form in its proper place, if this is possible: since it is better.
When truly the rupture is wide in the lower part of the belly: then it is necessary that you make the patient lie on his back, and place his legs higher than his head.
And if it is in the upper part of the belly, then place his head and his chest higher than his lower parts.
And similarly if the rupture is in one of the two parts of the belly, then direct your attention and your consideration always to this, that the part in which the wound is should be higher than the other part.
And thus it is necessary that you manage this in large wounds and in medium wounds.
In small wounds however, place it according to what is prepared for you.
Then have present at your hands a dutiful assistant, who holds the entire rupture with his hand: and brings together its edges.
Then uncover from it to the one who follows the suture something after something: and this is the method of common single suture.
And it is that you take a needle, or a number of needles according to the size of the width of the wound.
Then leave from the end of the rupture the length of the ring finger, that is, the medical finger: and fix one needle without inserting a thread into it in the two ends of the skin, with the two ends of the sifac which is under the skin from the inside, until you make it penetrate from the other side, and you have already brought together the two ends of the skin and the two ends of the sifac: and they become four rows.
Then tighten with a double thread around the needle several times from both sides simultaneously, until the two edges of the wound are brought together in a proper joining.
Then leave the thickness of a finger also, and fix another needle in them: afterward secure it with thread, as you did with the first needle.
Do not therefore cease doing this with what you need from needles, until you complete the constriction of the entire wound.
And let the needles be medium between thickness and thinness: since very thin needles quickly cut the flesh: and thick ones are difficult to insert into the skin: because of that it is necessary that they be medium in thinness and thickness.
And it is not necessary that the needle be fixed in the two ends of the skin very close: so that the flesh is not cut quickly, and the wound opens before its consolidation, and they should not be extended also with suture, so that the wound is not prevented from consolidation.
Then cut off the ends of the needles, so they do not harm the patient during his sleep: and place on them cushions of cloth from every side, which hold the ends of the needles: and leave them until you know that the wound has already consolidated.
And indeed this type of suture with needles in such a way is more suitable in small wounds.
Since one needle suffices in their suture, or two, or thereabouts.
The second suture is a common one, where you join together with suturing four edges: two edges of skin, and two edges of the peritoneum at once, with a needle threaded with an even thread in terms of thinness and thickness.
Then when you have passed the needle through these four edges, bring the needle back from the side where you began, so that the drawn thread falls from the upper part of the wound: so that the suture is like the stitching with which cloths are bound, and place between each suture the width of a little finger.
This suture is known to men.
And with this suture I sewed up a wound that had occurred to a man in his belly, who had been wounded with a knife, and the tear of the wound was larger than one palm: and about two palms of the middle intestine had protruded, and the tear was in the middle of the belly.
Therefore I returned it after his intestine had remained outside the wound for 24 hours.
The wound was therefore consolidated in a space of about 15 days: and I treated him, and he was healed: and he lived many years after that, going about his affairs.
And the physicians had judged that he would not be healed.
And it was miraculous that I did not treat it with ointment.
For I was in a place where no ointment could be found, nor any medicines.
I therefore placed old cotton on the wound twice a day, and continued washing it with honey water until it was healed.
I will describe two types of specific sutures according to the narrative account.
And it is that you begin with a sharp suture: and insert the needle from the outside to the inside.
When therefore the needle penetrates the skin and the muscle running along the length and width of the whole body: leave the edge of the peritoneum on the side where you inserted the needle, and make it penetrate into the other edge from the inside to the outside at the other edge of the abdominal wall.
When therefore you have made it penetrate, then make it penetrate according to this in this same edge of the abdominal wall from the outside to the inside: and leave the edge of the peritoneum, which is on this side, and make the needle penetrate into the other edge from the inside to the outside: and make it penetrate with your penetration which you make it penetrate in the peritoneal edge of the abdominal wall, which is on its side, until it penetrates it completely.
Then begin also from this same side, and sew it with the edge which is from the peritoneum on the other side, and draw out the needle from the skin which it penetrated.
Then return it into that skin, and sew the edge of the peritoneum, which is on the other side, with this edge of the abdominal wall: and draw it out from the skin which is on its side, and do that once, and again: and do that time after time, until you sew the whole exterior according to that example.
And the summary of this suture is that you sew with the furriers' suture with which they sew skins: so that you sew the peritoneum once from one side with the edge of the skin: and that you leave it another time from the other side, until you complete it.
The second type of specific suture, which Galen mentioned.
His account is narrated thus, that you sew it according to the similarity with which some physicians sew them, such that they gather every part to its matching counterpart by nature: and they join the edge of the peritoneum to its other edge, and the edge of the abdominal wall to its other edge.
And that is done according to what I tell you.
It is necessary that you fix the needle in the edge of the abdominal wall near to you from the outside, and make it penetrate to the inside in it alone: and leave the two edges of the peritoneum.
Then turn the needle, and make it penetrate from the outside to the inside in the two edges of the peritoneum, namely on both sides.
Then turn both, also make both penetrate from the inside to the outside, in the two other edges of the abdominal wall, which are on the opposite side.
And this mode of suturing is better than the common easy suture, and it is the suture whose remembrance preceded.
This is therefore also Galen's account.
And some said.
The suture of the belly is rectified with two needles.
That is, insert a single thread into both of them: and begin with the insertion of the needle from your side, and make it penetrate to the other side, according to the suturing method of those who sew leather evenly.
And know that when the rupture is in the middle of the belly, then its suturing is more difficult than in other areas of the belly.
The treatment protocol for the wound is indeed the protocol for other wounds.
That is, when you encounter a fresh wound with its blood, before the air alters it: and you return the intestine, and suture it, and adjust it: then apply the powder that promotes flesh growth.
But if the air has already altered the wound: then apply to it certain ointments which you have at hand, until they cause pus: and the threads fall out, and the sifac and mirach [abdominal layers] heal.
Then treat it as you would treat other wounds, until it heals.
If you don't have medicines at hand, then immediately after it begins to discharge pus, place old cotton on it: and change it twice a day, as I taught you, until it heals.
For you do not need other medication in most conditions, when the wounds are simple.
But if you fear that the wound might affect vital organs with injury, then you should soak soft wool in oil of moderate warmth, or in rose oil: and place it around the areas between the groin and under the armpits.
But if he feels pain, or punctures, or putrefaction in his intestines (for this often happens), then give him an enema with astringent, black, tepid wine: especially if putrefaction has already reached the intestine, and an abscess has formed penetrating to its cavity.
And know that what is from the large intestine heals more easily: and what is from the small intestine heals with more difficulty.
The intestine which is called Jejunum does not accept healing from a wound that occurs in it at all: and this is because of the abundance of veins in it, and their size, and because of the thinness of its body, and its proximity to the nature of nerves.
But if what protrudes from the wound is omentum, and you encounter it fresh: return it according to your method of returning intestines evenly.
But if time has passed, and it has already become green or black: then you must tie it with a thread above the place that has blackened, so that blood flow does not occur.
For in the omentum there are veins and arteries.
Then cut what is beyond that ligature, and leave the two ends of the thread hanging from the lower part of the wound outside it: so that its attraction and extraction may be easier for you when the omentum falls and the wound discharges pus.
¶ A reminder about wounds that occur in the Intestine.
When a rupture occurs in the Intestine, and it is small: then it is possible that it may be restored in some people: because I saw someone who was wounded in his belly by a lance strike, and the wound was on the right side of the stomach, and the wound became old: and turned into a Fistula, and excrement and wind came out of it.
Therefore I applied treatment, until I was not confident in his healing: nor did I cease to make it finer, until it was healed, and the area was consolidated.
After I saw the area was already consolidated, I feared for the patient, that something bad might happen to the patient in his belly: but nothing bad happened to him from that.
And he remained in his better conditions, eating and drinking, and having sexual relations, and entered the bath, and exercised in his daily routines.
And some experienced practitioners have already said that when a wound occurs in the Intestine, and it is small: then it should be bound according to this method.
And it is that you should take large-headed ants.
Then bring together the two lips of the wound, and place one of these ants which has an open mouth over the two lips of the wound.
When therefore it grabs onto them, and tightens its mouth, cut off its head, for it adheres and does not loosen.
Then place another ant near the first, and do not cease doing this with ant after ant according to the size of the whole wound.
Then return it, and sew the wound.
For those heads remain attached to the Intestine until the Intestine is nourished and heals, and no harm whatsoever happens to the patient.
And it is also possible to bind the Intestine with a fine thread: which has been cleaned from an animal's intestine, attached to it after it is inserted into a needle.
And it is that you should take the end of this thread from the intestine, and clean it thoroughly.
Then tie a fine linen thread wrapped at its end.
Then insert that thread into a needle, and sew the intestine with it.
Then return it into the rupture.
And this method of suturing with ants and intestine is only according to the way of confidence and hope.
Know that a wound that is large, wide, especially if it is in one of the small intestines: then there is no ingenious solution except making it finer, nor is there any healing for it at all.
¶ On the treatment of Zuchemen and Fistulas.
Chapter 88.
Know that every wound or abscess when it grows old and ancient, and becomes an ulcer, and does not consolidate, and always emits pus, and does not stop: then it is universally called a Fistula in whatever member it may be, and we call it Zuchemen.
A fistula indeed is in truth a hardened, white, filtered nodule: with which there is no pain, which has a cavity like a bird's feather: and because of that some call it Risati, that is, a feather.
And at certain times it is moist, which emits pus.
And perhaps the moisture is cut off at certain times.
And sometimes this moisture is abundant, and it is scarce: and it is thick, and it is thin.
And I have already explained in the division, when I spoke of wounds, that every ulcer that does not heal, nor does flesh grow in it, is only due to one of nine causes.
Of which one is either due to scarcity of blood in the body: or due to its poor quality: or because between it and above its lips there is hard flesh, preventing the growth of flesh: or because it has much filth and dirt: or because the ulcer itself is putrid, and the matter which is sent to it is of poor quality: or because the medicine is unsuitable in its treatment: or because the corruption falling in the region is a kind of pestilence, or by a characteristic in the region, as happens in Caesaraugusta: in which the digestion of diseases becomes difficult, and the healing of swellings is delayed there by nature: or because in it there is one bone, or a number of bones.
And I have already shown all these causes and their signs, and their treatments with medicines in the division: and it is necessary here that I make you know the treatment of Fistula and Zuken, which is done by way of operation with the hand.
Know therefore, that Fistula occurs in all members of the body.
For among them are Fistulas which reach to the great veins and arteries, or nerves, or peritoneum: or to the intestine, or to the bladder, or to any of the ribs: or to any of the vertebrae of the back, or to any of the compound joints in composition: like the hand, and foot: and among them are those which go to the proximity of a principal member, and similar things.
Therefore whichever of these Fistulas is according to this manner, is among the diseases difficult to heal, and does not accept treatment, and occupation with it is labor and ignorance.
But if there is among the Fistulas one whose depth does not reach to these places which I mentioned: and you hope, and trust in its treatment, and wish to arrive at knowledge of it, then take a probe of bronze, or iron, if the Fistula extends in a straight line, and examine it with this.
But if in the Fistula there is tortuosity, then investigate it with a probe of fine lead.
Because lead with the softness of its body is lightened, and curves around the tortuosity.
But if the Fistula has many orifices, it is not possible for you to mark it with a probe.
Therefore irrigate from these one orifice from among its orifices.
For the moisture with which you irrigate it goes toward the other orifices, and runs out of them.
Then carefully inquire according to what manner is possible for you: so that you may know whether there is bone there, or nerve, and whether the Fistula's cavity is distant or near: or whether it is one Fistula which has many orifices, and stand upon all that, with the sum of your strength: with your questioning, by which you question the patient, and finding of pain during compression with your hand over the place, and similar things from signs and causes occurring to the swelling.
When therefore you have stood upon all those things with true standing, then proceed to treatment according to confidence: and it is, that you consider then, if the Fistula is near appearing, or in a safe place distant from a joint, or from a nerve, or artery, or vein, or one of the places which I told you: then cut the Fistula according to what was set forth from my narrative, and remove what is in it from filtration, and corrupted flesh, which grows in its orifice from flesh, or granulation, and similar things: and treat it until it heals.
But if the Fistula is of distant depth, and is according to straightness: then it is necessary that you cut it in depth as much as is possible for you.
Then clean it from all its corrupted flesh.
Then apply bandages soaked in sharp medicines: and insert them up to the cavity of the Fistula which you have grasped with the iron: do this with it several times, until the sharp medicine erodes all corruption that remained in the cavity of the Fistula.
Then restore it with ointments that generate healthy flesh, until it heals.
If indeed it does not heal through that, then cauterize it according to what we have described.
If therefore the cause of the Fistula is bone, and this is certain to you: then examine it, and cut it according to what I told you: if nothing prohibits you such as a vein, or nerve, or principal member, as we said.
If therefore the bone is exposed to you, and there is some corruption in it, and blackness: then scrape it until all its corruption is removed.
Then treat it with that which causes it to grow flesh, until it heals.
But if it does not heal, and discharges pus as it did before: then know that you have not reached the complete eradication of the corruption.
Therefore expose it again, and carefully perform its scraping, and cleansing with your ultimate strength.
Then restore it.
If therefore it heals, it is good: and if not, then know that that corruption is in a remote depth of the body, which you have not reached.
Therefore you have no means in it, except to leave it to nature.
But if the corrupted bone is small, and it is possible for you, draw it out with fine forceps that are suitable for that.
If however there are many bones, then carefully perform the extraction of all of them, and do not leave any of them with your strength.
If indeed something from the humors opposes you, and there is no fear or error in cutting them: then cut those humors and flesh, if they are there, and free the bones.
If indeed you do not have the preparation for removing the bones at your time, then place upon the wound that which will putrefy it: and leave it until what is around those bones of flesh and humors putrefies.
And guard the wound so that it does not consolidate.
And let the incision which you cut in your operation be constricted.
Indeed place upon it, if you fear, cotton soaked in ground sulfur with oil: or cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment, or some of the green ointments.
For when those humors putrefy, and the bones separate from them, their removal and extraction becomes easier.
If however it is one large bone, like the shin bone, or hip bone, and similar to those, and what is corrupted from it is a large part: then scrape it with ultimate scraping, until that blackness and corruption is removed.
Then restore the wound.
If indeed what is corrupted in it is a large part, and the corruption has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to saw it, and cut it all the way to the place where the corruption has reached: then treat it until it consolidates.
And I tell you about zuken [a condition], which happened to a man in his leg: so that you may place it as an example and aid for your operation.
There was a young man aged about thirty years, to whom pain occurred in his leg, from a cause that moved upon him within the body, that is, from the interior, until materials came to the leg, and it swelled with a great swelling: and there was no external cause for him.
Time therefore extended with him with the error of physicians, until the swelling opened, and many materials ran with it.
And his treatment was postponed, until the leg became fistulated, and many orifices were made in it: all of which were discharging pus and bodily humors.
Therefore a multitude of physicians treated him for about two years, and there was not among them one wise in the art of hand [surgery], until I was called, and I saw his leg, and the materials that were running from those orifices with great flow: also all the man's body had already wasted away, and his color was yellow.
Therefore I inserted a probe in one of the places of the orifices, and the probe reached to the bone.
Then I examined all orifices: and I found them reaching to each other from all parts of the leg.
I hurried therefore, and cut above one of those openings, until I exposed part of the bone: and I found it corrupted: which was already eroded, and blackened, and had rotted, and was perforated, until it had penetrated all the way to the marrow.
Therefore I sawed what was exposed to me, and prepared from the corrupted bone.
And I determined that there was nothing in the bone except that corruption, which I cut away and sawed.
And I had already eradicated it.
Then I applied restoration of the wound with consolidating medicines for a long period.
And it did not heal.
Then I tried, and exposed the bone again above the first exposure: and I found the corruption continuous with the bone: and I sawed what appeared to me also from that corruption.
Then I attempted its restoration.
And it was not restored.
Therefore I exposed it again, and did not cease cutting the bone bit by bit, and attempting its restoration: and it was not restored, until I cut from the bone about one palm's width, and extracted it with its marrow.
Then I restored it with medicines, and it was quickly consolidated and healed: and this repetition in its operation and its cutting was only necessary because of the weak condition of the patient, and his low tolerance, and my fear of his death: since in all hours he was suffering from bad fainting spells due to excessive evacuation.
Therefore he was healed with complete healing: and hard flesh grew in place of the bone, and his bodily condition became good, and his strength returned: and he went about his affairs: and the injury did not cause him any hindrance in walking at all.
But if a protruding bone in a part of the body is already broken: then it is necessary that you saw it, according to this method: which is: that you take a bandage, and tighten it at the end of the protruding bone: and order someone to extend it upward: and place another bandage of wool thicker than the first bandage.
Then bind it over the flesh that is under the bone: and extend its end, so that you pull the flesh downward: and you expose the flesh over the place which you want to saw, so that the saw does not harm the flesh.
Place wood, or a board under the bone below properly: because when you do that, it does not prevent cutting the corrupted flesh.
And it is necessary that the sawing be slightly above the corrupted place, so that there is no corruption in the cavity of the bone: and it does not appear visible to the senses, and force another round of sawing.
But if the bone is corrupted, and not protruding, rather one part continues with another part: and the corruption is in its middle, or in part of it: then expose the flesh completely from all parts.
Then place wood below.
Afterward saw it from the first part, where the corruption is, until the sawing continues from the other part: and let the sawing be lengthwise a little from the corruption, according to what we said.
But if the corruption is in a joint, cut that corrupted joint, and saw the bone where it continues from the other part.
If indeed the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then there is no solution for it except scraping.
But if the corruption is in the metacarpus of the hand, or in the metatarsus of the foot: then the matter in it is very difficult.
Indeed it is necessary that you investigate how the corruption appears to you.
And scrape it, and clean it according to whatever condition is possible for you, and with whatever technique is proper for you: when neither Vein nor Nerve opposes you.
And know that the cutting tools and Saws for cutting these bones are many, according to the position of the bones, and their preparation, and their thickness, and their thinness, and their size, and their smallness, and their hardness, and their porosity.
Therefore it is necessary that you prepare for every type of operation an instrument suitable for that operation.
And know that these operations indicate to you the type of instrument you need, when you have long study with you.
And the knowledge of the methods of this art, testimony of the types of diseases: for then you will find by yourself that which is suitable from the instruments for every infirmity.
And I am confirming to you in the end of this chapter the number of instruments, which you will set as examples upon which you will cut, and the proof by which you will experiment upon others.
Form of the Saw.
Form of another Saw.
Form of another Saw.
Form of another Saw.
This depicted form of the Saw should be properly made.
Let its upper arch and its sharpness be made of iron: and its handle of boxwood, and let it be properly made pyramidal.
Form of the Joint Rasp.
Let the head of this Rasp be according to the form of a starred nail head: and its points should be according to the form of the elischetfegi points.
And it is not suitable, except to rub with it the heads of joints, when they are corrupted, or when the bone is wide and large.
Form of the larger Rasp.
Form of the medium Rasp.
Form of the wide Rasp.
Form of the Rasp which has a concavity.
Form of another subtle Rasp.
Form of another Rasp with curved extremity.
Form of a small Rasp, of subtle grip.
Form of a Rasp with which bones are cut.
Form also of a large Rasp.
This resembles a Rod, and the extremity is like a Saw: it is used in many places for the rasping of bones.
Form of a Rasp which is suitable for rasping what has been perforated from bones.
Its extremity is triangular, with sharp ends.
It is made from Indian (steel).
And similarly it is necessary that all which we have mentioned of Rasps, and Cutting tools, and Saws be made.
¶ On the cutting of extremities, and Sawing of bones.
Chapter 89.
Extremities putrefy, either from external cause, or internal.
When therefore you have treated that corruption with treatment of medicines, and the treatment does not help: and you see corruption advancing into the limb, which nothing repels: then it is necessary that you cut that limb up to where the corruption extends, so that the patient may escape through that from death, or from an evil which is greater than the loss of a limb.
And the sign to which this happens is that the limb blackens, until it is thought that fire has burned it, or it putrefies after the blackness: until that putrefaction is cut up to that which follows that limb, and creeps into the whole body.
Hasten therefore with its cutting, and similarly if the cause of corruption is from the strike of certain venomous things: like the sea scorpion, and viper, and rutella, and similar ones.
If therefore the corruption or strike is in the extremity of a finger, then cut the finger, and do not give space to the corruption to advance up to the rest of the hand.
And similarly if it happens in the hand, then cut it from the root of the forearm bone, and do not give space to the corruption until it takes hold in the bone of the arm.
And if it invades in it, then cut the arm at the elbow in its joint.
If however the corruption passes beyond, and you see it around the elbow: then in that is the death of the patient.
And to administer treatment beyond that is a matter of strength.
And similarly do with the foot, when corruption invades in a toe, then cut it at one of the joints: and if it takes in the instep of the foot, then cut the entire foot.
If however it ascends to the knee, then cut the leg at the knee joint.
But if the corruption has already reached above the knee, then there is no device in it, except abandonment, and leaving the patient to death.
And the method of cutting a limb, or sawing it is that you tighten a ligature below, which you wish to cut: and tighten another ligature above the place.
And let one minister extend one ligature downwards: and let another minister extend the other ligature upwards.
And you separate the flesh which is between the two ligatures, with a broad Spatula, until all the flesh is exposed.
Then let it be cut, or sawed.
And it is necessary that you place linen cloth on all sides, and that the saw does not touch healthy tissue: and that no additional injury and hot inflammation occurs to the patient.
If however internal bleeding occurs while you are operating, then cauterize the area quickly: or place upon it certain blood-stopping powders.
Then return to your treatment until it is completed.
Then bind the wounded limb with a suitable bandage, and treat it until it heals.
And I tell you what happened to a man in his foot, this same incident that I am telling you about.
Which is, that blackness occurred in his foot, with a burning that resembles burning by fire: and that corruption first occurred in his toe, until it began to take over the entire foot.
Therefore the man hastened on his own, after he saw the corruption spreading in the limb with the intensity of what he experienced from pain and burning: and he cut it off at the joint, and was healed.
And after a long time had passed, that same corruption occurred in the index finger of his hand.
Therefore he came to me, and I tried to counteract that excess with what I placed on the hand from medicines after purifying his body: and the excess was not repelled, and it began to spread to another finger: until the corruption began in the hand.
Therefore he called me to cut off his hand: and I did not want to do that, hoping on my part for the repulsion of that excess: and I also feared death for him during the cutting off of his hand.
Since the man's strength was declining.
After therefore he despaired of me, he returned to his land: and word reached me about him, that he hastened and cut off his entire hand: and was healed.
And I have not brought this narrative, except that it might be an aid concerning what falls under this type of illness: and that it might be a sign by which it is indicated, and according to which one should act.
¶ Concerning the Treatment of Sinuses, and the Method of Administering Medicines with Clysters.
Chapter 90.
When inflammation occurs in certain fleshy members, and the duration of the inflammation is prolonged, until it makes a collection of pus: then it bursts, or is perforated, and what is in it of pus comes out, and an empty place remains as if it were a vessel: and the skin which is over it is like cloth that has already been thinned: and it has not reached the ultimate in its corruption, nor has it affected bone, nor nerve, nor ligament: it deserves to be named Sinus: and is not named Fistula: however if its duration is prolonged, until the corruption affects any of these members, then it is named Fistula, or zuken.
And its treatment is that you cut all that skin as it rolls back: and especially when it has been thinned, and made like cloth: and you are confident that it does not adhere with the place, because of its corruption.
If however you hope that the skin might adhere, and that ultimate corruption does not follow from it: and if in the skin there is thickness from flesh, then treat it with a Clyster: and it is, that you examine the Sinus.
Then if it is large, and the pus that comes out of it has a foul odor: then treat it with clyster with Egyptian medicine, which is of vinegar, and oil, and verdigris, taking equal parts, collected in a vessel: and they should be cooked over fire, until the medicine becomes red: and comes to the thickness of honey.
Then take from it what is necessary for you: and dissolve it with water and honey, and treat the Sinus with clyster: and tighten its orifice, and leave the medicine in it for the duration of two hours.
Then extract it with pressure: do that for so many days, until the Sinus is cleaned, and the foul smell is removed.
And sometimes it is treated with clyster with ash water, when this medicine is not present for you: and it is, that you take ash of vine wood, or ash from oak wood: and throw water upon it.
Then strain it, and treat with clyster with it, until you are confident that the Sinus has already been washed.
If the patient cannot tolerate the Egyptian medicine, nor the water of ashes, then give them an enema with water and honey, to which some ground verdigris has been mixed.
Or give them an enema with mixed honey and wine, since it is a property of honey to cleanse and wash away: and wine makes the Sinus adhere, especially when there is an excess of astringency and dryness in the wine.
When you do this several times, and you are confident that the corruption of the Sinus has been removed: then give them an enema with that which makes flesh grow in it.
And it is thus: take from the diaphenicon plaster and dissolve it with rose oil and astringent wine: or give them an enema with certain medicines and other ointments, whose properties I have written about in the treatise on ointments.
If the opening of the Sinus is narrow, such that the cannula of the enema cannot enter: then widen it slightly with an iron instrument: or place in it a tent wrapped in Egyptian ointment, or in basilicon ointment, until it is widened.
And similarly if the opening is also wide, then join its lips with sutures: and leave enough space for the enema to enter without addition.
And similarly if its opening from which pus flows is elevated toward the top: then cut it at the lowest point which is in it, so that pus may flow down from it: since when pus is confined in the depth of the Sinus, it prevents flesh from generating in it.
If it is not possible for you to cut the Sinus around its bottom according to what you want: then try to prepare the limb in such a way that pus flows from it easily according to how it is prepared for you.
Try not to retain any pus in it at all: and take consolidating medicines which are placed over the mark, suitable for what you want.
And spread them over a linen cloth.
And let the cloth be of such size that it covers the whole Sinus.
Then cut with scissors directly at the opening of the Sinus a hole, slightly larger than the opening of the Sinus.
Then spread gentle ointments over another cloth, according to the size of the hole: and place it over it at a position far from the opening of the Sinus, so that the exit of pus from it is eased: and do not remove the large cloth except after several days at once.
That which is over the opening of the Sinus is that which you remove every hour, so that what accumulates in it of pus may exit: and so that you may know whether that which flows from it of discharge is much or little: or digested or undigested.
And with this again consider the place of the Sinus itself, whether its owner feels pain in it or there is no pain in it, and whether there is swelling in it or there is no swelling in it.
When therefore your treatment proceeds in such a way, and you see the matter which exits over the opening of the Sinus, then know that the Sinus has already adhered, or approaches adherence: then therefore loose it in the morning, or on the third day: and when you loose the wound, then change another cloth, and renew the ointment.
If however there exits from the Sinus after a long time a thin discharge, then do not despair of its adherence, for its healing approaches, since among men there are those who are slow in generating flesh in their wounds, and among them are those who act contrary to that.
If however there exits from the Sinus after many days undigested pus, then know that the sinus does not adhere.
If therefore the adherence of the Sinus is delayed, and its condition is prolonged: then increase in the drying of medicines, but let physicians make it so that the medicines are moist in their substance, and dry in their virtue: like the diaphenicon ointment, when an excess of addition from zinc is added to it.
And from the most ultimate by which it is treated, is that you take diaphenicon ointment, and it is dissolved with rose oil, and ancient wine equal in its substance is sprinkled over it.
Then prepare it with this, and use it.
And it produces a similar effect, when you don't have diaphenicon ointment present, as honey does when you cook it until it thickens, and you use it.
Or take myrrh, and aloe, and frankincense: grind it all together, and sprinkle it as powder over honey while it is over the fire.
Then spread it on a cloth, and bind it tightly over the Sinus: and spread it with the honey that you cooked until it thickened: and sprinkle the spices over it, and place a cloth over it, and bind it tight.
And sometimes long aristolochia is administered in it, and roots of celestial lily, which is iris: and vetch flour, and centaury.
Use them either individually or combined, grind them, and sift them: and sprinkle them over the honey which I described, and use it.
But if the condition of the Sinus persists, and is not healed by this treatment: then know that there is corruption in its depths: or it has already made an impression in the bones, or in other hard parts, or ligaments: then treat it with the treatment for Fistulas, according to what was previously described.
On the treatment of whitlow and bruised nail, and cutting of additional finger, and section.
Chapter 91.
A whitlow is an abscess that grows under the thumbnail of the hand or foot: and perhaps it grows in the remaining fingers.
When therefore its condition is prolonged, and its treatment is neglected, and it swells with hot inflammation: or becomes corrupted, and discharges pus, until it erodes the root of the nail: and perhaps corrupts it entirely, and perhaps the corruption reaches the bone, until it has a foul odor: and the tip of the finger becomes wide, and its color becomes dark.
When therefore you treat it with what we have described in the division, and your treatment does not help: then you must cut away with an iron all the excess that remained from the nail.
Then cauterize the wound after that.
For cautery is very helpful.
If indeed the bone is healthy, and the nail is also healthy, and empty additions of the nail are now pressing the flesh inward, and begin to prick it, and harm it: then you must place a thin probe under the angle of the nail which pricks the flesh, and push it upward: and cut that flesh carefully, and place upon what remains of the flesh some burning, corrosive medicines, until all of it is removed.
Then treat it with ointments until it heals.
If however the corruption has already affected the bone, then you must cut that bone and extract it: for it never heals while corrupted bone remains in it.
But if you see the erosion and corruption advancing into the finger, then cut it at one of the joints, according to what was previously mentioned.
Then treat it until it heals.
If however the nail suffers bruising or a blow: and severe pain occurs in it, then you must first bleed the patient.
Then cut the nail with a sharp spatula in a transverse cut from above to what is visible.
And take care that the cut does not reach the flesh that is under the nail, for by that you will cause severe pain to the patient, and it will be a cause for the growth of additional flesh in the place.
Then treat the area with what relieves pain.
The additional finger which grows in some people's hands is perhaps entirely fleshy: and perhaps there are bones in some of them, and perhaps there is a nail in it: and some of them grow at the root of the joint, or its growth is in some of the finger's knuckles.
Therefore that which grows in some of the finger's knuckles does not move: and that which grows near the finger's joint perhaps moves.
Therefore of these, the one that is fleshy, its cutting is easy.
Which is to cut it at its root with a broad spatula.
But treatment of that whose growth is at the root of the joint is difficult.
Therefore refrain from cutting it.
In that which grows in the finger near the last knuckle, then you must first cut its flesh with a circular incision up to the bone.
Then saw the bone with one of those saws suitable for that.
Then treat it until it heals.
The joining together which occurs between fingers often occurs either from a person's birth, that is, they are born with it, or from the healing of a wound, or burning by fire, and similar things.
Therefore you must cut that joining until the fingers return to their natural form.
Then place between them lint or cloths soaked in rose oil: so that they do not join together quickly, and separate them: or place between them a thin lead plate, until the area heals as it should.
And similarly if joining occurs between some fingers and the palm, then cut that joining, according to what is prepared and suits the shape of the limb.
¶ On the Incision of Varicose Veins.
Chapter 92.
Varicose veins are twisted veins, thick, full of melancholic superfluities which occur in many parts of the body: and most commonly they appear in the legs, especially in the legs of travelers and laborers, and those who carry loads.
Therefore, you should administer a purging of the body from black bile several times with strong purging.
Then perform phlebotomy on the patient's basilic vein.
The treatment with the iron instrument, however, is according to two methods.
One of them is that they are cut, and the black blood is drawn out.
And the other method is that the vein is raised up and extracted completely.
The cutting of it is according to this method.
First, bathe the leg with very hot water, until the thick, murky blood is dissolved.
Then bind the patient's leg from the upper part of his hip down to the lower part of the knee with a band.
Then cut the vein in one place, or two, or three with a wide incision.
Then lift up, that is, extract the blood with your hand from the lower part of the leg up to the top, and from above it is necessary that you first perform phlebotomy on the patient.
Then cut the edge continuously downward until there comes out an amount of blood which you see to be sufficient, and which the patient's strength can tolerate.
Afterward bind it: and instruct him to abstain from foods that generate black bile: and repeat the evacuation and phlebotomy when the veins become full, and this troubles the patient.
The lifting up of it, however, is according to this method.
Shave the patient's leg, if there are many hairs on it.
Then place it in a bath: or bathe it on his leg with hot water until it becomes red and the veins swell: or let him exercise with strong exercise, if a bath is not available to him, until the limb becomes warm.
Then cut the skin directly over the vein with a lengthwise incision: either at its end near the knee, or in its lower part near the heel.
Then open the skin with hooks, and strip the vein from all sides until it becomes visible to the senses: and upon its appearance, you will see it reddish tending toward black.
When therefore it emerges from the skin, you will see it white as if it were a cord.
Then insert beneath it a probe, until when it is raised and comes out of the skin: suspend it with a blunt, smooth hook.
Then make another incision near that incision at three fingers' distance.
Then strip the skin from the upper part of the vein until it appears.
Then lift it with probes as you did before, and suspend it with another hook, as you did at first.
Then make another incision, or several incisions, if you need that.
Then lift up and cut it with a final incision near the heel.
Then draw it out to the incision which is above it.
And do this until you draw it out from the incision which is higher or highest of all the incisions, until when it comes out completely: then cut it.
If however it does not yield to you for extracting and lifting: then insert a needle with a strong double thread, and bind it, and extract it: or insert a probe under it: and turn your hand to every side until it comes out.
And take care that it is not cut.
For if it is cut, it becomes very difficult for you to lift it, and harm enters upon the patient from it.
When therefore you have extracted it completely: then place upon the site of the wounds wool soaked in wine and rose oil, or oil: and treat it until it heals.
But if the varicose vein is contracted, having tortuosity which has coiling to the sides, and is not as we said in a straight line: then it is necessary that you split over it at every part of its tortuosity and the places of its coiling.
Then suspend it with hooks until you lift all of it: and take care in your cutting over it that you do not cut or wound the vein: for it will become difficult for you to lift or extract it.
Therefore preserve your prudence.
Form of the Cutting Instrument with which Varicose Veins are Treated.
Form of the Blunt Hook.
It does not have curvature like the other hooks, nor does it have a sharp end, so that it does not wound the vein: and it has thick bendability, smooth: because if it were thin, it would cut the vein by its thinness: rather it should have excessive thickness, as we said.
On the extraction of the Leg Vein.
Chapter 93.
This vein forms in the legs in hot lands, like Alizegi and the land of the Arabs, and in dry, hot lands of little tenderness, that is, in which neither herb nor tree grows.
And perhaps it forms in other places of the body besides the legs.
And indeed its generation is from putrefaction that occurs under the skin, just as snakes and ascarid worms occur within bodies, and worms generated between the skin and flesh.
And the sign of the beginning of this vein's appearance is that severe inflammation occurs in the leg.
Then the area becomes blistered.
Then the vein begins to emerge from the site of that blister, as if it were a plant root or an animal.
When therefore its end appears, then it is necessary that you wrap around it a piece of lead, whose weight should be from one drachma keil up to two drachmas, and tie it: and leave the lead hanging from the leg.
Therefore whenever something of it comes out to the exterior, wrap it in the lead, and tie it.
But if it extends greatly, then cut off part of it, and wrap up the remainder.
And do not cut it at the root before it has all emerged.
Because if you cut it, it contracts and enters into the flesh: and causes an abscess and putrefaction in the place, and a bad ulcer.
Therefore it is necessary that it be handled gently and extracted gradually until it emerges from its end, and nothing of it remains in the body: and indeed from this vein there emerges in some men what is in length five to ten palms.
And it has come to my attention that it came out of a man to twenty palms.
If however it is cut during your treatment: then insert a probe into its opening, and pierce it with a long hole, along with the body, until all the matter that is in it is evacuated: and treat the putrefaction of the area with medicines for several days.
Then treat it with the treatment for abscesses.
And indeed this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears in the ankle joint or in the foot itself: and many openings occur to it, and from each opening emerges a branch.
Therefore treat it as we said in the division, and with what was previously mentioned.
¶ On cutting for Worms generated under the skin, and it is called the Bovine Disease.
Chapter 94.
This Disease is named in a certain land among us the Bovine Disease: because it very often occurs in cattle, and it is one small worm that is born between the skin and flesh.
And it goes throughout the whole body, ascending and descending: and is detected by sensation during its movement from member to member, until it breaks through wherever it breaks through the skin, and emerges.
And its generation is from the putrefaction of certain humors.
Just as worms and serpents occur, that is, roundworms and ascarids in the belly.
And its malice is feared.
Because when it travels in the body and rises to the head and reaches a spot: then perhaps it opens in it and emerges and destroys the eye: and this happens many times.
When therefore you wish to treat it and extract it, then this is not done except during its movement and when it is detectable by sensation.
Therefore it is necessary that you bind what is above it and what is below it with a bandage with strong constriction.
Then cut above it and extract it.
But if it goes deep into the flesh and you cannot find it: then place a cautery with fire over the spot until it dies.
And the greatest thing that is feared is its corruption by which it corrupts the eye, as we said.
If however you see it has already reached the head near the eye, then bind below it the eyebrow with good constriction.
Then cut above it and extract it.
And it is necessary that the patient use purification of his body with medicines that dissolve putrid bad humors.
And let him beware of foods that generate putrefaction.
¶ On the surgery for the illness of Nakir.
Chapter 95.
This illness is called Nakir in our land: and it is a pain that occurs in certain body parts: then it moves from one part to another.
And indeed I have seen it myself, according to what I tell you.
I was called to a sick woman in certain villages.
And she uncovered her arm, and I saw a small swelling in the rope-like vein of the arm.
And after I remained for one hour, I saw one swelling moving along the forearm, like a worm moves, ascending to her shoulder more quickly than possible: so that it was like quicksilver when it runs from place to place.
Therefore the pain left from that place, and became fixed in the shoulder.
Then I sat for one hour, and it ran through the rest of the body, until it reached the other arm.
Then she told me that it was revolving throughout her whole body, according to what I saw.
I was amazed therefore at the speed of its movement from member to member.
And indeed before that I had not seen this illness with my own eyes in such a way according to this manner.
However, I saw many who experience pain moving from member to member: but I did not see it with my eyes as I saw it in the woman.
And I do not think it to be anything except that it is because the woman was one of those from the villages with a dry body and visible veins: hence therefore that moving windiness appears to the senses.
And it is necessary that they do not appear in this way in those who are delicate, and with moist bodies, of hidden veins.
Therefore when you want to cure it, and the patient feels that pain: then if it is visible to your eye, as we said, then bind above it and below it quickly: and cut above it until that confined windiness comes out: and cauterize the place.
But if you do not see it with your eyes: then treat it with shaking of the body, and with that which expels windinesses, and disperses them with fetid pills, and pills of sagapenum, and similar things.
¶ On the Extraction of Arrows.
Chapter 96.
Arrows are differentiated according to their types, and according to the places in the body where they fall.
Their diversity indeed is: because among them are those which have large and small points: and hollow ones, and solid ones.
And among them are those which have three angles.
And among them are those which have barbs.
And among them are those which have splinters.
Those indeed which are according to the members in which they fall, are in two ways.
For either they are members from the principal hollow members, such as the brain, and heart, and liver, and lung, and kidneys, and intestines, and bladder, and similar ones.
Therefore when it falls in any of these members, and the signs of death appear to you, which I tell you about afterwards, then it is necessary that you avoid extracting that arrow from them, for death follows that person in whom it is, in most cases.
And when these bad signs do not appear to you, and the arrow is not hidden in the depth of the member, then extract it, and treat the wound.
Indeed among the signs of the brain when an arrow falls in it, and penetrates the bone, and exits the membrane which is over the brain, is: that from it occurs severe headache, and dizziness, and vertigo, and redness in the eyes, and swelling, and redness of the tongue, and spasm, and confusion of intellect, and vomiting of bile.
And perhaps blood comes out from the nostrils, or ears.
And perhaps speech is cut off, and the voice is destroyed.
And from the place of the wound comes out a white moisture similar to porridge.
And from it exits something like watery flesh.
If therefore these signs appear to you, then abstain from treatment, and extract the arrow if it does not exit.
The signs indeed of an arrow when it falls in the heart, are: that it is near the left breast: and one feels with it as if it were fixed in a hard thing, not in an empty thing.
And perhaps the arrow has a motion similar to the motion of the pulse: and black blood runs from the wound.
And this is followed by coldness of the extremities, and cold sweat, and fainting.
Know therefore, that death descends without doubt.
And the sign when an arrow wounds the lung is the exit of foamy blood from the wound: and the vessels that follow the neck swell, and the color of the patient changes.
And he exhales great, deep breaths: and seeks to draw in cold air.
If the arrow falls into the membrane which is in the chest: then it is near the small ribs: and there is great breathing with severe pain, with sighing: and all parts of the shoulders move.
And if the arrow falls into the stomach, then perhaps something undigested from the food exits from the wound.
And if the arrow falls into the Belly, and is fixed in it: something of excrement exits from the wound, or omentum, or intestine which has already been ruptured.
There is therefore no hope in its cure, nor in the extraction of the arrow.
If the arrow falls into the Bladder, and urine comes out: and something proceeds from it to the exterior, and the pain becomes stronger upon the patient: then know that it is mortal.
The remaining members, however, such as the face, and neck, and throat, and shoulder blade, and upper arm, and vertebrae of the back, and collarbone, and hip, and leg, and similar members can be saved in most cases: when the arrow does not find an artery, or nerve: and the arrow is not poisoned.
And I tell you what I have seen of these arrows, so that you may understand through it your treatment.
Which is, that to a certain man an arrow fell in the tear duct of his eye, at the root of his nose.
I therefore extracted it from the other side, under the fat of his ear: and he was healed, and no harm came to his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from a Jew, which fell into the fat of his eye under the lower eyelid: and the arrow was already hidden, and I only found its small end, with which it adheres to its wooden shaft: and it was a large arrow from Turkish bows, with smooth iron, in which there are no barbs.
The Jew was therefore healed, and no bad accident happened to his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian.
And it was an Arabic arrow, and it is one that has barbs.
I therefore cut between two veins: and it was already submerged in his throat.
I therefore worked carefully with it, until I extracted it: and the Christian was healed.
And I extracted another arrow from a man which had fallen into his belly: and we thought that he would die from it.
After therefore thirty days had passed, and nothing had changed in his condition, I cut upon the arrow: and I worked upon it with skill, and extracted it: and he was healed, and no bad accident happened to him.
And I saw a man to whom an arrow fell in his back, and the wound healed over it.
After therefore it was seven years later, the arrow came out at the root of his hip.
And I saw a woman in whose belly an arrow fell, and the wound healed over it, and the arrow remained within her: and none of her conditions changed, and the woman found no harm from it in any of her natural functions.
And I saw another man, in whose face an arrow fell: and the wound healed, and remained, not causing him much pain: and many similar cases to these.
And I extracted an arrow from a man among the King's princes, which had fallen into the middle of his nose, and had already declined slightly to the right side: and the entire arrow was hidden.
I was therefore called to treat him three days after the arrow's fall.
I found therefore the arrow wound very narrow.
I therefore searched for it with a fine probe, and did not feel it: and he indeed found a pricking and pain under his ear on the right side.
I therefore hoped that this pricking was from the tip of the arrow.
I therefore plastered the place with a plaster in which was attractive and digestive power, trusting in myself that the place would form an abscess, and the sign of the arrow would appear to me, so that I might cut upon it: and no symptom occurred in the place indicating that the arrow had reached the spot.
I therefore continued with the plaster upon him for many days: and no symptom occurred, and the wound healed meanwhile: and the patient remained concerned about its extraction for a period of days, until one day he felt the arrow within his nose.
And he told me that.
Therefore I applied a sharp, corrosive medicine to that wound for many days, until it opened: and with a probe I probed it, and felt the thin end of the arrow which was stuck in the bone.
Then I increased the opening of the wound through that sharp medicine, until the end of the arrow became visible to us: and about four months of time passed with this.
Then after the wound was widened, and it was possible for me to insert forceps into it, and move it, and it did not yield to exit: then I did not cease to think carefully, and work on it with ingenious methods, until I took hold of it one day with properly made forceps, according to the form that will come at the end of the chapter, until I extracted it.
Then I restored the wound.
And indeed doctors judge that the cartilage of the nose does not restore itself.
Therefore I restored it, and the wound was consolidated, and the patient was healed with complete health: nor did anything harm him at all.
And I tell you the method of extraction of certain arrows: so that you may make it a rule and indication for what I have not said.
Since the parts of this art and their distinctions are not comprehended through narrative: nor does a book comprehend it, and the prudent craftsman compares with little against much: and with what is present, against what is absent: and finds new operation, and new instrument for the descent of foreign things of this art when they occur.
Therefore I say that arrows do not exit from the members in which they are fixed, except according to two modes.
Either through pulling from the place from which it entered.
Or contrary to the other part.
And that which exits where it entered, either is an arrow proceeding in a fleshy place: and it is pulled, and exits.
But if it does not yield to exit from the hour in which it falls: then it is necessary that you leave it for some days, until the flesh which is around it putrefies: and its extraction and its exit become easier.
And similarly if it is fixed in bone, and does not yield to you for exit, then leave it also for some days: and attempt it with pulling and moving every day, until it exits.
But if it does not yield to you for exit after days, then it is necessary that you perforate around the arrow in the bone itself from all parts with a fine drill, until they are widened for the arrow.
Then pull it, and extract it.
If however the arrow is fixed in the bone of the head, and has already proceeded into one of the ventricles of the brain, and certain of those accidents which I mentioned appear in the patient: then abstain from pulling the arrow, and leave it, until its being is equalized after days.
For if the arrow reaches the membrane, then death is not prolonged for him.
And if the arrow is not fixed, except in the body of the bone only, and does not penetrate up to the membrane: and the patient remains for some days, and none of those accidents happens to him: then be ingenious in pulling the arrow and extracting it.
But if it is very firmly fixed, and does not yield to you for pulling: then employ small drills around the arrow, as I told you: then treat the place, until it heals.
If however the Arrow is already hidden in a place of the body, and is concealed and hidden from sense: then investigate it with a probe.
If however you feel it, then pull it with certain instruments which are suitable for pulling it.
If however you cannot [succeed] with it, because of the constriction of the wound, and because of the length of the arrow in depth: and there is neither bone there, nor nerve, nor vein: then split [the wound] above it, until the wound is widened, and it becomes possible to extract the arrow.
But if it has ears by which it is held, then free the flesh fixed in them from all parts, by every ingenious means by which you can do that, and be ingenious, if you cannot [succeed] in freeing the flesh in the breaking of the ears and twisting them, until it comes free.
And when you perform the extraction of an Arrow, wherever it may be, then use the twisting of your hand, with forceps in all directions, until you make it come out: and be extremely subtle, so that the Arrow does not break, and its removal and extraction does not become difficult for you.
If you cannot [extract] it at once, then leave it for several days, until what surrounds it putrefies.
Then try again: for then it will be easier. But if bleeding causes you trouble, then apply what we described about treatment in its chapter: and guard your skill from cutting a vein, or nerve, or cord.
And employ every possible method of Arrow removal that is possible for you: and let it be with ease, and calmness, or slowness, and firmness, as I have described to you.
And it is necessary, when you pull the Arrow, that the patient be in the same position as when the Arrow struck him.
For this is most helpful.
If however this is not possible for you, then employ whatever position is possible.
But an Arrow which exits from the opposite side, or has already proceeded somewhat to the exterior: or the tip of the Arrow makes a bulge that can be felt from above the nearby skin, and you see it protruding: then cut above it, and let the incision be of such size that the forceps can grasp it.
Then pull it: for it becomes easy to remove.
If however it is stuck in bone, then twist your hand in a circular motion, until the Arrow makes an impression in the bone, and widens [the space] for itself: then pull it.
And if not: leave it for several days: then try again, until it comes out.
If the wooden shaft of the Arrow is still in it, then push it with that.
If however the wood has fallen off, and you wish to push it: then insert a hollow instrument, so that its cavity enters the Arrow's tail: then push it with this.
If however the Arrow is hollow, then push it with an instrument that enters into it.
For the Arrow becomes easier [to remove] by this method.
If the Arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary that you hollow out all the flesh in which there is poison: if this is possible for you.
Then treat it with what is appropriate for that.
If the Arrow has fallen into the chest, or in the belly, or in the bladder, or in the side: and it is close enough that you can touch it with a probe, and it is possible for you to cut above it: then cut, and beware of cutting a vein or nerve, and extract it.
Then sew up the wound, if you think appropriate, and treat it until it heals.
And this is the form of the Forceps, with which Arrows are extracted.
Let the tips be like a bird's beak, which are made like irons: when they grasp the Arrow, they do not let it go.
And many types of these are made, large, and small, and medium, according to the size of the Arrow's magnitude, and its smallness, and the width of the wound, and its narrowness.
Form of the hollow Pusher.
And form of the solid Pusher.
This is with a solid tip like a Rod, so that its entry into the hollow arrow may be easier, and it may be pushed with it.
The tip of this hollow pusher is hollow like a bird's feather: so that the entry of the arrow into it and its pushing may be easier.
¶ On the Bloodletting of Veins.
Chapter 97.
The veins to be opened for bloodletting, which are commonly used in the body, are thirty.
Of these, sixteen are in the head: two pulsating veins, which are behind the ears, called the two Herbs: and two Arteries, which are visible in both temples: and two veins which are in the tear ducts of both eyes, which are called the Watching ones: and the vein prepared in the middle of the forehead: and the vein which is at the tip of the nose.
And two Guidegi, which are in the neck.
And two veins which are in the upper lip of the mouth.
And two veins which are in the lower lip.
And these are the veins which are called Algecherich.
And two veins which are under the tongue.
The veins which are opened for bloodletting in the arms are five veins in each arm.
One of them is the Cephalic, and it is on the outer side: and common people call it the head vein.
And the Dark one.
And there is the Middle vein, and it is composed of a branch of the Basilic and a branch of the Cephalic: and common people call it the body vein.
And the Basilic, which is positioned on the inner side: and is also called the Axillary.
And common people call it the belly vein.
And the Rope of the arm, which is positioned over the forearm: and it is the one which is opened for bloodletting, and it is the one which appears above the thumb with clear visibility.
And the Salvatella: and it is the vein which is between the ring finger and the little finger: and it has two branches.
And in the leg and foot there are three veins.
One of them is that which is under the curve of the big toe on the outer side.
And the second is the Saphenous: and its location is near the heel on the inner side.
And the Nesse vein: and its location is near the heel on the outer side.
And in the other leg there are three similar veins.
¶ On the bloodletting of the two veins behind the Ears.
The bloodletting of the two veins which are behind the Ears is beneficial for chronic catarrhs, and migraine, and sahafati, and old evil ulcers of the head.
And the method of bleeding it is as I describe.
That is, that the patient's head should be shaved: and his occiput should be rubbed in the location of the two veins with a rough cloth with good friction.
Then the patient should bind his neck with a band, until the two veins appear.
And their locations are behind the Ears in two depressed areas of the head.
Search for them with your finger, and where you feel their pulse under your finger, mark there with ink.
Then take a knife-like lancet, which is called the Cutting one.
Then insert it under the vein in the skin, until the lancet reaches the bone.
Then raise your hand with the vein and skin upward, and cut the vein with the skin in an incising cut.
And let the length of the incision be the width of two joined fingers, or thereabouts: and let out as much blood as you wish.
Then bind it with small pads, and leave it until it heals.
And their incision and cauterization has already been addressed at the beginning of the book.
¶ On the bloodletting of the two Arteries in the temples.
The benefit of bloodletting from the two Arteries which are in the temples is for chronic migraine: and severe headache, and persistent eye inflammation: and the flow of acute excessive fluids to the eyes.
And the method of bleeding them is as I describe to you.
The patient should bind his neck tightly, until the two veins appear clearly visible to the senses: and their pulse is demonstrated under your finger.
Then mark with ink.
Then lift the skin above the vein upward with your index finger, and insert the cutting lancet from below, and lift the vein upward.
And cut it, as you did with the other two veins: and let the blood flow according to your required amount.
Then release the patient's constraint, and place your finger over the vein for one hour.
Afterward, place cotton and small pads over it, and bind it above with strong constraint: and leave it until it heals.
And their mention, their incision, and their extraction has already been addressed at the beginning of the book.
¶ On bloodletting of the forehead vein after bloodletting of the Cephalic vein.
Indeed, the benefit of bloodletting from the forehead vein after bloodletting of the Cephalic vein is for chronic diseases of the face: and for migraine, and redness: and foul ulcers.
And the method of its bloodletting is according to what I will tell you.
Let the patient constrict his neck with a band until the vein appears.
Then take the instrument which is called the Fossorium.
This is its form.
Place the protruding point that is at the head of the Fossorium over the vein itself, and strike it with a comb, or with another thing like it: and let the blood flow according to the quantity you want.
Then loosen the patient's perforation, and bind it until it heals.
And sometimes it is opened with a broad lancet.
However, it is not necessary that the lancet have a sharp end, like other lancets, rather it should have a broad end.
And perform the bloodletting crosswise: since the bone is near: and perhaps the lancet would break in it when it is thin.
¶ On bloodletting of the Veins in the two Tear Ducts.
Moreover, the benefit of the two veins which are in the two tear ducts of the eyes is for the eye affected by scabies and redness: and sebel in the eye, and diseases of the face.
And the method of their bloodletting is that the patient should bind his neck with a band.
Then perform bloodletting on them: and you should be standing over his head.
And let the bloodletting be done somewhat crosswise to the length, with a small, somewhat broad lancet, for there is no flesh in the location.
For if the lancet is of thin end, perhaps it breaks.
Then let the blood flow as much as is necessary for you.
And place cotton over them, and bind them for one night, and loosen them.
¶ On bloodletting of the Veins of the Nose.
Moreover, bloodletting of the veins of the nose is beneficial for acute fever, and severe headache, and diseases of the face, such as migraine, and redness which occurs in the face: especially when it is chronic.
And the method of its bloodletting is that the patient should bind his neck.
Then hold his nose with your left hand, and take a thin, long lancet: and fix it in the middle of its hare-lip, between that which divides the nose according to straightness.
For the vein does not appear visible there, and because the blood begins to flow immediately.
And it is necessary that you steady your hand with the lancet somewhat: and let the blood flow according to your need.
Then bind it for one night.
For it heals quickly.
¶ On bloodletting of the Guidegi veins.
Indeed, the benefit of bloodletting of the two Guidegi is for constriction of breathing, and the beginning of leprosy, and melancholic diseases, and impetigo and bad ulcers, and corrosive conditions, that is, spreading herpes.
And the method of their bloodletting is that the patient should bind below both in his neck with a bandage: and the practitioner should stand over the patient's head, and the patient should be sitting on a seat.
Then perform bloodletting on the vein lengthwise with a somewhat wide incision.
Then draw out a moderate quantity of blood, or according to what you see from the necessity which exists for it.
Then do similarly with the other vein.
Afterwards loosen the bandage, and bind the two veins with moderate tightness: so that the patient is not suffocated.
And leave it until morning.
For the wound heals.
On the bloodletting of the Algeberich veins.
The benefit of bloodletting from the Algeberich veins is: because it helps with thrush in the mouth, and corruption of the gums, and bad ulcers, and cracks in the lips, and bad ulcers, even those that are in the nose and around it.
And the method of bloodletting from them is that you make the patient sit before you, and bind their neck with a band.
Then turn back their lip, and look for two veins: one of which is on the right of the lip, and the second on the left of it: and both can be identified by their blackness.
And this is true: because around them are minute, black veins.
Therefore cut both with an incising cut.
If however there is doubt upon you, and you do not know which of them it is: then intend to cut the larger of them, and the more visible one.
And similarly do with the two veins which are in the upper lip: and indeed most commonly practice runs with it: and cut the two veins which are in the lower lip.
On bloodletting of the vein under the tongue after Cephalic bloodletting.
The benefit of bloodletting from the two veins which are under the tongue is: that bloodletting of the Cephalic is for suffocations which are in the throat, and sickness of the uvula, and sicknesses of the mouth.
And the method of bloodletting from them is that the patient sits between your hands facing the sun: and raise their tongue, and look under the tongue on one side for a vein, and on the other side for a vein: and the color of both tends toward blackness.
Therefore let blood from both: and be careful, lest you take your hand too far in letting blood from them.
For under them are arteries, and perhaps there will occur a flow of blood from those arteries.
On the three veins in the elbow.
The three veins which are bled in the elbow are those in whose bloodletting practice has run in all people.
And their bloodletting is done according to two methods.
Either by puncturing with a broad myrtle-leaf lancet: or with an olive-shaped one inclined to fineness: or by cutting with a knife-like lancet, which is the Alnesil.
And this is its form.
Thus Alnesil is what is suitable for cutting.
And among them are broad and fine types according to the width of the veins and their narrowness. The form of the myrtle-leaf lancet should be broad, as you see.
And it is suitable for opening hollow, full, protruding, visible, thick veins, and those which contain thick, turbid blood.
And this lancet is of lesser width, and finer at the tip.
And it is suitable for bloodletting of fine veins, which contain thin yellow blood.
On bloodletting of the Basilic vein.
The benefit of bloodletting from the Basilic, which is one of these three veins, is:
Because it draws blood from sicknesses which are below the throat and neck, from that which follows the chest and belly: and it is proper for the bloodletter when he lets blood from it, to be careful, and to be fearful of it for under it is an artery.
If therefore he errs, and adds to the puncture of the lancet, he will cut that artery, and there will occur a flow of blood.
Wherefore it is necessary, not to let blood from it with a puncturing lancet: rather it should be cut with the Alnesil.
But if the Basilic does not appear with clear appearance, then it is necessary that you avoid it, and change to another, or seek some branch of it: or let blood instead from the Rope of the arm.
For it is visible, and cut it with the Alnesil lancet, as we said.
If however you want bloodletting from it itself, then it is necessary before binding the arm, that you touch the place, until you know the place of the pulse.
Then mark the place with ink, afterwards the arm, and cut the vein with a hollow cut with the Alnesil lancet, as we said.
And be careful lest the strike fall through space from the place of the artery.
And when you see, when you tighten the binding, swelling in the place which you marked with ink, then that swelling is the swelling of the artery: therefore avoid it.
If you see blood at bloodletting leap out like the urine of a boy, and it is thin, red blood: then know that it is from the blood of an artery.
Then therefore hurry, and place your finger over it for a long time, then remove your finger.
If therefore the blood stops flowing (for it often does stop), then bind the arm and release it: and the patient should avoid moving it, and should be cautious with it.
And he should not move it for several days, until it heals.
If however the blood does not stop, and overcomes you, and you don't have medicine present at the moment, then cut the artery, if it appears to you.
For its ends contract, and the blood stops.
Or take the bark of the pistachio tree, and split it: take one half, and bind it over the place of the vein with proper binding, with bandages and small cushions until the next day.
Then if the blood stops, it is good.
And if not: then treat it with what was previously mentioned from the section on powders that stop blood flow: and stopping its blood is not difficult in most cases, because of the small size of the wound, and the possibility of binding from the arm.
¶ Concerning phlebotomy of the Median vein.
The benefit of phlebotomy of the Median vein is that it draws blood from the upper part of the head and lower part of the body: because it is composed of a branch of the Basilic and a branch of the Cephalic, as we said.
And it is proper for one performing phlebotomy to be cautious when bleeding it, for under it is a nerve.
If therefore he goes too deep in the puncture with the lancet and finds the nerve, numbness occurs in it, and healing becomes difficult, and perhaps it never fully heals.
And this nerve is often visible to the senses.
If however it is hidden in some people, and is subtle, and not visible: then you should make your phlebotomy incision with the Alnesil, and avoid the nerve with all your strength.
But if the vein is between two nerves, then split the vein lengthwise.
¶ Concerning the Cephalic vein.
The benefit of phlebotomy of the Cephalic vein is that it draws blood from the head, and helps with diseases of the eyes.
And it is necessary specifically for this vein, if you wish to perform phlebotomy on it, to puncture it with an olive-shaped lancet, or with a myrtle-shaped lancet: since it is the safest of all veins, as there is neither artery nor nerve beneath it.
Nevertheless, during phlebotomy, it is proper for you to avoid the head of the muscle with the lancet, and seek a softer spot: and it does not harm it if it is not found with the first strike to repeat the phlebotomy on it several times.
Nevertheless, it may become swollen in some people when it is not bled on the first strike, but that swelling does not harm it in any way.
¶ Concerning the utility of Phlebotomy, and precautions to be observed in it.
The quality of Phlebotomy, and its effects, about which rectification you should think.
First therefore of that which you should know, that phlebotomy is not administered except in preservation of health, and its maintenance, and precaution against the arrival of diseases.
And that phlebotomy should be done in one of the three veins which are in the elbow, namely the Cephalic, the Median, and the Basilic.
And that phlebotomy should be done at the beginning of Spring on an empty stomach, in spring and summer: and in autumn and winter after eating, when signs of repletion appear.
And phlebotomy should be done on the first day, or on the third, after three hours of the day have passed.
But phlebotomy which is administered in diseases has no determined hour: but when convenience and necessity provoke it, at night or day, and at any hour, and at any time.
And children should not be bled until fourteen years have come upon them.
Nor should a pregnant woman be bled, except from the fourth month until the seventh.
Nor should the elderly be bled, who have already passed sixty years.
Therefore when anyone wants to be bled for whatever reason it may be: it is proper that he clean his intestines before phlebotomy with a gentle clyster, if there is much retained waste in them: so that the veins do not draw putrid superfluities harmful to the principal members from the intestines during phlebotomy.
Neither should one suffering from toctina, that is, nauseating satiety be bled: nor one who is drunk, nor one recovering from drunkenness, until that condition is removed from them.
Nor one sick with dropsy.
And bloodletting should be avoided after colic pain, vomiting, diarrhea, excessive sexual intercourse, labor, exercise, sleeplessness, fasting, and anything that dissolves strength from bodily or mental causes.
Then consider the thinness of humors before that, if the blood is thick with foods and drinks, and medicines: if that is possible for him.
Then let him enter the bath, if nothing prohibits it: or let him exercise with some exercise, so that the blood becomes thinner.
And place his bloodletting on the chest, around the third hour of the day, as we said: and strive that his chest be emptied that day of all harmful mental accidents: such as anxiety, anger, and fear: and of all bodily accidents, such as labor, pain, excessive intercourse, and similar things.
And let him have present in his seat things which people customarily use, such as aromatics, fragrances, dancing and similar things according to possibility.
Then let the bloodletter sit on a cushion that is higher than the cushion of the one to be bled: afterwards let him extend his arm, and let the bloodletter rub it with his hand two or three times.
Then let him tighten the binding with a strap, and wrap it twice.
And let the tightness be moderate, since when the tightness is uneven, or excessive in tightness, then it prevents the flow of blood: or in looseness, then it also prevents the flow of blood.
Then after the binding, it is necessary that the one to be bled rub his hands together until the veins swell and become visible to the senses.
Then let the bloodletter wipe the lancet with a little oil, specifically old oil.
Then let him place his left hand's index finger on the vein itself slightly below the place where he wants to perform the bloodletting: so that the vein doesn't slip away and the strike miss.
For among veins there is one that you will find like a fleeing string during bloodletting: and among them is one that is full of windiness: and when you place the lancet on it, it contracts under the lancet, and the bloodletter is deceived, and the lancet does not open the vein: and if it opens it, it is narrow: therefore for that reason it is necessary that the bloodletter be steady, and be careful in all these matters.
Then let him lower the lancet.
If therefore the vein opens from one attempt, then it is good.
And if not, then repeat it another time slightly below that place, or above it with haste: if the place is not swollen.
But if it swells, or if the patient becomes frightened, then leave him for a day or two days: and do not tighten the binding.
For perhaps it will draw a hot swelling.
Neither should he enter the bath.
Then let him repeat the bloodletting, if he wishes.
But if the opening is small, or the blood runs thinly: and you fear that the amount of blood you want will not come out: then repeat the lancet in the same hole in a straight line, and increase the operation slightly.
And do that with haste, before the place swells, for a swollen place occurs in many people during a small operation.
If therefore you see it already swollen, then do not repeat over it at all, for nothing will excuse you in this.
And place on it some of the dregs of oil: for it eases the flow of blood.
And it is better in this place than the oil itself, and than other oils.
And similarly administer oil dregs in all your bloodletting, with which you let blood from veins when the flow of blood is prevented: and theriac alfarach and sagzenea do that, when one of them is placed on the spot.
For blood becomes thin and dissolves, when it is thick.
But if a large swelling occurs in the place of bloodletting, for it often occurs, especially in one who has not been bled except that time, or if the opening of the vein is small, then hurry and place on the spot a sponge soaked in water and salt, warmed slightly: and bind it for one hour: for it will be resolved.
And it is necessary that you do that after the exit of blood from that vein itself, with its completion, or from another vein.
If any blackness or greenness remains in the place after some days, this is not harmful: and if you wish, put on it some aloe, or dissolved myrrh: or some juice of wild mint, that is, calamint or something similar to it.
And very often swellings and protuberances occur during the bloodletting of the basilic vein.
Therefore place your hand upon it, then if you find softness when you press upon it, then that swelling is bad.
Take care, therefore, not to put anything from what we mentioned on it.
For perhaps arterial blood will flow from it.
But make a plaster for it with something that has astringent properties, so that the area hardens.
Then treat it with the remaining treatment until it heals.
And it is necessary to draw blood from every person according to the measure of their strength.
And according to what appears from the predominant color of the blood.
For if the blood is black, then let it flow until it becomes red: and similarly if you see it is thick: then let it flow until it becomes thin: and likewise if it is sharp, until its sharpness is removed.
And for one who is full-blooded, strong, and needs blood extraction at once, the vein opening should be made wide, and the lancet should be broad: and for one who is weak, it should be the opposite of this.
And it is necessary to draw it out in stages, and the opening should be narrow: and the best procedure in bloodletting is that the cut should be transverse, not a puncture.
And this method of bloodletting is safe from blood flow and from nerve cutting: and it is more praiseworthy and safer than bloodletting through width and length.
And for one who is accustomed to fainting during bloodletting, it is necessary to feed them before bloodletting a little bread soaked in pomegranate water mixed with honey: or oxymel, if they are heated: and draw blood from them in three or four stages.
And if they are of cold complexion, then they should take before bloodletting bread soaked in grape syrup, or in honey syrup flavored with spices, or in aromatic fragrant syrup.
If fainting occurs during bloodletting, and its cause is the exit of much blood: then it is necessary that they drink meat broth and light fragrant syrup: and use aromatics with civet, and their chest should be anointed with it: and use the remaining things which we mentioned in the division in the chapter on fainting from evacuation.
For one who wants to open their arm and release their blood a second time: it is necessary for one whose bloodletting is for much evacuation, and whose strength is weak, to release blood gradually according to their strength over continuous days.
But one who wants to open their arm and release their blood a second time, and their body is strong: then let them do this after seven or nine hours from their first bloodletting.
And one who wants to draw blood from their body to the opposite of the part to which it inclines: it is necessary that they be opened on the second or third day.
In whose body there is much blood that has become heated, and becomes sharp, and causes fever to occur: it is necessary that blood exit from them at once, and much quantity should be drawn from them: and the opening should be widened until fainting occurs: after you have observed all the conditions of bloodletting: and that you place your hand on their pulse during the flow of blood, so that death does not occur instead of fainting.
For often this happens when the bloodletter is ignorant, and negligence occurs.
And when you want to open the arm and release blood a second time, when the opening of the vein has already closed, and the exit of blood becomes difficult, it is not necessary to press upon it with force, and quickly extend what is curved.
For that is very bad, rather leave it until it is bled a second time.
Or remove with the sharpness of the lancet that which has coagulated from blood in the opening of the vein, and put on it some salt dissolved in water.
And put on it some of the theriac alfaroch, or sagzenea, and place it with gentle pressure, until the blood comes out.
If indeed the vein has become swollen, then leave it, and do not cover it until the swelling subsides.
But if necessity calls for drawing blood a second time, and there is no excuse, then either perform phlebotomy above that place, or on the other arm in another vein.
Moreover, the cord of the arm is bled in place of the Fusca and Basilic veins, when they cannot be found and are hidden, since it is composed of them.
And the method of bleeding it is that the patient should put their hand in warm water until the forearm reddens and the vein appears clearly.
Then it should be bound above with a bandage, with moderate tightness.
Then perform phlebotomy gradually across the vein, not widthwise, nor lengthwise: and let the opening be wide, and let your incision with which you perform phlebotomy be slightly above the wrist joint.
If the blood flow is blocked, then put the hand back in warm water, and let the blood flow into the water until you achieve your need.
If however you are in the summer days, then you are excused from repeating the hand in warm water.
And indeed the flow of blood is mostly placed in warm water in winter time.
And the bleeding of this vein is safer than all veins, since there is neither a pulsing vein nor a nerve beneath it.
The bleeding of the Salvatella vein of the right hand is beneficial for diseases of the liver.
And the method of bleeding it is that you bind the palm of the hand with a bandage, or with your hand, after you put it in warm water, until the vein swells and becomes very apparent to the senses.
Then bleed it crosswise.
And if you cut it completely, this will not harm it in any way.
And take care not to extend your hand too far with the lancet.
For beneath it are the nerves of the fingers, stripped of flesh.
Then return the hand to warm water, and let the blood flow into it.
For if you do not return it to warm water, the blood coagulates in the opening of the vein and is prevented from flowing.
When therefore you have drawn the necessary amount of blood, then put oil and salt on the vein: so that it does not heal too quickly.
And similarly you should do this with every constricted branch.
The benefit of bleeding it from the left hand is: that it is beneficial for diseases of the spleen: and similarly do in bleeding it as you did in the second case equally.
The benefit of bleeding the Saphenous vein is for diseases which are in the lower part of the body, such as diseases of the womb, and retention of menstruation, and infirmities of the kidneys, and old ulcers of the hips and legs, and similar diseases.
And the method of bleeding it is that the patient should put their foot in warm water: and rub it until the veins become prominent: and bind above the foot joint with a strap.
And indeed the location of the vein is at the heel, appearing toward the big toe: and many branches spread from it on the surface of the foot.
Therefore bleed it in its larger branch, or at the heel where it collects: since this is better and safer.
But if you bleed it on the surface of the foot, then beware of the nerves which are beneath it on the surface of the foot.
And make your incision with which you bleed it crosswise, as if you wish to cut it: and let the lancet be Nesil.
If however the blood flow is blocked, then return their foot to warm water: and let the blood flow into it until it is evacuated.
But if the phlebotomist misses the vein on the first attempt, then let him repeat with the phlebotomy slightly higher up, for the location is safe, and you need not fear harm from it, when you beware of the nerves, as we said.
And similarly with the Saphenous vein of the other foot equally.
The location of the Sciatic vein, as we said, is at the heel on the sylvan (outer) side.
And the benefit of bleeding it is for pain of the hip, when it is due to hot blood.
And the method of bleeding it is that the patient should enter the bath, and hurry: and bind their leg from the side of the hip to above the heel four fingers' width, with a long thin band: for it does not appear except because of that.
When it appears, then perform bloodletting on it by whatever method is possible for you, either crosswise (which is better), or by making an incision, or by cutting it with a section.
Indeed, its location is safer, and in most people it is very well hidden.
But if you cannot find it, and it is not at all apparent to the senses, then perform bloodletting on one of its branches, namely the one that appears on the top of the foot and toward the little toe: and beware of the nerves, and let flow the amount of blood that you wish.
Then loosen the binding, and place leather over the site of bloodletting, and bind the area.
For it heals quickly.
¶ On Cupping, and the nature of its use.
Chapter 98.
Cups are made from horns, and from bronze, and from glass.
And indeed cupping is done in two ways.
With scarification and blood extraction: and the other is cupping without scarification.
And this cupping which is without scarification is done in two ways.
For either it is with fire.
Or it is without fire.
And for cups which are administered with scarification and blood extraction there are fourteen places on the body.
Of which one is the Cupping of Alnocrati, which is the back of the head: and Alkehel, which is the middle of the neck: and the cups of Alhagdahim, which are the two plates of the neck on both sides together: and the cups of the chin, which is under the jaw in the lower part of the mouth: and the cups of the two shoulder blades: and the cups of Alachosos above the end of the tail: and the cups of the two forearms, which are the middle of the two arms: and the cups of the two legs: and the cups of the two ankles.
And indeed cupping does not extract blood for you from the tiny veins scattered in the flesh, and because of that strength does not fall from them, as it falls from bloodletting.
Nor should cupping be administered, whether with fire or without fire, in any of the illnesses that occur from repletion, until the whole body is evacuated.
But if necessity calls for cupping due to illness, or because of custom, we administer it at any hour at the beginning of the month, at its end, and in its middle, and at whatever time it may be.
This is because among people there is one who, when blood multiplies in him until he needs its extraction through cupping, finds heaviness in his head, and headache.
And among them is one who finds fullness and redness in his face, his head, and his neck.
And among them is one who finds itching in his face and his forehead, and darkness and dullness in his eyes.
And among them is one who scratches the place of his cupping.
And among them is one whose laughter multiplies.
And among them is one who finds the taste of blood in his mouth: or his tongue swells, and he spits blood.
And among them is one whose sleep multiplies.
And among them is one who sees in his sleep blood and redness, and the slain, and wounds, and things similar to those.
Therefore when we see any of these things, and especially if it is in the middle third of the month: we then prescribe cupping to be done, after two or three hours of the day have passed.
The benefit of cupping of the nape is: that it helps with heaviness in the head, and what flows to the eyes.
But indeed it is necessary that this be after the evacuation of the whole body.
And this cup indeed is in place of bloodletting of the Cephalic vein.
And it is not permitted that one who is of cold complexion use it, or one in whom there is catarrh.
For it brings great harm to him.
And because of that it is not proper that old people use it, and those in whose head are cold illnesses.
Moreover, whoever becomes assiduous in its use, forgetfulness is generated in him.
And because of that it is necessary that you instruct the cupper to move his hand with the cup a little downward, fearing the generation of forgetfulness.
But cupping of Alkehel is in place of bloodletting of the Fusca and bloodletting of the Basilic vein, and because of that it helps with asthma, and constriction of breathing, and fissure of the breathing apparatus, and cough, and repletion.
And it is necessary that the Alkehel Cup be pushed a little, because if it is placed lower, it generates weakness in the heart and stomach.
Cupping of the alhagdahim (scalp) benefits pains occurring in the head, eye inflammation, migraine, perforation, and pain in the roots of teeth: and it serves in place of bloodletting from the basilic vein.
And it is necessary that you instruct the cupper not to press his hand during scarification: so that he does not cut an artery, and bleeding occurs.
Cupping under the chin benefits ulcers in the mouth, and corruption of the gums, and similar diseases which are in the mouth: and it serves in place of bloodletting of the alieherich, which are in the two lips.
Cupping of the shoulder blades benefits alchafacham (palpitations), which occurs from repletion and heat.
Cupping of the inner parts of the two forearms provides the benefit of bloodletting from three veins - the Basilic, the Dark, and the Cephalic: because it draws blood from all those minute veins which are in the flesh: and those minute veins draw from other thicker veins, until the drawing reaches the three veins.
And it is necessary that you instruct the cupper not to proceed too far in scarification: because the place is devoid of flesh, and beneath it are nerves and arteries.
The cupping which is performed over the alchausos (coccyx) benefits hemorrhoids of the Anus, and lower ulcers.
And it is necessary that you instruct the cupper that the cup should be large, and that it should be made of bronze: because the place needs strong suction, and perhaps delicate cups might break: and it should be scarified with large scarification.
Cupping of the legs diminishes with manifest diminution: because they draw blood from the whole body, and benefit old pains in the kidneys, and wombs, and bladder: they provoke menstruation, and benefit bothor (pustules), and ademenul: and they serve in place of bloodletting of the two saphenous and alhorcobeni veins.
However, they greatly weaken the body, and cause fainting in many people.
And the benefit of cupping the alhorcobeni (sciatic region) is close to the benefit of cupping the two legs.
The method of placing cups is that you first place an empty cup, and suck with moderate suction: and do not prolong the placement of cups, but place them quickly, and remove them quickly, so that the humors come to the place with equal arrival: and do not cease to repeat and continue this, until you see the place has already reddened and swollen, and the redness of blood appears: then therefore scarify, and repeat with gradual suction.
Then consider the disposition of bodies.
For he among men who is of tender flesh, with rare pores, it is necessary that you scarify him once, no more: so that the place does not become ulcerated.
And instruct the cupper to widen the scarification, and deepen it a little: and to moderate the suction in ease, and speed, and gentle movement.
If there is thickness in the blood, then it is necessary that you scarify it twice.
In the first time indeed the way is opened for the thinning of blood, and its wateriness: and in the second indeed for the exquisite investigation of extracting thick blood.
If truly the blood is very turbid, then let scarification be done a third time: so that the ultimate is achieved.
And finally, when we wish to extract blood gradually, or little by little, one scarification suffices for us.
If we wish to extract much blood, we scarify with multiple scarifications.
And if we measure that the blood is thick: then it is necessary that it be scarified with deep scarification: and the equal limit in scarification is the depth of the skin.
What are the oils that should be administered when applying cups, and what should the person being cupped avoid.
For one whose skin is thick, hard, dark, and whose pores are tight, the areas to be cupped should be anointed with opening, softening, and dissolving oils: if it is in summer time, such as alkanna oil, or violet oil, or sweet almond oil, or pumpkin seed oil.
And if it is in winter time, then narcissus oil, or lily oil, or chamomile oil, or sarbatinum oil: and similar ones to these.
If indeed the excess is thick and cold: then let the oil be marjoram oil, or balsamita oil, or alben oil, or dill oil: and similar ones to these.
If indeed the person to be cupped has wide pores and tender flesh: then it is necessary that they be kept from oil, and it is necessary that these people wash the cupped areas after cupping with rose water, or with cold water, or with nightshade water, or with pumpkin water, or with purslane water: and similar ones to these.
He whose blood has much moisture should wash the cups with vinegar, or with myrtle water, and sumac: and similar ones to these.
One whose excesses are thick should wash their cups with aged wine, or with marjoram water, or a decoction of dill, or chamomile: and similar ones to these.
And cupping should be avoided in the bath, or immediately after bathing, rather it should be administered after leaving the bath for an hour, or for two hours.
And one should not sleep after cupping.
What is it by which the person to be cupped or bled should be governed before cupping.
AND after it, you should first consider: then if the person cupped or bled is choleric, and sharpness and inflammation dominate their blood: then they should take cooling things, like sweet pomegranate: and also endive with vinegar and lettuce, and sekanjabin, and julep: and similar ones to these.
And make their foods chicken, and sekebiget sheep meats, and foods seasoned with verjuice: and similar ones to these.
And one whose complexion is cold should drink honey syrup, or almiua, or sekanjabin made from seeds: and should take fragrant wine of medium age, which is between old and new: and should be instructed to eat sparingly.
And make their food chicken, and canebir: and sparrows, that is, small birds: and young pigeons prepared issiadebet.
And the drink on the day of cupping and bleeding should be more than the food: and it is necessary that some people be given to drink at times theriac alfaroch, or musk medicine, that is, muscata, or alesselithe before cupping: and before or after bleeding: so that the principal members are strengthened and the blood is made thinner.
And they should not drink it when heated.
Concerning Cups without scarification.
Cups which are without scarification are cups which are placed over the liver, and spleen, and gout, and over the belly, navel, and areas of the kidneys, and hip socket: since these members do not tolerate scarification upon them.
And nothing is sought through them, except either the drawing of blood from one member to another: just as we place a cup over the breasts in illness of nosebleed.
And we use them to release cold windiness stuck in a member: just as we place a cup over the belly and navel.
For it rarefies the member, and warms it, and removes pain because it dissolves that windiness.
It is also placed over the kidneys, when obstruction or stone occurs in them.
Indeed by its power of attraction it perhaps opens the obstruction, or uproots the stone from its place.
And similarly it does when placed over the liver and spleen for grinding down windiness in both of them.
And these cups are administered empty with cutting only.
And sometimes they are administered with fire.
And sometimes they are administered full of tepid water in illnesses of pleurisy: and that is, that the cup should be filled, and should be large, with hot water alone, or water in which suitable herbs have been cooked.
Shape of a Cupping Glass administered with fire.
Let the width of its opening be two spread fingers, according to what we have shaped: and let its depth measure half a palm: and let there be on its side, around its middle, a small hole, of such size that a needle may enter it: let it be made entirely of brass, or yellow copper, with thick, smooth, even, polished edges: so that it does not harm the limb when placed upon it: and let there be in its middle a crossbar of brass, or iron, where a candle is placed with fire.
And this cupping glass is made large, larger than the one we described, and a little smaller than that one, according to the illnesses and age of the one who uses it.
Indeed, the cupping glasses for children and thin people are different from the cupping glasses for men and people of thick bodies.
The method of placing this cupping glass with fire on a limb is that you light a wick with fire made properly from linen, or a small wax candle: and place it upon the middle of the crossbar which is in the middle of the cupping glass: so that the lit fire is around the lower part of the cupping glass, so that the patient's body is not burned.
Then let it be placed on the limb: and let a finger be on the hole which I mentioned, until when we hold the cupping glass: when we need to, we remove the finger, and vapor will escape through that hole, and the cupping glass will be released immediately.
Then light the wick in its usual way, and repeat it, if you need it.
However, in the cupping glass which is administered in the illness of pleurisy with water, there is no crossbar, nor hole: and it is administered only because it is filled with water, and placed on the limb only.
And this is its shape.
And this cupping glass is better the larger it is, so that it may hold much water.
On the Application of Leeches.
Chapter 99.
Leeches are not administered in most cases, except on those limbs where the placement of cupping glasses is not possible, due to their smallness, such as the lip, and gum, and similar parts.
Or on a limb stripped of flesh, such as a finger, and nose, and similar parts.
And the method of using them is: that you obtain leeches which are from sweet waters, clean from putrefaction.
Then let them be left for a day and night in sweet water, until they are hungry, and nothing remains in their bellies.
Then evacuate the body first with bloodletting, and with cupping glasses.
Then clean the patient's limb, until it reddens.
Afterwards let them be placed upon it.
When therefore they are filled, and fall off, and it is possible to suction the area with a cupping glass, then this is most ultimate in benefit: and if not, then wash the area with vinegar.
Then with much water, and let it be rubbed, and squeezed.
But if the flow of blood continues after the falling of the leeches, and it is oozing: then soak a linen cloth in cold water, and place it on top, until the oozing is stopped.
If the blood multiplies, then sprinkle ground vitriol upon it, or gallnuts, and similar astringents: until the blood is stopped.
Or let halves of peeled beans be placed upon the area: and let them be left until the beans adhere to the area, for the blood will be stopped.
And it is necessary if the repetition of leeches is needed, when it is possible, to change them.
If however the leeches are prevented from attaching, then clean the area with fresh blood.
Or pierce the areas with a needle, until some blood comes out.
Then let them be placed, for when they sense some blood, they attach immediately.
When therefore you want them to fall off, sprinkle some ground aloe upon them, or salt, or ash: and they will fall off immediately.

¶ Book III of Surgery by Albucasis.
¶ General discourse on restoration, dislocation, treatment of twisting, and similar matters.
Chapter I.
This Chapter is also frequently necessary in the art of Medicine, and it is about the restoration of fractures and dislocations occurring in bones.
Know, O Sons, that the foolish among physicians and common people boast about this Chapter, those who have never examined a book of the ancients, nor read a letter from it.
And for this reason it happens that this branch of knowledge in our land is lacking.
And I never encountered anyone good at it at all, and I did not attain what I have attained in it except through lengthy reading of ancient books and studying their meaning, until I extracted this knowledge from them.
Then I devoted myself to experimentation and study throughout my life.
And I have already described to you in this Chapter everything that my knowledge contains: and what my experience has covered, after I abbreviated it for you, and freed it from lengthy digressions, and abbreviated it to its final form, and showed it without deviation: and I have drawn in it many illustrations of instruments which are used in it, with some additional variations, as I did in the two preceding Chapters.
¶ Summaries and collections about the nature of bone fractures, among those things whose introduction is necessary before we begin the discussion of fractured and various members, each individually.
Chapter II.
It is necessary that we state in the prologue of this Chapter the main points of discussion and chapters, whose understanding is first required for the practitioner to stand upon their truth: namely so that you, and those who are ready, may know or learn this noble art, and others from you.
Therefore, I say that when someone suffers a fracture, or dislocation, or twisting, or a fall: then it is necessary that you hurry first to bleed him, and purge him, or both together: if nothing prohibits it, such as weakness of constitution: or if the one to whom something of these happened is a child, or a very old man: or if it is a time of intense heat, or intense cold.
Then let him be content in his diet with cold vegetables, and the meat of birds, and young goats: and forbid wine, and heavy meats, and being filled with foods and any food that fills the veins with blood.
Until when you are secure from hot swelling, and do not fear the flowing of matter to the limb: then let the patient return to his first regimen with which his custom proceeded.
When therefore the broken bone begins to heal, then it is necessary that the patient be fed foods that nourish with much, thick, heavy nourishment, in which there is viscosity: such as foods made from wheat cooked with water, and rice, and heads, and feet, and cow stomachs, and eggs, and fresh fish: and thick wine, and similar things to these.
With this regimen indeed, the healing of the fracture happens more quickly and better.
And know that broken bones, when they are in men who are in early old age, and the decrepit, it is not possible that they join and consolidate according to their nature always, because of the dryness of their members: and those of them that are extremely soft consolidate and join, like the bones of small children.
Nevertheless, nature attaches over the broken bone from all sides something like glue, in which there is thickness, by which it adheres and binds it, until they are glued together, and bound together, until it comes to complete strength and firmness, as it was at first, until nothing prevents it from its functions: and for this reason it is necessary that you make the patient's nourishment foods in which there is heaviness, and viscosity, and thickness, as we said.
And know that there are different types of fractures, according to the diversity of limbs: for a fracture of the leg is different from a fracture of the skull bone; and a fracture of the chest bone is different from a fracture of the spine bone; and similarly all other limbs are different from each other: and I have come with the remembrance of every type of fracture explained in its own Chapter, distinct from others.
And the types of bone fractures also differ in themselves.
For there occurs an arched fracture, without splinters occurring in it.
And sometimes a fracture occurs along the length of the bone: and there are splintered fractures, that is, with splinters, and protruding additions, like those in a reed when it is prepared with a knife for writing.
And non-protruding ones: and there is a fracture with a wound and disruption in the head: and there is a fracture that is a small fissure.
And for every type there is a technique, or proper instrument for its restoration, according to what will come in its remembrance, distinguished in their places.
And among the ways by which a bone fracture is recognized, is its crookedness, and its prominence: and its appearance to the senses, and its sound when you compress it with your hand.
Therefore when there is no apparent crookedness in the place, nor sound upon your touch when you touch the bone with movement, nor does the patient find great pain: then there is no fracture there, rather it is possible that there might be a twist, or a small fissure: therefore you should not move it with hand and compression at all, but rather place upon it from the medicines, whose remembrance comes, after that moment which suits the place: then let it be bound with a subtle binding.
And know that when a place is bent, and split in two, without splinters occurring in it, but rather each part is removed from its companion: then you must begin at your hour to rectify it, straightening it before a hot swelling occurs.
But if a hot swelling occurs to it, then leave it for some days, until the swelling subsides.
Then straighten it according to whatever method is possible with gentleness and skill.
And know that its restoration, and its straightening, is easier than that of a bone in which splinters occur.
Then bind it, according to what will come to you in its remembrance.
But if there are splinters in the bone, then extension of this fractured limb from both parts is necessary, if it is a hand, or foot: or with your hand, if the limb is small: or with two ropes, or with a rope and hand.
And let your position in which you place the limb be on an even place, according to its natural shape, until when the parts of the fractured limb are extended: then strive to make those additions return by every skill, and according to whatever method you can to their places: and take care according to your strength, lest pain or injury occur to the patient through your operation: and strive according to your strength, to join one of the two bones with its companion, according to the better forms.
And it is necessary in that hour, that you test and touch it with your hand.
If therefore you see anything irregular there, rectify it, and straighten it according to the measure of your ability.
And beware of violent extension, and strong compression, as many of the foolish do.
For many times they cause through that operation of theirs a hot swelling, or contraction in the limb: as we have already seen that from their operations many times.
Then attach after the straightening, and decent operation, and binding of that limb, and rest, and tranquility: and advise the patient about it.
And make him beware, lest he move it in the hour of his waking, and his sleep during his turning, and his movement, and during his evacuation, and all his movements to the utmost of his ability.
And that he should beware, lest the position of the limb be a position with which pain follows.
Which is, because when he feels pain or injury in the condition of the limb's position: then it is necessary that you change it to another condition from that with which he does not feel pain.
And beware with that, that its position be even, straight: so that no crookedness occurs in the limb, when it is restored.
And the method of binding a broken limb is as I will describe.
Know that broken limbs differ in their smallness and their size, and in their shape.
Those among them that are small, like the arm, finger, and forearm bone, and similar ones, then it is necessary that the wrapping be of soft, thin cloth.
But those among them that are thick, like the thigh and leg, it is necessary that they have a wide, firm wrapping.
Since a wide bandage connects a large limb and binds it from all sides with even pressure, so that no mark enters it.
Then begin after your cleaning by evening out and placing a suitable dressing for that purpose, with soft tow over the fracture site itself.
Then begin to wrap the bandage over the fracture site with three or four turns, according to what the limb requires: and tighten your hand a little with the bandage.
Then go with it to the upper part from the fracture site, and tighten less than was your tightening with which you bound the broken site.
Then distance yourself with the wrapping from the fracture site a little, and loosen the binding gradually, until you take up a large portion of healthy area.
Then take another band, and wrap it again over the broken site with turns.
Afterward go with the wrapping to the lower part from the fracture.
And let your procedure in tightening the wrapping, and loosening it, be according to what we said in the first upper wrapping.
Then place between the wrappings some soft tow, or cloth, with which to even out any crookedness of the fracture, if there is crookedness in it: and if not, do not place anything in it.
Then wrap over it another band.
Afterward align over these wrappings splints properly made immediately, if there is no swelling or hot inflammation in the area.
But if there is swelling or inflammation in it: then place over it what calms that inflammation and removes the swelling: and leave it for several days.
Then tighten the splints over it at that time.
And let the splints be made from halves of wide cane, scraped, wisely shaped: or let them be from wood from which sieves are made, which are made from pine, or geraid, that is, palm branches, or calingi: and let the width of each splint be according to this form and this same figure.
However, it is necessary that the splint which is placed over the break itself be somewhat thicker and wider than the other splints: and let the length of the splint be according to what is appropriate for the limb in terms of size and smallness.
Then tighten over the splints with another band, according to that same first binding.
Then bind over it with threads properly, according to what we said about binding: that is, that your binding should be tighter over the fracture site: and the further it extends from the fracture, let the binding be looser.
And it is necessary that the threads be medium in thickness and thinness, and be of soft linen.
For if the threads are thick, as I have seen in the work of fools who put their threads from twisted linen cords, it is a great error: since the binding with them falls outside proper measure.
And thin threads again are not suitable: since you will not achieve through binding with them what you want.
And there should not be less than a finger's width between splint and splint.
But if the patient is harmed by the ends of the splints after binding in healthy areas: then place under them some soft tow, or carded wool, until nothing is harmed from that.
When however the fracture is with a wound, and disruption occurs in the skin, I will come with mention of it in a chapter according to its particularity.
And know that not every broken limb should be bound with splints from the first day.
Which is because when a limb is large, you should not place splints over it except after five days, or seven, or more, according to your confidence about the occurrence of hot inflammation.
And this is the method of plasters, with which the ancients restored [bones], which are placed over fracture and dislocation.
Method of a common abbreviated plaster, restoring fractures, suitable for many constitutions, especially women and children: since it is one in which neither heat nor cold predominates.
And it is that you should take dust from the mill, which is the flour meal that hangs on the mill walls near the movement of the millstone: and prepare it as is, except that you should sieve it with egg white: and make the preparation neither thick nor thin.
Then use it.
Method of another plaster, restoring fracture, dislocation, and sprain.
Take almess, laudanum, acacia, elecampane, and mugwort: and suc, 10 drams each of all; of myrrh and aloe 5 drams each; and 20 drams of alethil; let all be ground and sieved, and mixed with alethil water: or with egg white, if the patient's constitution is heated.
Then use this plaster.
For it is of good composition, restores broken bones quickly, and helps many people.
Method of another plaster, which also helps fracture and sprain.
Take mugwort, and mess, and white marsh mallow, 10 drams each of all; of myrrh and aloe 5 drams each; 6 drams of acacia; 20 drams of Armenian clay; let all be ground with much grinding, and sieved, and prepared with water, or egg white: and administered.
Method of a plaster for joints and bones separated from their places: and it calms the pain occurring in them, and bone splitting, and fracture.
Let unwashed wool be taken, and submerged in vinegar and cooked oil: and placed on the spot.
And in this plaster indeed there is no restorative power, but it is good in calming hot swelling: and especially drives away pains.
Method of a plaster which restores broken bone.
Take leaves of deaf fig, and leaves of wild poppy: and grind all, and make a plaster from both.
Method of an abbreviated plaster, administered for the restoration of bone fracture: and when you want resolution of residual swelling.
Take of marshmallow root, and chamomile, and violet flowers, and vetch flour, one part each of all: let all be ground, and prepared with wine, if the limb is not heated.
But if it is heated, then prepare it with water of fresh coriander, or with water, and use it.
Method of another plaster stronger in resolution than this first one, when hard swelling occurs during limb restoration.
Take of marshmallow root, and linseed, and pomegranate flower, and melilot, and marjoram, and violet flower, and chamomile, one part each of all, let all be ground, and prepared with willow water, or with sweet water, or with wine.
All that according to the heat of the limb, and the quieting of its heat.
Hippocrates indeed did not say in his book that anything should be placed on a broken limb during its restoration, except a wax plaster made from wax and oil: nothing else: and he related that it should be medium between thickness and thinness.
But it seemed to Galen that things should be placed on a broken limb during its restoration in which there is drying of heat, such as myrrh, and aloe and frankincense, and similar things to them from those which we have related.
Method of a plaster which helps injury and pain.
Take equal parts of mugwort, and chickpea, and cut human hair, or bird feather, and marsh mallow, and salt: let them be ground, and sieved, and prepared: and let a plaster be made from it.
The duration for which it is proper that the bandage should remain, before it is loosened, is that you should consider then, if no pain occurs to the patient, nor itching, nor does the broken bone move from its place: then do not loosen it for many days.
If there occurs in the place intense itching, or disturbing pain, or swelling: then hurry, and loosen it immediately, and remove the plaster from it: and take a soft cloth, or soft, moist sea sponge: and submerge it in lukewarm water, and wash the area with it until the itching subsides and the pain is relieved.
Then let the limb rest for one hour.
Then place upon it unwashed wool, soaked in vinegar and oil, or rose oil: and bind it over it for one night, until you are safe from hot swelling, and the swelling of the limb subsides, and its pain is removed.
Then repeat it with a gentle binding, and a small plaster: and do not bind it as tightly as your first binding, and proceed gently with it until it heals.
But if you see that the swelling, and redness, and pain, and inflammation, and all symptoms have now completely subsided, and you need a plaster and binding, then repeat it just as you did at first, equally.
But if none of those things we mentioned happens to the limb, then do not loosen it except after three days, or four, or five, or seven.
And sometimes all of this is left for twenty days, according to what appears to you regarding the loosening of the limb, as we said, until when the fracture adheres and the flesh begins to coagulate over it: even then increase the binding more than your first entire binding: and also increase the thickness of the patient's food, according to what was previously mentioned.
However, if you see the fracture site becoming dry and thinner than it should be: then know that nourishment is being prevented from reaching it.
Therefore moisten it with lukewarm water whenever you loosen it, and let this be every three days, and slightly loosen the binding.
Through this procedure, therefore, nourishment flows to the limb, and it heals quickly.
That which foolish bone-setters do with a fractured limb a second time, when it is not set properly at first, and heals crookedly, is an error in their procedure, and a great danger: and if it were correct, the ancients would have mentioned it in their books and would have practiced it.
And I have not seen any trace of them doing this at all, and it is more correct that it not be done.
¶ Concerning fracture occurring in the head.
Chapter III.
The types of fracture are diverse, and its forms many: and its causes are distinct.
For among fractures there is that which occurs from a blow with a sword: and the blow removes the entire bone until it reaches the membrane which is under the bone, just as an ax does in wood: and because of that this type of fracture is called Axial.
Or the sword cuts part of the bone, and cuts its surface, and the cut does not penetrate to its depths: and this type of fracture is called Kalaan, that is, Elevation absolutely.
And the wound of these two fractures is either large or small.
And among fractures there is that which is crushing or grinding: and its cause is being struck with a stone, or falling onto a stone, or similar things.
And this fracture is also either penetrating, which has already approached the membrane that is under the bone: or it is on the surface of the bone: and the wound of these two fractures is also either small or large.
And among fractures there is that which is hidden in the bone with the fineness of a hair: and it is a small fissure, and because of that this type of fracture is called Capillary.
And among them is a fracture which occurs from a fall, or strike of a stone, and similar things, which cause the layer of bone to go inward, and a hollow forms in the place: just as happens to brass cauldrons when they receive a blow, and part of them goes inward.
And indeed this happens most often in the heads with moist bones, such as the heads of children.
And separate treatments are made for all these types of fractures, and I will come with the mention of all of that in its place.
And we recognize all these types of fractures through exposing them, and examining them with probes, and removing corrupt flesh that is over them.
The capillary-type (fracture) is recognized by this: that it is exposed on the bone, and when it is cleaned and painted over with ink, the fracture appears black.
In treating a fracture, first consider the patient's symptoms: then if you see from the symptoms something that clearly indicates danger, such as bilious vomiting, tenseness, loss of consciousness, loss of voice, fainting, acute fever, protruding eyes, their redness, and similar symptoms in most cases, it certainly cannot be cured: but if you see symptoms that do not frighten you, and you hope for recovery: then begin its treatment.
That is, if an injured person comes to you immediately after being wounded: and if it is in winter days, then you must endeavor to remove the bone before the fourteenth day under all circumstances.
And if it is in summer days, then you must hurry to remove the bone before the seventh day, before what is under the bone from the membrane becomes corrupted, and those symptoms we described occur.
If the bone fracture has already reached the membrane touching the brain, and is with fragments and contusion: then you must cut away the comminuted and crushed part, according to what I will tell you.
And it is that you should shave the wounded person's head: and expose the bone in whatever way possible for you: and according to the shape of the wound, and what is manageable for the patient.
If during the exposure of the bone there occurs bleeding or hot swelling: then treat it with what is necessary.
That is, fill the area with cloths soaked in wine and rose oil: and let the wound rest until the swelling subsides, and you are safe from bleeding.
Then begin the treatment of the bone and its removal.
And this is done according to one of two methods.
One method is that you cut the bone with a narrow-edged Incisor: and this is its form.
Then use another Incisor after the first one, slightly wider than it: and this is its form.
Then also use another Incisor even wider than the second.
And the second method is that you should have a number of different Incisors: some wider than others, and some shorter than others: and they should be extremely sharp at their ends, and be made of Indian iron or steel: and use gentleness in striking the Incisor, so as not to shake the head and harm it.
If however the bone is strong and hard: then you must drill around its circumference, before you use the Incisors, with drills called non-penetrating Trephines: and they are called thus only because they do not pass beyond the limit of the bony skull to what is behind it: because the Trephine has a round extremity above its sharp head, similar to a margin, and the small circle prevents it from sinking in and passing through the thickness of the bone.
And it is appropriate for you to take many of these Trephines, each one suitable for the thickness of the bone, until you have for every skull a Trephine: whose sharp extremity's quantity in length and shortness is according to the quantity of that skull's thickness.
And this is the form of three types of Trephines.
The method of drilling around the fractured bone is: that you place the Trephine on the bone, and rotate it with your fingers until you know the bone has been penetrated.
Then move the Trephine to another location, and place what is between each hole the width of a needle, or approximately that.
Then cut with the Incisors what is between each hole from the bone: and make it as thin as you can manage with utmost gentleness, as we said, until you extract the bone, either with your hand or with some other of the instruments which you prepared for that: such as forceps and fine scissors.
And you must take every precaution not to touch the dura mater with either the Trephine or the Incisor.
When you have gone around drilling the bone, and it has been separated from the membrane, if it was continuous with it, and you have extracted it, you should scrape and smooth the edge of what remains in the bone with another similar cutting instrument.
However, it should be thinner and more delicate than other cutting instruments.
And if any small bone fragments and splinters remain, then remove them carefully with whatever instruments you have at hand.
Then treat the wound afterward with lint and the ointments we have mentioned.
And there is another method of operation that is easy and completely free from fear, which Galen described and praised greatly: and these are his words.
First, you must begin by exposing the part of the bone where the fracture is most severe and most visible: until when you have exposed that part, and placed under it the tip of this lenticular cutting instrument, which has this form.
And the lenticular part is smooth and does not cut anything: and its sharp part on its two sides runs lengthwise, as you see: so that the lenticular part rests against the membrane, with its sharp cutting face against the bone.
Then strike the cutting instrument from one side with a small mallet, until you cut through the entire bone easily, as it turns: and be assured regarding the membrane, that no concerning accident will happen to it at all.
And if the physician were not the most foolish and ignorant of men, and were not asleep, then if anything of the membrane remained attached to the bone in certain places, he would cut it away from it with the tip of the same lenticular instrument, and free it from it easily.
For it is freed from it without harm and without fear.
And if the bone fracture does not penetrate to the membrane, and what is cut away from the bone is its surface, and roughness and fine splinters remain in it: then you should scrape away that roughness and remove those splinters with fine rasps, of which you have prepared a number of different sizes, so that you can use from among them in any location the most suitable and most appropriate ones, according to what the operation leads you to, and the fractured bone itself, and its shape.
And in your scraping, when you first scrape the bone, you should use the widest of those rasps.
Then after that use one finer than it.
And do not cease doing this continuously until you proceed to using the thinnest and finest of them all.
In each of the remaining small capillary fissures and fine fractures, you should administer treatment according to what leads to its correction.
And this is something that is not hidden from anyone who has any study in this art and has understood what we have written and shown regarding major fractures.
If however the exposed membrane is retained when you remove the bone: then you should take a linen cloth according to the size of the wound, and immerse it in rose oil, and place it over the opening of the wound.
Then take another cloth folded double or triple, and immerse it in wine and rose oil, and place it over the first cloth: and do this as gently as you can over it, so that the membrane is not weighed down.
Then apply a wide bandage over it: and do not tighten it except by an amount that just holds the wound: and leave it with this treatment for one day or two days, until you are assured against hot inflammation.
Then loosen it, and afterward apply medicines which have excessive dryness: such as lily roots, and vetch flour, and frankincense powder, and birthwort, and similar things: and it is that you should make from these medicines a powder, which is to be sprinkled over the wound as they are dry.
And generally apply to it any medicine whose property is to cleanse, and not to irritate.
And take care according to your ability, that the wound in your treatment be clean: and let there be in it neither ointment residue, nor filth.
And do not let pus accumulate in it at all: since when pus accumulates on the membrane of the brain, it corrupts it, and putrefies it, and afterward great harm befalls the patient: and it has already occurred in the membrane of the head, when the bone is cleaned from it, especially when its care is neglected, that blackness appears on its surface.
Therefore consider then, if the symptoms we mentioned occur in the patient, know that it is undoubtedly dangerous.
And if the blackness occurs only from the medicine which is placed upon it, and it is in the power of that medicine to cause that blackness: then it is necessary that you take one part of honey, three parts of rose oil, and spread them on a cloth.
Then place it on the membrane: afterward treat it with the types of treatment that are suitable, until it heals.
¶ On the restoration of the Nose when it is broken.
Chapter 4.
Know that only the two upper parts of the Nose break together, or one of them: because they are two bones: since its lower part is cartilaginous, it does not break, and nothing happens to it except bruising, and twisting, and flattening.
If one of its two parts breaks, then it is necessary that you insert the little finger into the nostril, and straighten that fracture with your index finger and thumb from the outside, until the Nose returns to its natural shape: and let that be done skillfully, with gentleness.
And take care that pain does not occur to the patient through that operation of yours.
But if the fracture is in the upper part of the Nose, and the finger cannot reach it: then it is necessary that it be straightened with the end of a probe, in which there should be a small thickness.
If indeed the fracture is in both parts, then do similarly to that: and hasten with its restoration on the first day of the fracture, if it is possible.
And if not, then after the seventh or tenth day when the hot swelling has subsided.
Then insert into the end of the nose a plug of linen cloth, if the fracture is in one part: or insert two plugs if the fracture is in two parts: and let there be in the plug sufficient thickness to fill the nostril.
And some of the ancient healers said to soak the plugs in butter, and change them every day.
That indeed does not seem right to me, rather it is necessary that the plug be soaked in egg white, mixed with mill dust.
Then leave the plug until the bone becomes firm and the cartilage hardens.
And sometimes a goose quill is inserted into the Nose instead of the plug, after it is wrapped with soft cloth: and it happens that it holds the fracture of the Nose more firmly, and so that the patient is not prevented from breathing.
And this thing is not necessary.
If you wish, do that: and if you wish, make plugs.
But if while you are working a hot swelling happens to the Nose, plaster the nose with wax ointment, or with cotton soaked in rose oil, or a little diachylon.
If however no hot swelling occurs, then it is necessary that you plaster it with sesame flour and powdered frankincense mixed with egg white.
Then place soft tow upon it, and do not bind the Nose with anything at all.
If indeed the bones of the Nose break with a small fracture, or are shattered, then it is necessary that you cut over them, and extract them with instruments that are suitable for them.
Then sew up the incision, and treat it with what causes flesh to grow and consolidates from suitable plasters or ointments for that.
But if a wound occurs between the Nose, then it is necessary that you treat it with plugs: and use a lead tube, until it heals.
On the restoration of the lower jaw, when it is broken.
Chapter 5.
When the lower jaw is broken, and its fracture is not accompanied by a wound: observe then if the fracture is only external, and is not broken in two, and curves inward: then its diagnosis is easy.
Therefore, if the fracture is on the right side, you should insert the index finger of your left hand into the patient's mouth: similarly if the fracture is in the left jaw, then insert the index finger of your right hand: and push with it the protrusion of the fracture from inside gently outward with your other hand from the inner part of the bone properly, and with it align it.
If the fracture of the jaw is already separated in two, then you must apply traction from both parts, according to straightness: until its alignment becomes possible.
If moreover there has already occurred loosening or disruption in the teeth: then bind those which you hope will remain with gold wire, or silver, or silk.
Then place a wax plaster over the fractured jaw.
Then place over it a folded cloth, and place over the cloth a large splint properly made: or an even piece of sole leather, along the length of the jaw.
Then bind it from above, according to how its bandaging is prepared for you, and its application is suitable, until it does not come apart: and instruct the patient to maintain tranquility and rest: and make his food soft liquid meals.
If however you think that some part of its shape has already changed in some way: then hurry, and loosen it on the third day.
Then rectify what has been altered from it, and plaster it with mill dust mixed with egg white, or with sesame flour, after you have removed the wax plaster: and place soft wool over the plaster.
While therefore that plaster remains attached over it, and the position of the bone is not altered, leave it, do not loosen it, until it heals: or tighten the fracture.
Indeed this fracture often heals in three weeks.
But if meanwhile a hot swelling occurs, then administer what we have mentioned many times for its sedation, until that swelling is removed.
And if the fracture is with a wound, examine it.
For if a fragment has already separated from the bone, or from splintered pieces: then be subtle in this, that you remove those splintered pieces with whatever instruments are suitable for their removal.
If indeed the opening of the wound is narrow, then widen it with a lancet according to your need.
Then when you have removed those splinters, and none of them remain, suture the opening of the wound, if it is wide: and if not, place upon it plasters which are suitable for that, and help it heal, until it heals.
¶ On the restoration of the Collarbone, when it is broken.
Chapter VI.
The collarbone is most often broken at the anterior part near the shoulder, and its fracture occurs in one of three ways.
Either it breaks and separates in two, without any splinters occurring in it: and this is easier to restore.
Or such that splinters occur in the bone: and this is more difficult to restore.
Or such that the fracture comes with a wound.
And the procedure for it when the fracture is without a wound is that you should have two assistants present, so that one of them holds the arm that follows the broken collarbone, and the other extends the neck to the side.
Then align the fracture with your fingers, until its form becomes as it should be: and there should be neither protrusion nor cavity in it.
If you need more extension, then you should place under the patient's armpit a ball of cloth or wool: and its size should be according to your need: and extend and elevate the collarbone, and compress the ball with your hand until you align the fracture as needed.
If you cannot pull the end of the collarbone outward because it has gone deep, then the patient should lie back on their neck: and place under their shoulder a medium-sized pillow, and have the assistant press their shoulder downward until the collarbone bone that is deep rises upward: and then straighten the fracture and align it with your fingers.
If you feel splintered pieces from the collarbone, and it moves: then you should cut into it and extract the splinters carefully.
If it is stuck in the bone, then devise to cut it with one of the cutting tools that you have prepared for this, after you have placed under the collarbone an instrument that protects the membrane: and it is an instrument of wood or iron.
And this is its form.
It resembles a spoon that has no cavity.
And its width should be according to what you need of it based on the size of the bone, whether large or small.
Its length also according to what is possible for you to operate with.
And it should have two ends, as you see: and one end should be wide, and the other narrow.
If the disruption of the wound that you cut when you extracted the bone splinters is wide, and you are safe from hot inflammation: then bring together the two lips of the wound with sutures.
And if the disruption is small, or you fear hot inflammation: then fill the wound with cloths and small pads according to the size of the wound's cut.
If hot inflammation occurs, then soak the cloth in rose oil, vinegar, and wine, and place it over it.
The binding of the bone when it is without wound and without cutting is that you should place over the bone a plaster made from mill flour with egg white.
And place soft tow over it.
Then place a ball under their armpit, if you need it.
Then take a himemah, that is, a bandage that the Saracens use, which should be very long: and its width should be one palm or thereabouts.
Then place a doubled pad over the tow and plaster.
Then take a splint from a thin board, whose width should be three fingers, and similarly in length.
Then wrap it in cloth.
Then wrap that cloth with the splint in the place of the bandage that falls over the fracture and area.
Then place the bandage over the fracture as it is wrapped, and wrap it over their neck, and under their healthy armpit, and under their injured armpit: and return it over every part, and however you see that the binding holds the fracture with proper tightness: and all this is not hidden from you, and everything, so that the splint does not move from over the broken bone.
And because of this you should examine the patient every day.
When therefore the bandage becomes loose, and you see the splint has moved: then straighten it, and tighten the bandage.
Then put the patient to sleep on his back, and place under his armpit during his sleep a small pillow at night, so that with it his upper arm is elevated from his side.
Therefore the fracture of the collarbone is elevated by raising the shoulder.
Either tie his arm to his neck: and do not loosen the bandage, unless there occurs in the area a symptom from itching, or from swelling, until twelve days have passed.
Then renew the plaster, if you see its surface requires it.
And increase the tightness, and leave it until it heals and solidifies.
And indeed the fracture of the collarbone becomes tight and strong typically in twenty-eight days: and sometimes it happens in some people in less than that.
¶ On the Treatment of Fracture of the Shoulder Blade.
Chapter VII.
The shoulder blade rarely breaks, and [when it does] in its wide part: and nothing breaks from it except its edges.
When therefore a place breaks from it, and it breaks in its middle, and this is not known except by touch: then according to the nature of the fracture, attempt its preparation.
And return it to its natural shape by every method of technique that is possible for you.
Then place on the area mill powder with egg white, and soft tow, and place above it a pad of folded cloth.
Then place over it a wide splint from a thin board according to the size of the entire shoulder blade, or slightly larger than it.
If indeed under the splint there is a hollow in any areas of the shoulder blade, then level that hollow with soft tow, until the splint descends evenly.
Then tighten over it with a long bandage, with decent constriction, and firmness of the splint, until it does not move from its place.
And check the bandage every day.
Whenever therefore the bandage becomes loose, tighten it, and adjust the splint if it moves from its place: and let the patient lie on his healthy side.
And indeed the shoulder blade heals in twenty days, or in twenty-five days.
When therefore this number is completed, then loosen the bandage: and you may be secure.
For it is one of the bones whose joining is not feared, nor their separation.
If however a fragment protrudes from the bone, and pricks under the skin: then cut over it, and remove it.
And do what we said in the fracture of the collarbone regarding the treatment of hot swelling, if anything of that sort occurs.
¶ On the repair of a fractured Chest.
Chapter VIII.
The chest sometimes breaks in its middle, and this rarely occurs.
Its extremities indeed most often break and are crushed from its accidents.
When its middle breaks, which slopes downward, and severe pain occurs, and difficulty in breathing, and coughing: and perhaps he vomits blood, and a hollow appears in the broken bone, and is not hidden to the senses, its Repair is that the patient should lie back upon his back: and place a pillow between his Shoulder blades.
Then press his shoulders, and bring together the ribs from both parts or sides with the hands: and be careful in aligning it, according to every way in which this is possible and appropriate, until the shape of the bone returns to what it should be.
Then place upon it a plaster and tow, and place above it a splint from a thin board of willow, or teak, and from similar things in lightness, after you wrap it in cloth.
Then be careful in binding it over the broken bone, so that it does not move: and go with the bandage according to the roundness to the back several times, and tighten it with decent tightness.
Then check the bandage every hour, and whenever it loosens, tighten it: and if necessity compels its loosening due to itching, or irritation which occurs in the place, or pain, or swelling: then hurry, and loosen it, and remove the plaster, and correct what has occurred with the method of its treatment.
Then replace the plaster, if you see fit for that: and attach the tightening to it, until it heals.
¶ On the repair of Ribs, when they break.
Chapter IX.
Know that Rib fracture does not occur, except in the thick places which follow the spine, and from their extremities in the anterior part.
And crushing does not occur to them, except because they are cartilaginous.
And knowledge of it is not hidden from the senses during examination with the fingers.
And its repair is done thus, that you align the fracture with the fingers according to the possible way, until the shape is aligned, according to what is necessary.
Then apply plasters, and tighten the broken bone with a splint, if it needs that.
And if the fracture of the Ribs is sloping towards the interior: then severe pain occurs to the patient, and stabbing, like that stabbing which occurs to one who has pleurisy: because the bone punctures the membrane, and also difficulty of breathing occurs to him, and coughing, and vomiting of much blood: and this is difficult to cure.
And indeed the ancients have contrived in it with many devices: and among them are those who say that you should give the patient foods which generate inflammation and windiness, so that the belly inflames and extends, and pushes the fracture to the exterior.
We however abhor that a quick cause should not be made for making a hot swelling, if it has not occurred.
But if it has already occurred, then it increases in it.
And some of them said: let a cupping glass be placed over the place, then let it be sucked with force, and it is more similar to reasoning.
However it is feared that the cupping glass might draw superfluities to the place, because of the disposition of weakness.
And some of them said: it is necessary that the place be covered with wool which has already been submerged in hot oil: and let cushions be placed between the Ribs, until it is filled: so that the binding might be equal when you wrap it according to the roundness.
Then let the patient be treated with the treatment of pleurisy from food and medicine.
But if a severe matter constrains the patient, which he does not tolerate, and the bone punctures the membrane with a harmful puncture, and we fear for the patient: then it is necessary that we cut over the place, and uncover from the broken Rib.
Then let us place over it the instrument which preserves the peritoneum, whose mention preceded: and let us cut the bone with ease, and let us cut it.
Then let us bring together the two lips of the wound, if it is large with suture: and let us treat it with plasters, until it heals.
But if meanwhile a hot swelling occurs, then hurry, and pour cushions in rose oil, and place over the place: and let the patient be treated with what suits the swelling.
Meanwhile also let him lie back on the side on which he sleeps, until he heals.
¶ On the repair of fractures of the vertebrae of the back and neck.
Chapter 10.
Indeed, fracture sometimes occurs to the bones of the neck, and rarely does crushing happen to them: and similarly also to the vertebrae of the back.
Therefore when this happens to someone, and you wish to know whether it will heal or not heal: then observe.
For if you see their hands already softened, and numbed, and dead: and they cannot move them, nor extend them, nor grip them: and when you squeeze them with your fingers, and prick them with a needle, they do not feel it, and do not feel pain in them: then know that it will not heal, and in most cases it is fatal.
But if they move them, and feel in them the squeezing with fingers and the pricking: then know that the marrow of the bone is safe, and that the patient will heal with treatment.
But if something similar happens to the vertebrae of the back, and you wish to know whether it will also heal or not: then look at their feet: then if you see that they are softened, and there occurs in them what occurs in the hands: then when they lie on their back, wind and excrement come out without control: and when they lie face down on their belly, excrement comes out without control: and when they lie on their back, and want to urinate, and cannot: then know that it is fatal.
Therefore do not labor in treating it.
But if none of that happens to them, the matter is lighter.
And the treatment of what happens from that is that you should attempt to calm the hot swelling: thus, that you place upon the crushed vertebra rose oil alone: or with the yolks of roasted egg.
Place this upon it several times in the day, until when the hot swelling subsides: then place upon the location one of the strengthening, drying plasters, and bind it with a bandage: and instruct the patient to maintain rest and tranquility.
And not to sleep on the part with which they find pain, until it heals.
But if there occurs with the crushing of the bone splintering, or something that has become separated from it: then it is necessary that you cut into the skin, and remove it.
Then join the two lips of the wound, if it is large, with sutures.
Then treat it with some flesh-forming substance, from the ointments, until it heals.
But if the end bone of the coccyx breaks, which is the end of the tail: then it is necessary that you insert the thumb of the left hand into the anus, and align the broken bone with the other hand, according to what is possible, and with secondary alignment.
Then place upon it, and remove it: and treat the wound with the treatment which preceded, until it heals.
¶ On the repair of the Hip.
Chapter 11.
The hip bones rarely break.
But if they break, then their fracture is nothing but fragmentation in their extremities: and they split lengthwise, and decline inward: and pain occurs to the patient in the location, and stabbing pain: and the leg which breaks becomes numb.
And indeed its repair is that you extend your hand over it, until you determine the nature of the fracture's shape.
But if the fracture is in its extremities only, then align that fracture, according to what is prepared for you from alignment, until it resembles its natural shape.
But if the fracture is lengthwise, or has already declined inward: then make the patient lie on their belly, until the repair of that fracture is prepared for you.
Therefore when you have aligned it, place a plaster upon it: then place upon it a splint of wood, or of leather: and bind with a binding over which you do not fear movement of the fracture, nor removal of the splint.
And align their concavity with that which fills it, until the binding takes it evenly: and instruct the patient to sleep on their back, or on their healthy side.
But if a hot swelling occurs to it: then cease from its extension and its repair, until the hot swelling subsides: and place upon it what settles it, according to what preceded, then return to its repair: and bind it as necessary.
But if splintering occurs in the bone, or it is fragmented, extract it.
On the Restoration of a Fracture of the Upper Arm.
Chapter 12.
The upper arm is that which is between the elbow up to the head of the shoulder blade.
If therefore it breaks, then its restoration is according to one of two methods.
Of which one is: that you take a flat piece of wood of medium thickness, according to this form which follows.
And let two bindings be tied at its two ends.
Then let it be suspended from an elevated place: and let the patient sit upon a seat.
Then let him cast his broken arm over the wood, until it reaches his armpit, in the middle of which let there be attached the curve of the wood.
Then suspend something heavy above it, so that the assistant may extend it downward.
Then let the physician align the fracture with both his hands, until the fracture returns to how it should be.
And the other method is that the patient lie back upon his neck: and suspend his hand from his neck with a binding.
Then instruct two assistants, that one of them hold what is above the fracture with his hands: and that the other hold below it, and let each of them extend toward his side.
And if you wish the extension to be stronger, then bind below the fracture with a binding, and above it with another binding: and let each of the two assistants extend them toward their two sides.
If therefore the fracture is near the extremity of the humerus, then it is necessary that one binding be placed under the armpit, and another under the fracture toward the elbow.
And similarly if the fracture is near the elbow: then it is necessary that a binding be placed above that place, and above the elbow itself.
Then align the fracture with ease without labor, until when the fracture is aligned as it should be, and is applied with good application: then bind it, if no hot swelling occurs.
But if a hot swelling occurs, then leave the binding until the seventh day.
And place upon it unwashed wool soaked in vinegar and rose oil, until when the swelling subsides: then bind it: and the method of binding it is that you place a plaster over the fracture.
Then place a wrapping of new cloth over the plaster.
Then let him gather the forearm over the upper arm itself, and place his open hand over his shoulder.
And place cloth, and bind the forearm over the upper arm, so that the forearm stays in place of splints: if nothing prevents you from that, nor anything of the fractured bone shifts upon you.
But if you fear that something of the fractured bone might shift upon you, then use splints: and it is that you place over the fracture itself a splint which should be wider and stronger than the other splints.
And place between each splint the width of a finger: and let the length of the splints be according to the fracture with an addition of three fingers on each side.
Then bind over the splints with the binding which I mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
And it is that your binding over the place of fracture should be tighter.
And the further the fracture extends, let the binding be lesser.
If therefore you see the position of the splints and the binding, as we said, in the hour in which you restore the limb immediately, then do it: and if you fear a hot swelling, then leave the binding and splints until the seventh day, as we said.
Then examine the binding every three days, so that there does not occur in the place itching, or swelling, or food is prevented from reaching the limb, due to the condition of excessive binding.
Therefore rectify all that, according to what we said.
But if you are confident that nothing of that will occur: then do not loosen the binding, except after three days, or more.
And let the patient's sleeping be upon his back, and his hand upon his stomach: and place under the upper arm a cushion filled with wool evenly.
And observe in every hour of night, or day, that the position of the fractured limb does not loosen, or the binding become slack.
Therefore rectify all that with your skill.
And arrange the patient's food according to the order we prescribed, so that the food should be light at first, until the bone begins to bind: then it is necessary that you make his food more substantial.
For it is the custom of the upper arm and leg that they bind in forty days: then therefore it is necessary that it be loosened, and a bath be administered, and treated with ointments which restore it.
But if the fracture should be ugly, abraded: then do not loosen the bandage and splints from it for up to fifty days, and up to two months.
¶ On the restoration of a Fracture of the Arm.
Chapter XIII.
The arm is composed of two bones, which are named the two focuses.
Of which one is small: and it is that which follows the thumb.
And the other is large, and it is that which is positioned under the small one from the lower part.
Perhaps therefore the larger focus breaks alone, or the small one: and perhaps they break together.
When therefore the small upper focus breaks, then its restoration is easy, and its healing is easier.
And when the lower focus breaks, its fracture is bad, and its healing difficult.
And worse than this is when the two bones break together.
If therefore the bone which breaks is the small upper focus, then it is appropriate for the physician during its restoration to apply a small extension with ease, until he aligns it.
But if the large focus is that which is broken: then it is necessary that he apply a very strong compression.
And it is necessary that he position the figure of the hand during its restoration, and its extension stretched over a pillow.
And let the thumb of the hand be higher than all fingers toward the top: and let the index finger be lower than all fingers, or the rest: and the patient sitting square upon himself, and let the pillow be before him, or directly in front of him, at a height so that the patient does not incur strain.
Then let an assistant extend the arm from the lower part, either with his hand or with a bandage.
And another assistant should extend similarly from above.
Then let the physician align the bone, until he reduces it according to the best figure that he can.
But if in the fracture of the bone there are splinters, then try to reduce every fragment to its place with your strength.
If indeed a separated splinter appears in it, and pierces the skin, and you have no hope in its restoration: then cut over it, and remove it according to the method which we described in those things which were mentioned before.
But if the fracture is with a wound, I have already made a singular chapter for that, therefore take its treatment from there.
But if in the beginning of your restoration a hot swelling occurs, then smear the cloth with a cerate made from rose oil and white wax, and let it be medium between thickness and thinness: and bind the cloth over it with a light binding, until when the swelling subsides: then remove the cerate, and apply a plaster prepared from mill dust with egg white.
Then place the splints, and let the splint which is placed over the fracture itself be somewhat wider and stronger.
And know that the number of splints for the arm is six in most conditions: whether the fracture is in one focus, or in both focuses together.
Then place your binding over the fracture site stronger and more forceful, and somewhat more with binding above the fracture, or below it: or place the binding somewhat softer than its binding, according to what was mentioned before in the beginning of the chapter.
And let the cloths which are wrapped over the fracture be soft, moist cloths: and not hard, rough.
And let the thread with which it is bound be specifically of flax, medium between fine and thick, as we narrated.
And examine the limb and bandage after days.
But if something occurs whose correction is necessary, such as itching which occurs to the limb: then it is necessary that you bathe the limb with heated water, until that itching subsides, and you leave the limb not constricted, until it subsides, then repeat the binding.
But if the binding has already softened, and the bone has already moved, and similar things to those: then correct all that with your strength, and examine again.
For if nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb, due to excessive tightness, then it is necessary that you soften it a little, and leave it for several days, until nourishment flows to it, then tighten it again.
But if none of those things we mentioned happens to the patient, then it should not be loosened, except after twenty days, or thereabouts.
Then let the patient's hand be suspended from his neck.
And let his neck be level, and let it be protected in its strength from agitating movements.
And make him sleep on his back.
And know that this fracture heals in thirty days, or in thirty-two days: and perhaps it heals in twenty-eight days.
All of this depends on the conditions of the complexions, and the conditions of strength.
¶ On the Treatment of Fractures of the Hand.
Chapter 14.
Know that fracture rarely occurs in the metacarpus of the Hand and in the knuckles of the fingers.
And nothing happens to it except bruising many times.
Therefore when a fracture or bruising occurs to the palm: then the patient must sit square: and before him should be a seat at the same level.
Then place his Hand extended upon it.
Then let an assistant extend the broken bones, and let the physician align them, until they are joined in good connection.
Then it is necessary to apply a plaster and tow, if no hot swelling occurs.
Then place a splint above according to the size of the area: and you should have already wrapped it in linen cloth.
But if the fracture is toward the lower part near the belly of the palm, then make something like a sphere from cloth: and instruct the patient to press upon it with his fractured palm: then bind it with a long cloth.
And let the splint be of leather, in which there is softness, so that the leather may be applied to the body of the palm: and tighten it as necessary.
But if the fracture is toward the exterior, then it is necessary: that you place a splint above, and another splint below on the palm: and let the hand be open and straight.
Then apply the binding, as the hand is turned: and extend between the fingers with the bandage.
But if a fracture occurs to any of the knuckles of the fingers, then if it is the thumb, let it be aligned as necessary.
Then let it be bound with the palm: and if you wish, place a straight, small splint on it: so that the fracture is elevated and does not move.
But if the fracture is in the remaining fingers, such as the middle and index, or little and ring fingers, then let it be aligned, and bound with the healthy finger that follows it: or let them all be bound in continuation: and this is better.
Or place upon it a small splint, as we said for the thumb.
And consider in your treatment, and after it the condition of hot swelling: and oppose it with what is necessary, when something of that occurs, according to what is repeated in its description.
On the Repair of a Fractured Hip.
Chapter 15.
The hip bone is often broken, and it becomes apparent to the senses, since it turns toward the inner and posterior part.
And its repair is done thus: a bandage is tightened above the fracture, and another bandage below the fracture.
And the patient should lie face down.
Then the assistant should extend each bandage to its side evenly, and this is when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
But if the fracture is near the root of the hip, then the bandage should be placed toward the pubic area, so that the extension goes upward, and another bandage below the fracture.
And similarly if the fracture is near the knee, then the bandage should be placed near the knee, so that the extension is downward.
Then the physician should align the bone with both his hands until he returns it to the likeness of its natural shape, and the bone is joined with a good connection.
Then it is necessary that you apply a plaster and binding, if no swelling occurs in the limb.
But if swelling occurs in it, then leave it for several days until the hot swelling subsides, then return to your treatment.
The binding should be done thus:
It is necessary that you wrap over the fracture a hard bandage, that is, a strip of cloth, and double it two or three times, and let there be excess remaining from it.
Then wrap the leg until the heel reaches near the root of the buttock.
And insert a long thread between the hip and leg near the knee downward, and let the ends of the thread come from the upper part of the two parts.
Then wrap over the leg and hip what remains of the bandage.
Then place splints over the hip at the location of its fracture, and place one of them over the leg bone.
Then fill the empty spaces between the leg and hip with soft cloths, so that the binding is even.
Then begin with strong binding from the middle over the fracture site with three or four wrappings.
And the further you move with the bandage from the fracture site, let your binding be lesser and softer and gentler.
Then attend to the two ends of the thread which you inserted between the hip and leg.
Therefore tie with both the three splints which are above.
Then go with the two ends of the thread downward until you reach the ankle of the foot.
And with both also bind the ends of the splints from the other side, so that the bandage does not move from its place.
Then leave the binding upon it while it remains thus, provided that no erosion occurs to the limb, nor swelling, nor inflammation, and similar things.
But if anything of that occurs:
Hasten therefore to loosen it, and rectify everything that occurs from it, according to what we have said many times.
If indeed there is a fragment of bone that is piercing, then it is necessary that you align it, if it is possible for you.
And if not, cut over it and remove it, and treat with that whose remembrance has preceded, until it heals.
And sometimes this hip fracture is bound without splints being added to it, as we said regarding the shoulder and arm.
However, in repairing it when fractured in such a way, lameness does not occur in the patient.
And if it is repaired alone, without the other leg being attached to it, then it is necessary that its owner will always limp.
And know that the hip is bound for fifty days, or a little more is added, or a little less: all that is according to the diversity of constitutions and other conditions.
On the Repair of Fractures of the Kneecap.
Chapter XVI.
Know that fracture rarely occurs to the kneecap, but bruising happens to it many times.
If indeed a fracture occurs to it, then it is nothing but either a crack, or a hole in its parts.
And this is either with a wound, or without a wound.
And all of this is determined by sensation.
And its repair is thus, that what is broken from its parts should be evened out with the fingers, until it is brought together and joined according to what is possible in terms of alignment, ease, and craftsmanship.
Then apply a plaster made of sesame flour, or mill flour, with egg white: and place upon it a round splint, if you need it: and bind it above with a binding suitable for that.
Then consider all the conditions which we have described in other fractures: such as hot swelling, and similar things: so that you may counter every symptom with what is appropriate for it, until it heals.
On the Repair of Fractures of the Leg.
Chapter XVII.
Know that the Leg has two bones, one of which is thick, and is called by the name of Leg: and the other thin, and is called the Splint-bone.
And both types of fractures occur to them which occur to the two bones of the arm: and because of that its repair is done just like the repair of the arm equally, and the procedure is one.
If the two bones break together, the Leg turns to all sides.
And if the thinner bone breaks, the Leg turns to the anterior part.
And if the thicker bone breaks, you find it lower: and it is among those things which are not hidden from you.
Then administer extension, alignment, and binding of splints according to that equally.
However, it is necessary, if the fracture of the Leg is an ugly fracture, having many fragments: that the extension be lesser, and gentler in your relief.
And indeed in the Leg there is something in the procedure beyond the arm: and it is that when you align the splints, and complete all your procedure, then take two bands of pine wood, which is used in the construction of floors that is placed under boards: and they are made from palm spatulas: and choose from those which have small thickness, and are not from the minute ones: and let their length be according to the length of the Leg from knee to below.
Then wrap each one with cloth in two wrappings according to its length.
And place one part of the Leg from one side, and the other from the other side: and let them be from the knee to below the foot.
Then bind the two bands in three places from the two extremities and middle.
For when binding is prevented, the Leg declines to right and left, and stands in a good position.
And indeed a cradle of wood should be administered according to the length of the Leg, and the Leg should be placed in it, so that it may preserve it from movement.
And most importantly it is necessary that you do this in a fracture when there is especially a wound with it.
Then examine the Leg every day, and study it with ultimate attention for swelling, or inflammation, or other things.
If therefore any of these occurs, then counter it with what is necessary, until it heals, if God wills.
On the fracture of the bones of the Foot and Toes.
Chapter 18.
Indeed, fracture never occurs in the heel bone.
However, fracture sometimes occurs in the bones of the Foot, and fracture rarely occurs in the Toes: and nothing happens to them except crushing in most cases.
If fracture occurs in the bones of the Foot, and you see those bones raised up against each other, then let the patient put his Foot on prepared ground, as if walking.
Then stand, and place your Foot on what is elevated from those bones: then press, or step on it: and level it until it returns to its place.
Then apply a plaster, and put tow on top: and place under the sole of the Foot a small board, which should have two flat ends.
Then bind it with the Foot with proper binding, after you wrap it with cloths and other things that are needed.
When therefore three or four days have passed, then loosen the bandage.
For you will find the bones leveled, whether they were fractured or dislocated.
Therefore the procedure for them is as you see.
But if any toes are broken, then restore them, and align them according to what I told you about restoring the fingers of the hand.
Then place on your finger a splint according to the length of the toe, and let it be slightly wider than it: then place under the Foot this board which I described to you, and bind it with proper binding.
If indeed what is broken from the bones is two, or three, or more, then place over each toe a splint of its size, wrapped in linen cloth: and bind the board to the bottom of the Foot: and let it stand on one of the ends of the board outside the sole of the Foot, so that it holds with good retention.
And it is proper for you not to forget to consider everything I told you in the remaining fractures about the accidents we mentioned: and oppose each accident with what is necessary.
¶ On the fracture of a woman's Vulva, and of the pubic bone, and of a man's penis.
Chapter 19.
When a woman's Vulva is broken, then make her sit square.
Then incline her slightly toward her back, and let her be held from behind.
Then let the midwife fill her Vulva with cotton, until she fills it: and let it become in the Vulva like a sphere from it.
Then let the woman be shaken, and raise her back gradually.
For that cotton comes out, until it becomes before the entrance of the Vulva like a sphere, and the broken bone returns.
Then place a small cushion on her back.
Therefore when she wants to urinate, let her remove the cotton carefully, then urinate: and return it according to the way in which you first inserted it: then let her return to her first cushion.
Let her do that for seven days, or thereabouts, for the bone itself heals.
And if you wish, take a sheep's bladder, and bind over its opening a reed pipe, and insert the whole bladder into her Vulva.
Then blow into the pipe with force, until the bladder inflates inside the Vulva, for the fracture returns.
Then let it be filled with cotton, and let it remain for some days, according to what we described, until it heals.
And when the pubic bone of a man or woman is broken, then administer in its restoration and its leveling that which we described for the hip bone.
And the correct way is not hidden in these nearby fractures, which rarely occur, especially for one who has some study or practice.
And understand this book of mine much, since the fracture itself indicates to you in most cases the right way in its restoration and its binding: therefore understand.
But when a man's penis is broken, take a goose's throat: and insert the penis into it.
Then place over it a wrapping of cloth, and let it be wrapped, and let it be left for three days, or thereabouts, and it will heal, God willing.
¶ On the restoration of bone fractures when accompanied by a wound.
Chapter 20.
It is appropriate for one who has suffered a fracture with a wound, especially if it is large, like a hip bone or shoulder bone or similar to it, that you hurry and bleed them immediately, if the conditions for bloodletting are favorable, as we mentioned before.
If the wound is flowing with blood, then it is necessary that you hurry to stop it, by sprinkling powdered vitriol over it, if nothing else is available to you.
Then begin to restore the fracture on that same day: and do not postpone it, unless inflammation occurs.
If however hot inflammation occurs, then leave its restoration until the ninth day, until the inflammation subsides.
And do not approach it on the third and fourth day at all, for you would cause bad complications.
If however the fractured bone is protruding above the skin exposed: then you must try to reduce it and align it with your hands with gentleness and slight extension.
If however its extension and alignment cannot be achieved with your hands: then reduce it with this instrument.
And it is an instrument made of iron, whose length is about seven or eight fingers, and its width is according to the size of the wound.
And for this reason it is necessary for the physician to take three or four of them according to the amount needed for treatment in every type of fracture.
And let it be round: and let there be a small thickness in it, so that it does not bend during compression upon it at the time of operation: and let it be sharp-pointed, with an edge at its extremities.
And let its upper part be of thickness from its middle down to its lower parts.
And this is its form.
It is necessary in this operation that its curved sharp end be placed on the end of the protruding bone: and push it with it once, until when the bone returns and is somewhat aligned.
Therefore try to align the ends of the fracture with each other.
But if its fractured end is thin, and the instrument cannot get a good grip on it, then it is necessary that you cut the end of that bone until the instrument has power over it.
If however you cannot reduce them with what we have described at all, then cut it with what is suitable from the cutting instruments we mentioned: or saw it with one of the saws in whatever way possible for you.
Then scrape away what remains on the bone of roughness and small fragments.
When therefore the bone is reduced, and the patient finds severe damaging pain after its reduction, then know that the bone has not returned to its natural place.
Therefore do this.
For you bring great benefit to the patient when your restoration of the bone is completed.
Then submerge a cloth in astringent black wine.
And especially if it is in summer.
And do not put wax ointment on the wound, nor anything containing oil: lest it cause putrefaction and corruption in it.
Then apply splints at the time you complete the bone restoration.
And leave the wound exposed: so that you cut with scissors a hole in the bandages according to the size of the wound.
And take every precaution not to constrict the wound with the fracture.
For many times foolish physicians have done this: and have caused either death, or gangrene, or zuche (that is, pus) to occur in their patients.
And let your binding be soft, gentle, different from the binding of other fractures.
But if the wound is bad, or if the wound is large, and you fear over it certain bad complications which we have described, and you find persistent pain in the area: then you should not put splints on it.
And make bandages for them from hard cloths in place of splints, and bind it with these.
When it has been one day or two days, and you see the wound already beginning to generate pus: then remove from above it the cloth which you placed over it with wine.
Then administer lint cloths and ointments with which it is our custom to treat wounds: such as tetrapharmacon ointment and similar ones to it.
And it is proper for you to loosen the bandage.
And examine the wound every day morning and evening, until it consolidates and heals.
And it is necessary that the limb be positioned in such a way that pus flows from it downward with ease.
But if many days pass for the wound, and it does not consolidate, nor does the pus cease from it: then know that there are small bone fragments there.
Therefore it is necessary that you examine the wound with a probe.
However many of those bone fragments are loose, remove them and extract them.
And those which are not separated, and which prick the limb and cause pain to occur, try to cut them and remove them in whatever way possible for you.
But if zuchen or ekileten (that is, gangrene) occurs in the wound, or another type of corruption and putrefaction: then it is necessary that you treat each of these with what is appropriate for it from the treatment, whose description preceded in its chapter.
And among that which it is necessary that my discourse should emphasize, and to which you should give your present attention when a bone is broken and protrudes over the limb, like the hip bone and shoulder bone and similar ones from the large limbs, is that you should not attempt to pull it, for often death occurs from that, but rather leave it until it decays.
For perhaps it will fall off by itself after twenty or thirty days.
Then therefore treat the wound, if it seems right to you: and if not, leave it alone.
¶ On the Treatment of Nodules in the Site of a Fracture.
Chapter 21.
This Nodulation often occurs in the site of a healing fracture.
Especially that which is near the joints: and the appearance of the limb is disfigured by it.
And perhaps it prevents the limb from its natural function.
Consider therefore then, if the nodule is recent: administer medicines which have astringency to it, such as aloe, and frankincense, and myrrh, and sarcocolla, and acacia, and similar things to these.
Thus, take some of these, or all of them: and combine them with astringent wine, or with egg white, or with vinegar: and place them over the nodule in tow, and bind them over it with good binding.
And leave the binding, do not loosen it for many days.
Then loosen it, and repeat another, until the nodule is removed.
Or bind a lead plate over it appropriately.
For lead has the property of removing everything that is feared from limbs.
But if the nodule has already turned to stone, and is tight, and necessity quickly calls for removing it: then cut into it from its upper part, and cut away the protruding excess: or scrape it with certain rasps, until it is removed: and treat it until it heals.
¶ On the Treatment When it is Restored, and the Limb Afterward Remains Thin, Not According to its Nature.
Chapter 22.
When a bone fracture is restored, and the limb afterward remains thin, weak: then this happens only because of many causes.
Of which one is, frequent loosening of the bandage and binding it not according to what is proper: or because of excessive tightness of the bandages, until nourishment is prevented from flowing to the limb: or because of excessive moistening at the wrong time: or because of scarcity of blood in the patient's body, and its weakness.
And its treatment is to feed the patient, and to make his body soft, until blood multiplies in it.
And administer a bath.
And introduce joy and happiness to him.
Then place pitch on the limb: so that the pitch draws much nourishment to it.
And continue its moistening with tepid water, until nourishment flows, and it returns to its natural appearance.
¶ On the treatment of fractured bones when they heal crookedly.
Chapter 23.
When it happens that a limb that has already healed after treatment becomes crooked, and there is a protrusion of the fractured bone, or a nodule: and the form of the limb is disfigured by it, yet the limb is not prevented from its natural function: then you should not accept the advice of one who thinks that the limb should be broken again.
And there have indeed been many foolish physicians and bone-setters who have done this in our land.
And this procedure is indeed very blameworthy, leading to death, or great fear, namely that it might be fatal.
But if the lameness and nodule are recent: then it is necessary to apply fomentation with tepid water, in which softening herbs have been boiled, such as marshmallow leaves, and its root, and melilot, and similar things.
And make a plaster for it with a softening plaster, such as properly made diachylon.
Or take the mucilage of marshmallow root, and shake it with chicken fat, or sesame oil: and make a plaster with it.
Or take fat figs, and grind them with pigeon dung, and similar things which are named among medicines that reduce consolidation.
And sometimes the nodule is dissolved with persistent, long-term, and gentle friction, which is done with moist hands.
And movement of the limb should be administered in all directions at all times.
But if the crookedness has already preceded, and has become strong, and has turned to stone, and there has arisen a necessity for treating it with iron: then it is necessary that its upper part be cut, and the continuity of the bone be broken, and what is excessive from the nodule or bone be cut away with fine cutting tools: and ease should be administered in that with care and attention.
¶ On the Discussion of Dislocation.
Chapter 24.
Dislocation is the exit of any joint from its place.
Whereby it is prevented from its movement, and the shape of the limb is disfigured.
And it causes severe pains and injuries to come upon the patient.
Therefore when dislocation happens to someone, then it is necessary to hurry to its treatment: and do not delay it at all.
For if it is delayed, the area becomes inflamed, and perhaps with it the reduction of the dislocation.
Because of that therefore it is not proper to move it, nor to extend it during the time of its inflammation.
Since many times it causes spasm and harmful pains to occur.
But when that happens, then it is necessary that you hurry to bleed the patient.
Then let it be left until the inflammation subsides.
Then the limb should be fomented with hot water and oil.
Then it should be reduced with care.
And every limb should be treated with that which mention will come of in its place.
I indeed have already arranged the chapters on dislocation, also according to what preceded in fracture, from the upper part of the body to its lower part.
On the treatment of dislocation of the lower jaw.
Chapter 25.
The two jaws are rarely dislocated except on rare occasions.
And the dislocation of both occurs in one of two ways.
Either they are removed from their places by a small displacement, and are slightly loosened.
Or they are dislocated with a complete, full dislocation, until they loosen towards the chest, until the patient's saliva runs, and he cannot hold it, nor can he close his mouth, and his tongue becomes involved in speech.
When its dislocation is small, then it returns in most cases by itself with little intervention.
But if the dislocation is complete, full: then it is necessary that its reduction be administered quickly, and not delayed at all: and it is that an assistant should hold the patient's head: and the physician should insert the thumb of one of his hands into the root of the dislocated jaw between its bone, if the dislocation is on one side.
Or he should insert both his thumbs together, if the dislocation is on both sides.
And the remaining fingers of his hands should be outside, with which he aligns it.
And instruct the patient to clear his jaws, and release them for chewing in every direction.
And the physician should align the jaw, and push the jaw, until it returns to its place.
But if its reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are involved together: then administer steam with hot water and oil, until the reduction of both becomes easy: and do not delay the reduction of both at all, as we said.
Therefore when they return and are aligned, and the patient's mouth closes, and they do not loosen: then place cushions of cloth over them, with a wax plaster that is made from wax and rose oil.
Then it should be bound gently with soft bandages.
And the patient should sleep on his back: and his head should be positioned between two pillows, so that he does not move it to the right and left: nor should he attempt, or be forced to chew anything: rather his food should be made into a mild soup, until when the pains are removed, and the jaw is knitted: then he may eat what he wants, and this should be administered with ease.
He should not strain over the operation of his mouth in eating and drinking, and yawning, until the jaw is knitted, and healed.
But if the reduction of the two jaws becomes difficult, when they are dislocated at some time, and do not return to their places: then often fevers occur from this, and persistent headache: and perhaps the patient's bowels are loosened, and perhaps he vomits pure bile.
Therefore when you see this: then know that it is destruction, and often the one to whom this happens dies within ten days.
On the reduction of dislocation of the Clavicle, and the extremity of the upper arm.
Chapter 26.
Indeed the clavicle is not dislocated from the inner side, because of its connection with the chest.
And it is sometimes dislocated to the outside: and this is apparent to the senses.
And its restoration is that the patient should lie on his back, and extend his arms.
Then compress the area with your palm with strong compression, for it will return.
Then place a plaster over it, and cushions, and bind it.
Indeed its extremities which follow the elbow, and are connected with it, are not dislocated, except rarely.
But if it is dislocated on some day: then it is necessary that it be reduced and aligned according to what we said, and what is prepared for you.
Then place a plaster over it, and cushions, and a bandage.
And instruct the patient to maintain tranquility and rest, until he is healed.
And with this same treatment the extremity of the upper arm is reduced, when it is also separated from its place.
¶ On the Reduction of Dislocation of the Shoulder.
Chapter XXVII.
Know that the shoulder can only be dislocated in three ways.
One of which is when it is dislocated towards the armpit downward.
The second is when it is dislocated towards the chest.
And sometimes it is dislocated to the upper part of the shoulder: and this happens rarely.
And it is not dislocated posteriorly, because of the shoulder blade.
And it is not dislocated anteriorly, because of the nerves.
And most often it is dislocated and moves downward towards the armpit: especially in those whose flesh is sparse.
Because in them it moves out quickly, and moves back in quickly.
In those whose flesh is abundant, it is the opposite of this, namely that it moves out with difficulty, and moves back in with difficulty.
And sometimes it happens to some people that due to a blow, or a fall, the shoulder becomes swollen with a hot swelling, and because of this it is thought that it has been dislocated.
Therefore, it is necessary that you examine it, until you are certain of it, and then proceed with its treatment.
And a dislocation is recognized when it is downward towards the armpit: and you should distinguish between the dislocated shoulder and the healthy shoulder.
For you find between them a clear difference, and you find in the head of the shoulder a cavity, and under the armpit upon touching the head of the shoulder it is as if it were an egg: and the patient cannot raise his hand to his ear, nor move it in any direction.
And similarly, if it is dislocated towards the chest, or upward: then you find clear evidence upon touching, nor is it hidden.
And indeed the reduction of this dislocation becomes easy when it is recent, or the patient is a child.
And its reduction is thus: let an assistant raise his hand upward.
Then place your thumbs under his armpit, and raise the joint forcefully upward to its place: and let the assistant raise his hand, and extend it upward.
Then let him lower it, for it returns quickly.
But if it does not return by what we have described, and many days have passed since the dislocation occurred: then it is necessary that the patient be bathed in warm water, and an embrocation be administered which softens and soothes, such as if marshmallow roots, fenugreek, and melilot are cooked in water, and administered.
Then let the patient lie on his back: and let there be placed under his armpit a sphere of wool, which should be balanced between softness and firmness.
Then let the physician place his heel on the sphere, and raise the head of the shoulder with force, and pull the patient's arm downward.
And let another assistant hold the patient's head, so that it does not move downward: for it returns immediately.
And if you wish, reduce it according to this method: that is, have present a man who is taller than the patient, and let him stand at the side, and insert his shoulder under the patient's armpit: and raise his armpit upward, until the patient is suspended in the air.
And let another assistant pull the patient's arm downward towards his belly.
But if the patient is light: then it is necessary that something else be suspended with him, to weigh him down: for the dislocation returns immediately.
And it is also reduced according to another method: that is, let a long piece of wood be fixed in the ground, whose head is round in shape: like the handle of a mortar: which should neither be thick nor thin.
Then let it be placed under the patient after soft cloths are placed on the head of the wood: and let the patient be standing according to the length of the wood.
Then let his arm be extended downward on one side, and let his body be extended on the other side with force: for the joint returns to its place quickly.
If its reduction is difficult through all that we have said, then use this treatment: that is, take a wood whose length is the measure of two arms, and its width the measure of four fingers, and its thickness the measure of two fingers: which should have a round head, so that its entry into the depth of the armpit is eased, according to this form.
Then let soft cloths be tied over the round head, so that the wood does not harm the patient.
Then let it be placed under the patient's armpit, so that the hand or arm is extended over the wood down to the lower parts: and let the wood be tied over the upper arm and forearm and extremity of the hand.
Then let the arm be placed over the step of a ladder by its width, and let the hand be extended downward, and let the rest of the body be left suspended from the other side.
For the joint goes in immediately.
When therefore its entry is completed in whatever way possible: then it is necessary that you place under the armpit a sphere of equal size made of wool.
Then place a plaster prepared from mill dust with frankincense and egg white over the entire shoulder, as it is wrapped over it.
Then bind beneath the armpit with proper binding: and let the bandage be wrapped over the plaster above: and let his hand be tied to his neck, and let it be left, nor let his hand be moved for seven days.
And it is necessary that the patient's food be little, until the limb is strengthened: since it is quicker for its healing.
Then let it be made more abundant after seven days, or five, and let it be exercised with movement.
If therefore it becomes firm and does not soften, then it has already healed.
If however the joint dislocates many times, because of moisture that affects it, or because of another cause: then it is necessary that cautery be administered to it with three holes, according to what was mentioned in the chapter on cautery.
If all this is done, and the bandage is loosened after seven days, and the joint is not secured, and the plaster and binding are reapplied over it several times, and it does not hold firm, and falls, and cannot be raised upward: then know that its nerves which are at the head of the humerus have already been cut, or stretched, or softened: and know that the joint will never be fixed in its place.
The reduction of a dislocation that occurs toward the chest and breast, or toward the back, is accomplished with pushing and extension using the hands: until it returns, and the remaining binding and treatment should be administered to it until it heals.
If after healing heaviness occurs in the limb, and slowness in its movement, then the patient should use the bath many times, until that heaviness is relieved, and it returns to its original nature.
¶ On the treatment of Elbow dislocation.
Chapter 28.
Know that the Elbow joint is dislocated with difficulty, and similarly returns with difficulty also: and it can indeed be dislocated to all sides, and especially to the front or to the back.
And its dislocation is not hidden from you: since it is apparent to sight and touch, in whatever way it is dislocated.
And when you compare the dislocated elbow with the healthy one, this becomes clearly evident to you.
For the joint becomes hollow, and cannot bend the arm, nor touch its shoulder with it.
And it is necessary that you hurry, and reduce the dislocation immediately, before a hot swelling occurs in it.
For if a hot swelling occurs in it, its reduction becomes difficult: and perhaps it will not heal at all, especially when it is toward the back.
For it is the worst of all types of dislocations, and causes the most severe pain of them: and death often follows with it.
And its restoration when it is among those that are possible to reduce, is that his hand should be extended with both hands: and his arm should be expanded, and the physician's hands should be above and below the elbow, and he should push the joint with the thumbs of both his hands together, or with the heel of his palm, until it returns to its place.
Or if the dislocation is toward the front: then it returns thus, that he should bend the hand with his hand, until he strikes the dislocated elbow with the heel of his palm.
If the dislocation does not yield to reduction, then administer very forceful, strong extension: that is, two assistants should extend the arm: and two assistants should also hold it, so that it does not move during extension.
Then the arm should be rotated to every side after a long folded cloth or wide bandage is wrapped around his hand.
And when the physician touches the joint with his hand, he should anoint it with oil: so that this may be among those things that help in the lubrication of the joint with ease.
Then he should push the joint with forceful pushing, until it returns.
And after its reduction, it is necessary that a plaster be placed over it, in which there should be astringency and drying with egg white: and it should be bound with proper binding.
And the arm should be suspended from the patient's neck: and left for several days.
Then it should be loosened.
If therefore the joint becomes firm in its place, then remove the bandage from it, and leave it.
And if you see the joint is not well tightened, then repeat the plaster and bandage, and leave it for several days, until it tightens.
Then loosen it.
If however heaviness occurs in it after reduction of the joint, and there is a condition in movement: then administer moistening in bathing, and gentle friction, and compression, until it is soothed, or place upon the joint the fat of a ram's buttock.
Then it should be bound, and left upon it day and night.
Then remove it, and put him in the bath.
When therefore it sweats, then rub the joint with moderate friction.
Then repeat the aleliati [possibly a medicinal preparation] on it once, and a second time, and a third time upon entering the bath, until it softens.
And if you wish, place wet cow dung on it, warmed with butter, and bind it tight.
Do this several times.
For it will soften and return to its normal condition.
¶ On the treatment of dislocation of the Almahassem [wrist].
Chapter 29.
The Mahassem of the hand is often dislocated, that is, the joint which is between the arm and the hand.
And the reduction of its dislocation is easy.
Unlike other joints.
However, it is necessary that there be swiftness in reducing its dislocation in the hour in which it is dislocated, before the area swells: or a hot swelling occurs in it.
And the reduction of the dislocation in it is that you place the Mahassem of the diseased hand on a board, and the assistant extends his hand: and the physician places his palm over the prominence of the joint, and pushes it until it returns.
However, it is necessary that it be observed, if the palm has already receded to the belly of the hand: then the patient should place the back of his hand on the board during the extension and reduction: and if the dislocation is proceeding to the back of the hand, then the position of his hand should be internally on the board, that is, the inner part of his hand should be placed on the board, so that the physician's hand falls upon the prominence of the joint.
If therefore it returns immediately, it is good: and if not, then bind it with a poultice that reduces swelling: and leave it, and do not repeat it.
For if it cannot tolerate it, nor can you achieve its reduction, after days pass, however the joint remains according to its crookedness: and it does not harm the patient in any way, except that the hand is weakened, and cannot grip anything: then know that the nerves are severed, or worn away.
There is therefore no technique for it, except that it should be bound with a cautery near its fall.
And perhaps that will not help at all.
When therefore the Almahassem does not return, then place upon it the poultice, which we have described.
Then let it be bound, and left for five days: afterwards let it be loosened and left, and let the hand be exercised.
If however its movement is lost, and some heaviness occurs in it: then soften it with heated water, and with friction several times, until it softens.
¶ On the treatment of dislocation of the Fingers.
Chapter 30.
When a Finger from these is dislocated to any part, or from these a Finger to the back of the palm, or its belly: then extend the Finger, and push the dislocation with your thumbs, until it returns.
Then support the head of the Finger, and suspend it toward the part to which it is dislocated, and leave it for two days.
Then suspend it, and extend it, until it is made straight on that day of its own.
When therefore it is night, bind it according to the same account: and do not cease to loosen it in the day: and exercise it with movement: and bind it at night.
Do this for several days, until it is tight.
And similarly do with it, if it is dislocated to the belly of the hand: and bind it to that part, and do your first operation with it, until it heals.
And similarly do with it when it is dislocated to the remaining parts.
¶ On the treatment of dislocation of the vertebrae of the back.
Chapter 31.
When someone suffers a complete dislocation of the vertebrae of the back or neck, or many vertebrae are moved from their places: then there is no cure for it, since death hastens to the patient.
And the sign of this is that the patient's waste comes out without control, and he cannot hold it: and often certain of his limbs become paralyzed, or his two legs, or his two arms, or one of them: or a single vertebra is moved from its place.
Indeed it often happens that their displacement occurs in four directions.
That which is displaced toward the back is called Gibbosity [hunchback].
The treatment for this is that you should then consider, if the Gibbosity occurred from childhood: then there is no cure for it, nor is there any healing from it at all.
But for that which occurs from a fall, or a blow, or similar things, the ancients have already described methods of treatment in lengthy discourse.
Most of which does not return with benefit.
I have indeed abbreviated from it, whose little excuses from much of it from my proximity to the intention: and in my exposition which I have explained it, and I have formed its instrument in a different way from that which they showed it, and explained it.
Therefore I say that in gibbosity which occurs from the anterior part, there is no remedy, nor healing from it.
And similarly in that which occurs to the two sides also.
And none of these are cured, except that which occurs in the back specifically, with that which I describe: and it is that the patient should be stretched out on his face on a level platform near a wall: and a moist bedding should be spread under him, so that his chest is not injured.
Then let a straight pole be fixed in a pit in the ground, at the end of the platform, around his head: and another pole around his feet at the other end of the platform: and let an assistant hold the pole, and let it not be firmly fixed in the pit.
And let another assistant hold the other one.
Then wrap around the patient's head, and under his armpits a soft, firm bandage: and extend the end of the bandage to the pole which is at his head: and tie it to it.
Then tighten another bandage above his hips, and above his knees, and at his ankles.
Then gather all the bandages together, and tie them to the other pole which is at his feet.
Then let each assistant pull the bandage toward the pole's side, and let the two poles not be moved from their places in which they are fixed: however they should not be firmly fixed, as we said.
And let the physician place his palms on the vertebra with force, until it returns: or let him place a board on it.
Then let him attach his feet over the board, until it returns.
But if it does not return through this treatment, then take a board whose length is about three arms' length.
And hollow out in the wall which we said is near the patient, a place into which the end of the board may enter.
Then place the middle of the board over the vertebra.
And let the physician place his feet on the other end.
And let him press well, until the vertebra is compressed, and returns to its place.
Then if you wish, work with the winch which is turned with your hand: and it is that you fix in the ground at the head of the patient at the back of the platform two poles, whose length should be one arm's length: and at his head at the back of the platform two poles.
And let the length which is between each pole be one palm: and already a hole has been made in each place, in which the winch runs: and let each pole be fixed very firmly in the ground, lest it move at all.
And let a round pole be inserted: and it is a winch in which the bandage is wound in the two holes of the two poles.
And at its end there is a hole, in which is fixed a wooden piece, whose length is a palm including what revolves: and in the other two wooden pieces it is similarly so.
Then tighten the bindings which you fastened on the patient's chest with the turner that is at his head: and the bindings which you fastened on his legs with the turner that is at his feet.
Then let an assistant stand at each turner, who should turn his hand with the strap by which the turner is rotated: and the physician should align the vertebra, according to what we said.
This is the form of the turner that follows.
Then after the vertebra returns and the area is aligned, then it is necessary that you apply a drying plaster with egg white.
Then [apply] tow (hemp/flax fibers).
Afterwards place above the plaster a splint made from a board, whose width should be three fingers, or thereabouts.
And its length should be enough to cover the area of the hump and over part of the healthy vertebra.
Then let it be bound with the binding we mentioned.
And let the patient use light nourishment until he is healed.
But if some protrusion remains in the area at the end of healing: then it is necessary that medicines which soften and soothe be administered, with the application of the board which we described for a long time.
And a lead plate is now applied to it.
And sometimes a protrusion occurs in the back of the spine's vertebrae: and through this a dislocation is suspected, and it is that bone which protrudes.
Therefore one should not attempt this treatment on it: for perhaps it will cause death.
¶ On the treatment of a dislocated hip.
Chapter 32.
Know that the joints of the hip and the joints of the shoulder suffer nothing but complete dislocation: nor do they suffer what happens to other joints from slight displacement and hollowing.
And indeed the hip joint is dislocated in four directions.
That is, because it dislocates forward and backward.
And most often it dislocates inward: and rarely dislocates forward and backward.
And the treatment of its dislocation inward is: that when you join the patient's healthy leg with the injured one, it is longer: and his knee protrudes more than the healthy one, and the patient cannot bend his foot at the groin: and the area following the groin is swollen with hot swelling, because the head of the hip has arrived there.
And the sign of one who has suffered dislocation outward is that his symptoms are contrary to these symptoms.
And the sign of one who has suffered dislocation forward is that he extends the healthy leg completely: however he does not bend it without pain which is in the knee: and if he tries to walk, he cannot [move] forward on it: and his urine is retained, and his groin swells, and when walking his stepping is on the heel.
And the sign of one who has suffered dislocation backward is that he cannot extend the knee, nor can he bend it before bending the groin: and his leg is also shorter than the other: and the groin is softened, and the head of the hip is at the location of the ilium.
The reduction of these types of dislocation is that you should then consider if the dislocation is old, which has already become chronic in the one having it.
Then if you administer its reduction, and it remains in its condition: then there is no treatment for it at all.
Therefore one should not attempt it at all.
But in one whose dislocation is recent, and is of one of the four types of dislocation: then hasten to rotate the joint, and extend it inward and outward, and move it right and left: for perhaps it will return, and does not need other treatment.
But if it does not return this way, then it is necessary that you prepare a strong assistant, and he should extend his leg from the lower part: either with his hands, or with a binding, which is tied over his leg above the knee: and another assistant should extend his hand from above, so that he puts his hands under his armpits.
Then let him bind with a soft bandage above the root of the hip, and hold the end of the other bandage.
And let its extension be either from the anterior part of the groin to the collarbone area, or from the posterior to the back area.
And let the extension of all of them be at once, until the patient is lifted with his body from the ground, and remains suspended.
And indeed this type of extension is a common type among the four types.
If therefore the dislocation returns with what we have said, it is good: and if not, then each type needs that which I will speak of regarding proper treatment.
In its proper reduction when the dislocation is toward the interior, it is necessary that the patient lie back on his healthy side.
Then place the bandage above the root of the hip, in that area which is between the head of the hip and the place below the groin.
Then extend the bandage upward from the groin area to the higher part of the body, to the collarbone area.
Then let another strong assistant take his arms, and reduce the thick area of the diseased hip, and extend it outward with vigorous extension.
Indeed it has already returned to its place.
And this type is easier than the remaining types of treatment by which this limb is reduced.
But if it defies you, and does not yield to entry with this type of treatment at all: then it is necessary that the patient's two feet be bound together with a strong, soft bandage, above the two heels and above the two knees: and let the distance of each from its partner be four fingers' width: and let the diseased leg be extended more than the other by two fingers' width.
Then let the patient be suspended over the head of a wooden beam, which should be in the house: and let its height from the ground be two arms' length.
Then order a strong young man to secure the head of the hip: and let another young man be suspended with the patient: and let another young man, securing the hip, push with force, for the joint returns to its place quickly.
In its proper return, when the dislocation is outward, it is necessary that the patient lie on a bench, according to what we described for one having a hump.
And let the bandage be bound over his diseased leg specifically, and over his chest.
Then let two wooden pieces be placed, one at his feet, and the other at his head.
Then let an additional piece of wood be placed in the middle of the bench, firmly fixed: over which wet cloths are wrapped, so it does not harm the patient: and let the wood be between his hips, so it is not pulled downward during extension.
Then let each assistant extend toward his side, and let the physician equalize the reduction with his hand.
If therefore it yields to return, it will be good.
And if not, place a board over it, and press it, as we said in the case of the hump, evenly.
However, it is necessary that the patient lie on his healthy side.
And when the dislocation is toward the front, then it is necessary that the patient's leg be quickly extended: and it is according to this same account upon a podium: and let the physician place the palm of his right hand over the patient's groin.
Then let him compress it with the other hand, and with that compression place it extended downward toward the knee.
And if the dislocation is toward the back: then it is not necessary that the patient be extended downward, and be elevated above the ground: rather it is necessary that he be placed upon a hard surface, just as is necessary if his hip is dislocated outward, according to what we said about his lying on both hips: and he is on his face, and the ligaments extended: according to what we just said.
And it is necessary that compression be administered with a board also over the place to which the joint exits, when the reduction is completed as necessary.
And the sign of its return is not hidden from you: and it is that you extend the patient's two legs: and when you see them equal, and the patient tightens his leg, and extends it without excuse: then know that the limb has already returned as necessary: then join the two thighs, and apply a plaster, and bind with an imemati, that is, a wheel: so that the hip does not move to any side: and let the patient adhere to rest for three or four days.
Then loosen the bandage and the plaster, and compare the leg with the other: then if you see them equal in position, then know that the dislocation has already been secured: therefore release the patient to walking.
And if you see any looseness: then return, and plaster it, and bind it according to your first binding: and leave it also for three days.
Then loosen it and make him delay in walking on both for some days, until it is well strengthened.
¶ Concerning Dislocation of the Knee.
Chapter 33.
The knee is dislocated in three ways.
It is dislocated outward, inward, and downward, that is, backward.
And it is not dislocated forward.
And the sign of its dislocation is that you order the patient to join his leg to his thigh.
If however it does not join with the thigh: then know that the Knee is dislocated.
And the restoration of all types of its dislocation is that you make the patient sit upright, so that he extends his leg if he can upon it, and your back joins to his face: and place his foot between your feet.
Then make his Knee join with your palms, and straighten them between your fingers over his Knee.
Then apply with your palm both sides of his Knee with force.
And let another assistant extend his foot, until the Knee returns to its place.
And the sign of its return is that the leg joins with the thigh in smoothness, not laboriously.
Then plaster it, and make the leg join with the thigh.
Then bind them together with a band for three or four days.
Then loosen them.
And let the patient not use walking for some days, until he is healed.
If however its reduction is refused to you, then administer strong extension with bandages, whose account preceded in the treatment of the hip, until it returns.
On the Treatment of Dislocation of the Heel
Chapter 34
The heel sometimes moves with a small displacement, and sometimes becomes completely dislocated.
And its dislocation occurs either inward or outward.
And the sign of its dislocation is that you see the heel swollen, protruding toward the side to which it is dislocated.
The treatment of its displacement is easy to reverse: it is to extend it gently with the hands and align it until it returns.
In treating it when it is completely dislocated, it is necessary that you have the patient sit upright: and a very strong assistant should hold him from behind his back, in the middle of it.
Then you hold his foot with your right hand from its upper part, and with your left hand from the lower part of his foot at the ankle.
Then pull the foot toward you with your right hand.
Then with the left hand twice.
Then extend with the left, and push the instep with the right hand toward the leg without strain.
Do this twice, as we have described.
Then push the instep toward the leg a third time, while you pull the ankle.
If it returns in one or two attempts in this way, and you see the foot aligned, it is good: and if not, then repeat the procedure on it: for it will return.
But if you are prevented from reducing it with what we have described: then have the patient lie on his back on the ground, and fix a peg firmly in the ground, so that it falls between his hips: and you have already wrapped cloth around it, so it does not harm the patient.
Then let an assistant take his thigh: afterward let another assistant extend the foot, either with his hands or with a bandage tied over the neck of the foot.
Then let each assistant pull against the extension of his companion: and let the peg stand between the patient's two thighs holding him, so that his body is not drawn downward during the extension.
Then let the physician align the dislocation with his hands, and let another assistant hold the healthy leg downward.
For the dislocation returns quickly.
When therefore the dislocation returns, and its proper return becomes clear to you: then apply a plaster and tow, and bind it firmly with bandages, and tie the foot to the leg with a bandage.
And it is necessary that you beware or fear for the nerves, which are behind above the heel, so that the bandage is not too tight over them, and harm them.
Then leave it for two or three days.
If the bandage loosens, tighten it: then loosen it on the third or fourth day: and forbid the patient from walking for forty days.
If indeed he attempts to walk before that period, there is no certainty that the dislocation will not recur in him, and become corrupted, and not accept treatment after that.
But if a hot swelling occurs to him: then it is necessary that you administer for its calming that which we have previously described in another place regarding treatment and fomentation, until it is removed.
On the Dislocation of the Toes, and Treatment
Chapter 35
It is necessary that whatever is dislocated from them be aligned with little extension without strain: and that indeed is not difficult, rather it is easy.
If however the dislocation is in some of the joints of the top of the foot: then it is necessary that the patient sit with his foot on a level place on the ground, or on a board: and he is standing as if walking.
Then you stand, and place your foot over what protrudes from those joints.
Then press it with your foot with force, until it returns, and you see it aligned, and no protrusion appears in the place.
Then place under the sole of his foot a board which takes the whole foot, which has two ends.
Then bind it with appropriate binding for three days.
Then loosen it, and make him rest from walking for many days, until it is tightened and secured from recurrence.
¶ On the types of dislocation with wound or fracture.
Chapter 36.
When something of this sort happens, and you attempt its treatment and its restoration, death often follows: and because of this, it is not proper that anyone should undertake the treatment of such a case, unless he is skilled in the art through long practice, compassionate, dutiful, cautious, neither bold nor presumptuous: and that he should use at the beginning only medicines which reduce hot swellings: and leave the patient to divine judgment.
Unless you see or hope for recovery from destruction with mildness of the illness, and in which there appears some hope.
Therefore attempt its reduction immediately at the beginning of the matter, before a hot swelling occurs.
If then the limb returns as we wish, then administer a regimen that reduces swelling: and treat the wound with what is suitable for it from drying ointments.
But if the dislocation is with fracture, and separated bone fragments occur, then attempt their removal, and do in that case what we said about simple conditions from what preceded in their sections.
And be careful according to your ability, and guard yourself from entering the path of fear: according to what I previously advised you.
For that is better for you before your Creator, and more lasting to your glory, and safer for your body among those in your time.
