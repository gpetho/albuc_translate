Chapter four on the reduction of the lower jaw if it is broken
If the lower jaw is fractured and the fracture is not accompanied by a wound, examine it. If the fracture is external only and not a double fracture and it is concave inward, then its diagnosis is easy. Thus, if the fracture is in the right fissure, you should insert the index finger of the left hand into the patient's mouth. Similarly, if the fracture is in the left fissure, you should insert the index finger of the right hand.  Gently lift the hump of the fracture outward from the inside, and with your other hand from outside the bone, control and align it.
If the fracture of the jaw is in two pieces, then extension should be applied from both sides in a straight line until you can align it.
If the teeth have become loose or separated, tie those that you hope will remain with gold, silver, or silk thread. Then, place cerate on the broken jaw, and place a folded cloth over it. On the cloth, place a large, tight splint or a piece of shoe leather equal to the length of the jaw. Then bandage it from above as it seems appropriate to you to bandage it and tie it so that it will not become loose. Order the patient to be quiet and still, and make his food soft broths.
If you think that something has changed in the shape in any way, then quickly undo it on the third day. Then repair what you bandaged with mill dust mixed with egg white or with semolina flour, after removing the cerate from it. Place a soft bandage on the dressing.
As long as that dressing adheres to it and the condition of the bone has not changed, leave it and do not undo it until it heals and the fracture becomes firm. This fracture often becomes firm in three weeks.
If a hot swelling occurs during that time, use what we have mentioned repeatedly to soothe it until the swelling subsides.
However, if the fracture is accompanied by a wound, examine it. If a fragment or fragments have separated from the bone, be gentle in extracting those fragments with whatever instrument you find appropriate.
If the mouth of the wound is narrow, widen it with a scalpel as much as you need.
Then, when you have extracted those fragments and nothing of them remains, stitch the mouth of the wound if it is wide. Otherwise, apply one of the ointments suitable for it and join the wound until it heals.
