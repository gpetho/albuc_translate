Of the fracture of the chest
The chest is sometimes broken in the middle, but this happens rarely; it often breaks on the outside. And when it is broken in the middle, it sinks down, and the patient feels great pain, shortness of breath, and coughs, and perhaps vomits blood, and the protrusion of the broken bone is visible, and it can be easily felt.
And the restoration is that the patient often lies on their back, and places a cushion between the shoulders, then press the shoulders together, and align the ribs of both sides with your hands, and adjust them evenly in every way you can, so that the shape of the bone is as it should be; then apply poultices and tow over a thin splint of willow, or other light wood, and wrap it in a cloth, and bind it over the broken bone, so that it does not move; and turn the bandage around the back, and tighten it properly, and check the bandage every hour, and if it loosens, tighten it; and if it needs to be untied for corrosion or itching that occurs at the spot, or pain or abscess, untie it quickly, and change the poultice, and address the issues with appropriate treatments; then reapply the poultice, and tighten it until it is healed.
