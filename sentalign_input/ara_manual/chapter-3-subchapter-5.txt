On the treatment of the clavicle when it is fractured.
The clavicle is most often fractured from the front at the end of the shoulder, and its fracture occurs in one of three ways: either it breaks and splits in two without producing fragments, which is the easiest type to treat;
or fragments occur at the fracture, which is more difficult to treat; or the fracture is accompanied by a wound.  The procedure, if the fracture is without a wound, is to have two assistants, one of whom steadies the upper arm next to the fractured clavicle, and the other extends the neck toward the opposite side.
Then straighten the fracture with your fingers until it takes the proper shape, without any protrusion or indentation. If you need more extension, you should place a ball of rags or wool under the patient's armpit.
The bone should be the size you need. Extend and raise the clavicle and press the ball with your hand until the fracture is straightened as it should be.  If you cannot pull the end of the clavicle outward because it has gone deep, the patient should lie on his back.
A medium-sized pillow should be placed under his shoulder and the assistant should press his shoulder down so that the clavicle bone, which is deep, rises up. Then repair the fracture and straighten it with your fingers.
If you feel that a fragment of the clavicle has broken and is moving, you should make an incision over it and gently remove that fragment. If the fragment is trapped in the bone, be ingenious in cutting it with one of the cutters that I have prepared for that purpose.
After placing under the clavicle the instrument that protects the peritoneum, which is an instrument of wood or iron, and this is its picture:.
It resembles a spoon without a curvature, and its width is according to what you need for the size of the bone, large or small.  As for its length, it is also according to what enables you to work. And let it have two ends, as you see, one end wider and the other narrower.
If the laceration of the wound that you made when extracting the bone fragment is wide and you are safe from a hot swelling, join the edges of the wound with sutures. If the laceration is small or you fear a hot swelling, then pack the wound with lint and bandages according to the extent of the wound opening.
If a hot swelling develops, moisten the lint in rose oil and vinegar or wine and apply it to the swelling. As for splinting the bone when it is without a wound or incision, it is that you apply to the bone a dressing made from mill dust with egg white.
And place the soft compress on it, then place the ball under his armpit if needed, then take a very long turban whose width is a span or so, then apply a folded compress on the compress and bandage, then take a splint from a thin board.
Its width is three fingers and its length is also, then insert it in a cloth, then insert that cloth with the splint in the place of the turban that falls on the site of the fracture, then tighten the turban on the fracture as you wrap.
And wrap it around his neck and under his healthy armpit and under his injured armpit and return it several times on each side and how you see that the tightening fixes the fracture tightly and precisely, which is not hidden from you. 
And the main concern is that the splint does not move from the fractured bone.
Therefore, you should check the patient every day, so whenever the bandage loosens and you see that the splint has moved, fix it and tighten the bandage, then have the patient sleep on his back and place a small pillow under his armpit when he sleeps at night.
So that his arm is raised from his side, thus the fractured clavicle is raised by raising the shoulder, or tie his arm to his neck, and do not loosen the bandage unless something happens in the area, such as itching or swelling, for twelve days.
Then renew the dressing if you see a reason to.
And repeat the tightening, and leave it until the fractured clavicle heals and sets, and it becomes stronger in twenty-eight days.
And it may be in some people in less than that.
