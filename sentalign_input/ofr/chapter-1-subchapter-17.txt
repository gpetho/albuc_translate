of the treatment of fistula by cautery
When you treat a fistula as we have described in the divisions of diseases, and your treatments are not effective, then you must apply cautery in this manner.
Instruct the patient to put their head in your lap; 
and let the assistant hold their head between their hands in such a way that they cannot move or shake their head;
then place cotton moistened in egg white or parsley juice over the eye;
then heat the cautery, which is like this:
and it is shaped at the tip like a feather of a vulture, together as one the cautery should be;
if you wish, it can be pointed from one end to the other, and if you wish, it can be like a tent;
but still, this one that is pointed is better for your work.
Then press the fistula if it is open, and draw out the pus, and dry it;
and if it is closed, then open it, and draw out the matter;
then apply the cautery hot, and hold your hand to the cautery on the side of the nose above the eye, so that your hand doesn't cause harm;
and place the cautery in the fat of the eye, and destroy it.
If you reach the bone at the beginning of the cauterization, that would be good.
If not, repeat the cauterization again, and again if you need to, and leave it for three days;
afterwards apply cotton soaked in butter, and treat it with the drying ointment until it is healed, and if forty days pass and it is not healed, then apply a sharp corrosive medicine until the bone is exposed;
and then treat it according to what is appropriate in its chapter.
And there is a method of cauterization for fistula that some of the ancients described.
Attend to the fistula, and cut open the area;
afterwards place in the incision a thin tube, of which here is the form:
and they make it about the size of a third of a lead weight;
and hold your hand or the tube firmly, and let the patient not move at all, so that the melted lead does not run into his eye;
and it is necessary to put on the patient's eye cotton moistened in egg white or in water:
the lead thus burns the site of the fistula, and heals it by marvelous healing.
And if the fistula is healed by the cautery that we have described, that is good.
If not, it is necessary to administer a perforation to the nerve, and bring back the fistula to the body of the nerve as appropriate in its proper place.
