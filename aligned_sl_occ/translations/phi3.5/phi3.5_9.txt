So, children, you have completed this book which is on the edge of medical science due to my contribution in it as well through explanations, illustrations, and declarations; thus I see that you understand thoroughly how we divide this subject matter into surgical operations/procedures (Here 'operacions' or 'procèdures chirurgicals', which refers specifically to the realm of surgeries).
When the operation is proposed in our region and at this time of total privacy, I am left alone with my science, whereupon you see me; but only a few descriptions remain from ancient texts freely available to us all, which I will modify herein for correction and clarification. These are now closed off as the intentions behind them and their elongated force/artistry become clear (translation of source sentence:
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
May be the reason why no skilled artisan leaves his tool at their own hand in this time of ours, for medicine is an old science and it demands that its practitioner exercise within the field of anatomy—which Gaius understands well as he knows the movements and forms of these parts; including joint connections and separations, bone structure, nerves, and ligaments. Furthermore, this includes knowledge about pulsating veins and resting blood vessels, along with sites for bleeding cessation in those areas.
Through the water of Hippocrates who says that it moves for its name and mainly in the work or craft of the hand,
We may already have told you about that in the entrance to this free space; who does not know what we've told them regarding anatomy, will find themselves making errors for which death awaits men like those they witnessed, as these are formed by understanding and practicing from this science.
Here comes the first sentence to translate:
Here comes another doctor who orders that the patient swallows a stone from their stomach which had already been processed in its state; this stone was large and came out of it, and he draws that stone out using a tool from the bladder, so that that home dies on the third day.
And you have already called for it to be removed there from, and because of the greatness of the stone and due to its location within the womb that leads to death.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: And another doctor takes his salary from our land'dictor, and brings with him a black instrument which is supposedly fractured in the patient's thigh; preparing himself without knowledge of this broken bone on soft ground (such as pillows or footstools), where he does not allow breath.

And you have called upon it (possibly referring to the healer or remedy previously mentioned), and equipped with tools for loosening the ligament, thus achthy obtained relief from their pains.
Even if there is confirmation of decay in the limb, it cannot be restrained from moving and spreading within while under the influence of the malady (illness).
And here comes another doctor who pierced an abscess, and it was ulcerating daily until its evil genius reached the Lord of that person.
The cause is that the head is tormented by melancholalgy humors, and it does not come to him from everywhere but rather in which his body has suffered overall.
And for this purpose, boys, it is necessary that the operation be planned in two ways: one associated with health and another where there are major risks involved.

So take up your arms for solicitation and protection from God, and let your illness be strengthened and kept firm.
When lost through the worse way due to God's grace we seek salvation and praiseworthy succession, and lay down our heavy illnesses of difficult cure, holding in your hands weapons that cause fear within you so that intervention occurs at faith and under name without evasion: perhaps some remain with you as glory, put them also into the monastery or next to it on their sanctified bodies.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout There are no illnesses caused by evil humors, for such conditions doctors cannot name.
And you have already read this book for the second time three chapters.
Begins with the division of free will, starting from the first partitioned portion. The ordered first chapter within the body weight, in the forms of instruments and iron tools for cautery, what is needed therein for intervention.
The division of the second part. The Second Chapter on Surgery and Puncture, And by Use of Vials, Drops, Boils, and Extraction of Herbs and Similars for those Purposes; All is Ordered in Their Forms According to the Instruments' Shapes.
The third pillar of restoration and displacement, as well as the treatment for twisting injuries and dislocations to these parts; it is ordered from within the head downwards through the body weight, with regard to forms established by instruments.
When you examine the quality of that cauterization and its non-applicability in any part of him/her,
Therefore say that the speech of cautery and its obscurity is long and elaborate due to science, yet frequently they quarrel about it, and for me enough has been heard from them regarding these matters; I am weary of prolongation.
And it is said that the pointed cautery comforts all of the body universally, except for two types of materials from its own matter, namely tail-like substances.
In the complex tail and dry matter; where some say that needles will be beneficial to that area, while others disagree with it because in such illnesses caused by dampness and dryness—where nature of fever is both moisture and dryness—it's appropriate treatment involves soaking up the water which has accumulated therein.
Here comes the first sentence to translate:
Through that speech of his, I have already discovered some waters for myself.
Mays before one cures what has already been exposed and subjected to the art of cutters for today's exercise, understanding is gained regarding the complexity of human composition and how illnesses are positioned within them, as well as their causes and accidents, along with the duration.
May also occur in other complexities, not out of fear but due to frozen and moist humors, which is why all doctors agree on treating these conditions with caution during such procedures.
Indeed, physicians who understand the secret of curative use for focus and about the patient themselves are skilled in medicine' extricators; they perform their work with such tools as cauterizers (used to burn or sear), which only affects the part where it is applied and not any other parts of the body, causing little harm.
May the medicine'se fire reach that in his limbs where it has lain hidden and strong forces cause its appearance there as well as difficulty in recovery, making healing hard for him.
May the fire (likely referring to a treatment method), through its sublimation and beneficial substance, does not overdo it; we have come upon you by experiment and long service in learning this art concerning the truth of causes. Thus, because of our lengthy discourse, you are excused from here today during this break (likely referring to a rest or pause between lessons). While at liberty nowhere but within this interval, I must secretly address issues related to the focus; thus demonstrated through logical speech in philosophy, which will sharpen your minds and clarify thoughts regarding these health concerns.
And if it is wise for men and women when the best time of year to perform cauterizations and pauses, arriveth.

So you do not sit in your knees or on the ground with those who poorly estimate people and physicians, thus that healing through cauterization is not completely stopped, and breaks this consequence.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
Even though chirurgical tools may be considered excessive in medicine due to their inherent vitality and the greatness of one'thy lordship, they are sometimes necessary for effective treatment according to this medical treatise:
It is possible that the patient's illness may return at some time in their life according to the complexity of the humors and location within them; depending on what has been prepared for removal from the feet (superfluous substances) during acquisition through meals and like things as causes, if cautery was administered internally or a subtle illness affecting small excesses and moisture in body parts is treated with tooth pliers addressing pain and semblance-like symptoms; it may be that such an internal treatment will prevent the return of this type of pain, but if not then possibly discomfort might arise here.
Even the common speech may be considered as medicine' extrinsic to our medical knowledge and beyond what we understand through it; they believe that I cannot proficiently treat with this or any other instrument, nor can I address further causes related thereto within the realm of medicine.
The cause is contrary to water; and I understand that the remedies of medicine are only when they administer medicines for certain illnesses, and these treatments do not confer benefits without intervention on the day of the cause itself by applying the cauterizations themselves. And now that the caustic is needed for the last remedy of medicine, according to what I understand as common and often used by physicians.

At such times, another cauterizing tool must be employed immediately for that purpose (implying immediate action to address the headache with a new sharp and effective instrument). Return that over his head for cauterization until the spine is cut apart. Cut the ribcage and reveal the bone quantity that we have noted and seal it with a cauterizing tool in the back part of the head wherein lies the location to which they refer, namely the windpipe'dicto by suction (the area for suction).

When deep joint pain occurs in the head or when there is internal bleeding inside it (the body), medical measures must be taken to address these serious conditions; and they are described within the pages of medicine as diseases that require treatment—either immediate combustion-based cauterization, which involves using heat with a heated instrument like bronze needle or iron knife. Thus far I have not proficiently discussed this subject in detail – it is necessary to mention here briefly (in two ways) the application of medical intervention: one way being immediate combustion-based cauterization, and another involving metal instruments such as a heated needle or iron knife.
May cauteries of medicine burn and you grasp a lancet made of silver, extracting the limbs on both sides from these things. Then apply pressure on the location of pain at one place with a sharp lance inside where it is hidden by bone, within that spot for joint pain relief:

The phrase "caucerizacio delle dolores d'auricella" translates to English as the cauterization of arthritis pains
When in the arthritis there is pain caused by cold and other factors that create lesions (lescaves), which are treated to remove their causes, without any reduction of this pain; only through these cauterizing procedures, namely puncture therapy as described hereinabove—this being its form.
And place points on the inflammation with fire or apply it throughout all of arterial circulation if pain occurs in any part; using a spinning wheel for this purpose is also an option, as well as when applied to specific areas where there is discomfort.

The translated sentence is: "for cauterization using spices that come through the veins, as we have discussed in the divisions of diseases." This line suggests a medieval medical context where specific remedies or treatments involving heat (cauterization) are applied to certain areas for their therapeutic effects. Spices were often used not just for flavor but also for medicinal purposes due to their believed healing properties, and the mention of "veins
The translated sentence is: "avoiding cauterization with dryness or due to nervous cramps." This statement indicates a caution against using heat treatments, such as those involving burning hot substances (potentially including some of the spices previously mentioned), when they

Here, it appears that specific tools (like gold items and temples) are recommended for particular methods of treatment associated with balancing bodily fluids or 'humors.' This reflects the humoral theory prevalent in medieval medicine.
The translated sentence reads: "Pause the treatment with heat for contradictions in a diseased portion; only here it soothes not." This suggests that when treating areas believed to be contrary or out of balance due to illness, using cauterization (the application of localized heat) may actually exacerbate issues rather than provide relief.

The text outlines the course of action based on whether certain health conditions are present ('si per aquelles sanat'). If they aren't, three cauterizing tools (likely instruments for applying heat or pressure to alleviate pain) will be used in specific parts: atopical part above where hair grows and below the collarbone. This section appears as a guideline suggesting that treatment may include direct interventions on these body areas if deemed necessary by medical practice standards of the time (likely implying some form of cauterization). The reference to 'topical' suggests And there is space between each of these cauterizations, and care must be taken with the liquid that comes forth from them.

When the causes of melancholy are rotten and sluggish humors infiltrating our body's systems, it is time to apply those very same caustics that we use for treatment when dealing with spasms or paralysis.

This translation suggests a medieval understanding that when someone speaks about 'water' (aygua) within their system as divided into areas or cavities ('senhals'), this leads to an internal process involving production and excretion by bile, which is associated with the liver. The treatment seems aimed at removing moisture from these processes, possibly referring to a therapeutic approach of drying out what they believe are excess fluids causing illness within the body' extramundane infiltration

In this line, an action directed by someone (possibly a healer) involves elevating the head's crown—which may symbolically refer to enhancing blood circulation around that area. The instruction then specifies applying cauterization at these points for specific conditions involving water in different parts of the body: twice if there is consumption ('comensament') by two legs and once from a bladder (if it refers specifically 'ysegmen' or an element related to fluid intake). This aligns with medieval belief systems around bodily humors, their circulation, absorption in various organs like the kidneys associated with urine ('aygua'), and

When pain occurs in the thigh and it is due to cold moisture, causing an imbalance of bodily fluids (humors), which are either naturally accumulated or mimicked by artificial stones/pillules; thus a cauterization procedure must be applied there.

And it is held that there are stones of certain bitternthy remedies; if they do not throw out green (vitriolic), then a fresh stone has been picked up; and when milked by three or four persons in turns, the milk should be poured into where pain occurs—in the thigh, groin, or cushion.

The translation of the given line reads: "Sometimes pain is in both places due to causes such as drainage or excessive evacuation and similar reasons; for these issues, cauterization using moist exudate materials." This statement suggests that there are various origins (drainage/excessively purging the body) leading to bilateral pain.

Here it describes a therapedict approach involving elevation of swelling (perhaps after injury or surgery) using pillows. The text also suggests that manual therapy, including gentle handling with hands in specific cauterization lines as required based on individual tolerance levels—is an appropriate form of treatment to alleviate pain according to the patient's condition and disposition towards such interventions. This approach seems reminiscent of historical practices where immobilization or manual therapy were used alongside other methods like cauterization for healing purposes in medieval medicine context, taking into account personal tolerance levels which are crucial when

From the provided fragments, it seems that we're discussing medical treatments related to gout and joint pain in a medieval or early modern language with influences from Latin, Italian,
When joint pain is caused by cold bodily humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout according to doctors' practice. (Translation)
And when gout of excess is cured by treatment and not reinjury occurs, the pains are removed with poultices.
And when you are cauterizing that particular elimination in the channel of the joint between the foot and the thigh, it is with various cauters as needed for this purpose.
That is the form of this instrument:
If it is necessary for a point to be made on the surface of the foot, then use pointed cautery accordingly. If pains penetrate the joints or other connections and movements cause them to move inward, then it is necessary to perform cauterization on any swelling present at those points using three or four of these instruments for this purpose here within (the scope).
If you need the appropriate amount of caustics for these lancets (medical instruments), do not press your hand too much on them beforehand; send only what is necessary to cleanse the instrument'dictum, which means "the ridge" or groove referring likely to a specific part where cleansing takes place.
If pain enters into both sides of the body, then administer (the) treatment we have just mentioned in our chapter.
If the pain is limited to the feet only and it is called soreness (suggesting a condition), then piercing should be done along the circuits of these same pains in both lines.
If there are remains of pain in the eyes (possibly meaning remaining discomfort or symptoms), then a point is made on the circumference of each pupil and over the nipple, where their fingers rest.
If joint or muscle pain occurs during the days at the hips or thighs, then they will perform cautery on all parts of their helpers (i.dict: patients).
And if the bowels are not expelled properly through good diet and medicine intake, even then they will be cleansed by this cauterization process; God helps.

From "cauterize the leprosy." This line suggests a treatment method where heat or chemical application is used
Some bleeds need to be treated with a more significant amount of caution for scabies caused by decay and melancholy. This translates the original text into English, conveying that in cases where leprosy (a historical term sometimes used interchangeably with Hansen's disease or syphilis) is thought to be due to rot from dampness ("flacma") combined with a sense of depression ("melencolia"), the treatment must take these factors into account. It implies that
So when you intend to caustically treat that (referring back to the subject of treating scabies or other skin lesions), consider if leprosy is involved and use only what we have mentioned in this division; do not let it enter, nor become worse. Be mindful over any malaise affecting all parts of your body — cauterize that on the head using one of our previously discussed treatments: apply to the forehead near hairline during daytime breezes (implying a time when conditions may be better for treatment), and afterwards, place it atop or below the second pillow; likewise, both over two knots. And behind you lies another area that requires attention — on the nape of your neck ("servitz") in case there's an underlying condition affecting this region as well (likely referring to leprosy). This translation attempts to convey complex instructions from a medieval medical text regarding how and where certain treatments, possibly for skin conditions or lesions related to perceived malaise that could indicate forms of Hansen’sinque like scabies infected by decayed body humors (rot), should be applied. The treatment seems not only topical but also requires consideration based on the condition's stage and potential spread within different parts ("corns" or calluses, knots) of a patient's anatomy — emphasizing thoroughness in addressing all affected areas to prevent further complications like leprosy.

Guard your nerves that do not burn upon the sole of the foot; this is a precautionary measure taken by those who care for it, to protect these sensitive structures from harm or damage when exposed to heat sources
Here are a few precautions taken by those who care for it: they use hot iron (cauterization) on the patient's ribcage and another over their mouth to prevent ulcers in the stomach area or abdomen, as well as some applied directly onto the foot. This suggests that historical treatments included cauterizing methods using heated instruments for various ailments such as gastrointestthy issues (
You understand that the more you adjust (or use) hot irons for treatment, as much will be beneficial and helpful; likewise, you know that humors do not inflict pain in those who have them placed there by healers—indeed these patients become numb to it. This implies an acknowledgement of the therapeutic effectiveness while minimizing discomfort through expert application – reflecting a principle observed across various historical medical practices for effective and patient-friendly treatments using cauterization methods with hot irons on wounds, often inducing localized numbness.
Consider that the hot irons used for treatment are large or small, depending on which body part and joints it concerns—this was as prescribed by healers based on specific guidelines of their instruments to cater treatments effectively while ensuring patient comfort during application. This statement underscores a personalized approach in historical medicine where the size and possibly shape (large or small) of tools like

In reference to "cauterization," the phrase likely pertains to a traditional or historical method used by doctors
When referring specifically to "corrosion" in the context of cauterization: The decay is mobile within the limb and acts like dry sawdust or ash rubbing against an open flame, implying that during ancient medical practices involving cautery (a method used for stopping bleeding by burning a wound), corrosive materials might have been applied
Therefore, if the decay (presumably a localized area of infection or inflammation) where you have applied cauterization with flint-tipped tools is present: Ignite small pieces of coal for further cautery as required at that particular location where corrosion has occurred. In this translation from medieval medical terminology to modern English, the practice described involves using a heat source—coal in this case—to perform additional thermal treatment or cauterization on an area affected by decay after initial procedures with flint tools have been performed as needed for healing purposes.
Therefore, thoroughly perform the full range of treatment at that location for complete removal of decay and without leaving any trace or cause thereof (meaning they would aim not just to treat but also eliminate all signs of infection).

Then hold this constriction for an hour while watching out so as not to spill any remaining fluid from the nozzle into the hole in front, where previously you had inserted something (likely a tool or instrument).

Here 'extraction' likely refers not only physically but perhaps spiritually or metapsychologically from issues within one’ extricating themselves (or another) in the temple area by using methods such as traditional healing practices and medical interventions like cauterization, where we have illustrated how these treatments are applied.

If you are hidden, then tighten the thigh bone with some cloth; and apply heat or steam to that place until your witchcraft appears (i.dict here referring possibly to an exorcism). And when you take it, this is its form: Here comes the first source sentence:
If the artery is delicate, then wrap it around the limb's extremity and insert into that part according to the quantity by which their limbs are elongated and contracted; this will prevent blood flow unless they are not inserted at all – for without insertion, there will be no circulation of blood throughout.
Return (or bring back) the excretion from the sanct of venesection into three times its normal amount, within.
If the artery is large, then cover it with material over two points on the femur bone or at both ends of the tendons, and do not thrust into it during constriction to prevent putrefaction within the tissue and fluid discharge.
Return the excess that is between two ligaments, and apply it at this time or another time.
If you wish, apply the pointed cautery inside the mouth of the cauterizing instrument and keep it at the location where that same workman'sup is operating.
E it is better if the swelling has fever or complex inflammation; those cauterizations are for such causes that aid in drying up fluids, and thus they are more beneficial when done with care.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
If while working you encounter an outflow of blood from the artery during labor, then immediately try to compress that flow, either with a cauterium or by filling the wound cavity and tighten your hand inside until the bleeding stops. If any cause of those is not before you now, then pause over the place where his sanctity has contracted, and enclose it in water with vigorous fomentation until its heat subsides, and apply stringent bandaging as necessary.
When the leech is pushed out of arsenic for this cauterization that has already been done with two lances in these places where you have attempted to strike and delayed due to fire (ignition), it enters into the bones so that its length corresponds to what exists between the extremities of the patient, which are not consolidated by all of this cautery.
This is how the cauterization works:
And it is the tightness of both tunics examples. Even if the patient' extrudes painfully (severely), two pillows are better than none when they become as sharp as any of their own joints and do not tear open the flesh quickly.
So when there is any swelling in them and heat accumulates at those places, the flesh detaches loosely from those areas.
This work is better in its entirety and has been made lighter.

Return the spleen between two acute limbs of it; this is its form. That is from within the second incision. When the knife enters entirely into that part of the spine where it crosses over the bone on which the skull rests and draws out its moisture, then do so with water drawn from this incision. Return the splint to its cavity and place your hand over it so that the intestine does not protrude again into another area using an additional tool which you call cauterizing (referring here possibly a metal or heated implement), applying from one side but not on both sides.
When the gout of that affected joint requires care for its attached flesh and must be lifted by force into the migrating split (referring to a fissure), lift it with all your might, removing completely all tendons running down from the headhair.

When the patient undergoes catharsis and continues this process, their humors (bodily fluids) become exhausted, leading to an urgent need for attention; thus, we see ulcerated eyelids and hair loss around their wounds. Herein lies a deep pain in front of the head so acute that it's both intense and sharply felt—a clear indication that these materials (substances used during catharsis) do not originate from normal vessels but rather are derived directly from dismembered parts below, as understood by wise ones.

When the cause of pain in the fingers (often referred to as "fingers" or simply "joints") is due entirely because it's metal-related like iron and glass, or when it seems plant-based from peas and beans, this also includes water and vinegar associated fluids. Or if there are any animals involved in the cause; thus for comprehensive treatment of such gout affecting fingers, one must consider all these four potential origins: metal (iron/glass), plants (peas/beans), liquids related to acids or alkaline solutions like vinegar and water.
And when blood appears in the ear or seems similar to those causes that do not fit into it and stops the flow of blood from the ear to the face, if you see this discharge coming out, then administer its removal, and make them stoppage by condensation.

When extracting the evil produced in the artery during treatment and healing, which you have described earlier of this fluid (likely referring to blood or pus), it is necessary that if there are no comforts for your care, watch over the vein as though looking at the sun.
So then if any cause by worms appears here (meaning the patient'thy condition), extract them carefully or with subtle hands, but if no such cause is found, take a quick-drawn catheter from below and remove it broadly; this is how we perform: And insert the delicate extremity into the artery according to the quantity that suffering can tolerate; press with it there harshly until all worms are expelled from inside.

When joint pain is caused by hard veins in the body that prevent movement and need to be brought out for days (presumably through some form of treatment or intervention), it's essential not to disturb these vessels during operation, implying a careful procedure possibly related to their removal or manipulation. However, this translation attempt may still carry elements specific to medieval medical terminology which might require further refinement by someone with expertise in historical medicine and languages mixing
Therefore it is necessary that you contemplate whether the joint where there are hard veins (sabel) has strength and not another illness present along with this symptom; if so, then gather together such a strong vessel in question herein for further consideration or treatment. This suggests an approach tailored to each individual case of sabel-related discomfort within the context of medieval medical practice—focusing on both diagnosis and holistic understanding before proceeddicting any action towards remedy or
And it is when you command the humors to stop flowing in their vessels, and suspend those veins by one or two inches according to your discretion—and if so, that amount may be doubled for this form of treatment as seen here. In medieval medicine, controlling the movement (stop) within a patient's body ("their humors") was believed crucial in managing health conditions such as sabel. The directive implies an intervention where specific limbs are addressed through direct manipulation or restraint to prevent fluid dynamics that could exacerbate joint pain and other related symptoms, showcasing a hands-

And bind those thin veins therewith tightly, with subtlety in mind, and wash them away hour by hour until they become swollen from the cold within their chambers and are agitated.

The reduction of the prominence of the hump (neck). Here, a medical practitioner would likely be referring to methods
When the hump encompasses the entire body and does not soften or diminish on itself (meaning through diet alone), it is necessary that we loosen the belly, after which continue with good suction to remove excess fluids from the chest cavity; then apply bandages over the place where treatment has been applied using asphalt and aloe oil along with seeds and sawdust (sarcocolla); also tighten the liniment on top of this, especially if it is warmth or pressure being felt. Here, a medieval medical practitioner advises that when diet alone does not alleviate an enlarged hump (which could refer to obesity), they should proceed with manual techniques such as applying leeches for suction and using specific medicinal preparations like asphalt combined with aloe vera oil, seeds of plants possibly known at the time, along with sawdust. After these applications are made on or near where treatment is administered—often over an area that may be numbed by prior scarification (cutting) for pain relief and healing purposes—they recommend tightening liniments which likely serve both to aid in recovery and possibly as a form of physical massage.
The translation of the medieval medical treatise line by line into English would be as follows:

From meat care nothing comes into the nose." This sentence, likely taken from a medieval medical treatise given its linguistic style
When various kinds of nasal growths appear in the nose for no apparent cause related to black dung or pus, this illness is called polyps; it bears similarity to that which represents flies on excrement." This line from a medieval medical treatise indicates an understanding (or hypothesis) about benign tumors inside the nasal passage. These growths are thought of as being caused by something inappropriate—possibly dirt or waste, hinted at with references such as "scorpion's tail" and "flies on excrement." It illustrates an attempt to explain symptoms using a combination of metapthyical concepts (like the scorpion) along with observable phenomena. This Regarding the decayed meat which is dark in hue and concerning that it does not retain its natural golden shine."

Therefore in this meat that is not fraudulent nor cancerous (implying it's healthy), make the cavity of your body open between your thighs and place over, exposing its armpits to sunlight; then use needles on these parts within those meats." The author here seems to be advocating for an early medieval treatment approach involving both physical manipulation (opening up a section of one's own skin) and possibly some form of bloodletting using thorns or similar sharp objects, with the intent that sunlight might have curative properties—reflective of humoral theories prevalent at the time.

The head of the patient is placed above their knees and mouth hushed down by a servant holding between his fingers nowhere near the tongue using an instrument noble to which this treatment belongs:
And it is made of silver or gold, delicately handled with a cautery.
So when you perceive it as their tongue and show them the lesion, placing your hand over that area for an instant or more keeps it in place therein until you can withdraw it to those parts beyond where possible. Another time when you pull any cause from the tunics (the patient'sup clothes), note that this is where your tool of choice will act on it.
Another time when you pull any cause from the tunics (the patient'sup clothes), note that this is where your tool of choice will act on it. and it is assembled with forceps; however, the external parts of them are bent backward, so that for each one among those things there appears a sharp point (made of iron), which enters into another'sin cavity and causes pain.
If this tool is not with you now, then cut that bone from which it belongs to here: And if it protrudes on one side but does not on the other, take care of its treatment accordingly.
Put that cut has been made, mark the other according to this method of incision, and apply moisture from water wash to cleanse it.
May it be that if there is flow of phlegm, apply cold water from the goblet made of grain or honey and myrtle berries to where such flows within that which obstructs its discharge; care for what enters inside so that whatever has entered may heal.
Here come some measures in the groin or other warts elsewhere on those legs, and cut them as directed within their mouths' cavities (the spaces inside where saliva is produced).
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
And there was an abscess so great that it had measured up to six inches within which I passed through two cracks.
So you cuffed them tightly and made them stay in one of their bellies, then drew that out; this was the large portion taken from another' extrusion, to which I also applied pressure at its mouth, cleaning his tongue, and had him hold onto that position within that fistula.
Return the intestine or hernia to its cavity and place your hand over it so that the intestine does not protrude further. So it is the gout of that woman, and immediately drink water, then consume food accordingly so she will not cease from those morbid motions for a long time, until such healthy motion enters into where that illness resides, which continues as long as that condition persists.
So then you heat and cauterize the gout in him/her, hence ceasing its addition; likewise I walk about without fear that God will take away this provision from me.
The provided text appears to be an excerpt from a medieval medical treatise discussing
When the humors are in excess and rise, it is known as gout according to customary medicine practice when pain occurs specifically in the joints or feet
When the catarrhos (indicative of excessive humors in medieval medicine) occur within a joint or hip, it is not named perpendsively; and if they are found in the large and round part of the body's structure—this being likely referring to an organ such as the liver (which might be perceived as 'gross') with its rounded shape ('bulbus'), then it shall be called a "bubba" according to medical practice.
When you are healed with the fluid we have discussed in section division and do not hinder your recovery, and periodically check if poultice compress is applied softly or firmly; when directed to that long-lasting application which has a dark color (like brown) or black consistency, it pertains specifically to fear of internal organs. In such cases, where there's concern about the insufflation within your body and its location not being at center but elsewhere on one’thy abdomen; in this area resides anxiety for you concerning those internal elements deep inside that are colored dark (either brown or black).
When you turn that second as directed by the patient's whim of blueness and length, which causes them to tighten their belly and press their tongue with an instrument through which they dictate their form and fix it in place on their navel (and pull that outward into one or two instruments used for inspection within the grooves of two molars), here comes:
When what is not inserted into the body so far as its natural addition has been adjusted on it; if you insert anything from there at all, let your speech be clear.
Return the inflammation (empodera), using that same liquid which has been recommended for use in two joints of a person' extricated from disease and heal it within them wherein they remain ensconced.
If the patient is frightened by his ignorance and uses force during cauterization due to fear, this reaction of using instruments for treatment is nothing but sharp water agitation. Keep their head at waist level when performing lancet insertion into the wound area; place your tongue on that instrument you have been holding out, and moisten it with the same water used earlier in cauterization. Thus fulfilling this living cause (meaning effectively healing), ensure that neither thick nor subtle is applied to their thin skin layer—this completes the hollow form of our chosen tool for treatment:
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
Here you place your hand on the medicine to express it over the tonsil' extralarge spaces within which time, and through this application of pressure with the medical tool (mordicacio), make that substance blackened and numb for its healing properties.
If you wish, prick the wound and cover it with this over the extremity of the ray (which likely refers to an arrow or similar sharp object), immerse the covering in medicine, insert your hand into the body cavity through which the cautery has been inserted so that the covered end adheres within that channel. This allows you to take as much medication as desired for wound healing after a few days (three to four).
If you have indigestion and travel the medicine pathway, repeat that treatment; apply cauterization within the loop of the uterus beginning at the navel, cleansing any moisture present in this area using water rinses, washing with soap if necessary. Treatment should be done thoroughly until healed through gargling with saltwater (presumably as a mouth rinse), and continue treatment within these guidel extramural spaces where worms may reside while achieving cure.
This remedy has been placed that penetrates deeply and out of fear.
Some times it is healed by water that has been put under which cauterizes and anoints with, whereupon this recipe includes mint, hyssop, rue, Arabic scabs, camphor, powdered herbs applied to them; all causes are adjusted in a pot of boiling water, and on the surface of the hot water there is placed a spike over which an instrument made from arsenical silver or iron according to this practice.
And when the limb is thrust into the mouth of the malady until the breath rises to the palate and makes the uvula dimmed.
Here applies pressure to that which has been dried out within herein and ensure you do not perform this treatment on the patient' extrication process; otherwise, it will worsen the abscess/ulcer condition, but if done properly by your hand swab (caut), there is no harm.
If you do not have this instrument at hand, take a can and compose it outside the body'dictum (likely referring to an incision site), so that the mouth of the bladder is moistened, which prevents bodily vapors from entering through there.
This healing is good for health.
Given that "Capitol" is not part of the provided medieval medical text ex
From the removal of thorns and water stuck in the foot, as well as from other causes.
Movements persist in the groin or backbone of the leg, or any other cause.
Now cover the liquid that has come out from those places with your hand which you hold over it on the forehead; place your tongue in this tool used above the head to make clear what is coming out of these areas, indicating gout or other issues present therein.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
If not through examination of these causes we have mentioned beforehand, then use a metal tool in this manner.
And if it is a large stone that enters outside of its cavity (the patient'gy bowel), which you insert into the opening for ease, then place your hand inside to prevent further entry and potential obstruction.
And raise the patient'se head upwards, and ensure that their mouth touch does not affect either the face or backbone of them; this is what the doctor holds for caregiving.
Even if the patient has encroached upon that place (the affected area), due to their science of understanding the cause and purposefully inciting it there, they draw out their tool according to the quantity prepared within so as not to exceed what is necessary for intervention at this specific site.
Given that this text is written in an archaic or pseudo-Lat
The phrase "Capitol .xxxix." seems to indicate a reference section, possibly from the end of a document where specific chapters are numbered (as is common in Roman numerals).
When bloodletting is administered as part of healing in medicine and not to cause further harm, consider that the humors within the body flow from above (head) into below (legs), so provide yourself with tongs which you have previously recommended for this instrumental use.
Therefore, when you feel a sudden or subtle gout attack coming on, extract that little bit or gesture delicately.
If it is not possible to extract from there, then take a concave cannula and insert that into the malady'dictum, placing a heated iron pin in the concavity of the cannula, allowing such amount (as long as the sanquiusugua dies and remains within the dictum) so that it is kept out of the swelling for the entire day.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
May it not be forefated if we have recommended the water that has been humidified, then submerge or apply frankincense (or saffron) to the mouth using the instrument used in moistening with saliva.
When it is necessary (and) in this way they come down with feverish illnesses that occur suddenly and unexpectedly
Another maneuver in the process of suffocating (it), is that you take hold of an enclosed space where carbonized materials are present and place it under a covering layer; within this covered container, another item sits on top, which then compresses inside the vessel containing these elements. Meanwhile, away from the act of smothering beneath, position your mouth at the end of the tube (canula), sealing it shut so that the suffocation process is considered complete as soon as you realize this has happened within the wound itself.
If not cured, then repeat the subfumigation movements, and prevent the humors in the male from drinking, eat salty and acidic foods, do not smoke or water (drink), which are necessary when this treatment regimen is needed to be adjusted.
This is the form of the tool by which one extracts pus from an abscess when seen; and it seems like forceps used times over again, but with no curve herein. the tablet of his urine is likened to the beak of a crow (cuckoo), which he licks, in it sharpness from lime is applied for up to four days when any cause arises, so that nothing does not harm him.

May some of which worms, not having penetrated but rather reaching the stage of disease in those places or their complementary parts, be allowed to exist.
So other appliances that are torn when crossed and do not mature according to their nature, similar to those applied at joints, which become a cause of contraction in that limb; or if the intervention on it within its ripened stage is delayed until reaching the main member, or towards the belly button (umbilicus), where an incision must be made as soon as possible before necrosis occurs. If such an appliance is pierced while incomplete digestion continues inside of you; but this one corresponding to your navel, a puncture thereof will cause indigestion and elongation at the body's division points (perineum), leading possibly to fistula formation or abscess that does not heal. May you know when the puncture of the abscess is due, and so it will be ripe for intervention.
E realizes that the pain and fever are subsiding, you improve breathing and heart rate, head swelling is decreasing, and other symptoms as well.
When you know where the puncture wound is located, especially near the area of old/decayed sores and incoming infection from treatment for elevation (implying an abscess or other issue related to high levels that need addressing),
Through incision is performed along the length of the flesh or body, if spicules are in the parts of muscles or feet, and at joints like ligaments, nerves, tendons; and finally throughout all awkward places where reflection does not occur naturally. In those areas that reflect, use an incision according to which part it is located on.
When the abscess is in the flesh, then you must perform its incision within which it has been confirmed that digestion of this person'thy (the patient) is complete; and if one pierces there now, they prolong the leg or thighbone of the sufferer, making their lips hardened and increasing depth.
May one pierce through the flesh or bone according to its necessity, or as dictated by which part of the body it desires (needs).
When administering a small incision, and in large punctures or extensive sections according to the variety of the abscesses' size.
Other than the apendices in which the cecum is ruptured and inflamed, when pain occurs with food intake or during menstruation, it resembles that caused by putrefaction or boils; for then your hand should be on them as well.
From those who are seated and have three angles; they sit similarly as a mitten of myrtle or the appendages of joints.
From those joints where treatment is administered with round and crescent-shaped instruments, they appear similar to them.
May those who cannot be pierced with surface lancets also have them penetrated only on the surface so shallingly.
And when the abscess is large and has collected pus already, do not attempt to extract all of it at once; take out some from that place today, put back into the other part tomorrow, remove a larger piece afterwards, doing so gradually until full extraction occurs—they draw portions each day following gradual progression for complete removal.
Mostly if the malady is caused by excessive bile or phlegm from women before menstruation, infants, or elderly people who are weakened, for their spirits move and seek to exit through illness, and they fall sick quickly; then you perform operations on them.
Guard your actions with great care and place your puncture in the instrument where you pierce these thorns; make sure to avoid contracting diseases, considering if the pus from the thorn is scant or a flat layer, then administer what was used by ancient healers for such cases; but if the thorn is large and there are fissures in your puncture site where blood comes forth, pause at any juncture within which we arrive.
If an abscess has separated a part of the colon or if it's concave in its circuit, then cover it with wool cloth threads or linen fabric as you do when carrying pans and razors; keep moisture within for all day until tomorrow. Then process that area carefully to cure what covers those intestinal enclosures which are healing inside where the cleaning agents have been placed.
May you provoke a flow of bile during your operation; if so, administer cold water and agree on these points where robes are wrapped around the body' extrication site for pressure to control bleeding.
If the flow of blood persists, then if you manage your diet and care properly with these recommended powders in places specified within our text and division.
If it is winter time and the site of ulceration is a place where nerves are located, then cover them with powder made from vine leaves and oil to stop bleeding at those locations.
If it is summer and the places are carnal (meaning fleshly or swolthy), then when you pause pulpils at the beginning, immerse them in water and oil as we have said before, so that all this enters into your body on a clear day like today. Moreover, cover up any abscesses and cleanse away whatever has entered therein for its treatment within the healing of it which I am to provide herewith (today).

Thus return to your operation within which you have completed it.
And if inquiry is necessary about any other small bubbles of pus inside the body, then investigate those areas and clean them out.
If it is in the state of severe scrofulus and not inserted that scrofulus into its cavity, then do so accordingly. Based on my understanding of Latin, Italian, Spanish and French languages as well as medieval medical terminology, here is the translation:
When you complete the wrapping of the small wound which you have already immersed in Egyptian ointment, take care of it.
If you insert that bone completely, then make sure the lips of your tongue and palate are adjusted just enough so that not even a single excess is placed therein.
May you find that there has been an excessive swelling due to the greatness of the scrofulus (a type of skin disease), and understand its cause, then perform suture as directed.
And when the scrofulous that contain moisture within them are pierced here at your place of healing, and a puncture prevents what has been put below the chest from escaping upwards as we have discussed.
And administer injections of wine and oil to those affected, so that the corrosive substance does not break through the crust. When you turn over the patient and their clean linen is put in place wherein that fresh cloth will heal them inside out.

So when we want to draw out the effluvia (impure humors), encircle three or four small circles within each circle of the effluvia, as much in between two circles where possible so that a section is enclosed by membrane and not cartilage.

The distillation of the whole speech about which we have been advised (likely from an expert or medical authority like Albucasis), is nothing but that outpoured blood veins in some form of apoplexy and they've entered into death, their bodies are dried up here on earth; these vessels will settle down near the epiglottis to allow breathing for any possible respiration within this body until such time as it passes away. Translation interprets a complex procedure from medieval medical literature likely discussing post-mortem resuscitation, which is an ancient and somewhat fantastical concept where physicians of that era believed they could restore life by manipulating the position of vital structures in relation to breath—a practice not supported or recognized today according to modern medicine.
And by the water of commanding said person who has been laid down (likely referring to a resuscitation attempt), until after three days have passed since being consumed with malice—this is how you will order them and thus heal within that which was diseased, provided it's cured inside.

From the care of mothers whose bodies are made up of women, we can infer that this line is likely discussing breastfeeding and maternal health in a historical or cultural context where such practices were common knowledge but
Some cues are puffed up the breasts of barren husbs when they dream to nurse and thus their nipples become erectile; accordingly assembled are the breasts formed by women' extrinsic features which stand out in pairs near each other, like columns. (Translation)
To the one who takes it inwardly, cover that which is drawn out according to this form from line B to line G, and scrape off the growth entirely, applying padded medicinal flesh externally; adjusting the lips of the flesh on their body garment, and heal whatever has been taken within.
May it happen that the breast declines to its parts and becomes milky due to her own nourishment, causing two pus-filled swellings in each section of these breasts, akin to crescent moons whose contents are held within one another by their respective larger lines (B. line) and smaller ones (G. line). Then scrape the linea alba which lies between both lips of prey animals; hold back any secretions or leaking fluids until healing occurs in accordance with what has been discussed for sutures and powders, when recovery is achieved.
If you do not complete the incision of the fluid that needs to be drained due to the restlessness of the humors and their flow, pour oil corrosive into it soaked in wax and place this inside what is being eroded by the fluids, with proper care for whatever has been healed.

When the pincers come into contact with flesh, they can cause puncture wounds or pricks.
When arthritis points (likely referring to joint inflammation or bony growths associated with gout) come from the spices of stones (probably a metaphor for hard deposits like uric acid crystals), they touch down on the skin, holding your hands.
From those that contain moisture; and from the ones where there is contained moisture which are inserted into the lunar cycle according to this figure: From line G to line B, when all fluid expelled during apoplexy of illness has been drained away completely, then on another day cover it with a clean cloth and insert inside.
Return the wound or injury and apply healing oil as needed until it is healed.
If the putrefaction of the spices in the nodes and abscesses occurs thereupon as we have discussed in this section about abscesses, then divide it over that very place.
If the patient is expanded so much that it burns down when touched, then apply treatment as we have discussed hereafter.

From the segment where you've inserted a line of what appears to be Medieval Latin, let me translate it for you:
When an arrow is broken and the chest is consolidated on that (which means it becomes firm or rigid), often inflammation and abscess are through arteries or veins: when an abscess occurs in the thoracic region, where a projectile has entered; you will feel painful pressure sensations there.
And he who is drawn upward by the vein appears in the body'dictor (as if indicating a symptom or sign).
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
Upon that which is of theirs for inflammation caused by the rheumatic joint(s), cut into the shinbone (tibia/fibula) leg bone, and cauterize part of it; also return tendons to its attachment site on the bone so they don'n come out.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
Return and apply pressure to the place between two ligaments where there is already bone exposed within it, breaking apart the adhesion (apothecem).
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
If it is an abscess in the vein's section, then hold your hand where you have felt (the abscess), and insert the needle there with what is possible of your power; put the suture thread into that place which you have held, and make this entry penetrate; ensure double-entry here so as to remove one part from another in ligature according to how it was previously stated using hemp twine at both ends of the incision.
May you fear that we extract the thread (needle), then insert it into the hole of today' extrication device quickly as required by your initial puncture wound care with this first needle, and tightly bind the threads in four places.

Return the pillow upon which you have immersed him in wine and oil, and apply the treatment that he is said to cure with these means inside where they will become softened until healed.
When it is necessary for the apothecary (doctor) who suffers from curvature of nerves, as in this case which causes painful inflammation known as rheum
When Ayssi suffers from chest and vein inflammation due to arceria (likely meaning pleurisy), as if suffering from nerve compression when experien0ffered with palpation or excessive pressure, seemingly showing symptoms of neuralgia.
When it is pain in the parts of the body or on the feet that are uncomfortable (mays), they occur at the locations occupied by assistants or the toes (talos), or anywhere where joint discomfort occurs.

It is not an abscess in the body' extrinsic parts, and its head moves freely throughout without going towards either side or behind.
So those who are infiltrated by metal at the joints will find that they have a strong force against them soon afterward.
May that person who is at the head or neck due to a spleen disorder have a splint for their spine. May it be small if this wound is present in your feet and knees; then cut those parts away from the roots (which could indicate removing damaged tissue or perhaps addressing issues at their source).
If it is great, then hold up one of them (referring to the thighs), and rub that area, and apply pressure thereon; adjust the bandage on the stitches, and take care for as long as they are healed.
The given Latin phrase "Capitol" can be translated into English
Translated, the line from medieval medical treatise reads:
Endeavoring to move away from homes for the sick in their bellies and other parts of those bodies that resemble fungi, whose root is subtle beneath its bulk; moreover, even their lips are conversed with by these things, which concern them small ones who magnify.
Here comes another source sentence to translate: And you have already seen one of them (the two parts mentioned earlier), which were like fungi and there was no difference between these white ones, so small they seemed nothing at all.
And their lips were turned outwards and began to split apart; moisture flowed from that entire time.
So then I have incised those and drawn blood in one foot for sixteen times, and the other for six units.

Of care for the prominence of the navel." This line suggests a focus on attention or treatment related to the area
The prominence of the navel is pained due to causes; or for fissures in the flesh over which it resides on the abdomen and where cloths or belts are fastened according as they occur elsewhere through breaks, or because of constriction hereby narrowing (of this area)." This sentence implies that navel prominency can be uncomfortable due to various reasons including fissures in nearby flesh potentially exacdressed by clothing elements like belts. It may also refer discomfort caused by internal restrictions or circulation issues within the umbilical region, as indicated by references to blood flow (vena) and arterial supply (arteria).
If for the crack in the flesh and due to linen threads, the discoloration of ulcers is similar to that of this part (of the body); here lies the lion's pain, appearing from various situations." This line indicates a correlation between signs like skin discoloration indicative of an underlying condition ("ulcer") on one hand and physical symptoms experienced by patients—often severe in nature as suggested by "the lion’s pain" metaphor. It implies that these manifestations can be seen across different situations, If for the emergence of an entrails (belly protrusion), that is where they have recounted to us as having been before; sometimes with great intensity varied, and when you presume them herein hidden within these limits [of our understanding], then return: but if so at this place it happens—and thus their movements are glorified by baths (as treatment) vigorous motion." The passage touches on the notion of certain abdominal signs being recurrent or previously noted. It suggests a course-correction in medical observation and possibly indicates how proper intervention, such as hydrotherapy ("bath") combined with energetic physical activity can reaffirm the body's health—or 'glorying movements.' The text implies an understanding that diagnosis involves recall of past events or symptoms ('what has been before') to properly manage current conditions.
May it be due to moisture; I shall remain hidden from you when near your hand and will not tighten nor swell up.
If it is for sanction, then immediately display where black decay descends on these limbs.
If it is through flesh nothingness, then a severe and hard spitting occurs, which follows a certain amount.
May it be due to windiness, then handling of him is like a lion.
And if the operation on it is that you consider whether the navel' extruded by splinter, or vein, or wind; and where prohibited in its treatment, there fear and worry accompany me as I taught in the capital city where I instructed about arses (splinter) and venae (veins).
If the prominency of the navel is due to the intestine or membrane, then command the humors (to retract), and have it extended; also set your password for testing throughout the entire belly area where you touched with intent during insertion, and position yourself in between its parts above over that specific point on their bodies. Additionally extend around the spinal column within this region of the navel through which contact was made when inserting intentionally or accidentally (with a tool), encompassing even the large intestine sections below; furthermore raise the lesion marker to the body's parts downstream from where insertion occurred, and position yourself between these areas with force using either strong faith/faithlessness tools of varying types.
Here comes the first sentence to translate:
If you have torn the skin, then take that one and apply it there; also incise away any excess of yours.
If it is contrary to your artery or vein, surround that area, and return to your work; take two needles and insert them into those fields strong enough so as the puncture you made near the fistula (abscess) caused by a wound in the knee joints has been closed. Then strengthen the abscess over these four parts where the needles are inserted.
If you wish to do so, place the needles and insert them into the spot where it pierces and expands the flesh; when they are subtly inserted and positioned therein, take care that whatever liquid is within the linens comes out for its own healing purpose.
If the navel's prominence is of flesh or due to moisture, then cover it with cloth and wash away dirt and humidity from there; this removes what is in excess within you, and take care that which covers and consolidates the location.

And when it comes to the division of species or types of head (or skull), and how they are treated by medicine, so that there is no ulceration; we have discussed this matter related to their treatment which involves care with iron as a form of prevention against such conditions. It seems like an old-style medical text discussing the importance of proper dietary or herbal intervention (possibly using 'iron' metaphorically for something healthful) in treating skull fractures to avoid ulceration, which could suggest a form of soft tissue injury.

And when the bucket is outside of it, and you bring that instrument into the water, then they will exit from there onto the instrument, so much in one hour time; but if what comes out does not leave within this same hour, swiftly the malady (illness) resolves itself due to the spirit animal's transformation or by applying five presses appropriate for death.

If the gallbladder is black in color (which may indicate something harmful or morbid), then take care to apply points on its liver and spleen areas, respectively.
May it be that the foreskin is on the head of the penis and one part has been cut off while another remains intact; after you have done this cutting inside where they will join together to become fixed, take care of that separation now as well when curing the restoration within the foreskin so that it does not tear apart.
And examine the testicles and foreskin of blackness and corruption; thus ensuring that you cover all that has already become degenerated and may potentially deteriorate further, applying liniments made from freshly ground rice flour mixed with honey and crushed herbs.
Return that healing is taking place within it at this time.

In the attachment of the prepuce at the base of the foreskin (and this adherence is not excised from where it' extrudes, nor compelled circumcision; when attached by dirt or carbuncle), scrape inside that which has hardened into a bone-like object. Here you must cleanse with salt and remove completely the head of the foreskin.

Translation: Circumcision is not solely for continuity with other diseases; however, when it comes to our work and the will behind it (or perhaps intended by God), we must assign in this particular operation—and place them where they can more easily achieve salvation. This suggests that circumcision was seen as a preventive or curative measure possibly related to hygiene ('more easily attain salut,' meaning health) and/dictates moral purity, reflecting the intertwined nature of physical well-being with spiritual cleansess in medieval medical practices within certain communities. It indicates that circumcision could be considered not just a procedure but also an act steeped in religious or ethical significance beyond its immediate health benefits—a viewpoint rooted deeply during this era when medicine and theology were often
Thus, the ancients did not decree circumcision in free communities where laws are absent, and they do not use it themselves but only acquire this knowledge through experimentation. This leads to many artisans (perhaps referring herein to practitioners or skilled individuals) being misled about using new tools like scissors/scalpels ('novacula' meaning 'new tool') and forceps ('torores'), instead they rely on leather straps made of flesh attached with sinew from the same source (ungla). This passage highlights a perceived misunderstanding or misuse among practitioners about what constitutes appropriate tools for circumcision, which could reflect regional variations in surgical practices. The emphasis is placed on tradition and possibly rudimentary methods due to limited access to modern equipment—a reflection of the disparities between different regions' medical capabilities during medieval times when knowledge transfer was not as systematic or widespread as today. It underscs a time where practical experience might have been valued over standardized
E you have already employed all these methods and cannot do better with refinement or needlework as it is done with glue or thread that in craftsmthy the penis protrudes, whereby the penis hangs down below, also the foreskin between two tunics, tightening the thigh when drunk quickly; therefore you are forced to seek other knowledge and pain relief.

Therefore, having measured two degrees of acuteness in my hand, I shall engrave them according to a proportion and make contact within the time frame: thus is formed the shape of the nail containing all of its part, where there will be no mistake at all.
And the first thing in performing surgery is that you make sure the child mostly remains calm and let them go into another day afterward.

The provided text is from an ancient medical manuscript with elements of Latin influence combined with Romance
From the context given, it seems that this line might be discussing issues related to retained urine within the bladder (vesica). Translating a medical
Retention of urine in the bladder is a fault caused by excessive bile accumulation or liver stones (pyre), phlegm, or fat deposits; these are similar to those mentioned for treatments related to female temperaments during division procedures.
If there is no dissolution in the water we have discussed as being vehemently felt upon the abdomen, then cover your removal from here with an instrument that has a silver and subtle lion conquau form: It may be thin like a needle used for catheterization (a slender tube inserted through body cavities), shaped somewhat like a palm or finger, held in the hand.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
Return the bladder to its cavity for ease of reaching the urethral opening; and bend the penis upward toward the pubic portion; lift this position with your hand until it arrives at the entrance, whereby the urine will be expelled. Here is the translation line by line:
Return the wool inside (or within) it slowly and gradually; as for the urine, also release its moisture in small amounts from time to extrusion.
Return that which is outside for cleansing with urine and use a cup, do not cease to clean it until the bladder and large intestines are relieved of their burden; then they become alleviated (relief or ease).

Then begin to place your hand over the bladder, addressing its moisture that has entered through the central channel of excretion within this womb where such moisture has arrived. (This translation attempts to capture medieval medical terminology and context while making it understandable in modern English.)
If there is no bladder present to you now, take a stone from the womb and break it completely; place your hand firmly into those disru each in turn as if seeking out where everything has become disturbed or displaced within these structures (this likely refers to organs); this action should restore their proper positioning. Once that is done, continue placing pressure on them so long as you wish for the accumulated moisture; and then introduce additional water into those spaces from which it came back up again like fluid flow after an intervention or catheterization procedure (in a modern medical context).
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: Return your tool to it in the instrument and make connections as you did with your hand in the bladder; express that which is inside of me so that moisture can reach the bladder.

The phrase "de extraccio de peyra" is in Latin, which translates roughly
"de extraccio de peyra" translates to:
And in this stone where operation is performed today, a section has been completed.
The provided medieval text describes various medical practices and observations related to joint pain, referred to as "gout," according to the humoral theory of medicine prevalent at that time:
Here it is presented by that which reports such an external manifestation and abbreviation.
So it is said that semen originates mainly in the bladder of children; and from their kidne extruded urine seems like water due to its subtlety, appearing therein; and the uterus rubs his scrotum, with recurrent painful motions. And for this reason they go out into that arena (the public place or marketplace where medical gatherings might occur).
It is difficult care for those children within that have attained twelve years, and in the limbs it becomes even harder. May also in young people travel through these fluids that between them move.
From that from which the stone is larger and poultice softer; if it is scarce, contrary to that.
So when you arrive at the treatment of that, cover with a cloth from which we extract out all cracks where it has entered into your joints; this crack may for some time prohibit urine flow and inquiry thereof.
Return its position to the thighs and count as many drops or pourings necessary for it to descend into the bladder'dictor of urine, or that which may jump a few times from place to place on its own accord.
And place that catheter you prepared within themselfs (the patient), and the more of it there are inside their body, the sooner will all parts be cleansed out sequentially.
Return that which is inside for each of those things; everything must be returned within its place (or cavity).
Then if you feel pain in the space, then bend over it with one hand on top of it.
If you do not touch the entire body at once, then when urine is discharged as indicated on your left side (if kidney disease), insert it into one' extraliminal opening that has been made for this purpose; and place therein what was previously brought in. Through the entrance of the stone that was inside at once enters this water. When that small entity is converted into something tiny within the bladder'dictation line by line translation and understanding of medieval medical terminology, here it becomes clear in English as follows:
And place that small entity at the neck of the bladder (vesica), and remove it from there to where your hand can be placed for assistance (seccio). This sentence is directing some form of procedure likely related to urinary issues, possibly involving catheterization or extraction. The use of "tieu dit" suggests a traditional instrument that
And commands the minister to press on the bladder with his hand; and directs another minister to extend their right arm over those parts above (presumably below), placing it underneice as well for assistance, while also having them contract their other hand around where they have inserted one of their fingers. This sentence appears to be giving instructions related to a medical procedure that may involve bladder palpation and possibly the insertion or manipulation with instruments like forceps (genetius).
Return inside the entrance of which this is its form: Here is the translation line by line:
E understand that there is any stone from which you extract (treat), and therefore the removal of it will be difficult by water.
From that fluid (referring to pus), it looks like a lion and is round, made of yellowish excrement for purification purposes.
Then adjust it in the crack.
If there is no forge-getaway available, then you must create one over that area or where it hurts intensely, and apply force with a limestone (or similar) tool on the skin above that point without escaping from its grasp; otherwise, insert immediately an instrument of subtle curvature.
If you cannot cover it there, then slightly increase the disruption and if you see a flow of bile, dissolve that little amount with vinegar already tripled.
If the stone is present in one, then you will draw it out through her mouth into its bladder (urinary tract), and place your hand over it therein; also carry a small amount to introduce water-like substances. In this sentence:
If there is blood flow that flows excessively and profusely, it may be due to ignorance on your part for not recognizing this great section of the urethra; hence its location lacks complete solidity: because either it remains or comes from continuous urine distillation.
May you administer the removal of it within which has come out or is involved in a fracture, wherein are placed inside its fingers to extract that very thing from pains.
So that when you have completed your operation, fill the wound with the juice of Aloe and dragon'dictum, and strengthen it. And place it over that cloth in oil and vinegar or water infused with pungent herbs, to allow the poultice (ointment) to be absorbed by the sore area.
Return the bladder over the patient'dict chest and do not release it into the third day.

The fourth is that the location of the stone in a woman's body (the stones being metaphorically referred to as 'peyra') exceeds the area where it needs to be extracted ('es longinc del loc de la peyra'), necessitating preliminary procedures, and therein lies danger ("en aquela es temor"). This suggests that removal of such a stone may require more complex or risky surgical interventions due to its location.

Hernia is not merely an accumulation of moisture within the white circle which contains semen from the testicles and it's called a cyst (This translation interprets what appears to be descriptions or understandings related to hernias, potentially referring to hydrocele in modern terms).
Some remarks are on the panniculus (a layer of subcutaneous fat) within which nature prepares itself in semen's portion; here we have already mentioned it before and this is not where another sperm resides—it remains solid or hard, as stated previously. (This translation explains a concept likely related to male reproductive anatomy from the perspective of medieval medical understanding.)
The generation of this hernia is due to suppuration within the testicles causing them pain; thus these secretions are released from those areas and some may be caused by direct puncturing (Here, a medieval medical explanation for conditions possibly related to epididymitis or other inflammatory processes involving seminal fluid release through induced discomfort).
This moisture has movements, whether the color of it or turning to lemon-colored (citrine) or blood red (sanguinea), or black dregs (feculenta), or white foam (aqua). It is what may occur.
And for the joints where it has been said this water addition is present: if in the cistern that we have mentioned before (the white basin), then exacerbation occurs during a long bath with its shape of hollow, and appearance of genitalia emerges; because moisture from all parts.
If the moisture is in the patient' extranodular membrane (the lining of the body cavity), then there appears an abscess, and thus he considers it another body part affected.
If there is moisture between the navel and the white line (the linea alba), then touch gently with one' extrication tool or two separate tools – for this area has more parts than others to be treated separately, holding their hands in the process.

If at the time of scraping or treatment you cause an abscess to form due to your action (causing inflammation), as soon as that happens which is in line with what has been said here, attend immediately to it for healing purposes.
If the patient'thy groin is painful and you fear that another operation due to its horror, administer a puncture as I recommend; when confirmed by what we have said about signs, it shows that this hernia is spilling out.

The arrival of this hernia occurs because certain threads or cords from within the stomach's cavity extend outwards over its surface as if they are unraveling, leading to protrusions beyond these extensions nearer towards our hands—the external indicators we touch. This description suggests that a physician is observing an intestinal hernia where internal structures have become noticeable through the abdominal wall ("ventre of part dels angunars del mirac"). The use of such imagery reflects medieval medical understanding, which often relied on analogies with familiar objects and experiences
This rupture comes either from within the cavity or due to external influences such as concussion (shaking), thrusting force, loud noise exposure, heavy lifting ("elevatio"), or seemingly supernatural phenomena—all potential reasons for why these threads are unraveling and causing a protrusion that can be felt externally.

The sign of this condition—when caused by straining or excessive exertion on the abdominal cavity ("ciphac") —is that it seldom causes sudden severe pain and does not suddenly become excruciating; instead, mild to moderate discomfort persists for a long time. The physician advises applying pressure inside (entro ves le preon) the belly button area near where one pressures on the hernia ("comprem le ciphac"), suggesting that this external intervention might help manage and possibly reduce pain related to such unraveling within, hinting at a form of manual treatment or self-care

Even as they recommend some remedies for that reasoning and treatment concerning other diseases.
When you eat of simple diseases' humors, when the recollection of complex illnesses comes to feasting time at dinner table,
Therefore say that when pain occurs in the head and it is not a fracture, you consider: if it' extruded stones or cysts, then press on the occipital region immediately thereafter (and do not delay), extract according to the quantity of its volume, provided no reason prohibits drainage; mainly when that swelling contains pus from an abscess present.
When it is a fracture of the opposite parts affected, and keep watch over the abdomen to prevent its swelling from food and drinks heavy in nature.
If from meticulous observation you find any cause at all, then the pain will be reduced by lessening food intake and not approaching meat or drinks.
When pressure is applied over soft tissue, if you have caused an abscess to harden by applying heat or in the liquid where it becomes firmly seated.
If you are sure about the application of cauterization (burning or scraping), then pause over the ground, if it is recent and the dust that was recommended has not yet settled down from its place.
If the air has changed its quality and become damp or unhealthy, then rest in a warm cloth within which it is said to be healed.
May it be that the child is large or due to insufficient space and appearance, and if their lips are not properly adjusted with pins as recommended for them, then do so accordingly.
If the child is discovered within the bone and thighs, but not restrained by you, then proceed with that care for the child which medicine shall provide; direct the malady to feast on foodstuffs in which it grows fond – capsules and forms of cough syrup as well as similacrum (similar substances) until they are restored within their natural place.
If rot festers in the navel and does not stick to the bone, then cut off all this putrefied substance with water (and) apply it as poultice; be careful of it.
If in these diseases an artery or vein from which blood flows is not severed by medicine, then ask about the artery/vein that has been mentioned; and if you cut it (not seceding), make incision there with a sponge/ligature, especially when what we have said should cause discomfort.
If these pains are simple and small, then the cause of them is phlegma; apply powder to those places until the air changes that which caused it.
The purpose of the poultice is: take one part of pressed oil made from flax seeds, two parts each of dragon's blood and unextinguished coal, crush them together thoroughly, filling this mixture into a container for use while lying on it (covering that object), which then solidifies as needed.
E apply firmness to that undernethy and thereupon the same, and not on slippery surfaces while she is lying down for it cannot be applied nor set up within her by medicine until healed.
When one lone applies cauterization alone, it is not when you are in their presence with salt and powder of dragon'thy blood.
And now this operation on the major humors is carried out when it has been stopped there and are straightened, which belong to those souls whose air has not yet changed.
If the air has been altered, and especially in summer, you cannot understand their position here, then take care of those thicker ointments we mentioned earlier, or apply pressure on these powders made from flour mixed with water and honey inside which helps heal; also pay attention to that other remedy while it is being cured.
May you treat a broken bone in the body and it is small, then extract fluid with your hands as directed by movement.
In English line by line translation of the provided medieval medical text could be as follows:
From "the humors of the colon
If you have acid in your chest, there is not a difference in medicine either here or at the head when it'sin simple nature; both are treated similarly.
May the nerves of the colon or artery already be inscribed therein (with cautery), if it is a nerve, not in its location but to prevent treatment with blood that causes violent spasm, as when one takes wormwood and sage for them so they do not touch their nerves. No pressure is placed on any cause of total madness; for the substance of nerves continues in it, which they place at the top of all limbs themselves.
If the water is what heals with medicinal means, then take some warm or cold oil poured into it and stones rubbed while being washed in hot water (and other pebbles used as per this method), along with ointment for moisture.
If the patient is large, apply bandaging or press their lips together and take care that they receive pills until healed.
May it be that if the child has depth or softness in their lower body portion where they have been punctured with medicine (possibly referring to an injection), then at this location a purple exudate may form, which is indicative of gout as perforated.
If in the patient there is an inserted artery and blood flow has been achieved, then separate or dry out that one if necessary to prevent it from entering into water (i.dict: getting wet).
If you have already immobilized the vertebrae of the gouty or all, and thus preserved the veins in the colon, then adjust your lips on the spinal column with a suture without touching that; otherwise reduce it back to its natural shape, strengthen it through proper alignment, leave it for some days until healing occurs. Take care so as not to displace or excite entry and exit where there is stitching necessary - this will ensure recovery.
May you if the child already hurts in the bone, then strike that place; and if there are fragments of bone within it, remove all those which you can from them; but if no one is present to assist, let the injured part rest so that it may recover on its own.
If it is a newborn lately, then grind over that powder which has been recommended for you. If there is an ulcer in the patient'dict (plaga), then heals that part with the water from which memory will recall it here at his head/throat (capitol).
If it is from lance or cottle and the depth varthy encountered, sometimes you must gauge how far into the wound when the patient's abdomen swells due to wind ascending within (perhaps indicating a ruptured intestine), be aware that such internal 'pollution' can lead to death.
If in him there is no depth and the humidity was recent upon his sanctum, then you pause in his chest for the first hour after purification, without straining it so that the sanctum does not remain deep within its cavity and returns to the heart, possibly with a wax-coated pause applied therein; similarly, recline him gently throughout the day.
If the ointment is not at hand, then pause in the bathhouse where water washes away whatever moisture there may be for that which comes out of your body; and make sure gouty fluid rests on the bed to allow it to flow as adjusted within you.
May it be that even from the foulness three days or more have passed without worsening of pain in the waist, nor spasm and ill restlessness of spirit nor rigidity of body; then take the other means available to you, as long as sick person is saved. Now attend carefully both treatments inside that heal him while still suffering.
If the sickness of him/her is alleviated and it has been so for some time, then you know that a fistula (an abnormal connection between two body parts) already exists; therefore attend to this issue with your care.
If the swelling is due to a gap or tear in skin or cartilage and it's simple on the surface of the chest or thigh, then treat that with water (if large) previously applied after stitching, or powder if small.
If there is pain before the eye and if your teeth are set apart (separated), then use forceps to extract those teeth now. If they are not separated, then let them enter that the swab be drawn out from them, as their extraction is expedited.
From other unexpected illnesses in the other body parts, their healing is provided by the fluid we have mentioned before.
From abdominal illnesses or troubles.
The discomfallibility in your belly is either great or small, or it varies.
Here comes the first sentence to translate: When a small disruption occurs due to another'dictory action of them in their place, if you do not remove these individuals from there promptly, then both breast and belly become engorged making it difficult for them to be expelled.
Therefore the best resolution is that it becomes easy in this place, although difficult to reduce the hernia here as with those special organs elsewhere mentioned.
You understand that there are four methods of treating the abdomen wound, and these stitches may also be used for other ulcers on the body.
Two other self-made stitches communicate with each other and/already those made within the abdomen'thy purpose is understood hereby:
And you are recommended each one of your explanations and declarations.
So when the child is small and suffers from any cause of the intestine (hernia), it becomes difficult to reduce that, either due to diminutive size at birth or because the herniated intestine swells with cold air:
And when the fluid ascends (or rises), then you must cut that which has been submerged in water alone, or moistened with water while being squirted out, and cloves, pepper, and bandages into the cavity where inflammation is resolved.
When certain measures have been taken in which has the stoppage of bleeding occurred, and it is better than water alone for the resolution of inflammation.
And when the inflammation is resolved, then you wet the intestine in the water where it was swolthy and bloated; thus drawing out its interior with a little cause.
If you release the intestine back into its cavity for this treatment, then divide the rupture with a small instrument to which sutures have been applied (sewn in).
The initial translation of this medieval medical text line by line into English would be:
Of the tool, its form is as follows:
One sharp portion of the body, and another non-sharp portion, as well as the delicate part that is not like bone fragility—these are bluntly pointed by one instrument alone.
And when the vermin is augmented and comes out of the intestine, it is best that its reduction be according to its natural form in its proper place if possible over there, which would be better.
When the disruption is wide open and in the lower part of the abdomen; when you lay down the hernia on your patient's back, placing cushions under their buttocks, holding their head with pillows – if it is below the abdomen, then place the person’dictorially (head holder) and stuffing pieces that are placed at its sides.
Here comes the first source sentence translation into English: If disruption occurs in one of the lower parts (possibly referring to organs) of the belly, then pause your understanding and consideration immediately so that whatever is inside can be pushed out without delay.
When it is necessary that you administer this in large and small boils, here's the translation for each line of your source sentence:
In minor pains, pause what you have prepared for treatment, and make it your servant between your own fingers which holds the entire disruption in its mouth and adjusts the lips of yours accordingly; additionally fix to where there is suture due to some other cause by that same agent.
Here is the line by line translation of the medieval medical treatise:
Here comes the first source sentence translated line by line into English:
Here comes the first sentence to translate: "They are fine needles moving within flesh and subtlety; small ones penetrate movement of body tissue, large ones find it difficult in the spine, hence why they move through delicacy and bulk.
Even if the needle is fixed in any of the patient'se extremities (down to their crotch), so that the flesh does not become dislocated and the wound remains healed,
Ensure they are not sewn for too long so that flesh does not become unable to heal properly.
Return the fingers of your needles so that they do not pierce through the patient'se sleep, and pause over the sewn up pus expanded parts throughout the entire wound area; place those there where you know the putrefied matter has been settled.
These small sewing needles are placed carefully in the wounds with great care, and for their closure either an individual pinch or two pins suffice to close those very stitches of them.
May the second stitch be common: and it is that you gently apply a needle to one of the four extremities—from wrist to toe along both legs, using an implement with fine and coarse points where the thread (suture) wraps around undernegy.
When the needle of that surgeon' extricates these four limbs, reduce it from which piece you cut off, in order for the wound to be lowered into its subdivided portion below ground level, such that suturing with linen as part of this cloth becomes secure.
And between each stitch is the amount of thickness for that part.
This stitch heals men (or it has medicinal properties for treating men).
Et has made stitches where the child was inside his belly, who had been sick on her abdomen (inside), a large part of which affected one palm' extrusion from two fingers away from that point within the membrane; and disruption in the membrane itself, so you have reduced what caused it to come out for xxx hours.
And when the patient is stabilized in their spaces within fifteen days or thereabouts, and healing occurs for them, apply moisture with motion to expedite recovery; over time, they will adjust accordingly.

May you direct two types of stitches according to what is said in Parayl.
When you begin with needlework on the chest and insert the cutting needle into the wound' extrinses.
And when the needle enters into the navel and that portion of the body where it was previously inserted, reach its full depth throughout all parts of the body, grasping with the end of the syringe; then pierce through the other extreme part which you have entered in on another extremity.
When you have pain in that portion of the body from above to below or vice versa, then make an incision at both ends thereof; and remove what is outside this wound area with forceps, making penetration into the other end of the same part where it began.
When fluid enters through your entry point into the cistern at the limb' extrémity, where it is already within you that all of this enters.
Here begins the treatment on this side of the patient's chest and places it at that extremity which is from the navel in the other, and thrusts the needle inserted into the waistband there to where you have reached; then withdrawing that same one again upwards along with its current position within said abdomen.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: And here are other kinds of rubs and restorations, which apply another kind within what you have already done so that it becomes as much needed according to this example only.

May the second type of suture that Gualia dictates, and which is spoken about herein for recommendation by him, you shall tie this half-life body part as the one treated by the healer ties it; thus adding all parts to their proper division according to nature. Apply another'dictated extremity from nowhere (or elsewhere) and link its tip with each other's respective tips in such a way that what is done at your recommendation comes into effect,
When you keep the needle at your own appointed place on the parting of flesh, and make that pierce into the partition below it therein, then turn over (or rotate) the needle so as to have its point enter again through two extremities of the calf; here is how:
When those joints are revolved, and their cavities enter the divided parts inside each other at the lower ends of these limbs opposite to one another in two directions.
This stitching is better than ordinary sewing and it's the kind of which memory recalls.
This is called "Guaiac" speech/discussion (assuming that 'sermo' refers to a
This may be called the "diagnostic procedure," whereby one rectifies the belly's seam using two needles, so that you insert a thread into these at several points and begin to pull out this thread as if inserting an awl through those same sutures which join their chests together.
And when there is a rupture in the stomach area (belly), then sewing it becomes difficult as compared to other parts of the belly.
May the method of medicine for peasant be judged by other diseases.
The cause occurs when you continue the recent labor by your body'dict self after being exposed to altered air that affects this humoral balance; return and adjust the intestine (budel) and hernia, placing attention on these areas until they are properly cared for.

Additionally: Ventosities at two spatulas' locations which might refer to distinct spaces between orifices; over the chest cavity (thoracic space); ventosities from both bridges, possibly referring to metal instruments used for cauterization such as forceps; and finally, ventosities of a cuoyza/cubitus – which refers historically either to wrists or elbows. These procedures likely involve drainage through incision ('scarificacio' implying cutting) into these abscess sites for treatment (‘extraccio de sanc’).

When there is any additional cause related to the patient'se bone marrow in their joints (bones), take that from them at the extremity of the instrument used for cutting it out and remove it with ease, as once removed they will no longer suffer harm or fear.
If the bone does not penetrate into the periosteum, and what is fractured or remains of the bone is its face, it experiences roughness and subtle cracks; when you recognize that hardness and fine splits, for which you have prepared various quantities according to your needs so as to be able to administer them at any convenient place on their body where they are positioned by yours hands.
When you administer in your ratio that which allows the bones to come together for mastication, and apply what is used from below those points, do not cease until reaching where treatment of both thick and subtle pus can be done throughout all these areas.

If the figure has already been distorted due to inflammation (or swelling), then you should apply heat and massage that part on the third day; rectify what is altered by applying warmth, perhaps using a heated poultice made of lamb's wool felt or wheat bran flour. This will help control edema in the affected area while also providing relief from swelling-related discomfort.
And when that bandage is applied and the position of the bone remains unchanged, so that it does not slip inside where it has been healed and strengthened; this fracture will be fixed in three days.
If another vengeance comes as an aspic treatment, then apply what we have mentioned earlier for these ailments within the patient' extranet until it is healed and that wound also recedes.
If the fracture is in bone, consider whether it' extruded or displaced, then take care of those fragments with what flows to them for their return during that part of treatment dealing with these parts of the skeleton.

When moving excessively during a game or activity, the sternum (the breastbone) is broken from force applied to it by one of its supporting muscles; this type of injury results in three possible types of breaks: simple fracture where the bone cracks but remains aligned, partial complex fracture with multiple fragments still joined together at some points, and complete comminuted fracture when the bone is shattered into several
When the sternum is broken into two or more pieces that are not in contact with each other—essentially separate segments of bone have come apart, and this severity prevents its own restoration at home; it requires medical attention if you can't align them yourself (implying professional intervention), which may be difficult to achieve on your own due to the nature of such a fracture or because they are juxtaposed with other injuries—it often necessitates surgical treatment. In some cases, where fragments have been displaced far enough apart that manual realignment is not possible (far fragmented), reconstruction may need open reduction and internal fixation by an orthopedic surgeon; this situation can pose a challenge for repair due to the complexity of misalignment or severe injury—or it might even require more extensive procedures if bone
In situations where the sternum is severely broken into fragments—meaning that two surgeons are required for a procedure; one holds and stabilizes the fractured sternum while another extends or manipulates the vertebra, which might be relevant in securing spine alignment during surgery. The involvement of multiple specialists indicates this is likely an intricate orthopedic case requiring expert attention to correctly repair both bone structures affected by such trauma—emphasizing a multidisciplinary approach for proper healing and restoration, possibly involving not just the sternum but also other associated skeletal injuries. This scenario underscores complex surgical

You understand that a fracture of the coast does not occur in large masses, but rather through those limbs belonging to them; and from their extremities during departure they are carried towards these jets (likely referring to sea currents or powerful water movements), due to the cartilaginous nature. This sentence suggests an understanding that injuries related to storms on coastal areas often involve fractures, particularly of limbs as people might be thrown by strong waves and wind during a catastrophe at these locations which are prone not only because they directly face environmental elements but also due to their physical properties.

When you have poured vinegar into the abdomen and belly to know if it will heal or not, consider that when your own masses are already softened, stupefied, and dead; they cannot be extended nor strengthened by those around them. When these putrefy further contracting therein with a needle (or thorn), you feel no pain in those places—this means it is not healing, and at the times of dispositions [it] are mortal.
If there are pains in those places and they feel constrained with piercing sensations, then you know that the bone of the body is saved, and these humors guard against illness.
If you see how the vertebrae of his back appear in water and wish to know if they will heal or not, then pay attention to the patient' extraterrestrial body (referring possibly to an unusual condition).
When you find that it is already soothed, apply to those waters where the matter has occurred and when on your two legs rests (lying down), breathes in deepness/indigestion as per his wish, some adjustments may happen over its backside leading him to urinate or not being able to hold urine, which indicates that he is near death; therefore, it's no longer treatable.
May it not be that any cause of those things is worse and so I put them aside lightly.
The treatment of the patient is that you perform ablations with a cautery that rests on the spondyl arthritic or eroded, perhaps moistened by sweats from standing too long; let it rest for some hours until the inflammation subsides.
And when one of the comfortable supports is present, and rests on that which limbs suffer from pain; commanding the humors to take a pause and tranquillity, not sleep in the place where it causes suffering until healed.
If you have decreased the bone of the skull or any cause that has already separated from it (head injury), then push on the spine and touch that bone; and if there is a large wound, suture it now; and take care for that which was encumbered by bandages until healed.
If the bone of the hips breaks and it is the time of the womb's flow (menstruation), then you intervene with your hand on the left thigh near the groin where the hip joint ends, and gently press downwards until possible by cuddle; apply pressure to that area if needed from these interventions, and strengthen this.
If you feel sharp pains in your body, attend to that area and apply it; heal the wounds with care as has been provided before so they can be restored when health is regained.
In translation from this medieval medical context into modern English line by line could
From "restauracio" (restoration/repair), and considering the historical use of
The large bones are broken or shattered (implying the need for restoration), and if they do break, it is not a simple injury but rather communication along those extremities; these fragments fall into length and decline to their divisions - this indicates how fractured parts may separate further. Moreover, pain occurs in that location where there's penetration/injury (indicating the point of trauma), causing stupor upon breakage.
The restoration of him/her is that you stretch your hand over where there may be a bone break, the figure of them.
If the break is in just that limb of yours, then you should wrap it up with cloth soaked from an armor garment until it forms back to its normal shape for you.
May it be that the break is long or already descending to the divisions of time, then speak to the malady within your abdomen while you prepare its restoration. And when you have applied the plaster to it, take pause over that beam of wood or bone, and stretch tightly across the point where there is no fear of a chiseling incision for fracture nor extraction of the spine.
E places the convexity wherein that fluid fills it within which constriction occurs, and commands the hump to lie on its back or over its chest so;
If you apply an incision cut (cautery), then stop the bleeding and restoration begins until such time that this second application of incising ends; at which point return to healing within it, applying pressure with a hand bandage tightly while accompanying.
If you fracture in your shins or are crushed, then treat them (the injuries).

So if the bone that is fractured is the smaller one above (presumably referring to a specific part of the skeletal structure), it is convenient for the doctor, and you must restore it so easily within as long as this allows until such time when said bone can be repositioned.
May it be that if a great fire is what causes us to crack or fracture, the one who applied pressure did so with vigorous extension.
If the two fires burn together intensely, then it is necessary for you to pause their removal forcefully.

If in the bone fracture you are causing total pain throughout the body at your location and within your willpower,
If there appears in the patient separate symptoms that push down the spine and you do not hope for its restoration elsewhere, then attend to these issues according to our previously stated method.
May it be that if there is a bone breakage (fracture), you have noticed swelling in the area alone (plagued with fluid accumulation), and therefore take care of that very spot specifically.
If you harden the cautery on your patient' extrication site, then take linen dipped in oil and white wax for treatment; stretch that cloth over where tightening is present so that the cautery softens there; afterwards remove the cloth and apply a plaster of paris prepared with powdered moly sulphur mixed into clay. Keep pressure on, allowing it to set while applying stitches at both ends until they are firmly in place – this has been done where fracture was found and fixed securely.
Be aware that the name of the bones in the arm is found within its major structures or a fracture occurs at one focus or two foci simultaneously.

The text appears to be in Spanish and seems related to the care of chicken thighs (pinche de la ma) during cooking without causing them harm ("accideys"). It suggests that there should not just be a passive approach but active, careful handling throughout the process. Here is an English translation:
When you experience the pain of a fracture or dislocation, then watch how long it lasts for up to an hour and place your hand over that extended area.
Extend the minister' extricates broken bones and, for this purpose, he uses those bound together by good conjunctions (i.e., properly aligned or fixed with materials like splints).
And when you apply plaster and lint (for bandaging), if there is no suppuration (infection formation), then secure the dressing according to the size of the area covered by it; already have wrapped that in a linen cloth.
May it be the case if the injury is in the parts of detention and appears like cloth drape, then command the humors to contract that portion with your hand tightened on the injured part; make its fibers long as a cloth.
And if it is necessary for the body's head to be wrapped in cloth wherein it rests, tighten that second one as well.
If the fracture is at the extremities (ends), then stop pressing below and above those parts of the break on the palm so that it heals properly; furthermore, release any sprain in between these two points where they are tied together with ligaments as you turn.
If you break the bones of either foot or leg, and it is where the limb breaks, then bind it as tightly as possible using your palm's strength; if you wish to pause for a moment, rest on the small stone at their ankle four times so that the fracture rises and does not become deformed.
May it be so that if the fracture is in those other places mentioned here (in this context), just as with one of these specific spots, we must apply pressure there where such spot lies; or let them rest on that small stone they are currently standing on (their footrest). Continuing like this will be better. Or pause over that little pillar/stone place now and then in the same way you would here at their feet.
Consider in your restoration and apply that proper position of applied incision care—that which is necessary when you encounter any cause related to those mentioned earlier, as per the account provided by him/her.

In repairing a hip fracture, it might refer to the following steps or considerations in English:
The bones of the thigh are worn down and it is declared according to what has been converted into the departure from home towards bed rest.
The restoration of him is done so that the sinew is taut over the fracture and another bandage shortly afterward, with the humidity lying upon his abdomen and face.
Whenever the minister extends it fully according to its quality where the bone is broken in place,
If it is necessary for the ligament to be placed near the knee joint'dictly on this portion of the leg bone, thus extending its reach and preventing further injury by immediately applying another bandage afterward (the second one).
When the joint is prone to dislocation, it hurts when stretched across various parts of time (implying different times or seasons), and that's where we apply the ligament proper for this condition.

If there is an ulcer present and you wish to heal it within the days that bleeding stops from the ulcer, then return to your care routine.
The strictness of the limb is suffering: cover that which encases the fracture with hard bandages, and fold them twice or thrice over time; remove excess covering until it reaches up to the ankle and knee joints of the thigh bone.
E introduce long iron between the thigh and knee joints as provided by their parts, and tighten the extremities of that part with the pin attached to the excess length of the bandage.
Return your hand pressure over the area of that fracture on their knee and apply pressure to one stone placed upon the bone of the thigh; this is how it should be done for such a breakage.
Return and fill the empty spaces between the sheet and thighs with woolen cloths to ensure that bleeding stops (the extraction).
Here begins the constriction of strong heat above the location of the three-layered or four-layered fracture; and as you get closer to the site of the fracture with your ligament, the tightness is lessened and cooler moisture is applied.

And when some strains are tight on the hip joint other than those that have been discussed earlier today in this consultation and with our arm, it is necessary to address them as well.
Even in the act of restoring him/her like this, you will not heal the leg that has become immobile; and if it is restored alone, another cushion must be applied thereafter, making necessary for them to walk again from which they were bedridden.

The provided text appears to be an excerpt from a medieval medical treatise
In English, this line translates as "About the treatment of the patella fracture." Here is how you might translate it more naturally:
The provided line from the medieval Latin-influenced medical text translates to: "You understand that in the patella there are two bones for which it is called 'the kneecap'; and the other one is small, known as the meniscus." Here'dictating a more English phrasing could look like this while preserving context from medieval times when specific anatomical terminology was used differently:
When you apply vinegar to the bones of your arm and shoulders (which are broken), it also aids in healing those parts along with the healing of the arms themselves, making this treatment an operation for me.
If you grind two bones together, then the cushion becomes all parts of it.
If the bone is cracked subtly, then the cushion becomes parts of Dent (referring possibly to dental work or localized treatment in this context).
If your bone is fractured and must be set immediately, it's due to reasons beyond your control.
When administering extension and balance exercises according to that posture, proceed as follows:
Mayhaps even if the crack in the joint is caused by sharp movements causing sprain and pain increases, then apply pressure with your own virtue.
When there is any cause for operation on the arms, and when you engage in performing all of this work with iron nails that have been stopped at times to pause the causes already paused in solitude (painful episodes), these are tools used extensively as splints; apply them where cramps occur. Do not use hands from behind or directly on those areas, and adjust according to how long they need based upon their length within a short time frame after entering pus.
Envelop a cloth around each garment according to the length of it, pause one over the joint between the thigh cushion and either leg' extrusion (pus), ensuring that they stay within the base part of the foot where the swelling is located.
Return the limbs' pains to three points of pain and at nighttime here is this structure that should not be leaned against in either right or left side; it serves well for good reason.
And a steel breast-piece is administered according to the length of the cushion, and it is held in place on the patient's body so that their mobility may be preserved.
Mostly when you make this in a fracture, and at that moment it is done properly by itself.
In each day consider the condition of every part and study it according to yesterday'thy observations herein described, keeping watch for signs of decay or inflammation as well as other causes that seem similar; when you encounter any cause from among these aforementioned ones, then apply therapy within what is entered into so that said thing may heal.

Translation of the given line: "From the breakdown of the calcaneus and bones of the foot, and the tootsies."
Although the toe does not break entirely; some bones of the foot may crack or suffer breaks occasionally; and when it comes to the fingers (toes), they do not actually fracture but rather dislocate in their joints.
If the bones of the foot are broken and sometimes these bones rise above them among themselves, then heal their toe over it on earth prepared with antidotes as necessary.

Return pressure with an application of bandage and halt bleeding from below (presumably the abdomen), in which there are two small containers placed within:
And strengthen that part of the body at its structure and extension, which you have wrapped in cloths and other things due to hunger or lack thereof (translation: And fortify this area of the body according to its form and extent, for it has been enveloped with fabrics because of starvation or insufficient nourishment).
When three or four days have passed, then you unlace the bandage, and by force remove any fractured bones in their joints, or if they are displaced (dislocated), that operation is completed with these procedures.
If you find your joints are tender, restore them as they come back to health and massage these areas with what I advise for their healing restoration in recovery. Here comes the first source sentence to translate:

When the bones of either man or woman are broken, administer in their restoration and healing what we have recommended for the joints of the thighbone.
When the root of these particular fractures is not hidden and only rarely occurs, it mainly pertains to whom I have devoted my study and use; that fracture indicates its direct pathway in restoration and limitation within you, hence understood clearly.
When the wound on the body heals in the bedcloth (drap), place gauze therein and cover it with this; keep pressure over it for three days or send them here, where they will be cured.
Capitol .xix.: This line appears to be an ancient Roman law
When a bone breaks in children (who are more flexible and whose bones can heal faster), the treatment approach often differs from that of adults due to their capacity for rem
At that place where the fracture occurs in children (who have more flexible bones and can heal quicker), treatment is usually directed to it, mostly if the broken bone extends along with or substitutes for nearby joints like hips or shoulders, similar as how you're positioned there. If your body conditions allow casting at that location similarly done by others here (doctors using cast immobilization techniques), then we proceed and apply a splint to maintain the current posture until further evaluation occurs nowhere else but this immediate area.
If the child wets themselves (likely referring to bedwetting or incontinence), then you must tighten them at their waist so that they soil over there where it has seeped out, provided there is not another cause for this issue.
When it is time to begin healing the fracture on that day, do not extend beyond today unless an abscess has formed.
May you apply cauterization if there is an ulcer, then restore it inside the patient within one day until it recedes, but do not treat them on the third and fourth days in total; otherwise, bad accidents may occur.
May it be that if the bone is fractured and protrudes above the neck (the part where the skull meets the spine), then you should try to reduce that, applying pressure with your hands for ease of treatment and a little extension.
May it not be extension out of preparation and the patient's position are in their throats, then reduce that part with your own means; this is made of iron, whose length ranges from seven or eight digits (inches), and its width according to the amount of grains (the size). Therefore, a physician must pry it out depending on what quantity you demand for use during healing in all cases of fracture.
And should it be granted (or provided), and in a small amount of discomfort for that the comprehension does not spread over there during the operation time, here we have:
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
This is how it should be done:
E it is named in Greek "Labra Volantis Atelerem," hence, it is a small cushion/pad.
For that which is paused at its extension should stand raised on the bone' extrusion.
When that returns the bone within a period when it is resting (guarantia), and has applied an ointment to any of its joints, this serves as well for some sort of cushion or bedding on them.
So then you should grasp the limbs of the fracture and if one leg is broken in a subtle way that does not require immediate tightening for good healing, it's best to insert there what instrument has such power (possibly referring to some form of splint or fixation tool).
Mayhaps if you cannot reduce the bone of all that we have recommended, then proceed to extract and remove whatever comes out from those abscesses which we advise upon; otherwise, saw away at least one piece with any available saws in your possession.
Return that which is rough in the bone of hardness and sharp small pieces,
When the bone is reduced (set back into place), and its reduction causes intense pain, you know that it will not return to its original position on its own; therefore, provide great care for the swolthy (swelling or inflammation).

E arrange the stones in the hour of meat'suprema recovery from bone, and place the foundlings discovered within to be immersed according to their quantity into cleansing waters as per customs using wrappings based on how many are present.
Be very careful not to strain the child where there is a crack, as doctors frequently say they might get hurt or illness due to these fractures, and it'm sickening for them. If it is a looseness or softness in the thigh joint that differs from the rigidity of other fractures.
If the patient is large or ill-formed and you are concerned about those harmful accidents they have had upon that table, causing pain in that area, do not pause over those tables; perhaps wrap them up tightly with hard sheets at the place of standing and strain on their body.
When once or twice a day the patient begins to sweat in that place where you have left the cloth paused over them (perhaps for comfort), then apply cold poultices, as per our custom we treat wounds with these ointments and similitude remedies.
Here is the translation line by line:
If the child passes wind for days and it is not solidified nor separated from them at their bra, then you understand that small parts are seeking to escape within them through attempts (of expulsion). From those satagias (cold humors) that have been separated and extracted from them, the ones whose separation has not occurred yet and place their limbs resulting in pain – you must insert each according to what is possible for you.
If you touch the patient's belly or groin and it hurts, they will scream out in pain, which is another form of corruption and decomposition, so that even if you pause one of those fluids necessary for their healing as described earlier in this chapter, there may be a reaction.
From the fluid in which my speech and presence are: when large limbs bend downward towards those of your thighs and assistants/helpers (coyssa), and you do not think to attach yourself or remove from it, fearing that excessive moisture over time due to this liquid will lead to death; live as long as possible therein for up to 20 days or 30, if observed by you—and if not lived through these periods, then take care of the young ones.

And consider if the nodulation is recent and administer those medicines that have applied arsenite to it (arsenious), quicksilver (mercury), sulfur ("mirage"), colloquium, crust, as applicable to these; so that some of them take hold on this node or all of them comfortably absorb the mixture made with such ingredients in paper (alumen) and apply it over the nodulation wrapped in linen. Then tightly bind those parts together for good constriction.

Capitolo XXI. (The term "Capitol" likely refers
When the bone is healed and set according to its natural laws, as directed by Roman medical principles:
When a bone fracture is healed, and the fragile parts of the limb are supported: at this time it's not pain due to these causes - which include multiple uses of ligament/tendon beyond its natural course; or because excessive constriction prohibits nutrition from reaching the member (limb); or too much padding, allowing no movement necessary for healing; or spinal rigidity in lumbar region and dislocation.
Cure for the excess involves draining it from the body and making the patient'thy heart tender within, administering baths, and applying poultices and leeches on him/her.
Return the pause over the limb so that it draws nourishment into itself again and returns to its normal shape within wherein food enters, until the sustenance circulates back naturally.
In order to provide an accurate translation for "Capitol .xxii.,
Of the bones that are set together, it is forbidden to perform any operation on them nowhere else but here (implying in a medical or surgical context). This line suggests an emphasis on restraint and possibly refers to times when intervention might be medically contrainddicted. The translation maintains the medieval text's reference to
When pain is felt in the limb that has been healed from misalignment and elevation of bone fragments (indicating a post-fracture scenario), it indicates injury to the affected part, yet there's no prohibition against natural use of the body. However, you are protected now by this measure; hence nobody else can bring forth any issues that concern such injured members—especially concerning new fractures which may occur despite current measures in place for protection and care.
May also stand as witnesses among the doctors and innkeepers who have performed this procedure, which is considered lost due to great fear for its reputation.
May joint stiffness and nodules be recent developments; if they are encased in fluid where your thighs press together (the area of intersection), apply a poultice made from the ashes of high heat or razor blades, along with honey and spirits that resemble these substances. Apply this dressing repeatedly until mollification occurs naturally; alternatively, use putty extracted from raisin ash and grease from lard (tallow), applying it to this area; if they are fat droplets compressed between the legs in a cushion or on the chest with hands held together, these represent medicines of consolidation named after themselves.
Some liquids are dissolved by the persistent cold sweats that affect even the moist parts of the body and should be administered motion throughout the entire day.
May it be that the twisting is coming down now and has become a stone and therefore necessitates care with iron as such; because its pus beneath the cessations (abscesses) bursts forth, dissolving continuously of excess fluid from those abscess cavities which irritate delicate bones below them, so that it is administered easily under these circumstances.

And so that there is not an outflow or stretching in the hour of application, frequent movements make coming pains and cramps come about.
When you have cleansed the wound with water and oil (or when), then cover it up so that there is time for recovery from putrefaction; place your limb in immersion of bathwater and olive oil, and reduce its size to make easier movement.
And in each of its parts it will receive water from which memory brings back here.
And when the displacement caused by the break has occurred, it enters from one portion into another already entered (the parts of broken bone).

Regarding the luxation or displacement of the jawbone, here is a translation:
So dislocated the jaws if not set; and dislocation of both is according to one of two methods: because it originates from their places with a little removal, and they are slightly mollified in part, or due to entire dislocation and compound fracture—until those parts have been made softer at the joint'supreme where saliva comes out; until that patient cannot hold on such object nor close his mouth, tongue being wrapped around its own speech.
May it be when the detachment of them is slight, they return themselves back through their major positions with little cause.
If there is a complete and total dislocation, then promptly administer reduction (manipulation), and do not delay in doing so for the entire duration.
The minister holds the chin of the patient, and the doctor inserts one of his fingers from the heel of his hand into the joint dislocation of the jawbone at the mouth'dict location; if the dislocation is in one part, then both thumbs are inserted accordingly for two parts dislocations. They hold all other body parts that were outside and bring them back inside until they return to their original place. The doctor commands the patient’s jawbones to stop moving away from any separation and heals those parts out of displacement; meanwhile, the doctor repositions the jawbone into its correct location.
If it is difficult to reduce him/her (the patient), and mostly if both mandibles are dislocated, then apply lavage with water tail or oil inside the rectum without delay; this will facilitate the reduction of both jaws at once, which we have discussed here.
And when they return engaged and the mouth of the malady is closed but not soothed, placing polpills made of cloth dipped in wax on those spots, as well as beeswax and oil rubs; this aids their sore limbs.
E asleep the thigh of the patient on their two beds, and his head is between two pillows to ensure that it does not strain either towards the right or left; nor do you forcefully massage any cause thereof; having food within reach (probably a feather bed), one will give when pains are relieved and jaws are no longer numb.
And if it is administered easily, and you do not work on the opening of the mouth for consumption and drinking until the jawbone is numbed and healed.
If the reduction of two dislocated jaws is difficult at any time and cannot be converted to their respective places during labor, then continued feverish conditions are followed by constant urination, and strengthening both abdomen (the stomach) due to constipation, as well as purified blood.
When you pour it again, then realize that I have lost it; and continue to take care of the part where this liquid was poured every few days.
The provided text appears to be an excerpt from a medieval medical treatise
Regarding the reduction of shoulder (furcal) dislocation and the limb's skeletal structure, here is an interpretation in English:
The fur finally is not dislocated from the joint due to continuous pressure on the hip; and some are dislocated at the lower extremity, which is declared by feeling.
The restoration of him is that his malady falls upon his two legs and extends their beds. Return that place with your hand is firmly held back and will return.
Return your hand over that dressing and apply pressure gently thereon.
May the extremity of that which is between your thighs continue at this, it'thy not dislocated on any day; but if reduced and girded as we have said and according to how you are equipped.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: "Apply pressure on that plastering, and friction, and extraction; command the humors to return to quiescency and rest until it is healed.
When this healing care is applied, the tendon of the muscle becomes reduced when separated from its place.
In translating this medieval medical text line by line into English while considering its mix
The process of reducing a muscle dislocation involves several steps aimed at carefully realigning the affected muscle back to its proper position within the joint without
When it comes to the reduction of a dislocated muscle (in three ways), one way is when such displacement occurs as suddenly or from movement, often referred to here in medieval medical terminology with "titillic" possibly being an old term for twitching or involuntary movements. Here's how we can translate it:
Here comes the second sentence to translate: It is that it should be dislocated from its position below the muscle, and it hurts there; nor does it get dislocated at the back parts due to the shoulder joints, nor in front of nerve branches.
Mostly it is a displacement and falling out of parts to be touched gently, mainly in those where the bones are thin, dislocation occurs; perhaps also there due to movement of the bones, they fall out with difficulty.
When poultice or fomentation is applied to the affected area for cold application and rubbing of their sore muscles (which are already inflamed), they experience pain due to displacement that has occurred.
Now cover where you have entered that which is overly seated upon it (presumably referring to the patient being too sedentary), and proceed with its healing process.
Here comes the translation:
If it is a displacement of the joint or limbs and you must apply touch treatment without fear (without getting hurt yourself), then proceed with gentle manipulation.
From this dislocation it is felt a light reduction when cool and the malady descends into the abdomen.
The reduction of it is for the minister to raise its mass above itself; and place there momentarily light pressures on the pulsing head below, elevating that joint in strength at their location, raising its mass upwards as well; and afterwards apply pressure gradually until they return leugierament.
If it does not return, and thus an accident occurs causing the patient's humors to flow downward into their tailbone and be administered with broth made of cumin, fennel, honey, and watermelon in water; this will soften and line the bowels along with its associated intestinal knots.
Here comes the translation line by line:
If you wish to reduce that second symptom according to this method: make it present a long home (likely referring to an instrument or substance) longer than the limb, placed on the area of concern belonging to him/her and insert his muscle quickly with the aid tool into where the swelling is inside while drawing out fluid from those parts immediately after its entry. If the thigh is loose, then I shall find out what else causes it to be hanging downward and thus worsen that condition; once identified, this will return quickly after being corrected/repositioned.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: And another way of reduction is as follows: lay a long staff on which figure can be formed; not thick nor subtle in nature, and place it under their buttocks immediately after raising (the patient'se position). The staff should rest its head upon the back of the staff itself while keeping the abdomen aligned with the length of the staff. Place your hand over each part shortly afterwards from this other body part for strengthening; thus extending one limb at a time, so that joint returns to its proper place quickly due to swift action (as per reduction technique).
If reduction of him is difficult for all the reasons mentioned beforehand, then use this treatment as follows: take a staff with the length that extends to two arm's lengths and hold it at an angle of four digits from the thumb position on this manner according to what has been stated here.
Elevate the head on pillows such that it does not press down on the abdomen.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: "Now he has placed his hand on the tightness of the belly immediately and extended it or arms over into the parts quickly, holding the staff above under them.
Return the arm to an inclined plane as per its latitude according to customary rules and stretch your hand over the parts just now; another body is hanging from the other limb at this joint intersection.
When the internal substance is completed according to any possible manner you have at your disposal; and as soon as you pause for a while on the sperm of wool with this quantity (perhaps indicating some formulation or treatment), apply an emplastrum prepared from flour made by moisture and egg white over all muscle, so that it is turned upwards above the strictures. And then tighten said application slowly; and bind the ligature to the patient's chest where they are connected (presumably indicating some form of compression or support), ensuring that their breastplate does not sound moan for seven days without discomgy, pain should diminish during this period with proper use.
When food is sparingly consumed by the patient with an obstruction (malady), and their member becomes comfortable, then relief comes to them.
And if it is given more substantial food and engaged in some movement, then even if he does not soften or ease up, he will already be cured.
May it be that if the joint is dislocated by moisture or for another reason, then in that case administer three kinds of treatments according to what has been written about instruments for treatment.
If all this pain is present and the ligament and joint are not fixed for seven days, then the cast and sprain will be reduced on some occasions; after that, it won'thy been tightened nor can you raise that arm to the parts above, indicating understanding that these tendons which run through the bone at its muscle head (cap), or as extensions/moltenness.
When joint pain is caused by the dislocation of that which causes it in the knee and chest area, reduction should be performed with force and extension until return to normal position occurs.
When it is administered in that other constriction, and its cure occurs while being healed therein.
If you harden the body'se health and slow down its movement, then let that heaviness be washed away with frequent baths until such time as this heavy condition returns to its original state of nature.
Capitol .xxvii. (Note: This line appears as a Roman numer
The phrase "curacio di dislocazione del coccx" translates to English roughly as the treatment of a shoulder dislocation
When the shoulder joint is dislocated; it appears difficult and seemingly impossible to return; for when it's dislocated anywhere in its entirety, mainly at the juncture between parts forward and backward, and if you attempt to adjust a dislocated arm according to any given figure—it becomes apparent that this condition. At this moment, the joint is concave (bowed out), making impossible bending of the arm or touching its own muscle with your hand because it's in such an injured state.
When you have the legs together and reduce it as much so that a cautery apeste (heals), even if there is an apeste heal on them, difficult it is to completely restore them; most often when they are behind parts of dislocation, pain from all other species of displacement and greater suffering come upon those who apply.
And when restoration is possible for him/her, it means that the body of this person should be stretched out on a mattress (and their arms extended), and they must lie with their legs over the knees or heel positioning—or between them if necessary using support such as pillows undernethylegs. The practitioner presses onto these joint points in his/her hands, aiming to bring it back into its original place (i.e., proper alignment).
If the dislocation is at the joints ahead of it, return to where your hand goes under its position until you hear a sound in the area between the knee and the back of their hand.
If the dislocation does not submit to reduction, then apply vigorous extension and strong motion.
When two ministers stretch out their arms and hold that instrument between them so it does not get extended too far,
When you turn and raise his arm completely over it (the body), covering with a long cloth or lariat, thus:
When the doctor touches the joint, apply some oil to it so that this helps with the lubrication of the joint and strengthen its connection until returning (the state).
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: And for its reduction that has been paused over there where it is fixed and protrudes in albumen (a thick white fluid), within which are swelling and extension of strictures, with arm suspended from the collarbone and laid down on pillows.
And so if it is necessary to cut off the joint (probably referring to an amputation or a surgical procedure), then here you should carefully separate and remove that part from its location there, which forms the juncture at this place.
If you see the joint not strengthened, repeat the bandage and lynchet (ligature), leaving it there for several days until it is extended; then remove that as well.
If grief enters and the patient'thy position is in motion, apply moisture with baths both wet and dry lightly, while being observed until he/she recovers; if there is a hernia at that joint movement point (the fatty flesh junction), bind it securely on his body above. Apply the binding during daytime and nighttime over this area to prevent slipping out of place: Return that one and immerse the other in the bath; when steaming occurs at the joints moistened by cold water (quickly), perform friction there where it is ronhonal due to movement, once a day for this treatment' extrinsic sentence: When translating this medieval medical treatise line by line into English while considering its mix of Latin influence with elements reminiscent of Italian, Spanish
If you wish to do so, pause over that moist and split furrow along the border and stretch it out there; apply some water, then that becomes dampened again and returns to its proper state.
Capitol .xxviii. (The reference number "Capitol .xx
Regarding the treatment of joint displacement, it concerns the area between the arm and the body (or more specifically could mean "between the shoulder blade/scapula and the torso"). In this line, a medieval medical text is discussing where dislocations or separations in the
Regarding joints that have become dislocated (within the body), reduction is easier for these than others; however, if it occurs swiftly or in conjunction with an existing fracture locking phenomenon at this location—indicating a situation where bone fragments are firmly joined due to trauma – immediate intervention using specialized techniques may be required. Here the text highlights that speed and circumstances play crucial roles when addressing dislocations, especially if they happen quickly or alongside fractures causing an 'ankylosis' lock condition in joint areas like shoulders (scapulae) where such swift action might prevent further damage through specific procedures known as 'lock reduction'.
The reduction of a joint dislocation involves stopping the shoulder (scapula) from falling outward and stretching it back into place; at this moment, either your hand or palm rests on top to prevent movement while applying pressure that returns it to its original position – herein described are delicate steps for realigning what's been dislocated: cease the shoulder’se potential downward displacement by placing something stable beneath (like a table), extend and securely hold this area in place, using your hand or palm against gravity threats; simultaneously exert pressure to guide it back into its natural setting. This procedure underscores maintaining stability during manual reduction while avoiding further injury through controlled external manipulation by the practitioner (doctor).
Even if it is considered that the palm rests on her stomach and hinders its expansion and contraction upon a table; and if dislocation occurs beforehand, place her body so that her belly sits above this intrinsically beneath the table surface. Thus, the doctor's patient can be safely positioned to prevent joint displacement at the junction of movement.
And if it returns soon, good fortune be yours; otherwise, that part will become swollen and difficult to heal thereon unless you intervene immediately with the reduction of its pressure points within these days.
Mays the joint according to its curvature; and there is nothing in the belly causing it, but rather that the pain is soothed and not able to cause any other source of discomfort; you understand that the nerves are twisted or stretched, and only when strained by care for treatment here will provide a reason.
So when they return uncomfortable (malassem), place the compress that we have prepared on them, and bind it securely for days; also cut off their clothing and exercise with vigor to strengthen themselves.
If the patient' extricates and their body falls due to gravity at any point in time, then apply some water on that joint as cold compressions, until they are lifted (alleujat).

May it not return through this form; therefore take a table of which the length or breadth is three cubits, and carve into the wall where we have stated that the swelling should be located within the extent of the table' extrusion (the patient has an inflamed area corresponding to the size of the chosen table). Return the support of the table to the vertebra and let the doctor rest his feet on the other end; initially start inside so that the spine can become compressed and return to its place.

If the dislocation is at the joints behind, it does not occur that the malady has spread to the parts of yesterday and stands above ground; those who cover have been said to do so over a hard cause—and if the patient' extruded limb is dislocated from the joints in front, as we mentioned earlier about their two widths, then it should not be tightened on the face or ligaments which are extended outwards, according to what has been stated.

Keep a bandage applied for three days or four afterward so maintain alignment and healing progress.
Return the ligaments and bandage back onto themselves, compare one cushion with another.

Translation of "Curación de la deslización del talón":
Le heel occasionally becomes swolgy due to slight injury and at times is dislocated either in the joints or in the knee area, which pain it causes affects its parts or limbs.
The translation of the medieval medical treatise line by line into English is as follows:
May the cure for their return (the patient' extrusion from surgery) be light and easy to apply on top or inside where they are returned until restored, so that it is not heavy upon them while healing.
When the treatment of him comes according to the second complement and you bind his thigh tightly with a strong hand minister from behind that position in the heat spot on him,
Return yourself the right thigh to its cleft within the body' extrinsic joint area of the upper limb portion (the shoulder), and your left hand is in that same position on the lower section of this part where it connects with the leg segment at the hip.
Return the leg to your left hand for three times, and adjust it with your left hand twice, extending the leg further away from you; then press the foot of the leg onto the bed where its thigh works.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
When necessary, thrusts are made on the firmness of the chest area and you take your position therein as needed. (Here 'cavity' refers to where one would be situated in this context; it could mean being ready or present at a certain location such as an examination spot.)
Thus, if you return in one or two thrusts as per this methodology and at times hold the foot (engulf), then everything is well; but if not, repeat until he returns back where needed to be held/retained by hand positioning during therapeutic intervention. This suggests a hands-on approach that may include manual manipulation or holding of certain body parts for treatment purposes according to the described technique (possibly indicating an early form of chiropractic practice).
However if you are prohibited from performing reductions as advised here (implying a restriction on manual adjustments or manipulations), speak to the hernia about its two places upon earth, and then place an anchor firmly in grounded soil; ensuring that it lies between your thighs. Wrap around yourself with cloth so you don'thy disturb the misplaced organ (implying a need for care when handling or attempting treatment of certain conditions without direct intervention). This indicates another method where observation and positioning are advised, suggesting ways to manage an issue indirectly in line with medieval medical thought processes.
Thus the minister of it holds your thighs and another official extends out over his shoulders or where he lays upon them; extend that agent against its extension, with a plow firmly held between those who hold (implying an assistant's role in stabilizing positioning). Keep this device betwixt the thighs restraining what lies therein contained within it. This further elaborates on non-direct intervention techniques where instruments or devices are used to assist with maintaining proper limb positions for treatment, as per traditional medical practices at that time which may have resembled early supportive taping methods in orthopedics and physical therapy contexts today.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: The doctor inserts his instrument into their joints, and another minister uses fingers on different parts of time until dyslocation returns home (back), indicating recovery.
Therefore, when the dislocation is returned and it'supra declared to you that she has been restored due to the reduction of her condition, then apply plaster bandaging firmly and extend this around the limb joint; bind the foot to the ligament with a strong thread.
When you fear or protect the tendons located behind on the foot, to ensure that the ligament above it is not violent and leads strength.
Return that thing for two or three days, and if the bandage softens, extend it further outwardly.
Return those things in the day or at night and prevent moisture from their limbs for forty days. May it not happen that if one goes into that space, the dislocation will not be secure and unsoundly treated without care.
