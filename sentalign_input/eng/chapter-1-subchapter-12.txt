 CHAPTER TWELVE.
On cautery in cataract of the eye.
 When by those signs I have mentioned in the relevant section there is brought to your notice the beginning of a cataract of the eye, start with draughts for the patient such as shall cleanse his head; and guard him from all humidities.
Make him also sweat for some days, fasting, in the bath.
Then tell him to have his head shaved; and burn him with one cauterization in the middle of the head; then cauterize him with two burns on the temples if the cataract is beginning in both eyes; or on the one side only if it is in one eye.
And with the cautery cut all the subcutaneous veins and arteries; and let the cauterizations be long, across the breadth of the temples.
Beware of haemorrhage; if you see any, stanch it straight away with any means you can.
We shall deal later on with the method of extraction and cutting out of arteries, and provision against haemorrhage.
Two strong cauterizations are sometimes made on the back of the neck below the two bones.
