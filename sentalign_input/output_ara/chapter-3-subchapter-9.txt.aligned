On the repair of the vertebrae of the back and neck.	On setting the vertebrae of the back and neck.	0.8447751
As for the bones of the neck, if a fracture occurs in them - and this rarely happens to them, what happens most often is a contusion - and likewise also the vertebrae of the back, so if this happens to someone and you want to know whether he will recover or not. Then look, and if you see that his hands have become limp and numb and dead, and he is unable to move them, neither extend them nor clench them, and if you pinch them or prick them with a needle he does not feel that and does not find pain in them, then know that he will not recover in most cases, and he is doomed.	When a fracture occurs in the bones of the neck, which is rare, as mostly they suffer contusion, as do the spinal vertebraeâ€”when it happens to anyone and you want to know whether it will heal or not, then look and if you see both his hands relaxed and numb and dead and he has no power to move or stretch or close them, and when you pinch them or prick them with a needle he does not notice it or feel any pain in them, you may know, as a general rule, that it will not mend, for he is doomed.	0.92828774
And if he moves them and feels the pinching and pricking in them, then know that the spinal cord is intact and that the patient will recover with treatment. If the vertebrae of the back suffer the same, and you want to know whether he will recover or not.	But if he moves them both and feels in them the pinching and pricking, you may know that the spinal medulla is still intact and that under treatment the patient will recover. If anything of this nature happens to the vertebrae of the back and you wish to know if he will recover or not, then pay attention to his feet.	0.85848033
Then look at his legs. If you see that they have become limp, and what happened to the hands has happened to them, and then, if he lies on his back, wind and feces come out involuntarily, and if he lies on his stomach, urine comes out involuntarily, and if he lies on his back and wants to urinate, he is unable to do so, then know that he is doomed, so do not bother treating him. If none of this happens to him, the matter is less serious. The treatment for what has occurred is that you try to soothe the hot swelling.	If you see them relaxed and in the situation we described in the case of the hands, and when he lies on his back he passes flatus and faeces involuntarily, and lying prone he passes water involuntarily and lying on his back he cannot pass water if he wishes, then you may know his case is hopeless, so do not concern yourself with his treatment. But if nothing of this kind occur then the case is easier.	0.76944834
By placing on the bruised vertebra rose oil alone or with roasted egg whites. Apply this three times a day, until the hot swelling subsides. Then apply to the area one of the strengthening, drying dressings and bandage it tightly. Order him to rest and remain still.	The way to treat this latter kind of case is to try to reduce the swelling by applying over the injured vertebra oil of roses, alone, or with roasted yolks of egg; apply three times a day until the swelling has gone down. Then apply to the place one of the strengthening and absorbent plasters and bind it on; bid him keep quiet and still and sleep only in the attitude in which he has no pain, until he is well.	0.82506824
And he should not sleep except on the side that does not cause him pain until he recovers. If a splinter or something has occurred in the bone at the time of the injury, from which he has recovered, then it is necessary to incise the skin over it and extract that bone. Then bring the edges of the wound together, if it is large, with sutures, then treat with healing ointments until it heals. If the last bone of the coccyx, which is the tailbone, is broken, then it is necessary to insert the thumb of the left hand into the anus.	If the injury is accompanied by fragmentation or a separation of part of the bone, you must cut down on it and remove the bone; then bring together the edges of the opening, by suture if it be wide; then treat with granulating ointments until it heals.	0.6416043
And straighten the broken bone with the other hand as much as possible and straightening is achieved. Then apply a dressing and a splint if needed, then tighten it.	If the last bone of the coccyx, which is the sacrum of the tail, breaks, introduce the thumb of your left hand into his anus and reset the bone with the other hand in whatever way is possible and affords the best setting; then apply over it a plaster, and a splint if necessary, and bind it up.	0.6415112
If you feel a broken fragment in it, then incise over it and extract it, and treat the wound with the aforementioned treatment until it heals.	And if you perceive a fragment in the fracture, cut down upon it, remove it, and dress the wound as before said, until it heals.	0.81159055
