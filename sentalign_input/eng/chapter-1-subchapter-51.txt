 CHAPTER FIFTY-ONE.
On cauterization of boils.
 When a person gets a boil which is slow in coming to a head, either because of the superfluity causing it, or because of the patient's age if he be an elderly man lacking in blood, or because of the season, and you wish to hasten the ripening of the boil, then make a punctate burn around it with multiple small cauterizations, and then let be; it will speedily come to a head.
If you wish to perforate it with cauterization, heat the cautery of this type.
Apply it to the middle of the boil till it has pierced the skin.
The cauterization should go right to the bottom to facilitate the flow of pus.
Then dress till cured.
