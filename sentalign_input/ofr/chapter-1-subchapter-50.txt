The treatment of chancre by cautery
When a chancre appears at the beginning, and you want to stop it, cauterize it with a cautery that resembles a circle, all around the chancre.
And yet, wise men say that one should also cauterize in the middle of the chancre;
and yet, this does not seem good to me, for I fear that it will be ulcerated and corrupted, and I have seen it happen sometimes;
and it is more appropriate that it be cauterized around, with the cautery which is called "circular," as we have said about cauteries.
