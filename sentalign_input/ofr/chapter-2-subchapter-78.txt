When the afterbirth is retained after childbirth, you must instruct the patient to hold her breath, and then make her sneeze using pepper, and hold your hands over her mouth and nose; and if it comes out because of this, it is well.
If not, then take a pot, and make a hole in the lid, and put in herbs that can open the mouth of the marrow, such as calamintha, rue, anise, chamomile, birthwort and centaury; all these herbs, or some of them, should be cooked in the pot with water over the fire; then put one end of a reed in the hole of the pot, and the other end in the mouth of the marrow, and hold it there until the vapor enters the marrow; then make her sneeze, as we have said.
Then the afterbirth will come out quickly.
And if it remains after this treatment, and does not come out, instruct the midwife to moisten her left hand in sesame oil or in althaea mucilage, and then insert it into the vagina, and search for the afterbirth; and when she has found it, she should take it and pull it gently and straight, so that the marrow does not fall out during the extraction; but she must move it gently to the right and to the left, and then pull; so it will come and be released.
And if the opening of the marrow is too narrow, we have described the treatment of sneezing, and fumigation with herbs; and if it does not come out with all that we have said, be careful not to be foolish in pulling; but you must tie what is at the opening of the marrow to the woman's thigh, then give her an enema of tetrapharmacum ointment; this will rot and loosen it, and it will come out; but nevertheless, when it rots, a bad odor comes to the stomach and head, and harms the patient.
Suitable fumigations are therefore necessary for this: some of the ancients have tried fumigation with watercress and dried figs.
The form of the instrument with which one fumigates the woman for the retention of the flowers and of the afterbirth is this:
And it is made of glass, resembling a tube, and the narrow end is placed in the vagina, and the wide end over the fire; and the fumigation should be over coals, and continue until it is consumed, and start another.
