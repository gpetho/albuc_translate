On the fracture of the woman’s vulva, the pubic bone, and the man’s member.
Chapter XIX.
When a woman’s vulva is fractured, have her sit in a square position.
Then tilt her back slightly, and let her be held from behind.
Then let the midwife fill her vulva with cotton until it is full, and let it become spherical within the vulva.
Then shake the woman, and slowly lift her back.
For the cotton will come out until it is at the entrance of the vulva like a sphere, and the broken bone will return.
Then place a cushion under her back.
When she wishes to urinate, remove the cotton with ease, then let her urinate; then replace it as you first inserted it, and let her return to her original cushion.
Let her do this for seven days, or about that, for the bone itself will be restored.
And if you wish, take an eggshell bladder, and bind a reed tube over its opening, and insert the whole bladder into her vulva.
Then blow forcefully into the tube until the bladder inflates inside the vulva, for the fracture will return.
Then fill it with cotton, and let it remain for a few days, as we have described, until it heals.
And when the pubic bone of a man or woman is broken, then administer its restoration and alignment as we have described for the hip bone.
And it is not hidden that in these close fractures, which rarely occur, especially for someone with some study or practice.
And understand my book well, for the fracture itself shows you in many circumstances the proper way to its restoration and bandaging; therefore, understand.
But when the man’s member is fractured, take the neck of a goose and insert the member into it.
Then place a wrap made of cloth around it, wrap it, and let it rest for three days, or about that, and it will heal, if God wills.
