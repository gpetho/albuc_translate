Chapter thirty-one on cauterizing ascites.	CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE. On the cauterization of dropsy.	0.7864146
Cauterization is only beneficial in particular for ascites due to an obstruction.	The cautery is particularly effective in ascites.	0.7209648
If you treat the patient with ascites with the types of treatment that we mentioned in the classification, and your treatment is not effective, then it is appropriate to cauterize him with four cauterizations around the navel, one cauterization on the stomach, another cauterization on the liver, a cauterization on the spleen, and two cauterizations behind his back between the vertebrae, one facing his chest and the other facing his stomach. And the depth of the cauterization should be close to the thickness of the skin.	When you have, without effect, treated a dropsical person with the various measures mentioned in the section on diseases, you should sear with four cauterizations around the umbilicus, and one over the stomach, another over the liver, and another over the spleen, and two behind his back between the vertebrae, one at the level of the breast and one at the level of the stomach; and let the burn be almost skin-deep.	0.80020565
Then you leave the cauterization open, letting the pus flow for a long time.	Then keep the burn open so that it suppurates for a long while.	0.72665024
And do not neglect treating the patient after the cauterization with what is appropriate to combine for him the two meanings, so that healing will quickly come to him.	Do not let the patient, after cauterization, be without the necessary treatment, so that you combine both methods for him, and a cure will speedily come to him.	0.8165248
And the shape of the cautery iron with which the back is cauterized should be nail-shaped, as its image was presented previously, and the one with which the back is cauterized should be olive-shaped.	The cautery with which his belly is cauterized should be claviform like the figure previously given; while the one with which his back is cauterized should be olivary.	0.81830376
