After I have completed for you, my son, this book, which is the last of the science of medicine with its supplement, and I have ended in it from its expositions and its declarations, it has seemed good to me that I complete it for you with this treatise which is a part of operation, that is, surgery by hand.
Since operation by hand is laid out in our region and in our time entirely private: until perhaps the science of it has perished, and its track has been lost: and what remained of it are a few descriptions in ancient books, which hands have altered: and it happened to them error and hesitation, until their intentions were closed and their essence was prolonged: It seemed good to me that I would make it clear with this arrangement of this treatise according to its exposition and declaration and abbreviation: and that I would bring it into being with the forms of tools Cauterizing, and the rest of the instruments of operation: since it is necessary from its addition and its properation.
Since the cause for which a good artisan of his own hand is not found in our time: that the art of medicine is long, and it is necessary for its author to exercise himself in the science of anatomy which Galen tells, until he knows the joints of the limbs, and their forms, and their connection, and separation, and has knowledge of bones, and nerves, and ligaments, and their number, and their exit, and their pulsation, and calmness, and places of their exit: it seemed good to me that I would bring him to light with this arrangement of this treatise according to its exposition and declaration and abbreviation: and that I would provide him with the forms of tools Cauterizing, and the rest of the instruments of operation: since it is necessary from its addition and its properation.
And therefore Hippocrates said, that the name with the name is much, and with the work is little, especially in the art of hand.
We have said before at the beginning of this book.
Since he who does not know that we have said about anatomy will fall into error, in which men are formed from the science: as I saw many of them, who form themselves out of this science and boast of it without knowledge and without experience.
What is more, I saw a doctor strike an aposteme scrofulous sore on the neck of a woman, and cut some of the arteries in her neck. Wherefore the blood of the woman flowed until she died between her hands.
And I saw another doctor who took out a large stone from the entrails of a man, who had been troubled by it for a long time, and the stone was great. So he came to him, and took it out with the hook of a probe. Wherefore the man died on the third day.
And I had already been called to take it out: and I saw from the great size of the stone, and the care of the nurse, that he should die.
And I saw another doctor take a fee from our Duke's land for medicine: and there happened to be a black eunuch with him, who was standing by his heel, and the doctor, through his ignorance, bound the fracture on his thigh with narrow bands and strong sutures, and did not desist from the wound's issue.
Then he dismissed him according to his desire. Later on he dismissed him after a few days, and commanded him not to loosen the ligatures: and so he stood until the sore in his leg, and his weight, were loosed, and came to ruin.
So I was called to him: and I did what I could to loose the ligatures: and subsequently there was quietness, and his pain was eased.
However the corruption had already taken root in the member: and I could not restrain it.
So the corruption ceased to wander in the member, until he died.
And I saw another doctor who pierced an aposteme cancerous sore: and it was ulcerated for several days, until the malice of it came out with its lord.
Which is as much as to say, that when the cancer is pure from the melancholic humors, then it should not be cut out with a hot iron at all, unless it lies in a member which it bears, so that it may be cut off all at once.
And for that reason, you sons, it is necessary that you know that the operation with the hand is divided into two: namely, the operation which is associated with health and the operation with which there is danger in many dispositions.
And I have already excited in all places of this book, where the operation has come, in which there is terror and fear.
Why it is necessary for you to beware of that, and to refuse it: so that they do not find the bones broken, and the words useless.
So receive with solicitude and protection, and bring your patients with ease and strength, and let them go through the door of grace of God to salvation and a glorious succession: and remove from you the souls who make you afraid, so that they come upon you a hesitation in your faith and comfort.
For it remains more for our glory, and more gloriously in the world, and finally to your numbers.
Because Galenus has already said in some of his advices: Do not treat disease with medicine: do not call yourself a doctor.
But I have already divided this treatise into three chapters.
Chapter one: On the nature and definition of surgery.
On the cauterization with fire, and cauterization with acute medicine, on the bed, and on the form of instruments, and tools used for cauterization: and all that is necessary in the operation.
Chapter two: On the preparation of patients for surgery.
On section and piercing, phlebotomy and sanguinology, and wounds: and extraction of arrows, and similar things: and all that is contained in this chapter, ordered according to the forms of instruments.
Chapter three: On the different types of surgical instruments and tools used for surgery.
On restoration, dislocation, and cure of torsion, and similar things: ordered from the head to the feet, and on the form of instruments.
But before I recall the operation with him, I should tell you about the qualities of his cauterization and non-injury, and in what kind of face it should be performed.
I therefore say that the speech about the quality of cauterization and non-injury is a long, subtle, learned, and secretive speech.
Moreover, many wise men spoke in it, and they disagreed with each other; and enough for me of their speeches, fearing a protraction of the discussion.
I therefore say that cauterization is suitable for all kinds of faces, whether with matter or without matter: excepting two kinds of faces, which are a warm face without matter and a dry face without matter.
In a warm or dry face with matter, they disagreed. Some said that cauterization is appropriate in that case. And others said the opposite, that cauterization is not suitable in such a disease, which is of heat and dryness: for fire's nature is to be hot; and it is unsuitable, so that it should heal from a hot and dry sickness with hot and dry.
And he who said the opposite added: "But with cauterization, an injury is made in any hot or dry sickness that occurs in human bodies; for when you compare a human body and its humidities to the complexion of fire, you cool down a cold body.
And I too say by my own experience: for by experiment I have discovered that this is true sometimes.
However, it is not necessary to press on that point, unless he who has already been tried and exercised in the exercise of the chapter of cauterization knows the difference between human complexions, and the disposition of sicknesses in themselves, and their causes, and the accidents of them, and the space of time.
Do not fear the remnants of the plasters; and especially in cases of cold and wet sickness. For all doctors agree on them, and there is no difference between them and the cautery in their treatment.
And know, sons, that the secret of curing with fire and the goodness of the cautery when it is burned with medicine together is simple: for the action of fire does not reach unless to the member that is cauterized; and it does not harm another member connected to it except by little injury.
For the action of medicine burned together reaches to that which is prolonged from the members; and perhaps it causes a difficult sickness of curing in the member, and perhaps it destroys it.
But fire, because of its subtlety and goodness of its substance, does not do that, unless it runs short.
Now this has been known to us by experimentation because of the length of practice and study with art, and standing on veracity of things: and by that excuse I have taken up the length of speech.
And if it is not, because it is not allowed to this my book, I would give you the secret and mystery of fire, and the quality of its operation in bodies by its expulsion, which expels sickness with philosophical demonstration, which is achieved from the minds of your sons.
And know, sons, that they disagree at the time when the cautery is to be made, and put forward a better time for the wound.
And I say, that the cautery is to be made at any time; because, the accident that happens through time is hidden in cure, which is drawn to the cautery. And especially if the cautery is because of the necessary pains, the stronger, the feasts, which do not bear tardiness: for they are afraid from them, that the evil which is greater than a little injury happens to one who does not stand through time.
And let not that son of theirs fall in the minds of the common people and the foolish doctors, that is to say, that health which he gains through cauterization is not always restored: they set down as a consequence, and it is not so as they think; for cauterization is not unless in the art of medicine, which changes the complexion and dries up the humors which are the cause of pains, whereby those pains occur.
However, cauterization is superfluous on medicine by virtue of its speed in healing, and the power of its operation, and the keenness of its lordship: and it is possible that he recover health at some time during his illness according to the complexion and location of his disease, and the power of it: and that it was prepared in his body from an accumulation of superfluous things in him; and that it came to itself through acquisition from food, and similar causes from within, unless there is a disease in which cauterization is administered.
A subtle disease in a small member that has an excess of things and moisture, such as the pain of a tooth, because of a pain and its like; it is possible, indeed, that he not recover that pain in him. But that happens in a few things.
But the saying of the common people, that cauterization is the last resort of medicine, is true: it does not regard what they intend in him; for they believe that it is not a healing that brings with it medicine, nor anything else after the occasion of a cautery.
But the opposite of this is true, and the intention, that cauterization is the last resort of medicine, is not unless when we administer means of cure in some disease, and they do not bring those medicines: then we administer at the end of things a cautery, and it brings it; then from this it falls, that cauterization is the last resort of medicine, not according to the intention which the common people and many stupids of doctors understand.
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii. Indeed, that is not absolutely true: for I have already proven that and found that it does not do so in certain bodies without others.
And the cautery with itself is good, and better than with iron, as they said. But when you ignite the cautery in fire from gold, it is not revealed to you when it ignites according to the quantity that you use, because of the redness of gold: and when it approaches to itself the cold, and if you add ignition on it, it melts in the fire and turns into leaves.
Why does the craftsman fall from that in his work: and because of that it is made The cautery with iron with us faster and closer, out of rectitude to the work.
And I too have already arranged this Chapter on the cautery, according to the chapters: and I arranged it from the head until the feet: that you may find what you want from it.
The skull
Confirm here the cauterization to the lord of humidity and coldness over the brain: which are two causes of salt, and multitude of flow of humors from the head to the parts of the eyes and ears, and multitude of sleep, and pain of teeth, and pain of throat: and universally all sicknesses that happen from coldness, such as paralysis, and salt, and epilepsies, and apoplexies, and similar things from those illnesses.
The way of cauterization is, that you instruct the sick: that he be drained out in the first place with solute and purifying medicine the head three nights, or four, according to what the strength of the nurse requires, and his age, and his custom.
Then order him to shave his head with a razor. Then have him sit between your hands, square-shaped, so that he has placed his hands on his chest.
Then place the root of your palm on the root of his nose between his eyes. So wherever your middle finger comes to rest, mark that spot with a wisp of stubble.
Then light the cautery with olive oil: this is its form.
Then place the patient on the marked spot with the fire, descending, so that your hand squeezes his hand little by little, and you rotate it. Then quickly wipe your hand, and examine the spot.
If you see a quantity of hair come off with the bone, or a quantity of oil, then quickly wipe your hand. And if not, repeat the rubbing with the iron, or with something else if it becomes cold: until you see the bones that I told you about.
Then take some salt, and dissolve it in water, and soak it in the solution, and place it on the spot: and let go for three days.
Then place on the spot the soaked fabric in butter, and leave it on the spot until the fire has completely consumed it. Then take care of that with the tetrapharmacon ointment until it heals.
They have already said that as long as a scar remains open, it will emit pus: why is this better and more beneficial?
And some of them said, let the skin be cauterized all the way down to the bone: and hold the cautery until a certain amount of bone is burned up.
Then shave after that which has been burned from the bone, then apply ointment.
And others say that it should be done with the cautery to impress on the bone an impression like a mold, so that it falls out, which is as it should be: or an instrument that women put in infusions of alphabet: and they estimate, that from this place there are discharged the vapors of the hair of the head, and the open wound closes after a long time.
And then heal, until it hardens.
But which of these two types of cauterization do not exist at all unless in some men after the first time of fear.
And dismiss him, for me it is better with his health.
For the head is weakened by the solution of its natural continuity; as we have testified in the other members; and especially when the head is weak from nature: and the species of cauterization is first healthier and better with me; and I use that one: so operate when he is healthy.
Chapter III.
When chronic pain occurs throughout the head and is prolonged in the sick person, and he uses oil, and poultices, and ointments, and baths. And especially if it has already been cauterized with one kind of cauterization which we have described, and does not give anything to it from those: then observe. For if the head is sick with the strength of nature and is not weak, and cold is felt strongly: then cauterize under it a little with another kind of cauterization. Then cauterize the head itself over all the branches of its own cauterization, not passing through the skin, and taking off a quantity from the bone, which we have described. And cauterize the head itself with one kind of cauterization in the back of the head, in a place that is called a vein; and it is a place where there is a flowing wind; and wash your forehead in this, and you will not see bone. The sick person will have great pain because of that sharp cold: and is far from the pain of all the other types of head cauterization.
And I will call this type of cauterization in its place; and it must be that it is a cauterization with which the branches of the head are cauterized, and the back of the head is cauterized more finely with cauterization, which cauterizes the middle of the head.
Chapter IV. On the Treatment of Headaches.
When there is pain on one side of the head and soda water, or the pain extends to the eye, and the head is washed with cleaning medicines, and the remaining treatment is given as I have described in the division of illnesses, and does not completely provide for it: then cauterization is to be done according to two methods: either cauterization with sharp-burning medicine: or with iron.
The cauterization with sharp-burning medicine is, that you take a tooth of fennel, and peel it, and cut off its ends from the two sides. Then cut the area of pain at the same time with a phlebotomy blade on one side, until a spot is made under the skin where the pain is taken.
Then introduce it into that place under the skin, until it is concealed: then tie it tightly with a little bandage that descends, and leave it for fifteen hours, and then remove it, and extract it, and leave it alone for two days, or three: then put a cotton swab on the place submerged in butter, until a boil occurs: then care for the place with ointment until it heals.
And if you want to make the wound heal faster with some burning medicines which I wrote about in the 12th chapter of The Surgery Book.
But cauterization with iron is to be done in this way. The fire for cauterization, whose shape is:
And it is called the "Claw," because the shape of the head is like the shape of a claw, and there is some small eminence in the middle of it.
Then place the claw on that spot and keep your hand: and you will gently turn the iron around with speed: and the amount that is burned should be according to the thickness of the skin, such as a half of it. And I pray for your hand, that no artery may be cut and there may not be a flow of blood.
And then dip the bandage in salt water and put it on the place and leave it for three days: and then dip it with butter: afterwards treat it with ointment until it heals.
And if you see, cauterize this headache with a sharp knife second time of cauterization. And do not cut the artery for this headache, but use your own blood.
The way to cauterize in a headache of old age.
When you treat a headache, with what we have said before about the cure of the division of ailments, and that the cure is not sufficient: and you see from the disease, that it does not suffice to it what we have said about the first cauterization with medicine, or with fire, then it is necessary that you use fire of cauterization, until it turns white after the marks on the place of pain with a line, whose length is half a finger, or almost like that: and put your hand by force until you touch the artery, and reach to the mouth.
However, it is necessary that you cauterize the continued mandible which moves during chewing, so that no nerve which moves it may be cut, from which accident a spasm may happen.
And be on guard and take care of the flow of blood of the artery which has been separated. For in the dissection there is a danger, and above all to him who does not know what he is doing, and is not studious or expert: and he dismisses the operation with those first.
And I come with a reminder of the treatment of blood flow from the artery in its own way, and in its own place in this book.
That if you see from the disease that this cauterization is not sufficient for him, and you see a body which bears the cauterization in the middle of the head, as we have narrated, treat a wound, until it heals.
And if you see, apply cauterization, which we have said in the chapter on extracting an artery with a cautery having two tweezers. For cauterization is better and provides more security.
(On the method of cauterizing in ear pain.)
When pain occurs in the ear from cold, and healing with hot solutions, and the remainder of the cure as we have said in the division, and the pain does not disappear, then apply fire cauterization: and that is what is called a dot, whose shape is this.
Then the dots with it after its ignition in the circumference of the whole ear, as it heals: or in the circumference of either, if pain is simultaneous in both. And lengthen it with the cautery from the root of the ear slightly, after you have marked the places with caustic: and let the quantity of cautery be ten points throughout the ear, and almost so.
Then care for the place until it is healed.
(On the method of cauterizing in torture.)
Chapter VII.
Torcura which is cured with cauterization, is not except from the species which occur from phlegm, according to what we have said in the divisions of diseases.
And distant cauterization of a species which occurs from drying, and from spasm of a nerve.
When you cure this species of torture with oil, and with the headpurging, and with gargarisms, and your cure does not provide security, then it is necessary that you cauterize the sick three times: one near the root of the ear, and a second slightly below its place, and a third at the conjunction of the two lips.
And put your cautery on the opposite side of the weak part. For softening does not occur unless in the part which seems healthy.
And the shape of cauterization is so that it cauterizes itself at the direct extremity of the upper ear near the head's corner, slightly: and a second in the time: whose length is according to the length of the thumb. And lay your hand upon the wound with the cautery, until the quantity of half the thickness of the skin is burned up.
And this is the form of cautery, and its kind from a scalpel, whose form has been mentioned above: but it is not so fine as you see; and it should be that the scalpel have a little bit of surplus roughness.
Then take care of the place with what preceded it: until it heals.
The mode of cauterizing in ancient apoplexia.
When a person is stricken with ancient apoplexia, and take care of her as we have said before, and your medicine does not help her, and she has no fever, then cauterize her with four cauterizations on all the horns of her head, and a cautery in the middle of her head, as we have said, and a cautery in the back of her head, according to what came before: and the mode of cauterizing is according to what came before.
Also cauterize with the cautery above the mouth: and it is more last.
Then take care of the place with what preceded it.
Head IX.
It is necessary that the person should drink in the first great fever of a pill that purifies the brain.
Then shave the whole head of the patient and put on his scalp a plaster described in the book of plasters: and put it on himself sometimes.
This is the form of cauterizing: and make it according to the order which we have said above.
But if he heals by that, then it is good. But if not: then make him three cauterizations on the back of his head, which are descending from the upper part of the head to the lower part of the eye: and put between every cautery the thickness of a finger.
Then take care of the cauterizations with what preceded it.
If however you wish to add a bandage, and the patient is able to tolerate it: then apply cautery in the middle. What if you wish to add a bandage: then cauterize himself over two horns.
Then care for the wound, until it heals: and afterwards apply oil in accordance with the form given above.
§ On the method of cauterizing in paralysis and softening.
Chapter Ten.
It is necessary that you should proceed in the purification of the head with hyssop, and with that which I have said.
Then rub the head with nurse; then apply cautery in the middle of the head, and cautery over all the horns of the head, and cautery over the posterior part of it, and three over the seven vertebrae of the neck.
But if you are able to tolerate a softening of the body with many of these, and the patient is able to bear it, and the disease is strong: then apply cautery four times over the vertebrae of the back, and the last with cautery, until it burns deeply from the skin, and wash your hand. Then care for the wound, until it heals; and then apply oil in this way.
§ On the method of cauterizing in epilepsy.
The epileptic should not be cauterized unless his epilepsy arises from phlegm.
It is necessary that the purifications of his brain should be done first with hyssop, and with the other cure which I have described in the division: when the patient is great or able to bear medicines.
But if he is a boy who does not bear medicines, then administer gargling and chewing to purify the brain before many days with good food.
Then rub his head; then apply cautery with one in the middle of his head, according to the method which has gone before: and cautery with another in the back of his head, and over all the horns of his head. If he is weak but can endure, then cautery himself with the cauteriums which I spoke of when having paralysis, and softening the body over the vertebrae of the neck, and the vertebrae of the back: and let there be olive oil cautery according to the method that preceded.
But if the boy is weak, then put the fine cautery, according to this manner.
Regarding the method of cauterizing in melancholy.
When the cause of melancholy is corrupt humidity, and thick phlegm, then cautery himself with the cauteriums which we have said when having paralysis.
And if the cause of melancholy is an excess of discharge towards sadness, and the body is wet with humidity, then give him in a drink that will purify his brain, according to what preceded in division: Then scrub his head, and afterwards make a twisted rope made of linen, like a circle.
Then place it in the middle of the head: and the weak one, sitting square, should hold back from all sides.
Then present the liniment. And it is worthy of being made from old butter. And heat him on a fire with moderate heat, which he can bear when he enters into him. Then vacate him in the middle of his head in a circle, and let him go until he is frigid.
Make this weak one do this every week once, along with the rest of his good regimen, until he recovers.
Or if you want to, cautery himself by making small spots on him everywhere, except that you hold back your hand with the cauterium: but let it be smelling.
This kind of cautery humidifies the brain with its quality.
Then place on him a cloth soaked in butter, or chicken fat.
Regarding the method of cauterizing in descending water up to the eye.
Chapter XIII.
When you find that the beginning of water in the eye has appeared through the signs which I have mentioned in the division, then begin to drink and [also] give him to drink when he has cleaned his head.
And keep him away from all kinds of moisture, and make him sit in a bath, on a few days' fast.
Then tell him to shave his head, and burn it in the middle of his head. Then burn him on both sides with two torches, if the beginning of the water has occurred in both eyes at the same time: or from one side, if the beginning of the water has occurred in one eye: and cut off all the veins and arteries that are under the skin: and let the cauterization be long in width of timporum: and let it be careful of the flow of blood.
That if you see anything of it, then cut it off immediately with whatever medicine is possible: and I will come with wisdom, which is in the extraction of arteries, and their cutting off, and their care to stop the flow of blood.
And when he is burned on his skin, between two bones, with two torches at the end.
The way to burn in ancient tears.
When the tears of the eyes are old and constant, and are on the veins and arteries that are in the exterior part of the head, it is known that it is from cold and phlegmatic: then burn with the same torch which I have mentioned in the beginning of water descending, burn with fire in the middle of the head, and two torches on both sides, and two torches on the skin under two bones. And if he is not used to addition, then burn him on all sides with careful eye, at the end of the eyebrow with a small torch.
The way to burn in foul smell of the nose.
When you are treating it, with what I have mentioned in the division, and the treatment does not work: then get closer, and give him three cups of wine to drink in a day: then shave his head, and burn it with fire in the middle, with an olive torch. Then he cauterized himself with two clavi of cautery, over two eyebrows between the hairs a little.
And watch out for the artery, lest you hit it.
This is the way to do cauterization with a clauvium.
The method of cauterizing in the softening of eyelids:
When the eyelid of the eye is softened by disease or moisture: then cauterize the eyelid with one clauvium, with this clauvium lunar.
And if the person is blind, then cauterize himself on both eyebrows a little with two clavi of cautery in all parts: and they are stretched from both sides: and the length of each cauterium, according to the length of the eyebrow: and do not place your hand with the cautery, except by measuring how much it burns the third eyelid.
The method of cauterizing the eyelid when the hair are turned inward stinging the eye:
The cauterium is second to two ways: either a cauterium with fire: or a cauterium with burning medicine.
In the cauterium with fire, however, you should instruct the sick person beforehand, so that he does not have his hair on him, if it is from those who clean them, until they grow out and become smooth. But if it stings him at the edge of his eye: then squeeze his eyes with viscous fluid so that they do not blink until they are grown.
When they are grown and become smooth, then place the head of the patient in your lap: and then mark on the eyelids of his eyes with a brand, a mark that is according to the shape of the leaf of myrtle: and let the beginning of the mark be near the hair.
Then place a moistened cloth made of wool on his eye: or a cloth dipped in psylli mud over the eye.
Then the fire cautery, whose form is this.
Then cauterize over the figure, which you have indicated gradually on many pieces, until it is burnt to the skin surface, which is like the shape of a myrtle leaf, all apparently itself.
And the sign of the work of your skill is: if you squeeze the eyelids of the eye already shut, and take off the hair near the eye.
So then bless your hand: and dismiss these tribes after a few days.
Then put on the patch with butter over it until the eschar is removed. Then care for the wound with ointment until it heals.
That if any of the hairs return after an hour, and the eyelid becomes soft: then once again apply the cautery to that place, as you did at first.
But if the hairs are in the lower part: then cauterize that very place, until it turns to its own natural place: and adjust so that the hairs of the eye do not sting.
It is as you command for the sick person: that he should abandon hair, until it becomes prolonged and even. Make in the shape of a myrtle leaf from paper.
Then take from the known soap, and from the untinged limestone of one pound or nearly that weight: then dry it all together with good stirring, and make it with haste, so as not to grow cold. Then from this take the bandage and put it over the paper which you have made as the shape of a myrtle leaf, and put it on one or both eyelids. And put under the eye a patch soaked with almond milk: and let the head lie in your lap.
Then put your index finger on the medicine, and press the patch slightly. And you will move the patch whenever the sick person feels the tingling of the medicine: for its tingling is like fire.
And so, when he had persisting in what he himself found out about mordicatio, then let go of medicine, and move it with your own finger. And so, when the mordicatio has quieted down, then remove the medicine, and wash the eye with water.
And then, if you see the eyelid lifting up, as if lifted up by fire or by incision, it is good: and if not, then repeat on top of it from medicine on the place where it does not print, and does not worsen, until your operation is satisfied, and the eye closes.
Then put over it Cotum with butter, until the skin of the irritation has been removed. Then care for the eye with diaphanous ointment, or another one, until healed.
And it is necessary for you near the operation, as a guardian of the last guard, so that nothing falls into the eye from the medicine.
That if the eyelid softens after a few days, and struggles with some hair in the eye, then repeat the medicine on that place which softens from the eyelid of its own, as you did in the first. Then care for the eye, until healed.
And this is the form of the leaf of myrrh.
And you should know that human eyes differ in size and shape. Therefore, according to this, your consideration should be: and may not close the path of its straightness, which is the study of this art.
On the mode of cauterizing in the tear fistula.
When you treat the fistula, with what we have said in the divisions of illnesses, and your treatment does not help: then it should be cauterized in this way.
Advise the sick person to put his head in your lap, and hold his head between your hands so that it does not move or shake with its own head.
Then put over the eye of the patient Cotum infused in alum, or in silic gel on the eye: then apply fire cautery, whose form is this.
Sit concauum, sicut forma cannae; pennae uulturis ab extremite una, cum qua fit cauterium: et si vis sit penetrans usque ad extremitatem aliam, et si vis sit sursum sic tenta.
Sit concavum, as the shape of a spear's shaft with its point facing one extreme, where cauterization occurs: and if the blade extends to the other extreme,
Then insert a tube, if it is open, and extract the matter from it, and dry it out: and if it is not open, then open it, and extract the pus.
Then place cauterization on it, which is set ablaze vigorously.
And hold your hand slightly away from the cauterization, at the eye's edge, so that your hand does not wander or shake: and place the cauterization in the adipose tissue of the eye, and destroy it.
If then you apply the cauterization to the tip of the tongue from the beginning up to the mouth, it will be good. And if not: then repeat the cauterization once, or twice, if you can bear it: and dismiss it after three days.
Then place cotton with butter on it, and attend to the wound with a drying ointment, until it heals.
If however after forty days it is not healed: then place on it an acute corrosive medicine, until the mouth is detected: and cut it according to what comes out in its own chapter.
And there is another method of cauterization with a tube, which some said first. Then approach the place of the tube, and find it: then place in it a small hole, that is, a thin cannula, whose shape is this one. And pour into it a quantity of liquid lead, and hold your hand with the cannula so that it does not move at all, so that it does not run, or get the liquid lead to his eye.
And it should be placed on the eye an infirm cotton cloth steeped in milk, or in water.
Lead indeed burns the place of the fistula, and it heals itself with a wonderful cure.
For if the fistula is healed, together with that which I said from the Treatment and Cure, it is good. And if not, then it is necessary to administer the nostril opening, and reduce the fistula to its own course of the nose, according to how it comes in its own place.
Regarding the method of cauterizing in fistulas of the lips.
Fissures often occur on the lip, which are called hairs, and most especially on the lips of boys.
When you treat these fissures, together with that which I said concerning the distribution of ailments, and there is no cure, then a small paring iron of fire cautery, according to this form.
And let it rest in the shape of the knife's sharpness.
Then place the freshly sharpened knife rapidly on the cracks, until the fire reaches to the depth of the cracks.
Then treat the whole with cerussae, until it is healed.
Regarding the method of cauterizing in the mouth fistula.
When the apothema occurs in the gingival root, or in the palate, or in the roots of the teeth: then it pus and bursts: afterwards it dries up, and the pus runs, and a fistula forms: then treat the fistula, and there is no cure for it, then let fire cautery take place according to its quantity that takes place in the fistula. Then introduce the fire into the fistula's opening, and hold your hand, until the iron is burned to its depth, and the last part: do this once, or twice.
Then treat the whole after that, up to the time when it is healed, according to what I said concerning the cure until it is healed.
If then the slough comes off, and is healed, it will be good. And if not, then it is necessary to grasp the place and remove the corrupt bone according to what comes to its head.
About the method of cauterizing in gingivae and softening teeth.
When the gingiva is softened by moisture and the teeth move and do not yield to medicines, then place the injured head in your lap.
Then the fire-cauterization, of which shape you will make after these things, so that you put the cannula over the tooth: and hastily insert the ignited cautery into it: and hold your hand somewhat, until the sick one feels the heat of the fire already reaching to the root of the tooth.
And wash your hand: then repeat the cautery a few times, as you wish.
Then the sick one shall fill his mouth with salt water and keep it for an hour: and he shall spit it out.
For the tooth is made steady by movement, and the softened gingiva is drawn together, and the corrupt moisture is dried up.
About the method of cauterizing in toothache.
When the toothache is due to coldness, or coldness is in it, or the gums are swollen, and the medicine does not yield to treatment: then there are two ways of cauterization: or cauterization with butter: or cauterization with fire.
But the cautery of it is with butter, that you take bright butter, and heat it up in an iron pot, or in a vessel. Then take a cotton ball, and hold it over the end of the tongue. Then submerge the one in melted butter: and place the one on the tooth that hurts quickly, and hold it until it is cool: then repeat the one a few times, until the power of fire has reached to the root of the tooth.
And if you wish, submerge the wool, or a cotton ball in cold butter, and place the one on the tooth that hurts: and place over the one an iron bar with fire, until the fire has reached to the bottom of the cavity of the tooth.
Cauterization, however, with fire is, so that you understand towards a pipe of air, or a pipe of iron. And sit on his body some kind of thickness, so that the sharpness of fire does not reach the throat of the nurse.
Then put fire on the cautery, whose shape has come: and place it on his tooth: and hold your hand, until the cautery is cooled down.
Make it sometimes, because the pain will be removed, or on that same day, or on another day.
And it should be impressed on the cautery so that it fills the mouth of the sick person with good broth and holds it for an hour: then he spits it out.
This is the form of the cautery.
Cauterize with any extremity as is possible: and this is the form of the cannula.
The mode of cauterizing in strophuls.
When strophae are of phlegm, and from cold humours, and are not obedient to digestion by medicines, and want speed in their digestion: then put on a cautery of fire, whose shape is this.
Has two open extremities so that the smoke of the cautery goes out from the other extremity: and put the burnt part on the apostema once, and secondly, if you can bear it, until it penetrates into the depth of the abscess.
That if the apostema is small: then put the cautery second according to the quantity of the abscess.
Then dismiss him for three days, and put on his body a poultice in broth, until the burning by fire is removed.
Then take care of the man with oil for toothache, until he is healed of the form of the cannula.
The mode of cauterizing in a hoarse voice, and a tight chest:
When the humidities mount on the lung canal, and especially when it is with a cold complexion, then it should be emptied of the sick person at first by means of dissolved medicines.
Then he cauterizes the wound at the root of the throat in a depressed place; and let him not come into contact with the cautery on the throat or skin, unless with some of his own flesh.
Then he cauterizes the wound with another cautery at the neck joint in the last part of the spine, at the end thereof; and let the cautery be cloved, according to the mode which has preceded.
Then he takes care of the wound with that which has preceded, until it is healed.
The way of cauterizing in diseases of the Lung and Cough.
When Cough and disease of the Lung are due to cold humors, and the patient has no fever nor consumption, and the disease is old: then he cauterizes the wound with two cauteries above the joint in depressed places, lightly, carefully. And with another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two nipples; and let the cautery be a cane, according to the mode which has preceded.
And if your cauterization is to be by piercing with the cautery, which is called a Point, of the same form as was used in piercing the pain of the ears; and let there be points from twenty to almost thirty.
Then he takes care of the wound with that which has preceded, until it is healed.
And now let there be a cautery with three branches: according to this form. Why does the application of the cauterization, when you make with it a one-three cauterization, allay?
Chapter 27: The Head.
When the aid-giving hand is dislocated due to moisture, and does not return to its place from the dislocation within a certain hour of time, unless it becomes used to that state of rest; and then, by a slight motion, which we have already described, it should be reduced. Then the sick person was laid on his back, or on his sound side. And then he opened the skin wound, which is in the inner part of the titulus with your left fingers: and if the stitch has come loose to the inside.
Then he took the cautery fire, which has two tips. Whose shape is this.
Then he cauterized the skin wound until it penetrated to another side, and the shape of the cauterization with four cauteries.
And when the cauterization is done with a cautery having three tips, why does the shape of the cauterization then become six cauteries: and the tips are according to the subtlety of the tentacle.
And this is the form of the cautery having three tips.
And when one is added to this way, why are there eight cauteries.
Then he put on the cautery crushed husks with salt. Then he did to attach the sick person's tranquility, so that he does not move a member at any time, until he is comforted.
And if the dislocation is to the top, and this rarely happens, then he cauterizes himself over the shoulder with a knuckle cautery, or with many points by puncturing.
For the joint is secured, and moisture is removed: and the sick person is healed.
The way to cauterize the stomach.
When it happens in the stomach cold and great moisture, until they take out from his skin, and increase the drops to his body, and the methods of cure, and does not fit: then let the sick person lie down on his back, and extends his legs, and his hands. Then he cauterized with three cauteries, cautery under the cochlea of the chest to the quantity of a finger's knuckle, and two cauteries below on either side of the chest cautery one, until the shape of the cauterization becomes a triangular one. And stretch out between both so that they do not join together, when they make pus.
And let the depth of the incision be three times the thickness of the skin in width.
And let the form of the incisions be as follows without addition: and if you want to make a large burn with a large cauldron in the middle of the stomach following this form: and let the cauldron that is thus made follow this form in the shape of a circle.
And let the stomach be burned by touching it with a burning object that makes one shiver from this burn; and it is so that the sign is placed on the stomach according to the quantity you want with fire: then let the one who burns it with the burning object touch it: then take care of it with the cure that preceded it until it heals.
Regarding the way to burn the cold part.
When it happens in the epigastrium that there is pain from cold and wet, or from a thick wind, until it exits from his natural complexion with excess secretions, and the sick person is cared for with what we have said, and does not profit in him: then let the sick person lie on his back on his skin, and make three signs with fire according to this form and this quantity over the lower Spar (spine) from the hypochondria, where it reaches the bed of man: and let there be a space that is between each burn according to the length of the finger: and let the burn following the length of the body: and do not press your hand much with fire.
And let the quantity that is burned be from the thickness of the skin, a half of it not added: and let the sick person stand on his feet.
But if he is not standing, then let him lie down, who has already extended his legs and raised his arms.
This is the form of burning.
And you too can do this burn with a small knife when there is subtlety and wisdom with you in the art.
And guard you, lest you proceed too far in the cauterization, and the pus of the skin of all the body endureth, whereby the whole body endureth, and cometh to the bowels: for the skin is there thin, know therefore that.
The method for cauterizing liver abscesses.
When an abscess has formed and you need to know if it is in the liver or in the lining of the liver (the peritoneum): then if it is in the liver, you will observe a pain that is dull and without acute symptoms: and if it is in the lining of the liver, you will notice a very painful pain: and you will now see that the treatment of these by doctors is useless.
It is necessary that the sick one lie on his back. Then, with a mirror, determine the location of the abscess: then, with fire, cauterize so that it is absorbed by radiation. And this is its form. And cauterize with it once, until the whole skin is burned, and comes to the siphum, until it discharges all the pus: then take care of the cure of these abscesses, until it heals.
And it is not necessary that this cautery be used except for the purpose of those who have studied medicine in depth: and by whose hands such ailments are sometimes treated with experiment: then, indeed, dare thought to such an operation.
But if you wish to give it up, it is better with me.
The method for cauterizing pleurisy.
The ancients said: the cautery with roots of aristaochia is used for pleurisy in this way. And it is: to receive the roots of aristaochia dry, a long one, which is found in it, and make it as thick as the thickness of a finger. Then immerse it in oil: and set fire to it on a fire. Then cauterize with one cautery in him who is between the furrow of the fork and the neck, and two small cauteries under the chin a little inclined to the side which is under the beard.
And two cauteries also in him who is between the fifth and sixth ribs inclined to the rear a little: and one cautery also in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach. And three cauteries from behind: one in him who is between the two claws; and two cauteries from the sides of the chest, lower cautery which is between the two claws.
And it is not necessary that you should compress your hand with the cautery, but rather let it be in plain sight on the skin smelling.
And some ancient ones have said that from men who use a cautery made of iron of similar length: and they light it, and put it inside him who is between the ribs until it reaches to the pustule, and the pus comes out: as we have said in the pustule of the liver.
But in this piercing with the cautery there is fear that either the weak man dies immediately or a fistula occurs in the place which does not heal.
Regarding the method of cauterizing the spleen - Chapter III.
When you are curing the sickness of the spleen - as we have said above in the division of the diseases - and your treatment does not help, then there are three ways of cauterizing it, all of which are correct.
Of which one is that you should make three cauteries or four in a line according to the length of the spleen according to the figure of the cauteries of the liver, whose predecessor was the figure.
And between all the cauteries should be there an amount of gruel of a finger, or a little less.
And there should be a mode of cautery  - which we have said above in the cautery of the liver  - equal.
Do not compress your hand with the cautery  - let the sick man lie on his back.
And another mode of cauterization is: so that the fire of the cautery has two sides, which we said in the chapter on shoulder dislocation: and dry up the skin, which is in the direct splenus, where it reaches the bed of the sick on the left: and make your elevation sit, as you dry up the skin according to the width of the body, so that the cauterization falls according to the length of the body.
Then introduce two hot wands so that they penetrate the skin on both sides: then remove the fire: so that there are four cauterized places.
And if you want to cauterize with another fire having three wands.
Then, after you have removed the fire, if the pus is not expelled in many days: for what remains of the cure is more effective than what has gone before from the treatment.
The way to cauterize in the Hydropsis.
The fire does not fall in Hydropsis unless it is raised properly.
When you treat the Hydropsis with the methods of treatment which we have described in the division, and there is no effect from the cure, then you should cauterize four times around the navel, and once on the stomach, and once on the liver, and once on the spleen, and twice behind the vertebrae, and one on the front of the stomach, and another on the back: and make the depth of the fire approximate to the thickness of the skin.
Then remove the fire, so that it emits pus after a long time.
And do not drink any water in which there is an infusion from the cure after cauterization with it: for two intentions should be united to it, and it will hasten to recovery with the help of God.
The form of the fire when the abdomen is cauterized, should be open: following the form which has gone before: and its form when the back is cauterized, should be round, following the form which has gone before.
To cauterize the feet and thighs.
When they are put out in the hydroptic, and become filled with yellow water; it is necessary that you should cauterize over the back of the foot in the nocrati, which is between the auricular and the ring: and wash your hand with the cautery, and do not turn it: then wash your hand: and do not return it at all.
For if the water becomes yellow, and the place is cauterized in this way, let the cautery be held according to this form.
Then let two cauteries be made on the two thighs, and let the cautery be held with the edge of the knife-point of the cautery: and let the cautery be made according to the length of the leg, one under the knee, and the other below that by about a third of the way down: and let two cauteries be made on all the back; and let the cautery be left open for a long time without cura: so that it may be cured from it some water: then care for the wound with the rest that we have said.
The way to cauterize in the solution of the belly.
Chapter 35.
When the belly is resolved from cold and moisture, until the virtues of retention and digestion fail, which are in the stomach and intestines: and cure it with the mode of curing, and does not heal: and you shall see a weak bearing up the exuberant power of the cure, then cauterize him with a large cautery over his stomach, according to that which preceded in the cauterization of the stomach with a circular cautery, and four small cauteries around the navel, with a sharp-edged cautery: and a large cautery over the alcatins, or two cauteries.
And if you see the moisture exuberant, and a weak bearing that thing, then cauterize him with a cautery over the pelvis, and a cautery over all the loins: and perhaps you shall add two small cauteries next to the large one in the stomach.
For cure is perfect to one whose art is not at fault.
The mode of cauterizing hemorrhoids.
Chapter 36.
When there are many old hemorrhoids, or one, and they are of gross humor, cold, or corrupt humors, and they are treated with that which we have said in the division, and the cure does not take place: then cauterize three cauterizations on the lower spine of the back under an amiodia somewhat triangular, and a cauterization under the navel almost two fingers.
And if you consider that his stomach is cold, and his food is not digested, and you see that his face is drawn, then cauterize him on the stomach with a large cautery, according to what has preceded: and cauterize on his spleen, and another on his liver, with a clove cautery: and leave the cautery open for some time: then take care of him, until he is healed.
Chapter 37.
When you separate the arterioles, then set fire to the cautery that is absorbed by radiation. Then introduce the fire into the arterioles that have been separated: and with your last hand, until the cautery reaches the opening of the anus, from which runs blood: do it once, or twice.
If then there are many arterioles, then cauterize each one with a cautery, according to what we have said. Then take care of them, with the ointment that is given to them, until they are healed.
And if you cauterize him with a large cautery on the inner side of the thigh, it is more final in its effect.
The mode of cauterizing the fistula in the anus.
Chapter 38.
When the sick person does not submit to the section and to the operation that we have described in its place, and shudders at it, perhaps he will be healed with a cautery.
So then when anyone has a fistula, and it is old, pus runs out of it, and there are corrupted wetnesses. It is worthy that you should probe it with great caution, when you try it out. Then recognize the depth of its quantity, when you try it out.
Then set a fire as a caustic that is similar to the ray. Then introduce yourself with fire into the fistula itself and recognize the quantity in which it enters.
And repeatedly apply the caustic to her, until all those corrupt bodies are burned out, once, or twice, or three times, according to the quantity of your need.
And beware of any burning of the nerve, if it is there, or of great veins: or if the fistula leads to the womb, or to the intestine, then beware of all these places.
And do not make this unless the fistula is in a fleshy place: and think that it does not penetrate.
Then take care of the place until it heals.
But if that place is sealed, and materials are cut off from it, and remains so for a long time: then know that he has now been completely healed.
And if they do not cut off the materials from it, then know that it is penetrating, or that there is a corrupted opening into its depths, or something like it: whose recollection will remain in its place.
The way to apply the caustic to the renal region.
When pain from cold or gross wind has occurred in the kidneys, and has been alleviated by lying down, then it is necessary to apply the caustic to the back above the kidneys, applying the caustic to each kidney with a claudent, whose recollection came first.
And perhaps we have cauterized that one again in the same place. Why would three lined marks be seen? So then they will be last in healing.
To cauterize the vesica.
When weakness and softenings occur in the bladder from cold and moisture, so that the patient does not retain urine, then cauterize the affected area at the bottom of the scrotum above the bladder, where the hair begins to form a tuft, and cauterize with one instrument on the right side and another on the left: and let the length of the cauterization correspond to the length of the thumb nail: and cauterize below with two instruments if you can bear it: and let the cautery be placed according to that which came before.
The way to cauterize the uterus.
When cold and moisture occur in the uterus, and it is prevented from becoming pregnant, and her menstrual periods are interrupted, and there is a delay in the appearance of her symptoms, and pain occurs for her during intercourse, then three cauterizations should be applied around the navel as we have said in the cauterization of the bladder, and one cauterization above the hernia on the lower back, or two cauterizations: and let the cautery be placed with the claw.
The way to cauterize the anus in a dislocation.
When moist secretions flow from the anus, and there is a cause for its exit at its place: its sign is that the crusts last longer on one side when they are face to face; and the site of the dislocation is found to be empty.
Then let the sick person be cauterized over the anus with a similar circle of cautery: after you have noted the signs with the cauterization around the anus as it moves away: and let it fall into the middle of the circle.
If this cautery is not present with you, then cauterize the person with three cauterings, with a large olive cautery: and let the depth of the cauterization correspond to the thickness of the skin all over.
Then the care for him, until he is healed.
The way to cauterize in sciatic nerve.
When it happens that there is pain in the foot of the leg, and there are causes for its coldness and moisture: the sick person should be treated with him, which we have said in division, and there is no cure, and it becomes old: then it is necessary that you free the sick from gross humors with bitter pills or with artificial pills and others. Then cauterize him.
And the way of cauterization in it is according to two ways: either with cauterizing with burning medicines, or with fire.
Cauterizing with fire, is according to many ways.
Of which one is, that he cauterizes over the sciatic nerve of himself three triangular cauteries, according to this form. And make them a good depth, or bad. And there should be space that is between every cautery of quantity of the finger: and there should be a cautery of olive oil.
When then it is made cautery in the middle on top of the sciatic nerve of himself. Why are there four cauteries?
And if you want to cauterize with a circle, of which the shape that precedes in cauterizing dislocation of the sciatic nerve, one: so that it is a circle containing all the sciatica.
And burn the spiciness of skin of the whole.
This is the way of cauterization in the sciatic, when the pain clings to the sciatic itself, and does not extend up to the hip and the thigh.
But if it extends up to the hip and the thigh, then cauterize him with two cauteries on top of the hip, on the place where the pain is, and cauterize your own with a knife four-finger wide towards the back side slightly: and let the cautery be a scalpel.
And let the depth of the cautery be according to the depth of spiciness of skin.
If the patient complains that the pain extends to near the toes, then cauterize him at that place with the cautery of a point, triangle, or square, or more, if he needs it.
And if he complains of pain under the knee towards the thigh, then cauterize him there with one knife cut.
And let your cautery be so that you do not end up with the cautery on this [part of the body] so that it burns nerves, or a large artery, and does not pull [the flesh] out through it for a bad injury, or contraction.
And I have seen one and the other who cauterized above the knee, and finished the cautery, and the thigh blew up until the tumor was joined to the foot, and it was全部穿孔，和完全腐烂：然后发生解脱风，然后是死亡。
If the pain is in two parts at the same time, cauterize each one according to this way.
And some wise men said about this method of cautery: Make a similar cut from iron, whose diameter is half of the palm's diameter: and it should be at the opening of its finger according to the size of the finger nail, or less [than that]: and inside this small one there should be another small one.
And there should be a space between each small one according to the quantity of the thumb nail: and the slits on both sides should be: and their height should be almost like a knot, or two knots: and let them make handgrips out of iron that is off-center in the slits.
Then let it be ignited in fire until it turns red and drops sparks: then let it be placed on a plate of paste over the patient lying down on the sound side. Then cauterize him with three round cauteries in one line.
Then let go of him after three days. Then paste with butter: and leave the broken bone open for many days. Then care for himself with ointment, until he is healed.
Says Albucasis, with this species of cautery on his son, we little use, because of the terror of the appearance: and therefore, since we have few who wait on him.
Indeed it is from good cauterizations that he suffers, and remains with him at his place.
But the cautery when they have the doctors present, so that you make two holes in which comes down the pin of his door from bronze, or iron, the length of his walls: whose height are the two knots, or almost themselves.
And let there be a space that is between each the quantity of grossness of a finger, and may be open lower and upper: and may contain itself on both sides, according to this form.
Then put it on top of a pan of clay, the sick lying on the sound side. And compress your hand over the pan of clay much. Then pour between the two circles of hot water, which is warmed with fire just a little, and hold it for a quantity of time: and may the sick bear the mordication, and his own burning, because he finds the mordication like fire, until he is quiet.
Then wash your hand with an instrument, and wipe off the hot water from all entirely with sweet water: then leave it for three days.
And put on top of it butter, until the blackness of burning moves away: and leave it for a few days, and let run out from it pus. It is indeed the latest in healing.
Then care for that with ointment, until he is healed.
That if the pain extends to the hip, or leg: let him have a standing in it that holds water, according to what you did on the broad one.
And this is the method for hot and cold water: I have already written about it in my treatise on rectifying medicines. Take the alkaline and put a part of it with the unextinguished calceum together in one half of a new jar whose lower part has a small hole; add the quantity needed for the medicine to the other half: then put the second half under the bottom of the jar; pour clean water on the alkaline and calceum, which should submerge both by finger depth; after that, compress them with your hand well; then set aside the jar until the sharp water in the lower part of the jar has dropped.
Then mix all together, and pour it over the other calceum; and set aside, until it has congealed again.
For this will then be very strong in sharpness, which is given to it in many medicinal operations, and in the cauterization of the remaining members. Since it makes an effective operation through its own fire.
And from the medicines are, with which they cauterize wide areas, also like thalidomyne, and honey of oak, and calcine mixed with soap, so that both are mixed together.
And Galen himself has told us that a certain man from ancient times, who was cured of the pain of the ankle and sciatica, said that it was very effective. And he said that he did not prefer any other cure, and that he was cured from one joint only, until he told us, that perhaps he entered a relaxing bath and came out already well.
And this is how to take the oil from the seed of the wild carrot; and if it cannot be found, it is collected like this: with a little fat, and put on the ankle where there is pain, or in the groin, or in the thigh: bind it, and leave it for a few hours, or as much as the sick person feels tired from the heat. Then introduce him to the bath.
When his body therefore begins to feel hot, introduce him into the bath. For the pain has subsided and he is healed.
And you should know that it is not necessary to use any medicine on these patients unless after they have been evacuated.
And Dioscurides, who said that when cow dung is applied as a lotion to the sciatic pain it will heal: and it becomes a lotion in this way. The wool is dried, and old oil is absorbed, and it is placed on a deep place, which is between the thumb of the foot and the heel, and it is closer to the heel.
Then take cow dung dried up, and add old oil, and set it on fire, until it becomes a coal.
Then put the coal on the wool and leave it, until it is extinguished. Then repeat this. Do not therefore cease to do this, until the sense of touch reaches up to the middle, and the pain rests.
And this method of cauterization is called Vaccine Cautery.
§ On the cauterization of back pain.
When back pain occurs for various reasons, or from a cause, or from a blow, or from excessive discharge (of the fluid), and such like; but the cauterization is not performed unless it is done in this way alone, which is made by an infusion of cold material.
Therefore after the discharge of nurses with feeble pills, and such like, that they may be placed on the back, where there is pain, three lines are drawn in the width of the alme (the spine), and then, having marked the line with caustice, five cauterizations or more are made according to the quantity which comes from the power of the nurse: and let the cauterization be made with a cautery-針.
And if you want, make three cauterizations or four with the cautery-针, following this form.
To cauterize in incised wound of gibbosity.
This disease frequently occurs in infants.
And the sign of its incipient beginning in boys is this: for it comes upon him a stricture in the loins during defecation, and movement, and swelling at the last spine of the back and the knotted joints, which have already begun to protrude above the other spines.
So when you see this, and if you are able to do so, then cauterize it with a cauldron, since it is in the form of a circle.
And he takes the cauldron over all the spine equally: and if you wish to cauterize around the spine with a cauldron of two or three dots: and the dots are close to one another.
Then care for the place, until it heals well with him that we have said.
And do not administer the cauldron to gibbosity, which occurs in a spasm of a nerve.
The way to cauterize for gout, and joint pains.
When the pains of joint-trouble are due to cold moistures that spread to any member of the body, then when pains occur in the feet, it is the custom of physicians to call it "Podagra" properly.
So when this "Podagra" due to cold is cured by the usual methods of treatment, and the pains do not recur, then remove them with the cauldron.
And it is as though it cauterized him after evacuation around the joint of the feet with many caulers: and let the cauler be Oleum.
And if you can tolerate it so that the dots on the face of the foot do not bother you, then let them be with a dot of cauldron. That if they ascend to the knees or other joints and often occur: then cauterize him over all the knees with three caulers, or four from every part, with this same cauldron of Clavius.
But if you need more of this medicine, then cauterize him. And don't submerge your hand with the cauterizing fluid, but rather let it be surrounded by the thickness of the skin alone.
But if the pains rise to the knees and back: then administer what we said about the cauterizing fluid in its own chapter.
That if the pains are only in the hands, then prick around the joints with fire, as they run in two lines.
But if the remaining pain is in the fingers, then prick them, over every knot a dot, and over the palm of the hand.
But if the pains rise after days to the elbows, or to the shoulders, then cauterize both from every part.
And don't let a sick person recover from good treatment, or receive medicine again. For if the regimen is made good, and the phlegm is drained, it will be healed with the help of God by this cauterizing fluid.
On the Mode of Cauterizing in Ruptures.
When a rupture occurs in the groin, and descends the intestines, or touches the testicle, and it begins to come near: then you should order the sick person to dismiss his food on that day of its own accord. And let him use laxatives, so that the feces may descend from his bowels.
Then have him sit between your hands on his back: and order him to hold his breath, until he emerges, or shows the testicle, or the intestines.
Then reduce him with your fingers, and mark with a caustice under the rupture over the top of the spine, with a mark whose extremity is like the middle of a circle to the upper part of the body.
Then set fire to the cauterizing fluid, whose form this is, until it becomes white, and let it spurt drops. Then reduce the intestines, or the testicle to its concavity. Then let the assistant place his hand on the spot so that it does not move out of the intestine: and you have already opened between the ribs of the patient, and placed underneath him a towel, and one servant serves behind his ribs, and another over his chest who holds the hands.
Then put the caustic on the spot with your hand holding it steady. And hold him, until you make him follow with his jaw: or else repeat with him a different push, if you do not succeed with him in the first place up to the mouth.
And carefully observe that at the time of your caustic there is no exit of the intestine, so that you do not burn it and it comes out through it onto the sick or a great disease.
And know that when you do not succeed with your caustic in making a hole in the mouth, your operation is of no avail.
And it should be that the caustic for infants is subtle, according to their measure.
Then care with the rest of the ointment, until he heals.
And let the sick person lie on his back for forty days, until the wound is closed.
And it should be that you put for him food according to the length of his cure, which relaxes his stomach: so that he does not lose the intestine by straining and vomiting.
And when he wants to get up after forty days, then give him a loosely made bandage, and let him wear it for another forty days.
And let him rest from work, and be filled with food and drink, and loud speeches.
For when he uses this regimen, he heals by a whole healing.
And I will tell you the cure of ruptures with an incision in its chapter.
When, however, ruptures occur in the rest of the udder, and they are beginning to develop, and do not add to them, then cauterize the rupture of his caustic round according to its quantity: and let it be as if it were burnt from then on like the third one. Then care for himself, as we have said: and do not add to it.
And others first said: that it be cauterized with a triangular cautery, according to this form.
Afterwards sign it withencaustum, and place a line which is of the width of a finger on the back upper part of the Ruptura, and another line to the lower side. And place your hand in the middle with the cautery clاوی.
But the cautery first is easier and better.
The way of cauterizing in pains because of a fall, or a blow.
Chapter LVIII.
When it happens in some member with a fall, or a blow; and that pain persiste for a long time, and does not respond to treatment with medicines: then it should be cauterized with a Pointed cautery.
And let the cautery be of the size of the member, and its health, and its weakness, and its strength, and its location, and the pain from it.
But if he is healed with the first cauterization, then it is good. If not: then repeat on top of the same cautery.
For the custom of these pains is that they should change from one member to another as it approaches that which it affects. Why it should be necessary to make them follow those with a cautery, until the sick is healed.
The way of cauterizing in leprosy:
But the leprous ones are to be cauterized with a big cautery. And especially the type of leprosy which is due to putrefaction of phlegmas and melancholy; when then you consider the skin as it concerns the cauterization.
If then leprosy is not resistant to the treatment which we have said in the division, and has not descended, nor stayed in place: and if it times on the sick part, which comprehends corruption all over its complexion: then cauterize him over the head with five cauteries: one on the middle of the hairline, and a second lower towards the front at the end of the hair, and two on either side, and one behind the ear on the cheek.
And last, with your hand and cautery, until it has impressed in the nose a purple mark, and the membranes are dislocated from it; so that the expiration of the steam of the great lungs may be relieved, and the cautery also on the spleen, as it had preceded.
But if the leprosy has already spread over the sick person and appears clearly; then it is necessary to make the following cautery with these very cauteries which we have said in the head, and a cautery on the tip of the nose, and two cauteries on the two cheeks, and two cauteries on the two neck joints, and six on the spine of the back, and one large one at the base of the tail and one above it: and two on the shoulders, and two on the elbows, and two on the breasts, and a cautery on the whole body from the joints of the fingers of his hands and feet: and a cautery on each heel of his feet, and tiny pieces of flesh from the knuckles of his hands and feet: and a cautery on each heel of his feet, and small pieces of flesh from the knuckles of his hands and feet: and a cautery on each elbow joint, and two cauteries on each shoulder, and two cauteries on the two breasts, and one large cautery on the spleen.
And let there be a nervy thread over the very heel of your foot, so that you do not burn them.
And when one is cauterized with a cautery on the top of the chest bone, and another on the stomach bone, and another on the liver.
And you must know that whatever amount of cautery you use, it is more helpful, and gives greater relief.
And you must know that the sick person does not feel pain in the cautery, as he feels it when he is healthy: for this reason his body has already become numb.
And let the cauteries be of the same size and shape as the joints and members: since it has preceded in the appearance of the instruments.
Then care for the cauteries with flour of herbs mixed with honey, and with other cure; until he is healed.
To cauterize while unconscious.
When a limb is numb and does not respond to medicines, oils, plasters, or poultices, then cauterize the limb with cautery, according as the magnitude of the limb is great, or its smallness.
And place your cautery instrument a little way into the depth of the skin. Then care for the limb with ointment until it heals.
And sometimes cauterization is done to a certain numbness that occurs in the hand or foot, at the exit of nerves that move that limb: and the numbness disappears.
But do not do it too much, unless one is knowledgeable in the anatomy of limbs, and knows that the nerves that move the body depart from its members.
Head.
When Albucasis is burned and does not respond to any of the medical techniques: then place a little deep cautery on top of it, according to the thickness of the skin, until the complexion changes and its color is changed.
Then care for the limb with herb flour, and oil of roses, and leaves of argloche, and pigeon blood, and duck blood: make a part of each one: mix these all together, and spread them on a cloth, and let them stick to a place until they heal.
The method of cauterizing while unconscious in the case of cancer.
When the cancer is beginning and the eye must be removed: then cauterize the eye with a circle of cautery around it, as it turns.
But the wise have said that the last cautery in the middle should be used.
But for me, I do not see this: because I am afraid that it will ulcerate: and indeed, I have seen it a few times.
And it is better to cauterize around it with a circle, as we have said: or to use multiple cauterizations.
The way to cauterize in Adubelati.
When anyone has Adubelati and is delayed in maturation, or does it for the sake of superfluous doing, or because of old age, when he is feeble with little blood, or because of time, and the vein festers in maturation of Adubelati, then cauterize around it with small cautery punctures. Then let go of it. For it will hurry with its maturation.
But if you pierce its vein with a cautery, then take this form of fire.
And place it in the middle of Adubelati until it penetrates the skin: and let the cautery follow it, so that the course of the blood may be eased.
Then care for the person until he is healed.
The way to cauterize in a bad腐
Chapter LIIIII. On the way to cauterize in a bad腐
Which is not but corruption in a walking member, and corrupts itself: as fire devours dry wood.
But if you see corrosion in a place that accepts cautery with fire, then take many small and large fire cautery tools, according to what suits it in the place where the corrosion is.
Then cauterize the person from all parts until you eradicate the whole corruption, and do not leave anything of it within.
Then let go of the person for three days, and place sulfur powder with oil on the cauterized places, until all the escharas are eradicated, and all corruption.
Then care for the person with poultices generating flesh.
But if you see that after three days the flesh is born healthy, and there is no corruption, it is good.
Then repeat the cautery on the remaining corrupted places.
And the corrosion is healed when it is treated with sharp medicine. She herself rises up at the place of cauterization.
Indeed, the cauterization is faster with fire: and I myself have already said that the cauterization of her with sharp medicine is in division: so accept it there when she is hungry.
On the Mode of Causing a Wound to Heal Faster
Head L.V.
This illness often occurs in the lower parts of the legs: and it is a coarse, filtered, which hurts the leg.
And there are two ways of cauterizing them: cauterizing with fire, and cauterizing with hot water.
How much, then, is it with fire, so that the flames of the cauterization are similar to the feathers of a torch: which is to be made from iron, according to the quantity that it contains a seam from all parts: and let the margin be subtle.
Then, place the burned thing on the seam. Then, rotate the hand with the cauterization around the seam, until the cauterization reaches the depth of the seam: and leave it for three days, until the discharge of pus begins. Then, wrap the burned thing with silk threads, crumpled up with salt: and leave the emplastrum on the burned thing during the night. For it will itself be rooted out from its roots.
Then, care for the place with a generation of flesh ointment, until it heals.
If they are not turned around, and often happen on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet: then administer to them cauterization with hot water: and it is as if you receive a tube from iron, or steel, or a torch feather: and place it on the seam, or let it run. Then, pour into the tube a little hot water: hold your hand, and rotate it gently so that the margin of the tube is imprinted on the base of the seam, and there is hot water in sight to the depth, to the root: and let the sick person wait a little while during the tickle of the hot water.
Then let go of him, for the clavicle is cut off with its roots.
So do unto them as you would have them do unto you; for that is the law and the prophets.
Then be mindful of them after they are cut off, with those who go out from among them in the body.
§ On the mode of cauterizing in tremor.
When it happens to someone that there is tremor due to cold in a nerve, or due to quartan fever, or from another cause: then one should cauterize the part four times, or five on top of the spine on the back, and between every spine cauterization, and in the middle of the spine cauterization, and in the stomach cauterization.
For tremor ceases with the olive oil cauterization, and quickens the health of disease due to cold.
§ On the mode of cauterizing with alum.
Chapter LVII.Ex quibusdam febribus, et ex mor
When some fevers are expelled from the body with alum, that is, pustules which arise from coarse corroding material.
Then one should cauterize it on the head first, with a fine-tipped cauldron of Myrrh, whose tip is heated with fire. Or with the root of long Aristolochia. Or with a lenticular cauterizer.
And when they are cauterized with the semen, at first in accordance with this manner: they do not increase; and they break up the excess, healing them from within.
However, one should make it after evacuation with phlebotomy.
§ On the mode of cauterizing in a stream of blood from an artery in the ulna.
This often happens with blood flowing from an artery cut into the ulna, which is due to something external, or at the site of a pimple, or at the member's cauterization, and similar things: and it is difficult to remove it.
So when this happens to someone, then put your thumb properly on the opening of the artery and place your index finger over it: and tighten it very much until the blood is completely stopped under your thumb and nothing comes out of it.
Then put on a small oiled fire, with many more: and blow over them until they are very hot.
Then take from them one, or small, or great, according to the wound and the place where the artery is broken, and put the fire on it; then remove your thumb quickly: and hold the fire until the blood comes off.
If it is expelled with your thumb from the opening of the artery and you put out the fire, then take another fire quickly from those that are prepared in the fire;
So do not stop doing this with one after another until the blood comes off.
And be careful, so that you don't burn up the fire that is there, and something bad happens to the patient.
And know, that when blood flows from an artery, then it is not possible to stop it; especially if the artery is large, unless with four. Or with fire, as we have said. Or with extraction, when it has not been extracted. For when it is extracted, its ends are drawn back and the blood comes off. Or is bound with a strong ligament. Or are laid on top of the medicine by its property, which stops the blood from flowing, and is held with a little pressure.
Whoever does this to him with a ligament and constriction with cloth, or with the placement of burning things and others nearby, does not give him relief unless it is rare.
But if this happens to someone, and there is no present doctor or medicine: then let the thumb of the right hand begin to be placed on the opening of his wound as we have described, and constriction let it be very tight, until the blood from the upper part of the wound is completely stopped, and put on the artery. And let the finger not be moved, on top of it with cold water always whet with the cold, until the blood is congealed, and thickens, and is cut off.
And in the meantime consider in him, what does he need from the poultice, or from the medicine.
On Incision, Puncture, and Bloodletting on wounds and similar things.
We have already spoken in the first chapter of all disease, and of the ways in which fire can be used as a cauterizer and medicine combined with it, and of the causes of such diseases, and of the instruments for them, and of the shapes of the cauterization.
And I placed there from the top to the bottom chapters.
And I will proceed in this chapter in the same way: so that he may find what he is looking for easily.
And before I begin that, it is necessary for you to learn, O son, that the fear that is in the first chapter on cauterization,
And for that, it is necessary to be careful in it, since the fall often of the vibration with blood, which falls on opening the vein, or incision on a bruise, or opening of the exit of urine, or cure of a wound, or extraction of an arrow, or incision on a stone, and those similar: from all of which is associated tremor, and fear, and falls in many of them death.
And I warn you, so that it does not fall on you that hesitation, for sometimes those who are fallen to you, in this art of men with ways of sickness. For from them is one who becomes angry with his illness, and is weak before him, on account of the severity that he finds from his illness and the length of his evil. And when disease comes from fear that means death.
And from these is he who gives you his knife, and tells you with them, hoping for health, but his sickness is destructive.
Therefore it is not necessary that you should consent to him who comes to you from among them, whose way is such. And be your caution greater than your avarice and your greediness. And do not presume about anything from him unless after a certain knowledge that justifies it with you what comes to that worthy succession of praise.
And so you take care of all your sick people, prognosis and indication of him as to where the healing is appropriate.
For in that is for you an aid in acquiring fame and glory, and memory and praise.
May God inspire you, O son, with his understanding, and may he not take away from you his guidance and inspiration: for that is in his hands.
And I have arranged this chapter distinguishing it by chapters, according to which I preceded in the chapter of Cautery, from the cheek down to the feet: that you may be eased in what you ask for from him, and what you need.
About the cure of water which is added to the heads of boys.
Chapter I.
You should know that this disease often happens to boys at the time of birth: or when the midwife presses the boy's head without lightness.
And whenever it also happens for an unknown cause which is not known.
And I have not seen this disease in any other but in boys; and I would like to see all of them die: for that reason, then, I have abandoned the practice of using it on them.
And I have seen from among them a boy whose head was swelled with water, and whose head increased in size every day until he could not sit on himself; and the moisture increased until he died.
And this moisture, or collect between skin and bone: or collected under bone over the side.
And the operation in that, if there is moisture between skin and bone, and the pussing is small, then you should find a small crack in the middle of the head in width: and its length is almost two knots, until the moisture runs out.
And this is the shape of the needle.
If then the moisture is more increased, and the pussing is larger, then put them two cracks, according to this form.
And if the moisture is under bone, and its sign is that you see the scalp openings from all sides: and water is lowered when you compress it with your hand towards the inside, and it does not hide itself from you: then you should find in the middle of the head three cracks, according to this way.
And after the incision has been made, remove all the moisture. Then tighten the cracks with rags and powder. Then dip it in wine and oil until the fifth day.
Then loosen the ligaments, and take care of the wounds with linen bandages, and ointment.
And do not stop tightening the head with equality. And feed the sick with dry food of little moisture, until their members are comfortable and healed.
And another method of incision is that you should consider where the pussing appears large, and the collection of water.
Because when it is more in the back, or in the front, or on the right, or on the left.
So climb up with the incision where you see the pussing and the collection of water: and tear it according to what is possible for you.
And observe, so that you do not hit an artery, and does not happen a flow of blood, and the sick person dies from that flow with the evacuation of moisture.
Of the arteries which are behind the ears.
Head II.
When there occurs to anyone a cataract on the eyes, or on the chest, and it is old, and there is no treatment for it by medicines: then more is the last treatment in him, to make an incision of these two arteries.
Therefore, when you cut off their sight, let the sick person pull his head out. Then put a rough cloth over the place so that the arteries appear. Then the sick person should tighten his neck with whatever cloth he has. Then look where the pulse beats. And these places are those which are behind the ears that are depressed; and rarely is it hidden unless in some men.
Then signs with wax on both: and cut each with a chisel sharp on both sides, cutting towards the nose: and let it be done according to the breadth of the head.
And if you see, insert the chisel under the artery, and cut it towards the top with an incision.
And let the length of the incision be as two fingers joined together.
For when the vein is cut, blood flows out with a pulsating movement that rises to the inside at a regular interval.
But if the artery does not appear to the touch, then you must measure from the ear the length of three fingers. Then signs with wax and find up to the nose.
And that which must be emitted from the blood, is six inches and perhaps you emit more or less of it. All this depends on the quantity that appears to you from the vein and the filling of the artery.
Then look at the nipple. If anything remains in the mouth from spitting, then cut it so that there does not remain an open wound: and tighten the nipple with a thread from a linen cloth.
Then take care of himself with ointment, until he is healed.
On the extraction of arteries which are in the temples.
Chapter III.
When it happens to a man that he has an old headache, or acute catarrh through acrimonious humors, and heat in the nares of the ears, or old soda, sharp, and similar things: and is treated with the methods of medical cure, and does not give that treatment: then we are experienced in these diseases to extract the arteries from the nares of the ears, or to cauterize them, as we have related.
And the method of operation in extracting the ears is, that the sick man who are in the nares of the ears should be shaved, and turned towards the appearing artery in the ear. And this is shown to you from its pulse, and rarely hides itself except in a few men, or through sharp coldness.
If it hides itself from you, then the sick man should tie his head with any of his clothes: and then he should cover the place where he feels the cold with a rough cloth. Or he should heat the place with hot water until you see a clear appearance to you. Then take a spikelet, which I have just made. Then scrape with it the skin, with ease, until you reach the artery. Then throw it into her and extract it upward, until you extract it from the skin, and make it bleed from the tunics that are under it from all sides.
If, however, the artery is thin: then turn the end of the spikelet towards it. Then cut from that side according to the quantity by which its ends are elongated, and turn back, so that blood does not flow. For if it is not cut, and if it is not severed, the blood will not rise.
Then make bleed from its blood an amount of six drachms, until III.
If the artery is large: then it should be bound to two places with a double thread, strong, made of silk: or from an alohoid string, so that it does not happen to it putrefaction before the consolidation of the wound, and blood flows out.
Then make an incision in the superfluous part, which is between two ligaments. Do it at that time, or after another hour.
And if you wish, cauterize it with the cauldron up to the nose, with a knife: until the extremities are cut, and remain in place of that work.
And this work is better if he has no fever, or if his body is hot. For the cauldron is of those that remain to finish the moisture. Therefore it is better to bandage.
And it should be after the extraction of the arteries, so that the place is filled with old cooked: and let them be placed over him feathers made up.
And after the solution of the medicine dry, which makes the birth of flesh, and with liniments, until it heals.
Which if while you are working a flow of blood comes out from an artery, then go quickly to cut it with the cauldron, or as if you fill up the place with a bandage: and tighten your hand, until the blood is cut off. Which if there is nothing present for you, then place your finger on the place, until the blood is frozen. And dip the place with water of cold water, until the sharpness is calm, and tighten it according to what is needed.
And from that which is lighter and easier to extract the artery, it is, as if a knife with this cauldron having two knives: and the sharpness of the two knives is like an almond. However, they are much less sharp than the two knives. For if they are sharp, like the two knives, it is appropriate for both to have cold: and do not incise the flesh with speed. So if there is a little crudeness in them, heat is held in them, and the flesh is cut quickly: so with this work it is better for all works, lighter, and easier to do.
And this is the form of the caustic.
And let there be a space that is the thickness of a finger between the two blades, after you have marked the two places with the caustics; and place both of them burning well, until they come to the mouth, and fall in two places: so that what is between their extremities may lengthen. For with this caustic they do not solidify deeply.
CHAPTER IV.
De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.
When there are constant tears and there is a course of tears from the springs on top of the head away from the eyes: and he has no remedy with the doctors' medicines, and his face becomes red, and he feels a trembling in his forehead, as if it were a trembling of ants: and his eyes are dried up, and sore, so that his hairs are corroded by the corrosion: and his eyelids are warmed by the acuteness of the tears: then the old used to apply this cure with the Ense, and they called it The Ense.
And it is, that you order the sick to shave the hair on their forehead. Then cut in the forehead three slits equal distant according to the length of the forehead: and let the length of the slit be nearly as long as two fingers, and one slit be equal in length to the nose at mid-forehead, and the second slits be about even with the motion of the nostrils, and the third be from the side of the other: and cut away the arteries that are on both sides: and extend your hand from the junction of the two jawbones, and let there be a space between each incision equal to the thickness of three fingers joined together: and let you have a prepared sponge fragment, or many dry rags, with which to absorb the blood.
Then introduce a spatula made of two acute ends, whose following form is: From the incision which is from the temporal part, to the second incision: and scrub all the skin between the two incisions withसफ़ाक़, which is on top of the bone. Then also cut this from the middle to the second incision. Then also remove this bone with a chisel and insert into the first incision another tool called a sharp chisel, soft on one side, not sharp on the other. And this is its form.
And place the sharp side of it against the flesh annexed to the bone, and the soft side against the jaw; and press it on until it reaches the middle fissure: and cut away with it all the tissue that descends from the head to the eyes: except that which continues in the incision to that which appears out of the skin.
Then also make this in the middle fissure until another fissure.
And when an equal quantity of blood has run out, express the places from the clotted blood.
Then also put into each fissure a piece of burnt iron, and put on them wool wetted with wine, oil, or vinegar. And see that no pus becomes hot.
And on the third day loosen the ligaments, and administer a strong infusion with warm water. Then care for this with basilic ointment, and with other ointments that are used to heal wounds: until it has healed.
Head
§ On the care of acute tears and cataracts in the eyes from within the head.
When there occur acute, bitter, and persistent cataracts in the eyes; and the eyes appear weak, dull, and their appearance is already impaired: and the eyelids are ulcerated, and hairs fall out from them, and there is a sharp pain in the deep part of the head, causing sneezing: then do away with these accidents, so that those materials do not come, unless they are removed with many tools.
And the best treatment for them is this. And it is as you order to the sick man to shave his forehead. Then also cut in that fissure one in the middle of the forehead, or a little more in width, and begin with the incision from the left ear to the right: and extend it until you reach the jaw: and stretch out your hand from the temporals that move when chewing: until such time as it has touched the jaw: and dry off all the blood with a sponge.
Then separate between the two lips of the fissure with a hot wax, or with liniments from linen. Then tighten from above with powder: and immerse the powders in wine and oil, so that hot poultices do not cause a swelling.
And when you dissolve this, and you see that the hot poultice is about to erupt: then it is necessary to close the mouth, until it begins to grow hair inside of it.
Then take care of the patient with the dry treatment that makes the flesh grow: just as if you were to take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony: and prepare a plaster from it, and administer it for the birth of flesh within these wounds.
Chapter VI.
This is a treatment that affects the golden part.
All that falls into the golden part is of four kinds: or stone, or a similar rock, such as iron, and rust: or from a plant, such as chickpeas, and beans: or a fluid thing, such as water, and vinegar, and things like them: or some kind of creature.
When therefore something falls into the gold, or a kind of rock that does not contribute to, or grow in, the gold, expose the gold to the sun alone: but if you see a rock, then distill in the gold some of the oil of olive nuts, or sesame seed. Then administer the extraction, and make it snort with oil, and paint the nose with the ointment at the approach of sneezing, after you have put on the gold a bandage from cloths, or wool, and extend the gold towards the top.
For this treatment should be repeated several times.
But if it does not leave, then administer the extraction with Gestigans, that is to say, subtle Pyzgarolies: whose form is this.
Then if it leaves with Gestigant, it is good.
And if not, then administer the extraction with a subtle, weak, single-dose unction.
If, then, he does not emerge through that, then make a tube of brass; and introduce the extreme end of the tube into the hole of the ear much, and the resin which is around the tube with the soft brass with oil, so that there is no passage for wind except through the tube: then draw out with your breath strongly.
For often he emerges by that way which we have described. But if he does not emerge in this way then take some glue, or some water, that is, gluten prepared, with which birds are caught, and put it on the end of the tube: and place that in the extreme edge of the ear after you have dried up the ear with a cloth laid askew there: and then introduce the tube into the hole of the ear easily, after you have dried out the ear.
If then he does not emerge with all that we have described, then prepare to cut it off, before there occurs any heat or spasm.
And the mode of the wound is so that the phlebotomist takes blood from the head first: and draw out his blood according to the measure of its usefulness. Then make the sick person sit between your hands, and turn his ear upwards, and find a small hole in the base of his ear next to his fat there: and let the hole be round in shape, until you have reached a stone: then take it out with that, which is possible for you from tools.
Then sew up the hole from your side with speed, and tend to that, until it heals.
That if any thing falling into the ear comes from one grain which grows, and swells: then administer its extraction.
But if it does not obey you to the exit, then take a small, thin, thread, according to this form.
And administer with that the cutting of its kind from a grain which falls into the ear, and do not think that it is already wet with the moisture of the ear, until you have put many blows on it: then draw it out with a hook, or with a gentle touch, or with suction, as we have said, for the extraction of it eases.
But the water that is poured into the ear, it is necessary that the sick man use with coughing at first: and has already filled his ear with some boiled old: and lies on it, in which water is. If then he leaves by that, it is good.
And if not: then take many small stones, according to the length of a finger, light, soft, and warm them with fire slightly, and insert one into the hole of his ear: and salt over his foot one from those stones, and hit with the stone that is in the ear. So he will not cease to do that with the stone and the stones, until he leaves all the water out.
And already he leaves out the water so that you take from a torch, or from a branch of a tree, and introduce the end into his ear: and light the end with fire, until it is burned well. Then repeat the branch again, and do it many times, until he leaves all the water out: and draw it out with a tube according to what has been said above in the stone.
In extraction however of the animal that enters into it, if it is a small body, like a flea, and similar to it, take care of it as I said in division.
But if it seems to be a body of great size, then administer the extraction of it with gestures and a hook: and its business is easier for all those who hold it in the ear.
But in the extraction of the wax that is in the ear, when your care is like that which we said in division, and in the book of distillations, and does not bring your cure: then you should look at the ear in the sun. But if there appears anything of wax there, then extract it with gestures, or with a fine hook.
But if there appears nothing there of wax, then take a tube whose this form is, narrow below, wide above: and introduce the end into the ear according to what it can bear from the sick man: and then suck with it strong suction. Let us try this many times until all the worms come out.
But if they do not obey you to go out, then bind them around with a stick dipped in tar, as I have said in the stone.
What if they do not go out with it that I have said: then administer the distiliations which the old people have already experienced in the infection of worms: and you will find it in the book of distillation.
And let your pouring be as you pour oil and medicines on the ear with this instrument, whose shape is depicted here. As you see, make it from silver, or from brass, lower part strictly, in which sits a small hole, wide at the top.
So that it is driven out what is in the urge of the cannula, let it be made of brass poorly done. And if you want, take the radium, and let it turn round at the end of it with a gentle turning: then pour oil, or juice, or what you want from these medicines into the cannula: and let it be in brass: then throw in the radium with the cot which is slightly heated, and squeeze it out with your hand under moderate pressure, until it drives out the oil into the urge of the ear, and feels sick inside: and that which is poured into the ear, may already be slightly warm by the fire: and let there not be anything which distills in it coldly: for the medicines do not bear this.
Chapter VII.
On the care of the healing of an ear injury.
When some children come out of their mothers' wombs without piercing.
And it has also happened to some men that there is an infection in the ear from a wound, or from flesh born in it.
And this infection, when it comes to be in the deep cavity of the ear, which is not caused by washing: and when it happens on the outside of the cavity a little, and causes it to wash itself.
So then that which comes to be in the deep cavity of the ear, and which is not comprehended by appearance, is in many dispositions difficult for healing.
And for the one that follows the temperature rise, it is necessary that you place the golden nurse in the sun and look at her; then if you see an apparent operation, open it with a thin spatula, whose shape is this that follows, let the end be in where there is some small width, whose part is sharp: and let the other side of the spatula be soft on both sides: so that it does not hurt the auricle.
If therefore an operation is born from the flesh in the meatus of the ear: then hold it with a small hook, and cut it with ease by means of a knife, until it is all removed.
That if the operation is in the deep part of the ear: then take a small ray, smooth, and heat it slightly with fire: and then send it into the meatus of the ear.
If therefore you feel that the operation is with him who has a problem with hearing, try to make an opening of it with ease: and carefully, so as not to hurt the nerves of the ear.
Then put into the ear a liquid of second quantity of width of the hole that you have made with Egyptian ointment: let it be for several days, until you are sure about the healing of the wound.
Or take a liquid, and pour it into rose water, and powder it lightly on top of it, and use it.
That if you see the ear already blistered: then it is necessary that you remove the liquid, and let it be with another liquid that you have made with rose oil, until it cools down: and then take care of the ear until it is healed.
But if blood comes out: then dip a sponge or cloth in cold water and put it on the ear: and use the remaining cure that stops the predicted flow of blood in the book of distillation.
The cure for the palpebrae of Alथल.
Head VIII.
These are the ailments of Alथल that occur in the eyelids of the eye when they are moist and also dry.
You must therefore hold them with tenalis; or with an iron hook, and knock them down with a mallet from their roots. Then place on the table the body that has been cut into three pieces.
If however blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a thin lens-shaped cautery.
And cauterize them, it is better to do so after the incision. For many times they return when some remains of the roots. And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned up, and do not return.
De the treatment of the eyelids of the eye:
Head 9.
This often happens in the eyelids what is absorbed by Crandini in his strength, and hardness, and for that reason it is called Grando: and is an aggregation of moist gross in the upper eyelid, and lower eyelid.
Operation then on them is, so that you consider at that time, if there is Grando proceeding from it, which appears to the eyelid, and move all parts, and the matter of it is easy.
Then find on it a slit across its width. Then scrape off that from all parts with ease, until it is peeled off. Then suspend on it with a hook, and cut it off.
If however you are not prepared to cut it off, unless after you have penetrated the eyelid with a slight incision, then it will hurt the sick person.
That if the slit is large: then aggregate to it with a stitch: and care for it, until it heals.
And if it is small, do not worry about it. The ointments restore that and makes it carnation.
And if Grando is hidden to the inside of the ear towards its surface on the inside, then turn it around and hang on it the hook: except that you penetrate the incision, and press it from all parts.
If the eyelid is stretched by an incision, that does not hurt in any way.
Then afterward cleanse the eye after the cut with salt water; and care for the place where it is swollen until the wound heals.
In the treatment of eyelid wounds:
Head 10.
Axirnath is the fat that is found in the eyelids; and it often happens that young people suffer from it; and this affects their eyes, causing their vision to become blurry, and they cannot see the sunlight; because the tears flow towards them, and because of this the eyelids are always wet with them, having swelled up; and the prominence of Axirnath is clear to the eye, and when you press the spot with your fingers, you feel Axirnath between them.
And its mode of action is that the sick person places his head in your lap.
Then take a piece of linen cloth and prepare it with a ribbon; and make from it a circle according to the amount that contains Axirnath on all sides. Then place it on top of it, and press with your fingers from all sides so that Axirnath is collected in the center of the circle.
Then find in the middle of it with a blade of grass the width of a hair, and do not let there be a larger crack than that which is made in the phlebotomy in the deep.
Or it should be that you find the entire skin, until you reach Axirnath; for Axirnath often proceeds from a crack in many locations; for Axirnath is often formed from the width of a hair when the wound is healed.
Then take it out with the cloth that you have soaked between your fingers at the outside; and you should move your hand to the right and left until it is scattered; and be careful not to add it to the crack, so as not to reach the eye with the blade of grass, and let it go.
But if you do not see the axilla at first in the incision, you add a little to the incision with ease until the axilla comes out. Then remove it outside, as we have said.
Then soak the cloth in vinegar and water, and place it on the spot, and tighten it with flour.
And there are those who grind salt, and put it in the incision to melt what remains of the moisture from that.
Then care for yourself until you recover.
But if a hot blister occurs in the place, then care for that with wet poultices, until it heals.
As for the methods of Ataxmir regarding the eyes: that is, when the eyelids become soft to the eyes, so that they do not turn red as they should.
Chapter XI.
When hair grows in the eyelids different from the natural course of hair, and becomes ingrained: then it hurts the eye, and causes diseases such as persistent tears, softness of the eyelids, and discoloration, until it destroys the eye itself.
And Ataxmir also treats the eyes according to four methods. Or with a cauterizer using fire. Or with acute medicine, as stated in the chapter on cauterization. Or Ataxmir is treated by incision and suturing. Or with canes, as I call it.
It should be placed so that the head of the nurse is in your lap. Then treat the eye with your left hand.
If it is turned in the right direction, that is good. But if not: push it in where the hair grows from the lower part of the eyelid, and let it penetrate with a needle through the skin, and let it rest next to the hair itself, that is, next to the edge of the eyelid, where the hair grow: and pull the thread up superiorly with the eyelid, and turn it around.
Then find in the inner part of the eyelids under the hairs added with a spatula incident from the greater tear until the smaller tear.
Then remove the thread, and place under the eyelid a small feather from wool or cloth: then mark on the eyelid with the caustic, which should be as long as the shape of the feather of myrtle.
However, it should be done according to the quantity and elevation of the eyelid: because that varies a lot among people.
From these there is one who needs to be cut from the eyelid according to the quantity that softens from the eyelid.
Then with the spatula find on two lines that you have marked and begin from the greater tear until the smaller tear, and let there be a groove one near the natural hairs, as is the thickness of the radius.
Then insert the hook in one of two angles of the skin. Then scrape off the whole thing. Then gather together with a stitch the two lips, with an aiguille and a fine thread: and wipe away the blood, and let it stick to what is excess from the hairs on the two eyelids, with some things that you can smell, if you want to do this: and if not, then it does not matter.
Then let go of the stitch and thread until three or four days: then take care of that.
And if you want, let go of the hook without a stitch, and take care of it itself with what dries up and tightens. For the eyelid is released at the sealing of the wound and the aggregation thereof: but that which comes later is better.
In this way, Ataxmir taught how to treat it.
However, there is worry about the sick, and it is from a good operation, and there is no fear in that.
And another way too, which Ataxmir also mentions: and it is as follows: to mark on the eyelid a figure like that of the feather of myrtle, as we have related.
Then wipe the eyelids with three separate or gathered hooks, according to this form that follows, and then cut off what is in excess with small scissors, according to this form, with equal incision.
If you are not able to hold the hook, and it does not fit [the eyelid]: then take the thread in which the hook is placed, and insert it into the middle of this figure: and insert another thread next to the larger tear, and a second thread next to the smaller tear: and gather the threads between your fingers with equal tension.
Then wipe your hand with equal wiping [motion]: and wipe the skin over which is marked the crease, as we have described.
Then gather together the two eyelids with a stitch: and take care of it, until it heals.
If, however, there is a hematoma on your incision or a tear: but let that hematoma be with green ointment, and these others like it, sitting on oil-based ointment.
And when the eyelids also turn, so that his hair grows out.
Therefore you must use the same method for the eyes as we have described for the incision: but the stitch on both sides is more artificial. In the care of Ataxmir with canes.
And is it that you turn the eyelid, and split the crease that is inside, according to what we have described. Then make two canes, or two thin sticks: whose length is according to the length of the eyelid, and whose width is less than the width of a quill: and you have already cut at both ends where you hold the threads.
Then gather each one together with care over what is in excess on the edge of the eyelid, and tightly tie the two canes from both sides with a strong knot, and let it go after a few days. For the skin is stiff and will die, and will rot, and will fall off, until it falls away on its own.
If it is delayed, then cut it with scissors. Then take care of it until it heals.
When it has consolidated, remove the splint: and do not poke at the hair.
And this is the form of two tubes, which you shall make according to this figure, and their quantity in length and breadth.
Chapter XII.
§ On the piercing of the hairs in the eye with an aiguille.
The operation in that case is, to take an aiguille (a sharp-pointed needle) and to introduce a fine silk thread into the eye. Then bind the ends of it with a fine knot on each, and let the length of the threads be such that they may touch the knuckle of the hand.
Then compose in a ligature a second fine thread under the first, and bind the ends of it if you wish.
Then put the sick person's head in your lap, and place him near to the light that the operation may be declared: for it is a delicate operation, or minute.
Then introduce the aiguille with the ligature in the root of the eyelid, and let it penetrate into the eyelid rapidly, until it has passed over the natural eyelash.
Then draw the eyelash up above the ligature: and introduce into the ligature that eyelash; if it be one, or two, or three, not more.
Then take away your hand with it, until the eyelash has come out with the ligature on the eyelid with the natural eyelashes.
If the ligature is drawn out and the eyelash does not come out with it: then draw the ligature lower down on the eyelid, with a thread which you have composed in it, until the ligature comes out of the upper orifice of the eyelid, and is removed from the eye: then take both out, and close the eye: and let him go closed for two days, or three, until the eyelash has become attached to its place, and has grown over the top of the flesh.
If the hair is short, then either attach to it a long hair from natural hairs, and cut off with it; or leave it until it has grown longer after a gap, and then cut it off.
Chapter XIII. On the head.
When it affects the eye, this is called Leporina.
And this condition of Al-Khazani is either innate or acquired.
So the acquired one results from the hardening of the membrane, or from a cut, or from cauterization, and like these things.
And the mode of action in it is that you find this hardening, and that you separate her lips, and place in it what is between them from linen thread, and bind her, until she heals.
And you should not use, in her treatment, those things that dry and constrict: for if you do so, it returns worse than it was before: but use, in her, those things that soften, such as fenugreek; and dip it in water in which althaea has been boiled, and semen lini; and anoint with the ointment called dyaquilon, which softens when mixed with some oils; and wrap it up with linen thread, and treat it with it.
And the treasure of your treatment is that you should guard against any ingenuity, so that it does not harden, following the form which it had at first.
And this operation which we have described is nothing but a certain correction of Al-Khazani, so that it does not return to the form of the place at all as it was before.
On the treatment of the condition affecting the lower eyelid, which is rust or contraction upward toward the right and left.
Chapter XVIII. On the head.
This condition of Al-Khazani which affects the lower part is what is called in truth Al-Khazani. And this is either innate or acquired. Quod naturalis est, ex causa uulnerum in palpebra infer
And the accidental is done from the ulna, or a crack, or a scar, and those similar.
And the path of operation is in it, so that you take an ear, in which there is a double filament, and dip it into meat, and let it penetrate from the left tear until it reaches the right tear, until the filament reaches both ends of the flesh.
Then extend the meat towards the top with a sharp tool, and cut it with a chisel on the side. If then returns the figure of the eyelid according to what is necessary, it is good.
And if not, take the radius, and put it in the crack, and turn it with it: and find two cracks on the inner side of the eyelid, and the ends of the two cracks are from two angles of incision, until they meet and become one angle: until when they come together, becomes this figure, and is the Greek letter lambda.
Then remove that meat by its quantity, which is the acute lower side of it, from there that follows the eyelid. Then bring together the separated parts: sew them with a sheep's thread.
Then take care of them with that which I have said, about the soothing medicines and the liniments, until they are healed.
And if the surgery of Albucasis has happened from a crack, and stitching, or cauterization: then you must find a flat crack under the eyelids' hairs, also according to what preceded it. Then separate the two lips with a liniment, according to what I have said.
And the whole speech about the care of Albucasis, when it is on top, or below, is that it runs in it, according to what it has prepared from the form of Albucasis.
For it is many different forms: and the prudent craftsman prepares his mind with whatever way is possible for him, until he returns the figure to the natural form, or close to it, and himself becomes ill, according to what suits him from operation and instruments in many dispositions.
De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum
About the adhesions of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or cornea.
When this consolidation happens to many people, so that the upper eyelid is consolidated with the white of the eye, and prevents itself from its natural operations:
It is necessary that you introduce the tip of the radius under the eyelid, and lift it up: or that you extend it with a tiny hook: then cut the adhesion with a very thin knife, which does not have the sharpness of the incision of the scalpel, but rather is slightly blunt: so that the sick person does not disturb at the operation, and moves the hook, and hurts his eye with its sharpness: and make your incision almost like you remove that adhesion with ease, until when the eyelid returns to its natural form, and heals the whole adhesion.
Then pour into the eye water, with water wash it: or distill into it from a water-to-alcohol solution, dissolved from zinc with water.
Then separate between the eyelid and the eye with a lint: and place on the eye wool soaked with wax: and after three days use alcohol, and with consolidations, until it heals.
About the incision of the nail and the eminence of the flesh of tears.
When you make an incision in the nail and in the emin
You know that the nail is second to two ways: Or it is a nerve: and it is similar to the hard bone of the sifac, thin. Or it is not a nerve, similar to the frozen moisture of snow; which when it touches iron, or when you pick it up with a hook, it breaks off, and does not stick to it.
And both kinds of species do not begin until from the larger tear, until they slowly spread out, and prevent water, and stop the movement of the eye.
And the way to operate on it is: so that the sick person puts his head in your lap. Then open his eyes and close his eyelids with your hand. Then take the nail with a little hook and extend it towards the upper part. Then take the awl and insert it into the nail with a little hook, or a pin: and fasten the thread firmly at both ends, and fix it in the middle of the nail: and pierce it with the awl, and tie the thread to the nail, and extend it towards the upper part: and scrape away the flesh with the hair next to the nail which follows the pupil, as if you were pressing it with the hair until it reaches its tip.
Then cut the residue at the root of the eyelid with a sharp knife, or with small forceps: and let go of the natural eyelid flesh so that the usual flow of tears does not run out from the incision.
And when the nail is extended with a little hook: or with a thread, as we have said. Then scrape it away with a sharp knife whose edge is slightly curved.
And be careful so that the blade does not touch the рогue cloth, and do not make a tear in it, or else the pupil would be pierced.
Then, after the incision, pour into the eye some crushed salt, or take some of the solution made from the ash of a sheep's ear: and leave it until the next day. Then care for the eye with what is necessary until it is healed.
If the nail is not nerveless, and you cannot insert an awl into it, nor fix a hook into it: then often treat this nail-disease with medicines, and heal it as a thumb is healed in its separation.
If you want to cut the nail, then open the eye slowly with your hand, and take a sharp blade, slightly acute, such as this one. Then scrape the top of the nail with care. If you see that the nail is becoming thinner and tighter, and it is impressing itself into the blade, then pour into the eye from your own saliva made into a solution, or from a red ash, or from salt ground fine: and blind the eye until the next day.
Then he would iterate over the same operation, until he had removed everything of it. If there is no bloodshot eyes, hot swelling: then you should let go of the same, and take care of the wound, until it heals up.
Then he would iterate over the same operation with a razor, until it has healed up.
If there is a great pain in the eyes of the flesh, it should be suspended with an anchor, and cut from that part of it: and not the last cut, so that the course of tears does not run.
Then add a little rub or made with zein to the eye, or made from it, until it has healed up.
Regarding the incision of the Albucasis, and the flesh born in the eye.
Chapter XVII.
When it also appears in the eyes of some people's flesh, red or applied, until it covers the pupil, or comes close, or tightens on the eyelids, and perhaps turns the eyelids outward: and it is absorbed by the rose of the folds.
And the operation in it is that he puts a sick head in your lap. Then open his eyes and take all the flesh with an anchor suitable for it: and hold it with one clamp, or grasp it.
Then cut into the flesh first, until it has finished completely with a razor blade. And remove from the eye so that you do not leave it during the operation: and let your cut be what you cut, or with a chisel, which we have spoken about in the incision of the nails: or with small forks, with which Bel is bound, according to which his form will come after this chapter.
When your cut is finished, and all the Alguezenici has been removed, then fill the eye with crushed salt: or distil into it red powder, and other similar corrosive medicines: and place on the eye a cotton wool with albugine, so that it may be protected from the hot swelling.
If something remains of the allium and a hot blood prevails over you, and you fear a caldough: then let go of the eye, and take care of itself as it sits on the caldough.
Then wipe it again on the eye with the operation until it is healed.
And do the same for the flesh that comes to the eye from this kind.
However, it is necessary that you do not interfere with the cure of any weak eye from natural or accidental causes, operating with iron: and do not put your hand in any of these operations until you feel, for that member is tolerant of that operation.
Regarding the removal of Sebaceous from the eye.
Chapter 18: The Head.
Sебеl are small red lumps that grow on the eye and prevent surgery from being done: and they weaken the eye with the passage of days.
Therefore, you must first take into account, if the eye in which Sebel is, is strong, and there is no other disease in it except Sebel: then gather Sebel from it.
And is, as you command the sick, to put his head in your lap.
Then hang those small lumps with one or two hooks according to your prudence: and let the hook be thin, double-long according to this form, or let there be two hooks in one body, according to this form.
Then take with subtle hooks those small lumps with subtlety, and wipe the blood hour after hour until you feel them come out of the eye, and resolve: and do not leave the eye with sharp tips.
And let your operation be in the middle of the day before the sun, and be strong in your operation very much: so that you do not fall except for those small lumps.
And when you have emptied it, then distill in the eye green viride, or red: so that its sharpness corrode what remains of Sebel.
But if you cannot collect that whole thing at that time, then patch the eye with that, which soothes the eye's pain; and leave him for a few days, until his pain subsides: and keep him from hot poultices: and then put it on again in the same way, until he is healed.
And this is the form of the scalpel.
§ On reducing a rupture to the nose.
Chapter XIX.
They name the medical instrument as a fistula, which they use with caustic or with sharp-burning medicine, according to what has preceded in his story.
And if he does not heal, then there is no skill in it: unless you discover the pus and all the moisture that is in it and the swelling, until the opening is found.
But when the opening is discovered, and you see corruption or blackness in it, then shave it with an instrument whose form is this.
And it is called the scalp of asperity.
Let it be made of iron, and let the head be round like a chisel, which is pierced with a file or with a fine saw: and set the skull on the place where the corruption is.
Then roll the skull between your fingers and press your hand lightly, until you know that that corruption is now smooth: and do it often.
Then restore the place with drying styptics.
But if that place has hardened and a bone has grown there and the scar has healed: and it remains for forty days, and does not break out again, and does not suppurate, and no accident happens to it: then you shall know that he is now healed.
And if not, then there is no skill in it unless a tube is placed into the nose, according to this form.
And is, in order to detect the second bone with iron, or with sharp-burning medicine: and when the bone is detected, then take a twig according to this form, whose end is an iron rod, triangular; and let its wood be extended into a pyramid up to its end, as you see.
Then put this above his own skull: and place it near his tear duct: and extend your hand a little from his eye. Then turn your hand with the skull, so that it penetrates the bone, and feel whether it is weak: in this way he will find the pulse coming out from it when he holds his own hand on his own nose.
Therefore at that time restore the place with the stinging medicines, as I taught you.
When therefore the flesh is born and the place hardens: then the substance which flows out to the outside returns to the nose: so it is lighter over the weak one.
On the reduction of the greatness of the eye.
Chapter XX - On the Reduction of the Greatness of the
When the eye eminently and completely comes out, and does not happen to be injured or diminished: then you should relieve the weak one: then you should bleed him: then you shall put the wound-healers in the skin without scaring, but with suction.
Then put on the eye a liniment which is made from acacia and aloe and olive oil and sarcocolla. Then tighten the eye down over a plaster with many powders.
And the mode of the powders is: that you take soft cloths, many and twice as much cloth as there are clothe panels for four: make it from those many: then put them one above the other, according to the quantity which the eye requires: then tighten them together with a hard, strong cloth.
And again wound-healers without scaring, but with suction.
Then take away the wound-healers and release the eye, keep it shut during the day and at night.
If the ligament softens again, then you should tighten it much: then take away the ligament after a day and night, as we have said.
If therefore you see that the eye has been relieved with new lint, it is good: and if not, then again the plasters, and the tightening, and the wound-healers, until it is healed.
On the incisions of the king's tunics.
Chapter XXI.
When a breach occurs in the king's tunic, then it is cut off and brought out from between the eyelids like a grain of wheat, and shaped into the form of a man because of that; and the operation is, according to what I have said: and it is, so that you insert the acumen into the root of the king from below to above.
Then introduce another acu with a double filament on the side of the lacrimal, and let it penetrate: and release the first one according to its direction.
Then cut the spot where the double filament is, and bind that side of the king with it around the acu: and tighten it very much.
Then withdraw the acu, and place a wet wool on the eyeball in the white part above it: and release it, until the filament drops with the king.
Then care for the eye with it, which comforts it, until the wound heals.
And when the king is stretched tight from all sides by a circle of cloth, so that the eye projects greatly.
Then it is pierced with a thin spatula, which reaches to the depth of the eye, and makes the albugineous fluid flow, and the eye drops down, and is inserted immediately: then tighten it, until the wound heals.
Chapter XXII.
The Cure of the King's Eye
This condition called Alcomnati, is not anything else but a deposit gathered in the eye, similar to water that drops down, and it itself is not.
And the method of operation with this is, so that you make the sick sit on a chair prepared, or directly.
Then take his head in your hands from the two sides, and move it, until you feel the deposit reach to the lower eyelids of his eyes. Then bind it, and so that it does not drop down, and let the light be clear; and let the sick person see things as they are; and if it does not drop down below, you shall know that it is water.
But if the descent is not prepared with him as we have said, then make him sit between your hands. Then take a thin spikelet and find it with him above the cornified tissue somewhat at the edge of the connective tissue where it joins the corneal layer on the crown, until the pus is discharged.
When it has discharged then distil into the eye warm water in which you have mixed honey: or haygrass and honey: then treat with the remaining treatment until it heals.
Of the care of water, which has entered into the eye, or cataract.
CHAPTER XXIII.
We have already spoken on the species of water and that which is suitable for piercing with a revealing and explanatory statement, then take it up again according to health.
Then it is necessary that you make the sick person sit between your hands square-wise, opposite the light, near the sun: and bind his healthy eye, and tighten it firmly: then with your own hand squeeze the eye from which the water comes, if the eye is on the left, then with your right hand: or if the eye is on the right, then with your left.
Then take in your right hand alum, if the eye is on the left: or in your left hand, if the eye is on the right.
Then place the end of alum near the crown by the thickness of a ray into the same white part of the tear film of the eye: then push the alum with force: and you rub it up with your hand, until it penetrates into the corneal layer; and you will feel that the alum has already reached the wet part.
And it should be such that the distance of the alum to the depth is a measure, the space which is from the pupil to the end of the blackness: and this is the crown of the eye. You will see it in the same pupil with a vision of the eye, because of the clarity of the corneal layer.
Then put the almagest to the place where is water. Then press on the bottom with a single hand after another.
If however water has dropped immediately, then the sick person will see it on what opens his own sight immediately, and the almagest in his own eye.
Then you rest a little. If however water has dropped, then put it down second, except that the almagest should come out.
When it is fixed, and does not rise up: then remove the almagest with ease: and you raise your hand slowly again.
Then dissolve in water some of the clear salt of the gem: and rinse with it the inner eye. Then put outside all the puff up, or wool dipped in oil and bleached, and glue with it a healthy eye.
But we and those who are of our time, put on him ground pepper mixed with white of an egg.
That if the almagest does not obey you at the entrance into the eye because of its hardness, since it is from men, and whose eye is very hard: then you should take a twig called Alberida, whose this form is.
Proro ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctio tantum, et non ultra manum tuam in foramine ponas: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagdam locum subtilem.
Then put the almagest in, according to what we have said.
And near the end of your work, prepare for the sick person a dark bedroom in which he should sleep on his back: and prohibit any movement, or coughing: and do not let him eat anything that is not natural to him: and do not let his head move to the right, or at all.
And let it be bound up according to its shape until the third day.
Then solve it in that dark house, and test his sight: and let him see things. Then reduce the ligaments until the seventh day.
And it is not necessary for him to do this at the time of cure, or immediately after the incision: but he should delay it, because water quickly rises through the whelming face.
But if an apoplexy of heat occurs: then you should open his eye before the seventh day: and straighten that with him when he sits down so that the apoplexy is straightened until it has been set for some days while he remains in that dark house.
Then let him go out of the house gradually, and let him turn round in his cases.
And know that the student is not excused from an operation for a little while: then he may dare to speak about the operation.
And already some of them have come to us from Al-Arab who said that a hole was made in Al-Arab by which water is drawn up.
But I never saw anyone in your country do this: nor have I seen this written in any of the old books: and it is possible that this is new.
And these are forms of eyes from a hole, so that it stands on top of him who does not know it.
Let them be made of pure brass: and let their ends be shaped like this same triangular subtlety, and the sharp end.
Chapter 22: The head.
Regarding the cure for a birthmark on the nose.
When and how birthmarks arise in the nose: some of them have a substance that is like scorpion's many legs: and from this is the flesh which is cancerous, hard, pale-colored: and from this is the soft flesh, not pale-colored.
In which of these marks is soft, not fraudulent, and not cancerous, you should make him sit with his hands opposite the sun, and open his nostrils, and stick pins in those parts: then pull them out towards the outside, and cut off what you have stuck with a sharp, fine needle from one side, until you know that all the flesh has been taken away.
If anything remains from that which its removal is not possible: then cut it with one of the instruments and easily remove it until nothing remains. But if blood dominates you, or an aposteme is hot: then oppose it as needed: or if it is a malicious apostema, then approach it with cauterizing, until the blood is cut off and all flesh is taken away.
Then let it be poured into the nose after incising it with vinegar, and water, or wine. But if the nose opens, and moisture proceeds from it to the palate, then you shall know that he is already well.
But if the moisture does not penetrate, as is necessary, then you shall know that it is born flesh within the upper bones of the nose, to which the knife does not reach with the incision.
Then it is necessary that you introduce a thread of linen with some thickness, and nodules many in it; and place between each nodule a quantity of finger, or less: and let the sick person exhale his breath, until he reaches as far as the throat, and goes out over his tongue.
And many times this same boy makes Atom like in school: and it is an easy thing for him who wants it.
Then place the two ends of the thread, one end that exits over the nose, and the other that remains in the nose. Then, and also with the help of a lock for the flesh with the nodules that are in the thread. Make it so that you shall know that the flesh is already with the nodules of the thread.
Then remove the thread: and place in the nose after abstinence of blood a liquid that you have soaked in Egyptian ointment: make it so many days, or more, until the ointment corrodes all that remained of the flesh.
Then place at the end of the matter in the nose a pipe made of lead, for a few days, until it is healed.
If, however, the cure does not respond to extraction, use that method.
For making an ointment for the head, when oil is distilled and other medicines are added to the nose, make it from silver or gold: let it be similar in appearance to a small lamp, opened like a conch shell; and its opening should also be like that.
And if you want to make a tube closed like a cane.
And the shell of the instrument for making an ointment for the head should be full, filled up: which has a handle at the end, which you hold when you heat it with oil, or what you want to add, and fluid substances.
Head 25.
The ulcer on the nose often grows in severity and becomes larger over time until it forms a pus pocket.
And for this, when it first appears, you should cut off the whole of it. Then put a cauldron on the place, or cautery, or burning medicine that stays in its place.
But if the incision is delayed until it has grown larger, then observe: if it is hard, gray in color, and of few sensations; then do not touch it with iron: for it is a cancerous growth.
For many times a person who has been cut on the nose has become infected with a bad malice that has grown large over it.
And if the pustule is mild to the touch, not gray in color, and you see that the incision can be made throughout its entire length, then wipe away the pus, and cut into it without fear or anxiety; and treat the place with a cure that dries it up and tightens it up until it heals over.
Head 26.
On sewing the nose, lips, and ears.
You should know that when there is a break in the continuity of one of these cartilage pieces, the operation is not successful unless in certain people.
Therefore, when something happens to someone, you should examine whether the fracture is recent with its blood: and then add pain to the wound with a stitch; later take care of it until it heals.
And if the break in the continuity has already separated the lips and some healthy part has been made: then one should remove all the apparent skin from its part, until it bleeds. Then add two lips to the wound with a stitch and tighten them, and sprinkle blood from the dragon on it, and crushed olive oil: and put a fragment of a plaster of diafinicon over the powder, and some other consolidant plaster; and leave it bound for two days, or three. Then loosen it and change the medicine: and leave it until the threads separate themselves by themselves. Then care for it with ointment until it heals.
The way of sewing is that you gather the solution of continuity, or with a thread, as we have explained in the case of sewing an eye: or you gather the solution with a thread, as I told you.
Chapters 27
The extraction of nodules from the lips.
Indeed, many people have hard spots within their lips like little grains of grass: and some smaller ones, and larger ones.
Therefore you should close the lips and find all the knot in them, and hang it by a hook, and hit it from all sides.
Then fill the place where you have cut after grinding three times, until the blood has dried up.
Then soak it with vinegar and care for the place with that until the wounds heal.
Chapters 28
The incision of flesh born on the gums.
Often a flesh grows above the gums that the ancient ones call abluss.
Therefore you should hang it by a hook: or hold it with tongs and hit it against the root and let the blood flow, or pour blood on it.
Then put on the site three times, or other powdery astringent, drying.
If that returns to health after treatment, for it often returns many times, then cut it again and cauterize it; for it does not return after cauterization.
Head XXVIII.
In the case of toothache, when he is in pain, apply a hot iron to the tooth.
When teeth are gathered in the surface from within and from the outside part, and between the gums roughness, and sometimes they corrode, and become yellow and wrinkled, until corruption comes out of it to the gum, and the teeth become rotten because of it.
Therefore you should have the sick person sit between your hands, and place his head in your lap, and rasp off the molars and teeth on which you can see the gums, and make it like sand: until there is nothing left of it, and likewise do with yellowing, and wrinkling, and yellowness, and all else until it is cleansed.
If then what is in them from the beginning is removed by shaving, it is good: but if not, then repeat the shaving on them one day, and the next, and the third, until you have reached the last study of it that you want to do with it.
And know that teeth are resistant to different shapes of shaving, and many figures: moreover, the blade with which you shave teeth from below is different from the blade with which you shave between teeth, according to the shapes.
And these shapes of blades are prepared in your hands, which you will see.
Head XXX.
On the extraction of toothache.
It is necessary that you take care of the tooth from its pain with all your effort, and be late in eradicating it. For it is not that the tooth will be satisfied when eradicated: for it is a subtle substance: until, when there is no excuse for the eradication of it, then you should, when it is decided by illness to eradicate it, so that it hardens, and is confirmed with you the tooth that hurts.
Many times pain deceives the sick person and he believes that it is in the tooth and pulls it out himself; afterwards, the pain does not cease until the diseased tooth is pulled out.
For we have already seen this from the operation of bloodletting.
Since the tooth is certainly painful, then it is necessary that you make incisions around the tooth with a scalpel, where there is some strength, until the gum is completely removed: then break it with your fingers or with small tweezers, little by little, until it breaks off.
Then make big incisions in that place with good positioning and place the wound between your thighs: you have already held it well so that it does not ache; then pull out the tooth along its length, so as not to break it.
But if it does not come out, then take one of their instruments and push it under it from all sides with ease, and try to move it, as you did at first.
But if the tooth is punctured or corroded, then you must fill the cavity with cloth; and tighten it with a fine hook so that it does not break at the time of your constriction over it with tweezers.
And you should do, so that you carefully make incisions around the gums from all sides.
And keep your strength so that you do not break it and a part of it remains, and returns to the diseased part of it with the same malice that causes it greater pain first.
And beware, do not do what the bloodletters do in their haste and the courage of their actions, in eradicating it, except that they administer to it what we have described.
Many times they bring about great illnesses in men, which are more difficult to break than the teeth and remain with their roots or some of them; or to pull out the tooth with certain mandible bones; as we have often witnessed this.
Then wipe it down with wine, or with vinegar and salt.
If, however, a flow of blood occurs from the places (for often it occurs) then dry some of the wound, and fill it with the same stuff: and if not, cauterize him; if that does not help you, then apply medicine to him.
The form of the forceps which moves quickly in the first place, are long in their extremities, short in the handle, so that they do not double when applied to the tooth: they are like the large handles that you see, until when you squeeze them together, they do not bite into themselves, and do not double; the short extremities, and let them be of iron, or of a bent bar made straight, of the right angles: and in their extremities are teeth, some of which enter into certain ones, and press firmly by constriction, strongly.
And when the extremities become such as the form of the ear which is called the ciconia, and are strong in constriction.
Chapter XXXI.
Of the extraction of teeth and of the fracture of the bones of the mandible.
When there remains after the extraction of a tooth which is broken some, then you should place it on the spot with butter for one or two days, until it becomes soft; and then introduce to it the algin, or the forceps; of whose extremities are like the form of the ear which is called the ciconia. This form, however, is that of the forceps.
The extremities of them are made like a lever: or like an alewife-fish.
If he does not obey you in regard to the extraction with these forceps; then let him hold on to the root, and peel off all the flesh, and introduce the instrument which is called a small pliers, of whose form is this.
Let it be short in its extremities, broader a little; and let it not be dipped in water, lest it break.
If therefore a root is removed for this purpose, it is good; and if not, it should be done with these other instruments whose shapes are such.
The form of the first triangular extremity, in which there is some roughness.
The form of the second triangular extremity, which is slender.
And with other instruments and tools which have preceded in the sequence of tooth extraction.
Also sit with this instrument which is similar to a large hook, of such a form, of the second triangular extremity which is curved, in which there is some roughness so that it does not break, and is not soaked.
And know that there are many dental instruments: also the other instruments are not considered, and the prudent artisan, subtile in his art, finds himself the instrument itself, according to which signifies its operation and its diseases.
For from the diseases of the teeth are made the instruments not mentioned by the ancients, due to the diversity of their forms.
But if the jaw breaks from a tooth, or from any other bone of the mouth, then examine on itself at its own place with what is suitable to it from instruments and pliers which I mentioned in the extraction of roots, and be careful with the movement, whose form is this.
Sit with it some roughness gradually, so that it is held or clamped with the jaw, and does not move or shake, until the root has been removed; and restore the place with suitable medicines to it.
But if there is a small putrefaction in the bone, then shave off the putrid part from its own putridness, and heal the part, until it is healed.
Chapter 32.
Of the important locking of teeth on others.
When the teeth do not move in their natural course, they become rotted by that form; and especially when it happens to women and girls, that is, to those who bite their lips.
You should therefore reflect on it. If however he was born after a tooth has come out and has not been fitted with an artificial tooth or if it is possible to drill a hole in it or file it down: then you should extract the tooth: and if it is joined with another tooth, then you should cut through it with this instrument, whose shape this is.
It is similar to a small chisel, and is made of iron, with a sharp end.
And your cut should be deep, and because of the hardness of the tooth, and so that it does not move another tooth.
If however it is exposed to the wear of its own grinding: then file it with a file made of iron, whose shape this is.
It should be made entirely of iron, and its handle small, with a sharp point, like a file with which they make needles: it is ground little by little over many days with ease, so that it does not move the teeth and falls out: then smoothen it off, cut it short with some razors.
If however a tooth breaks off and hurts the tongue: then it is necessary to smooth out that piece as well until its roughness has been removed and made even: and to make it flat, so that it does not hurt the tongue or spoil speech.
ChapterXXXIII On retaining teeth with gold fillings.
On the retention of teeth with gold fillings.
When an anterior tooth is bruised or shaken by a blow, or by an accident: and cannot be held steady on it so as not to fall out: and has tried many treatments with the stinging medicines, but there was no benefit from them: then use skill in it, so that they are held with a gold wire: for silver turns yellow, and perishes after some days: but gold never changes.
And the wire should be of medium thickness, fine or coarse according to how much it takes between the teeth.
And the shape of the retention is so that you take the wire and slide it between two healthy teeth: then tie it with both ends of the wire between the teeth, or one or more, until you reach the opposite side with the wire up to the tooth on the other side. Then examine the texture all the way to the part from which you began: and hold your hand firm with subtlety and wisdom, until it is completely still: and let your constriction be where you tighten the thread, next to the roots of the teeth, so that it does not cause pain.
Then cut off the excess thread with forceps: and join them together, and twist them with a motion: and hide them between a sound tooth and a moving tooth, so that they do not hurt the tongue: then let it be tightened thus while it remains.
If it becomes loose, or gets cut, tighten them with another thread, and make it stable with that one for a long time.
And this is the shape of teeth, and the figure of holding two sound teeth and two moving teeth together, as you see it.
And sometimes one tooth recedes, or two after falling and returning to their places, and remain as we have told you, and do not make it except the craftsman be careful, and experienced.
And sometimes a certain bone becomes stiff: and it is made into a tooth-shape, and set in its place, from which the tooth holds fast and is tightened, as we have said: and remains, and sticks to it for a long time.
Chapter 34.
Sometimes the ligament that happens under the tongue is either natural, with which man is born, or accidental, from an arrow that has already hardened.
And the operation in it is that you open the mouth at the top of its jaw in your throat, and you move the tongue out of its place: then cut this nerve-ligament through its width, until the tongue is free from its hold.
If there is any hardness and nodding in it, and it comes from the hardening of an arrow wound: then throw it into the hook, and finish it through its width, until you cut the ligament, and free the nodule.
And if a crack does not occur deep in the flesh, and you cut the artery there, and blood flows.
Then clean the wound of the incision with rose water, or vinegar, or cold water.
Then put under the tongue a piece of linen that the sick person hold all night: so that it may not congeal again.
But if blood flows, then put three pounds on the spot. But if you really bleed, then cauterize the place with the red-hot cautery that belongs to it: then take care of yourself with the rest of the cure, until it is healed.
Chapter LXXV.
When a small pustule that has come up under the tongue and which is absorbed by the little wound, prevents the tongue from its natural function: and perhaps it grows so big until it fills the mouth.
And the operation on him is such that you open the mouth before the sun: and consider the pustule.
But if you see it a dark color, or black, or hard, and the sick person does not have a feeling of touch: then do not touch it, for it is cancer.
And if it declines to whiteness, and in which there is moisture, then throw into it a hook, and cut it with a sharp scythe, and free it from all sides. If blood flows from you during your operation, then put under the wound a piece of linen that the sick person hold until the blood stops flowing: and then return to your operation, until you remove the flesh along with its supply.
Then clean it with vinegar and salt: and take care of the rest of the cure that is fitting for it, until it is healed.
§ On the treatment of pustules on the two amygdales.
Chapter LXVI.
When two glands in the throat, that is, the glandules that resemble adam's apple, happen to be affected, and are called the two amygdales: when you do not cure them as we have said in the division, then consider.
If therefore the wound is hard and of a pale colour, and has little sensation: then do not touch it with iron.
And if the colour is red and its root is thick: then do not touch it either with iron, fearing a flow of blood, otherwise leave it until it has healed. And then you shall either pierce it: or let it burst by itself.
And if its colour is white, round, and its root is thin: then the wound must be opened.
And carry out the operation on it, so that you consider whether before the operation its apostema was warm and complete in quietness, or is about to diminish slightly: then therefore make the patient sit in front of the sun, and let his head be in your lap: and open his mouth, and take hold between its hands, and press its tongue downwards with the instrument, which has this shape.
Let it be made of silver or of brass, that it may be sharp like a knife.
When therefore you press it with the instrument and see the apostema, and it bleeds a little: then take hold of a hook, and fasten it on the amigdalus, and pull it out as much as you can, taking off with it some of the tunic.
Then open it again with the same instrument, which has this shape following. It is joined by a fork: however its extremities are curved so that the opening of each of them is in a straight line with the other: wherefore take care that it be made of iron, or of lead dipped in oil.
If this instrument is not present, then open it with a chisel, which has this shape. Let it be sharp on one side, and not sharp on the other.
And after you have opened the amigdalus on one side, open the other on the second according to this same shape of incision.
Then after incision rinse the patient with cold water, or with vinegar and water.
If, however, a flow of blood occurs, gargle with water in which the cortices of pomegranates have been boiled: or leaves of myrrh, and similar things from styptics, until the flow of blood has stopped: then care for him, until he is well.
And sometimes splinters come out of the throat, other than the two amygdals. So cut them as equally as I have said to cut the two amygdals.
And I have already treated a woman with an splinter that had lodged in her throat, which made her difficult to breathe and she was losing her senses, which almost closed her throat: and this woman breathed through my mouth and had stopped eating, and drinking water, and she was close to death, if she had remained one day, or two days.
And the splinter rose only as much as to leave two branches, until it came out through two openings in the nose.
So I rushed faster, and fixed my hook on one of them. Then I pulled him out, and a large piece came out with him.
Then I cut it off, where it was caught in the opening of the nose.
Then I made him go out through the other opening in the nose.
Then I opened her mouth, and pressed her tongue: then I fixed my hook on him: then I cut off a part of it, and there was not much blood coming out of it, so the throat of the woman was absolutely clean, and she immediately started drinking water, and then eating food.
So I did not keep cutting off the splinter after a long time: and the splinter that I cut off came back again after a while and it was very irritating: so I kept cutting it for a long time, until it was too late and painful.
So I was careful, and I sterilized the splinter between the two lips of the throat.
Then it stopped bleeding: then I walked away from him, and I don't know what God did to her after me.
On the incision of an ulcer.
De incisione apostematis uuulae.
When a catarrh has descended to the ulcer and has formed an abscess and is long, then it is called a perpendicular; and if it is on the lower part and is thick and round, then it is called a boil.
When it is cured with the medicine which we have mentioned in the division, and there is no improvement, and you see that the abscess has become cool and thin, then it should be incised.
And that which has gathered around it is round and not long, and is bloody or dark in color or black and does not have a sensation: then the incision of it should be made. For there is fear over the weakness.
Then when you see it according to the manner which I have mentioned from whiteness and its length, let the sick person sit before the sun: and press his tongue with an instrument which has gone before in narration; then fasten a hook into the ulcer and pull it down: and cut it with one or two instruments which I have mentioned in the incision of the two آمیدالا.
And you should not incise from it unless that which is added to it over the natural limit without adding.
For if you incise from it more than, you will hurt speech and discourse.
Then after the incision use that which we have mentioned in the incision of the two آمیدالا: and take care of it until it is healed.
But if the sick person shudders from the incision: then you should use your skill in cauterizing it without fear or anxiety.
And the mode of cauterization for it is not, except with sharp water: and it is, as you put a nurse's head in your lap. Then press his tongue with an instrument which we have mentioned. Then take from water which I have mentioned to you in the chapter on cauterization, and mix with it the powdered herb which we have mentioned, and fill with it the above-mentioned instrument, whose form is as follows:
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.
And set the instrument with the medicine on the wound: and let the sick person lie on his side, so that he may blow out the salve from his mouth by the natural power of it, so that nothing may descend from it to his throat, and may harm him.
Then take your hand with the medicine. And put half of it on the wound at first, until you see it has grown dark, and let it rest with the medication's tingling.
And if you wish to take a measurement, and spread it over the edge of the ear, and put the medicine on it, and insert the earwand with the medicine into the canal up to where it adheres to the wound.
Do this many times, until you get the result that you wish from the cauterization. Then let it go: for it will dry up and fall off after three or four days.
Which if you wish to use the medicine again, repeat it: and after the cauterization wash around the wound with a cotton swab dipped in butter, and clean with it what is around it from the medicine: and let it drip with cold water.
And treat externally with poultices, and internally with gargling, until it is healed.
This therefore of the cure is more salutary than incision, and less fearful to the patient.
And when it is cured with the medicine, which is thinner than cauterization and incision, for it is cured with suffumigations, in this way. Take mint, and hyssop, and oregano, and Rue, and Rosemary, and Chamomile, and Lemon Balm, and similar herbs; and put them all together, or some of them in an ointment, and soak them with vinegar, and boil them: let the pot be covered with a thin layer of lead: and set up in the middle of the pot an opening, above which place the instrument for the application of the medicine, in this way.
Let it be made of silver or brass; and let the end, in which is the granule, enter into the bone, until the vapor ascends to the wall above the tube, until it becomes dim.
Then go over it many times, until it heals.
And do not make this cure at the beginning of a fever. For it adds to the plague; and you shall not make this cure except at the decline of the plague from its heat.
But if you do not have this instrument with you, then take a tube and fit it into the end of it a piece of wood so that it does not burn the bone; for the wood prevents the vapor from burning the bone, and this is a good cure when done in health.
Regarding the extraction of spines and bones from the throat.
Chapter 38. On the extraction of spines and bones from the
Often adhere in the throat a bone, or a fish spine, or something else.
Then you should extract whatever is visible above the jaw when you press the tongue with the instrument near the sun, and tell me what it is in the throat.
And whatever is not visible to you and hidden in the throat, you should make a sick person fast before food enters the stomach. Perhaps something attached will come out through vomit.
Or a sick person shall swallow a strand of seaweed dry, or bread cracker, or he shall take a strand of sea sponge dry and soft; and he shall bind it with a thread, then he shall swallow it. When, therefore, it has reached the place where are the spines or bone, and is extracted, then it goes out.
But if it does not go out with that which we have said: then use the instrument of lead in this form.
Let it be thicker than a bone just a little, and let the end of it be smooth, so that it may easily enter into his throat; and he shall hold his head up.
Let him beware of touching his epiglottis, lest he cough and drive the wind out with it, or push himself back with his own hand.
But if the patient is weak, it is better: for he knows about the place of the wound and will push down or take his hand with the instrument up; all this in accordance with the quantity that has been prepared for him until he goes out.
On the extraction of blood from the tongue.
Chapter XXXIX. On the extraction of blood from the tongue.
When the bloodletting is done with medicines as I said in the division of cure and does not work, then look in his throat in front of the sun, or behind it when you press his tongue with the instrument which tells me.
But if your cough falls on the leech, extract it with a small hook or with subtle movements from the side.
That if it is not possible with them: then take a closed tube and insert it into his throat as far as the throat; and then introduce into the tube an iron rod heated with fire. Do this many times: and let the patient abstain from all water during the day.
Then let him take a full drink of cold water and open his mouth in it; and let him blow out air from his mouth while drinking it, and not swallow anything: and let him move his hand with the water. For the leech immediately falls when he feels the water.
But if he does not go out with it which we have said then smoke the patient with incense, or with an ashe-pot, with an instrument which tells me in smoking.
Do this many times, for she will fall by herself.
And the method of operation in smoking is, that you take a pot, in which there are plums with fire; and the pot is covered with a lid, in which there is a hole; and place the end of the instrument in that hole.
Then allow a suffumigation, and let the sick one place his nose at the end of the cannula, and close it, so that the suffumigation does not escape, until you know that the suffumigation has reached the blood-sucker. For the leech quickly dies.
If it does not fall, then perform many suffumigations.
And let the sick one bear hunger, and eat sauce, and other things, and do not drink water.
Therefore it is necessary that he go out with this regimen.
And this is the form of the instrument from which the leech is drawn out of the throat when it falls on it and it burns.
It is similar to forceps, as you see: but because it has a curved tip that enters the throat. And its end is similar to an ear, which is called cicogna, in which there is a sharp edge of the blade; and when it grasps anything, it does not let go at all.
The opening of Aphemata, and their section, and care in general.
Head 40.
There are many species of Aphemata, many ways, according to which the memory comes, that is, one, and the same in this book: and they differ in the perforation of them, and in the section of their own from two types.
Of which one is a species of Aphemata in itself, and because it grasps from the moisture.
And the second type is because of the places, in which it happens out of the body.
For an accident of Aphemata happens in the head, it is different from an accident of Aphemata in the anus; and an accident of Aphemata happens in fleshly place, it is different from an accident of Aphemata in joints; and each has its own judgment according to operation.
And of the Aphemata are those that do not need to be pierced, unless after maturation of blood within them, and completion of it; and of them are those that need to be pierced when they are raw, and do not mature according to the completion.
As the blisters which are near to the wound.
Because the blister, if it occurs near the wound and is prolonged, until it becomes rotten what is in its surroundings maybe the ligaments are corroded, or the nerves of that joint: so it is the cause of a closer contraction of that member.
Or is the blister on the main limb: for if you delay the piercing of it, until it has ripened, it will harm him or through that main member.
Or is near a limb, pierce then that immature one: and do not, so you pierce, the raw blister, which has not been completely digested, unless it is near a limb, so that it does not putrefy deeply, and it extends to the insides of the body, and becomes a fistula, or becomes at the edge of it, that does not heal.
It is necessary that you know the time for piercing the blister, which has ripened according to the complement: and it is with the sedative of pain, the retreat of fever, and the diminution of redness, and pulsation, and keenness of head of the blister: and the rest of the signs.
And you shall make the same piercing in the lower place of the blister, and more prominent eminence: and is the piercing to be made in the length of the body, if the blisters are in the parts of the hands and feet, and places of the ligaments, and nerves, and arteries, and up to the last in all equal places, there is no reflection.
In those which reflect, pierce with the hand of the member.
When however the blister is in the fleshly places: then it is better that you should stop piercing it, until its digestion has been confirmed, as we have said according to the complement.
Because if you pierce it before that one, the course of the virus will be prolonged from it, and there is much dirt and corruption, and perhaps the lips of it will become harder, and its depth.
And certain staples are to be drilled through according to the breadth of the body, at need; or according to that which the limb requires.
And it is necessary to make a small drill hole in small staples, and a large drill hole in large staples; or to cut sections of similar sizes of staples.
And there are staples from which the skin should be sewn; and it is cut when it has already been made like a cloth, and has been completed, that which has already died: like that which happened to many, such as a laceration, and abscesses.
And there are staples that cut in three angles. And from this one cuts like a fig leaf.
As the staple of the groin.
And there are staples from which a round section is made, and a lunar section; and similar ones from sections.
In truth, where there is no head, such as the soft staples, it is necessary to drill him with a superficial drill, or simply flat.
And it is necessary, when the staple is thick, and has already gathered a lot of puss, and you drill it, so that it does not break and does not leak all the pus at once: but take off a part from it. Then wrap the staple with cloth until another day. Then take out some pus again.
Do this many times according to the measure, until it comes out: especially if he is a weak person of declining vigor, or a woman expecting, or a small boy, or an old man decrepitous: for the spirit of animals often resolves with the exit of pus: and perhaps the sick one dies, and you do not perceive it.
Therefore take care of this chapter with great caution.
And after you have drilled him, when you have drilled these staples, it is necessary to wipe the wound clean: and consider. If then there is a staple of little wax, or it is a flat section, then administer wax from linen, or an old cot. If there is a large abscess and many perforations of the fissures, then you should then insert an awl into all the fissures until they are closed.
If you have cut off a part of the abscess or have made it around: then you should fill it with old cloth, or as when the skin is tender, or when the hair has grown and there is no moisture: and bind it tightly for three days.
Then let him discharge it, and care for that with him as he needs to with ointment, until it heals.
If, however, there is a flow of blood at the time of your operation, then you should administer cold water and vinegar to it after it has been soaked with cloth: and place it often on the site of the bleeding.
If, however, the bleeding persists, then you should administer a regimen and treatment, and powders, which are recorded in various places in our book of this subject, and with a powder.
If, however, it is in the season of winter and the site of the abscess is full of nerves: then you should fill the powders with wine and hot oil: and place them on the sites.
And if it is in the season of summer and the places are fleshy: then you should place powders soaked with water and oil, or wine and oil, and all of that cold. Until the third day, as we have said, then you should let go of the abscess and clean it, and administer to it what is suitable for its treatment, until it heals.
This is therefore what is necessary from the knowledge of the treatment of abscesses in general.
According to the half, however, I have already said about every abscess, which is a path to the treatment of its individual head.
Head 31.
On the Section on Abscesses that occur in the Skin of the Head.
Abscesses occur on the skin of the head, small ones are made of nodules, which are surrounded by tunica, which are bags, like those from hens' nests.
There are many types of them.
Of these there are many: and of these there are those that retain moisture similar to lime: and of these there are those that retain moisture similar to mud and pulp: and these are like, and among these are those that are hard rocks.
And in the cutting of all, and in the extraction thereof there is no fear when you cut at their joints, for there is no difference in the arteries.
And the operation in their cutting is, that you try it out with an instrument, whose form has come after these, which is called the intromitter, until you know what it contains.
For if that is what contains moisture, then dry it up by cutting it according to the length of the surface section: in this form.
And begin with the cutting from line b to line a. But when the moisture is emptied out, then peel off the skin that contains that moisture, and do not leave anything of it inside.
For many times it will return if there remains anything of it.
Then dip the cloth in Egyptian ointment, if it is present: and if not, in water and salt: and fill it with it, and leave it until another day. For this corrosion will eat up what remains of the skin.
Then repeat the ointment over the cloth a second time and a third time: and if you bear it well, until you are convinced that nothing remains of the skin, then indeed do not be afraid of the ointment; for I will heal.
That if an apoplexy contains a swollen nodule: then dry it up according to this form, having a section of the shape of a cross: and throw off the skin between two lobes of the section, and peel it off from all parts: and try your skill in extracting the skin that contains the nodule.
But if there is a difference to you when the arteries are cut, then do what I will tell you after.
And do likewise in an apoplexy, if it is hard, from the section, and with the same cure, according to what we have said.
And cutting above the stone is easier: for it is little of blood and moisture. And when there are some of these stones in the head of some men, where there is no moisture within.
That is: because I followed over the stone in the head of a married woman, and found the stone like a solid and hard, rough, white, which could not be broken: and if it were struck by him when he threw, it wounded himself.
In others however of these stones of accidents in the head, besides this that happen in the heads of boys, and at the roots of the ears, all of them is a superficial cutting.
Or put an incision of them always from their lower part, that it may alleviate the course of blood to the bottom.
Then take care of those with him as they should be taken when he is cured.
Regarding the cutting of the strumpfes in the neck.
Chapter LII. The head.
These stones often happen in the neck, and under the armpits, and sometimes in all the body.
And over those that happen from them in the neck, there is one, and many: and they come from within; and all of the strumpfes come out of their own skin, as we have reported.
And the kinds of these strumpfes are many. For they are some from stones; and some hold moisture; and some are wicked, and do not submit to the cure.
In that one that you see of good disposition when it is touched, whose manifest is its nearness to the color of the skin, and which moves to all parts, and does not adhere to the nerves of the neck, nor to the guide-血管, nor to the arteries, and is not deep: let it be cut off with a superficial cutting from the upper part to the lower part of the body in a line, b. to the line, g., and clean it out of all parts: and extend two skin lips with an anchor, or with many anchors, if you can bear it, as we have said in the head strumpfes, and draw them out slowly.
And it is necessary to take great care so that no new wound or nerve occurs.
And let the knife be not very acute, lest it cut your hand with an incision, or disturb the sick person, and you fall into a mistake which is unnecessary.
But if you cut a vein or an artery, or prevents you from performing the operation, then put the piece in a dry place, or some powder that stops the blood, and tighten the tourniquet, and let go of it until the sharpness subsides, and the wound softens: or else it begins to rot.
For the blood is stopped by the bandage. So bring it back to your operation, until you are finished.
Then inquire with your index finger, if there is anything left of the staphylitis with some powder: so cut them and clean them.
For if it is in the root of a staphylococcus a large new one: then it should not be cut from its root: but it should be tied with a strong double knot, and let it fall by itself without doing any harm.
Then fill the wound with old cotton that has already been soaked in Egyptian ointment. Then take care of yourself.
If the whole staphylococcus is cut: then you should gather the two edges of the wound: and close it immediately, once you see that there is no dư;
If you see that there is dư due to the size of the staphylococcus, then you should consider cutting its root and pulling it out: and administer the suturing that I have described.
And the staphylococcus that contains moisture should be punctured with a superficial puncture: so that you can see the place of maturity of it: and put the puncture away from what follows below the body, as we have said.
Then after the puncture administer liniment with ointment and similar things, so that it corrupts what remains from corruption, until such time as you see the wound have healed: then take care of yourself with a generous ointment of meat, until it is cured.
De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente
On the sectioning of the epiglottis with an accident in the throat.
The ancient ones said that this sectioning of the epiglottis was done by someone, and I do not see anyone in our land who has done it: and this is the writing of their speech.
In those who have a синанчию, the section of the epiglottis should be performed: but it is not done by that: for all the air and lung are weak.
In those who have a hot apostema in the mouth or throat or in both amygdals, when there is no disease in the canal, one should use the section of the epiglottis in order to escape the destruction which is caused by pre-formation.
Therefore, when we wish to do this, let us cut the epiglottis with a small section under a circle of the epiglottis or four, in that which is between two circles by the quantity, which is a section in a sifac, not in cartilage: and this place is suitable for cutting, because it is separated from flesh, and the blood vessels are far from it.
That if the doctor is timid, then he should extend the skin of the throat with a hook. Then he will find the skin, until he reaches to the canal: he should stop the flow of blood, if he sees anything from it.
Then let him cut the sifac which we have mentioned: and let it be signalled on the section of the canal from the phlegm which comes out from it, with that by which it is interrupted, and by the abruption of the voice.
And let go of the loop at some time.
So when the hour is coming near in which fear is caused by pre-formation, let two aggregates of the lip of the wound of the skin move it and leave it alone without cartilage.
Then administer medicines which make meat grow, until it heals.
Says Albucasis. The summary of this discourse that we have related is an exposition only when it is evident that one of these aphorisms has already been affected by the disease; and the sick person is raised above death, and his thirst is quenched with a desire to breathe: so he is saved from death, and therefore they ordered that the wound should be closed until the malady had spent itself, and it was a malady of three days, and almost the same as himself: then they commanded that the wound should be opened, and that he should be tended until he recovered.
And this which I saw myself is that a servant took a knife and put it into his throat, and it entered with it a part of the canal of the lungs.
And I was called to cure him, and I found him gasping, as it is the breathing of a dead person.
I then opened his wound, and I found blood flowing out from the small wound. So I was convinced that he had not cut the vein, nor had it burst: and breath came out of the wound.
Then I closed the wound, and tended to him until he was well: and nothing happened to the servant but a hoarseness in his voice; and after a few days he returned to his usual health.
Therefore, I say that there is no fear in the section of the epiglottis.
On the section of the gullet.
Chapter XLVIII.
This aphorism called Hernial gut is a great aphorism, second in order of appearance, and the color of the body: it is found in women very often.
And it has two causes: or it is natural; or it is accidental.
Certainly, there is no talent in the natural.
But the accidental has two causes: one of which is similar to the nods of the pinguis; And the other mode is similar to an aphorism that is made from the contraction of an artery. And there is fear in it, and it is not right that presumption should be made about it with iron, unless it is little; and you test it, and investigate it with an instrument. If then you pierce the node with a heavy needle, and it is not suspended with any sutures: then dry the node, as they dry knots; and take it out with what holds it, if it is in a sack: and if not, then examine all of it. Then be careful of the place with what is necessary for curing, until it heals.
Ch. L.
§ On cutting above species of nodes.
There are many species of nodes, and I have already spoken about them in a division: and it is necessary that I should tell here the difference between node and excision: when making a doubt.
I say, then, that where there is excision, there is heat, and fever, and painful throbs, until an efflux of serous fluid subsides, and putrefaction is completed: for then the fever and the heat subside.
But where there is a node, there is no heat, nor fever, nor pain, and they hold them in a sack of their own, which is second to the color of the body: and it is like beans, and becomes like a mat, and greater or smaller.
And they are according to two species: either they are fat: or they hold moisture. And the colors of moisture are many, according to what I said in a division.
It is necessary, then, when you are treating a node, that you experiment on it, and investigate it with an instrument which is called Intro-mission, according to the form of its shape in the chapter which comes after this.
And the way of investigating by penetration, and all nodes is, that you take this instrument, and introduce it into a moistened place, which you pierce in an aposteme: and you move your fingers gradually with it, until you know that the instrument has penetrated the skin. Then take your last hand according to the measurement of the apophelian arch.
Then extract the intramuscular and examine what emerges from its groove.
If then there emerges a running moisture, whatever its color: then dry it out by a superficial sectioning, according to what I said regarding the other apophelian arch.
And if there does not emerge moisture in the groove of the Intromissum, then you will know that it is thick: so dry out above the area with a sectioning in the form of a cross, according to this very form, as I taught you: and suspend it by means of hooks, and scrape off the skin from all parts with ease: and guard the cruciform section so that you can remove the healthy tissue with the Nodo.
If then the skin is broken during the procedure and it is not possible to remove the healthy tissue, since this often happens, then remove it hastily, until nothing remains of it.
For if there remains of it a little or much, the Nodo returns according to many accounts.
For if it hurts you, and there remains of it a little: then fill your wound with some acrid powder: and tighten the bandage, and place it over the arch that sits on fire, and take care of the wound with the rest of the cure, until it heals.
If then is a large Nodo, then cut two of its lips, and take care of the wound with that which has become inflamed.
If then is a new, pulsating or not pulsating nodule: then approach it, and fill the place to be cut three times, and leave it bound for two days, or three, until the bandage putrefies and the inflammation subsides: then return to cutting what remains of the Nodo.
Chapter LXVI. On the head.
Regarding instruments from outside for the purpose of sectioning and piercing.
There are three forms of Intromissums:
For from these there is great power, and from these there is mediocrity, and from these there is weakness.
For from iron let there be made a square of four extremities askew, that they may hold fast the entrance to the apotome.
And these are forms of experimentations, and no, i.e., piercings: and there is one called bers, i.e., piercing: and there are three species.
For from these there is great power, and mediocrity, and weakness.
They come together, that they may be investigated by the apotomes, and exits, and slits, and pustules from him because he is between them from bones.
And others are round, third, smooth, such as the big needles which are made of citrine, or of brass, or of iron, or of silver.
And better ones are those that are made of citrine.
And there are experiments also of black lead, which come together so that they may be experimented on the slits, whose reflections are caused by their smoothness, so that they reflect with gentleness with those reflections.
And again there are three species. For from these there are long ones, and from these mediocrity, and from these brevity, according to the quantity of width of the slit and its strictness.
Form of the anvil, and they are many species.
For from these there are simplicity, i.e., those which have one smoothness: and they are three species as you see, Great, Medium, and Small.
And from these there are blind anvils: and they are three species.
And from these there are anvils having two smoothings, and they are three species: and from these there are anvils having three smoothings, and they are three species: and all of these are necessary in their place.
And these are forms of scalpels, with which they cut and scorch the nodules and apotomes: and they are three species: for from these there is great power, mediocrity, and weakness.
Their extremities which are acute, the extremities of others are not acute: and they are not laid on so, except as with them a ligament is made in an excoriation of the nods at the fear of an incision of the vein or nerve: and that it may heal through it the sick, and find a little calm from the bitterness as it finds by an excoriation of pustules.
They are made of air, and they are similar to the radio, with which alcohol is made: and in the long end there is a small spot called Oculto: and it runs to the insides, and to the outsides when you see it, like you do.
The shape of the Spatumilium which are hidden between the fingers at the perforation of the pustules: and they cannot be perceived by the sick: and they are of three species, great, medium, and small.
The forms of the Wind-vessels, with which the flow of blood is cut off: and they are of three species, great, medium, and small.
Let them be made of air, or of yellow brass, round, a little long, like you see it: and let them be to subtility.
And let these species of the Wind-vessels be with you great, and small: that you may cut off blood through them with velocity at need, and then when there is no medicine present with you.
However, you should not use them for the cutting off of blood in any part of the body, and you should not use them except in the fleshy places: like the lizards of the legs, and of the hips, and of the arms, and of the breasts, and of the foot, and of the groin, and similar to these, from the fleshy lizards, moist.
And sometimes they are made small from these, other similar to the corks of the fists, according to their form: which cuts off blood when it flows from a place of phlebotomy, or at an incision of the vein, or artery: and sometimes they are made round according to this form.
Chapter LVII. On the treatment of mammaries in humans which
On the treatment of mammilli in humans which resemble mammilli in women.
When the mammaries of some men swell up towards the side of sleep (that is, when they begin to be inflamed while sleeping), until they resemble the mammilli of women, and then remain swollen with milk.
Whoever wishes to avoid this (that is, the swelling of the mammaries), should cover them with a lunar cloth, according to this form from the line B to the line G. Then scrub the entire area with a poultice. Afterwards fill it with a poultice of incurable ointment. Then join the two lips of the wound together with a stitch, and care for it, until it is healed.
If, however, the mammilla turns downward towards the lower part and softens on account of its size, as happens to women: then it is necessary that it be joined in two parts of a similar lunar shape on both sides, each holding the other near its ends, until they are united by a larger line containing the smaller one, according to this form from the line B to the line G. Then scrub the skin which is between the two lips, and remove the poultice, and administer what we have said about the stitch and powders, which is necessary in the treatment, until it is healed.
If, however, you do not wish to incise it as is necessary to incision, on account of trembling or of the flow of blood: then fill it with a poultice immersed in a corrosive ointment, and leave it, until that which remains from the poultice is corroded. Then care for it, until it is healed.
Chapter On the perforation of abscesses, which happened during the reign of Titus.
Chapter LVII.
These abscesses which happen during the reign of Titus, are of a hard kind, which contains a sac and from it there issue secrets.
Whatever is contained within these that is wet should be washed with lunar section, in this form, from line b to line g; and so whatever is there in the apomate from the filth, then fill it with old cloth, and leave it until another day.
Then the cloth should be removed and treated with a suitable ointment for that purpose, until it heals.
If the apomate is from the species of nods of the Strophulus, then cut it over it as we have said in the section on Strophulus equal to it.
If however a tendon is stretched out in this way so that it discharges pus, then administer cauterization to it, as we have said before, in what was pre-empted.
Chapter XLVIII.
As for the section of apomatides that occurs due to an artery or a vein.
When an artery bursts and the skin that is above it hardens, often there results a pustule; also occurs to veins, as it does with them, resulting in a pustule and swelling.
And the signs by which it is recognized that the apomate and swelling are due to an artery or a vein, are these: because, when the apomate is due to an artery, it is long, aggregated in the depth of the body; and when you feel the apomate of your fingers, you almost hear a whistle.
And what is due to a vein is round, evident on the surface of the body.
And the section over this apomate is an error, and especially if it is under the armpits, and groin, and throat, and other places on the body; and it is great indeed. Therefore, so that it is cured with iron, and whatever is also on the edges, or in the head, it should be cured too.
Over this, then what is on it from the swelling of the opening of an artery, find in the skin in length. Then open the section with a hook, then the artery: and free it from the tunics until it is detected.
Then introduce a hook underneath it, and let it penetrate until it reaches another side, and tighten the artery with double thread in two places, as I have taught you in the extraction of two arteries that are in the temples.
Then pierce the place which is between the two ligaments with a sharp instrument, until blood comes out completely, and break up the aphemia.
Then administer the cure which generates pus, until the ligaments fall: then treat that with suitable unguents, until it heals.
That if there is an aphemia due to the section of a vein, then you must hold your hand so that you do not touch it from the aphemia with skin. Then introduce a hook underneath the place which you held with your hand, and let it penetrate: and let it remain in it a double thread, until you extract it from the other side. Then tie up with it the aphemia with a good ligament: as I have told you in the tying of an artery, from its two parts with its two extremities with thread.
If you are to extract the thread, then introduce a hook with another thread under the aphemia all around the incision of the hook: squeeze, and tighten your threads in four places.
Then dry up the aphemia in the middle of it until there is nothing left inside: then cut off the excess skin, and let go what has been tied to it.
Then put on top of it a little feather which you immersed in wine, and oil. Then administer the cure, which is made with liniments and unguents, until it heals.
Head.
The aphemia that occurred from a twist of the nerves.
As happened to the aphemia in the artery and vein, so it happened to the nerves: which happened from a punch, or from excessive work, and similar: and it happens to them in many places of help, or of heels, and in any place where joints move: and it is a grey aphemia.
The color is similar to that of the rest of his body, and it is in many positions without pain: and when it is stretched with vehemence, he feels in it a similar stupor of weakness.
And there is no swelling in the depth of the body, but it is under the skin, and it moves itself to all parts, and does not feel in front, nor before, nor behind.
What is there on the joints, then, that needs to be rubbed with iron? Perhaps, then, a contraction may happen.
But in that which is on the head, or forehead, find skin with oil. If then there is a small swelling, then hold it with tweezers, and cut it off from the root.
And if it is large, then hang it by a hook, and scrape it off: then take it off, and collect the wound with a stitch: and take care of it, until it heals.
Chapter LI.
Regarding the cutting open of swellings, which occurs in the belly.
Some people often get a kind of fungus in their bellies, and in the rest of their bodies, which they call 'Fungia', because it resembles fungi.
The root is subtle, and the head is large, and their lips are wide apart. And there is a little of it: and there is some that grows very large.
And I have already seen a man, and there were two swellings in his belly, which were more than other things similar to mushrooms; there was no difference between them, white, small-rooted, and their lips were open, and they were projecting, and moisture flowed out of them always.
I therefore cut them open, and I found in weight one as much as eight ounces, and the other as much as six; and their operation is, that you consider then, if the moist is infirm, and the color of the swellings is white, moist, subtile-rooted: then cut them open with a sharp chisel, and let the cauterization be in your presence on fire.
For much blood is expelled during the incision; therefore, if the blood beats you, then cauterize it.
If you see the patient pale and frightened by the incision with the iron, then take a thread from lead which has been made slightly irregular, and tie it with the knot that we have spoken of, and let go of him for two days.
Then add to the string on the lead. Therefore do not cease to tie the lead, when it is tight in the wound, until it has been cut off and falls by itself without working.
But if the lead is thick at the root, then there is some fear and trembling in his incision: especially since it is in the belly.
However, it is possible that you cut off half of it. Then cauterize him so that he does not return.
Then take care of the patient until the wound is healed.
And do not suppose that the lead is incised which is of a dark color, few senses, and an appetizing appearance: for it is an apoplectic cancer: and I have come with a reminder of Cancer after this.
Chapter II.
On the cure of a prominent umbilical hernia.
Hernia can have many causes. Or from a fistula which is above the navel: and comes out of it thin, or of the intestine, according to whether it happens in the other ruptures. Or from blood that flows from a vein, or from an artery, according to what has been said above. Or from a constricted windiness in it.
If, however, it is from a fistula which is above the navel and comes out dirty: then it resembles the color of an apoplectic patient, and is soft, without pain, and appears in various places. And if it is from the exit of the intestine, then its location is with that which we have spoken about, which is more variable in kind. So when you grasp with your fingers, it hides: then it returns, and perhaps there is a sound: and it is greatly magnified at the entrance to the bath, and laborings are heard.
But if indeed it is because of moisture, it is soft; then it does not hide when you grasp it with your hand, nor does it tighten, nor is any added.
Which if it is because of blood, then with these signs appears a patch of bruising to turn blue.
But if it is born of flesh: then it is a bruise, gray, coarse, and it spreads out according to the quantity of one unit.
But if indeed it is because of warmth, then you feel it soft.
And the work on it is this, that you then, if eminence of the umbilical cord is because of blood of an artery, or vein, or warmth: then you must refrain from its cure. For in it is fear and dread, as I taught you in the chapter where I said about bruises because of an artery and a vein.
Which if the eminence of the umbilical cord is because of intestines, or a hernia: then you must order the sick person to hold his breath, and stand upright with his arms outstretched. Then signs with caustics around the umbilical cord throughout. Then order him to lie on his back with your hands under his back. Then with a wisp of tow around the umbilical cord around the spot you marked with caustic. Then extend a middle strip of cloth to the top, with a large hook. Then tie him strongly around the waist with a cord, or with a silk ribbon tightly bound: and let the knot of the binding be unfastened.
Then open the middle strip of cloth that was extended above the ligament. But if you should find him already caught by the ligament: then pull out the binding, and insert your finger into his rectum, and push his intestines into his inside: and if you find a hernia, then take it with a hook, and cut off its surplus.
If, however, the arteries are opposite to each other, or new: then surround it much. Then go on to your operation. And take two needles, and introduce into them two strong threads: and introduce into the two needles that you have made around the clot in the form of a cross, which you make to penetrate.
Then tighten the clot in four places on the needles: and if you want, remove the needle, and leave the place, until the flesh has rotted out: and it will fall of itself: or cut it off when it has become thin and rotten.
Then take care of the wound with the ointment, as much as is necessary, until it heals.
That if eminence of the navel is out of flesh into it, or out of moisture: then you must tighten the clot, as we have said. And draw out blood, or moisture, which you have injected into it.
Then take care of the wound with the ointment to harden the place.
Chapter LIII.
Of the treatment of cancer.
Now we have spoken in the division of the species of cancer, and how it is treated with medicines: and to beware of its cure with iron, so that it does not ulcerate: and we have spoken of cancer generated in the womb, and of the care to be taken in its cure.
And the ancients say that whenever cancer is in a place where it can be eradicated: such as cancer in the breast, or in the thigh, and similar places, from the body by means of an operation to take out all of it: especially when it is just beginning.
When, however, it has been cut away, and is large, you should not approach it.
For I cannot heal it by any means: nor did I see anyone else before me who has cured it.
And the operation on it, when it is located as we have said, is, as it were, a cure for disease from black cholera sometimes. Then phlebotomy him himself if the veins are filled with blood.
Then prepare the sick one with preparation, in which he lies during the operation.
Then throw into the cancer the hooks that fit it. Then cut off the patient from all sides with the blade, following the examination, until nothing remains of his roots: and stop the bleeding, and do not tear him away quickly, but rather squeeze the places, and wipe away the gross blood with your hand, or with whatever is there.
If, however, the blood flow from the incision of an artery or a vein causes you difficulty: then burn the vein, until the blood stops flowing. Then take care of the patient with the rest of the cure, until he is healed.
Of the treatment for hydropsis.
Chapter LIIII. We have already spoken at length about the division of hydropsis into its species and how water is gathered; we will now speak about the signs of each species and how to cure it with medicines.
And that which is cured by means of iron, is not any other species but only a single one: and it does not approach iron for the species timpanitis: nor for the species hyposarcus within the bowels: for that is a mortal illness.
When you have already tried to cure this species of hydropsis with medicines and your treatment has not succeeded: then consider the following. For if the sick one already has a weakness that is added to his hydropsis or other weakness besides the hydropsis: such as if he has a cough, or a fluid-like urine, and similar things: then be careful not to treat him with iron: for there is a fear of this.
But if you see a young person with an excessive amount of vigor, and there is no other illness besides hydropsis: and he is not a boy or an old man: then the mode of operation in him is such that you stand him up straight between your hands, and have someone else press down on his back while he empties his bowels.
Then take a spike-shaped spoon, shaped like this. Take two acute parts, one long and the other sharp at one end like a spike-shaped spoon. However, in it there is something that narrows gradually, so that it does not pierce with it while operating up to the intestines, and does not hurt itself.
Then consider. For if there is a generation of Hydropisis from the part of the intestines, then it should be extended with a cut from the umbilicus by three fingers' width, towards the lower side directly over the spine.
But if there is a generation of Hydropisis due to liver disease: then your section from the umbilicus should be three fingers' width.
And if the generation of it is due to the spleen, then your section on the right side: and it should not also be that it is cut at the place that you want to lay sick, so that there do not run into the weak spot fluids.
Then pierce with a sharp instrument all the skin. Then insert into it the section and spread your hand with the spike-shaped spoon under the skin, as if you were scraping it off: and let the amount that is scraped off be a quantity of a nail, or around that spot.
Then pierce with a needle, until the spike-shaped spoon reaches the empty place: and this is the place of water. Then draw out the flesh, and insert into the hole an instrument like this, which has this shape. And it is like a tube: it is made of silver, or brass, or gold, smooth, sharp: its lower end has a small hole, and on its sides are three holes, two on one side, and one on the other: and its end should be cut at an angle, as you see in a penknife's end, and there is an armlet on it.
For when the instrument reaches water, then it immediately drops onto the instrument, so that it flows out of water at a middle rate.
For if you drain too much from it, a sick person may die at a time when his animal spirit is resolved; or he may die of syncope approaching death.
But drain from it according to the quantity of its power, and according to what I tell you about the dispositions of the nurse from its pulse, and from its goodness.
Then take out the instrument, and retain the water.
That is, because it holds immediately by the skin which holds the orifice which is above the syphons; of which I told you that you should do so and so.
Then take out the instrument again on the other day, if you see the sick one تحمل it well; and also take out from the water the quantity of it which he exhales.
Do it on some days without fear, and guard yourself from error: until there remains in the water only a little.
But if you are to do it on a sick person, and to let go of a lot of water: then take care of him with the grave in the hot sand, and with much sweat in a bath and in the sun, and let him wait for thirst: and take care of him with dried-up medicines, until he is healed: and cauterize over his stomach, and his spleen, and his liver, after drawing out the water: according to what I told you beforehand.
Of the care of infants who are born in places whose openings have not been pierced.
Chapter L.V.
When any child is brought out of its mother's womb, and the top of its head is not pierced, or the hole is tight, or is in an incorrect place.
Then it should be helped with a sharp knife immediately after it is born, with a thin awl, according to this form:
Then put into the hole a little claw made of lead, and tie it up; and hold it for three days, or four.
When he will need to urinate, let him move his head, and let him go. Then reduce the swelling.
And if you do not put lead [plumb], it is now possible that the urine which has flowed over the place, should not allow the wound to close.
But this one whose wound is tight, is treated with lead, as we have said, for many days, until it increases.
But those in whom the wound is not in its proper place, are wounded. That is, because from him who is born, the opening [foramen] is at the end of the penis: so that he cannot urinate [mingere] toward the front, until he raises his penis by hand to the top. And there is no generation in him, therefore semen cannot reach the womb according to its straightness: and it is a foul disease.
And the mode of action in that is, so that the sick one lies down on his back. Then extend the penis of him with your left hand with a quick extension, and cut off the head of the penis from a place near  [ex loco priapi], with an edge, or with a sharp chisel: just as you would cut a wood, or like you cut anything, so that the opening comes in the middle, according to what is necessary.
And cause yourself so that there be no flow of blood during your operation. For that often happens. So do not leave him, and worry about the wound, until he is healed.
As for what happens in the prepuce and at the head of the penis, and corruption, blackness, and adherence.
The head.
For these things often happen in the penis, and there is a swelling of foul flesh.
And from that another bad one comes, and another not bad.
So do not hang the not bad one with a fine hook, and cut it off, until you have completely cleaned it. Then put over it a plaster submerged in Egyptian ointment. Then care for the wound afterwards with unguent of daphnicum, until it is healed.
That if the albather is malicious and of foul color, then you should administer to it a cautery after incising it and its rasp.
But if the albather is captured in the foreskin, uncircumcised, and is a part of the albather inside the foreskin, and a part of it outside: then you should remove the albather which is within first, until when it is consolidated; then care for him from the outside: for when you care for it at the same time, the foreskin is not secured except that it is pierced.
And also happen and in the testes, and blackness of the foreskin and corruption. Therefore, so that you bring together all that which has already been discolored, and what seeks to corrupt, or what is already corrupted:
Then apply a line over the wound after that with honey that has already been crushed with flour of chopped corns, and with herb of three times chopping.
Then care for it with the remaining cure, until it is healed.
But if there happens a flow of blood, then administer a cautery with lunar cautery, according to this form.
For the cautery is right for two things at the same time, that is, for a flow of blood, and for corruption when it seeks to corrupt:
That if it corrodes the head of the penis and destroys all in an hour: then you should introduce into it a plunger of lead, so that the weak one mixes over it.
But in adhering to the foreskin with the head of the penis, and this kind of adhesion does not happen except in that whose foreskin is sound, and it does not require circumcision on top: and when that happens adhesion because of a wart or pustule: then you should cut it out with an dull awl, until it resolves the ligaments, and releases the head of the penis from every part.
If it is difficult to distinguish them closely, then you should cut something from the head of the penis and from the foreskin. That is, because the foreskin, when it is thin, might perhaps pierce quickly because of its thinness.
Then separate between the foreskin and the head of the penis with a thin linen cloth that has already been soaked in cold water so that it does not stick again.
Then bandage with Styptic Wine until it hardens.
Chapter LVII.
The washing of infants and the treatment for them if they make a mistake by accident.
Circumcision is not a cure for continence, as are the other wounds; however, since it is an operation of our art and practice, and its use is proper to boys, we must indicate in it a better method, and introduce a lighter procedure leading to health.
I therefore say that the ancient ones did not speak of circumcision in any of their books; for they do not use it in their laws, and it is only what we have acquired through experimentation.
That is, because I have discovered most of the arts, and the use of phlebotomy for washing, circumcision with a blade and with forceps: and they use leeches, and bind with thread, and cut with a nail.
And I myself have already tested all these methods, and I did not find a better way of washing with forceps and binding with thread.
For in washing with leeches, the skin often escapes. For the foreskin skin has two layers; so perhaps one layer of skin might be cut, and the other protected by the cloth: it is therefore necessary to consider cutting the second layer in order to cause pain. And when washing is done with a leeches' digit, as the surgeons do, the incision at the extreme end of the male organ does not ensure security; for it might well enter into a hole.
In the washing of the feet, perhaps he has an eye on the iron and thus ruins your work: and indeed the skin of the boy is short by nature, and many times it comes like this, so it does not need to be washed: and already I see it.
In the washing of the feet, perhaps he has an eye on the iron and thus ruins your work: and indeed the skin of the boy is short by nature, and many times it comes like this, so it does not need to be washed: and already I see it. As for the cutting with blades and binding with thread, a good experiment has shown me that: for the blade which is above is like the blade which is below: since the sharpness which is above is like the sharpness which is below. Now when you squeeze the hand, two sharpnesses are proportionate and incise one according to the other in one time and place; and it forms a compression of similar shape, containing the skin of the arm from all sides, with which there is no mistake at all.
And the way of the operation is its own, so that you may guess at it, especially if he is one of those who understand a little, which you do not do, unless you tie the thread in his arm only: and you leave him until another day.
Then let him rejoice and be glad in every way as much as possible for you: since he receives understanding of his own. Then let him stand between your hands which are prepared to stand, and not sitting: and conceal the blades in your arm, or under your foot, so that he does not see them at all, nor any of the instruments.
Then put your hand on his arm, and blow into the skin, and pull it up until the head of the arm comes out. Then wash that which has been gathered there by squalor.
Then bind the marked place with a double thread. Then bind the lower part with a little less of that bond than the upper one. Then hold with your index finger, and keep the lower loop well with the thumb, and incise between the two bonds. Then caress the skin gently from top to bottom, and extract the head of the penis. Then allow the blood to flow slowly (for it is better) and place the powder from above: and on top of the powder, a cloth in which the raw flesh has been stretched out, soaked with rose water, rubbed with fresh good oil: and leave it until another day: and take care of the rest by cure, until it is healed.
The shape of the tweezers for cleaning is this.
But the two ends should be flat and joined together: let there be no projection in it like the knuckle of a claw: and let the length of the points be equal to the length of the two hands from the wrist.
But a mistake in the cutting is due to the fact that perhaps all the inner skin will be lost, or a part of it near the incision.
Therefore you should spread it out from your own time with your own nail before the inspection of the place: and lay it down according to equality.
If you cannot hold it with your nail, then remove it with a tweezers and cut it.
If, however, it has passed three days and what is under the penis remains swollen, inspected: then leave it until it has subsided by itself, and with ease remove the scar, and cut it according to your preparation: and caulk you at the head of the penis. For that will not harm him.
Take care, therefore, that this hardens with the powder, which we have mentioned in the book about the powders: and if it is cut from the skin above the line, and rises upward, it will not harm him either.
Take care, therefore, that this has been said, until it is healed.
Chapter LVIII.
Regarding the extraction of the hymen retained in the urethra.
Retentive urethra in the bladder, is due to a deposit made from a stone, or congealed blood, or pus, or flesh born, and similar things from which we have spoken regarding the division of cures.
And if the wound does not heal, and you see that it is because of the stone which has already come to the throat of the esophagus: then it is necessary that he be treated lying on his knees. Then they put his feet on his back, and he extends his belly from the upper part of his back, and strangles the sick man as much as is possible for him to do. It is considered that with the esophagus up to expulsion of the stone towards the back: why does Vrina heal?
That if it does not heal with that which we have said, and the disease is on the sick man: then it is necessary that you administer extraction with a tool, which is called a syringe, whose this is the form It is of silver, and is fine, soft, and smooth like a feather's tube in subtlety of its radius, long in similarity of the palm of one hand and half of it: which has a thin tube at the end.
And the way out of Vrina through itself is that you take a doubled thread, and tie it well at its end with wool or cotton, knot: and you insert the end of the thread into the lower part of the syringe: and you strike with pliers if there is anything that comes out of the wool, really insert into the tube with caution, like raising.
Then dip the syringe in oil, or in butter, and in alum powder: and make him sit on a seat, and immerse the esophagus, and his thread with wet oils, and olive oil, and warm water.
Then insert the syringe into the thread with ease, until it reaches the root of the thread.
Then double yourself above from the navel part.
Then push the syringe into itself until it reaches the bladder, and feel that the sick man has already reached the vacant part: and this does not happen according to this order unless because of the meatus in which you inject, is in which there is a curvature.
Then extend the thread with wool gradually. Then the thread follows the wool.
Then pull it out, and let the thread run along the urethra: and repeat this movement, and do not stop doing so until the urine is discharged, and the discomfort is relieved.
A discussion of the quality of cleansing the bladder with a clepsydra.
Chapter LIX:
When a sore happens in the bladder, or blood freezes up in it, or pus is contained in it, and water and medicines are to be distilled into it: then do with the instrument which is called a clepsydra, and this is its form:
It is a closed vessel. And in it are three openings, two on one side, and one on the other side, like you see them.
And the cavity where the push rod is located should be behind the quantity that it draws up without adding anything, until when it is pulled out with it something is drawn out from the moisture: and when it is pushed, it expels it far away: and this is what the clepsydra does, it throws out naphtha, that is, Greek fire in battles of war.
When you then pour the water into the bladder, introduce the end of the clepsydra into the water, and pull out with it what pushes up, for the water is drawn out into the cavity of the clepsydra: indeed, what pushes up is pushed out with it.
Then introduce the end of it into the penis, as we have described in the syringe. Then push the water with it, which, as we have said, goes into the bladder immediately: so that he feels the discomfort.
The form of a light clepsydra with which the bladder is cleansed.
Let it be made of silver or brass; and let its handle be higher than the base, similar to an almond nut, and under it a pocket for the spring which pulls out:
Then take the wool from the sheep and put moisture on it, so that it becomes like a sponge. Then bind it between two loops of strong thread: and warm it slightly with moisture over the fire.
Then introduce the tip of the clister into the penis; afterwards grasp the wool with your hand over the wound with the moisture constricted, until the patient feels that the moisture has reached the wool.
But if you do not have present wool, then take a fragment of parchment, and make it into a circle, and pierce it from all its roundedness. Then introduce a strong thread into those pores, as they rotate. Then gather the circle together, as it is gathered also with yarn: and then you put on it that which you have prepared from moisture, oils, and water.
Then bind him to the instrument: and do with him as you did with wool from the expression with your hand, until the moisture reaches the wool.
CHAPTER LX.
The Extraction of a Stone.
We have spoken in the division of species of stone, and the treatment thereof with medicines; and I have described the difference between stone formed in the kidneys, wool, and the signs of all these things: I also spoke of the operation that takes place by hand and its section; and this stone that is formed in the wool is particular to itself; and that which is figured on the thorn, and I am telling it with a clear exposition and abridgment.
I say, then, that stone formed in the wool mostly happens to boys.
And of the signs of it is that urine is discharged from the wool similar to water in its fineness: and it appears in it white sand, and it grates on the man's penis, and struggles with it, and often hangs down. Then it stands up, and passes with it the anus in many cases.
Healing is easy for boys until they reach the age of fourteen years. And it is difficult in the elderly. In youths it is moderate, for it lies between that and this; and cure is easier when the stone is small: if it is large, then the cure is difficult.
When we come to the cure, it is necessary at first that we should remove the dirt from within with a clister, which draws out all the dung that is in the intestines: for this often prevents the appearance of the stone during examination.
Then let the sick man take his feet and bend, and move towards the lower parts: so that the stone may go down into the depths of the bladder, or sometimes may come out from its high place.
Then let him sit between your hands, prepared like this, and his knees under his thighs, so that the bladder may all go down towards the lower parts.
Then examine him, and touch him from outside.
If you feel the stone in a space, then immediately approach it with your knife from above.
If it does not fall under your touch at all, then you should wipe the finger of the index with oil from your left hand, if the sick boy is a child: or the middle finger if he is a full youth: and let him insert himself in some part of his body, and examine the stone, until it rests under your finger: and gradually turn it towards the neck of the bladder.
Then press on it with your finger, and push it towards the outside against the place where you want to make the incision, and order one minister to grasp the bladder with his hand, and another minister to spread out the testicles with his right hand, from above: and with a third hand, let him remove the skin, which is under the testicles in the part where the incision is to be made.
Then introduce the scalpel, whose shape is thus: And find in it what is between the testicles and something else, and not in the middle, at the side of birth on the left: and the section above it, and your finger be in the anus: and let the section be turned around, so that the section be wide outside, and strict inside, according to the quantity that it is possible for the stone to come out of it, not bigger.
For perhaps the finger which is in the anus compresses the stone at the section and comes out without difficulty.
And know that from the stone there are angles and edges, therefore it is difficult for him to come out because of that.
And from it is soft, similar to a gland, and round: and the exit of him is easy.
So then who have angles and edges, add in the crack.
That if it does not come out like this, then you should use the tool on top: or tighten it with a twisted hand, whose tip is as the moon, which tightens over the stone, and does not rub against it: or so that you introduce a thin instrument below it, with curved extremities.
If you can't do it on top, then widen the hole slightly. That if he hurts you with any of his blood, cut him off with a blade.
If the stone is more than one, then push it into the first big hole at the nose. Then cut on top of it. Then push a little behind it, and likewise do if there are two or more.
That if he is very big, then ignorance is how to cut over the stone with a large section. Since it has happened to one of the two things, or that he dies, or that there is a regular release of urine: soon, because the place does not consolidate at all.
But give him an expulsion, until he comes out: or use tools to break it open, until you take it out quickly.
When you have therefore finished your operation, then fill the ulcer with thur, and aloe, and dragon's blood: and bind it tight, and place over it a cloth dipped in oil and wine, or in rose-water, and cold water: that an apostema may be dried up by the heat.
Then wrap the patient's neck tightly, and do not separate the ligaments until the third day. When you have undone him, put much oil and water in the place.
Then cure him with the ointment of daphnes and the ointment of basil, until he is healed.
If however an apostema of heat is added, and corroded, and similar things: such as if the blood congeals in a bladder, and urine is prohibited from it: and it is known from the exit of blood with urine. Then put your hand into the ulcer, and draw out the blood. For if any remain, it provokes the corruption of the bladder, and the putrefaction thereof.
Then wash the ulcer with vinegar, and water, and salt: and oppose to it all that is convenient out of the cure, until it is healed.
And it is necessary in the hours of the cure, that the two hips and the joints be bound on, for those medicines which are put over the place.
That if the stone be small and is in the meatus of the urethra, and does not pass by itself, and stops the passage of urine: then cure him with it before you come to a section. For many times from the section you will be excused with this treatment, for I have tried it already.
And there is, that you take the perforator out of iron-hardened iron, which has this form, triangular extremities, acute, fixed on a piece of wood.
Then take a thread, and bind it with the urethra under the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
Then introduce the piercing iron into the penis with ease, until it reaches its rock: and remove the piercing iron from your hand, little by little, on that rock: and feel the piercing, until you make him pierce from the other side.
Then urinate immediately.
Then press your hand on that which remains of the rock from the outside of the penis. For it itself is broken, and it comes out with urine, and the sick one is healed.
But if this treatment has not been prepared for you because of something that forbids it from him: then tie a string under the rock, and another string above the rock. Then dry on the rock in the middle between the two ties. Then remove him. Then solve the tie, and cleanse the frozen blood which has formed in the wound.
And it is not necessary to tie the string under the rock unless you want to return it to the wound: and a string above, unless when the string is untied after the rock has come out, it returns to its place, and covers the wound, as we have said. For this reason it is necessary for you to tie the upper string, so that you raise the skin to its height, so that it returns to its place, and covers the wound, as we have said: and because of this necessity you must untie the lower string when you wish to return it, in order that the skin may return to its place, and cover the wound, as we have said.
Chapter LXI.
On the Extracting of the Stone from Women.
A stone does not form much in women.
But if a stone should happen to any of them, then the treatment is difficult, and is forbidden on account of many causes.
One of these is that the woman may be a virgin.
And the second is that you should not touch a woman who is a doctor when she is chaste, or among those who have husbands.
And the third is that you should not touch a woman who knows this art well, especially the manual operation.
The fourth is the distance from the stone: why does it require deep cutting, and there is fear in that.
If necessity compels you to do so, then you should take a female physician who is well-versed in it: and there is little found.
But if you are concerned about it, then ask a well-versed male physician, subtle, and present a female obstetrician who is well-versed in the matter of women, or a woman who is skilled in this art part: do so, and especially to him, that he may do all that you command him concerning the stone.
First of all, if she is a virgin, then he should let his finger touch her private parts and feel the stone.
But if he finds it, he should let his finger slide into the opening and then instruct the obstetrician to put his own finger inside the woman's vagina and feel for the stone, after he has placed his left hand on her lower back, and squeezes it with a good grip.
But if he finds the stone, then he should gradually move it from the opening of the vagina to the lower part with all his strength, until he reaches it with the root of the pelvis.
Then he should cut above it on the opening of the middle part of the vagina near the root of the pelvis, from whichever side it is prepared and feels the stone in that part: and let his finger not move from the stone, holding it under: and first make a small incision. Then he should insert his finger above that cut on the opening of the middle part of the vagina near the root of the pelvis:
Then he should insert his finger above that cut on the opening of the middle part of the vagina near the root of the pelvis: If he feels the stone, then he should add to that cut a quantity that is proportionate to how much the stone moves out of it.
And you should know that there are many kinds of stones. For some are small and big, some hard and sharp, some long and round, having branches.
Know his nature, so that it may be made clear to you by this regarding what you see.
If therefore the blood annoys you, then put three layers of cloth in the place and hold it for an hour, until the blood is dried up.
Then go back to your work until the stone has come out: and make ready all the instruments which I have said are necessary for taking out a stone from the bladder, that you may help yourself with them during your work.
That if the blood annoys you, and you know that the escape of the blood is from the artery which has been cut: then put powder on the place, and press it down with a pressure coming on gradually: and do not change that; and let go of the stone, and do not draw out the same. For perhaps the woman would die if she were weakened. Then take care for the wound.
When however keenness of the blood has passed and the place has become putrid, then go back to your work until the stone has come out.
Chapter LII.
Regarding the cutting through the hernial hool: with water.
The ramet is not wet with water, but there is a gathering of moisture in the sheath of the scrotal skin which contains one: and it is called a sheath.
And when it is in its own bag which nature has prepared for it in its own part, until it puts out: that is another thing, and that skin of the testicles between the sheath is white, which I have said: and does not come about except rarely.
And the generation of this ramet comes from the weakness which happens to the testicles: why this substance is poured out on them. And when it comes about from a blow on the testicles.
And this moisture is having many colors. Or indeed the color of its discharge is in the direction of citrinism, or it is bloody red, or fecundous, black, or it is white and watery, and that which is more so.
And the signs by which one knows where the aggregation of water is, are these. For if it is in the scrotum or what we have said, then the swelling is round and of almost the same length as the figure of a circle: and the testicle does not show because the moisture holds it from all sides.
And if there is moisture in the pouch to itself, then the swelling is round with a part, and for this reason one estimates man because he is another.
And if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white scrotum, then it hangs down.
When you want to know the color of the moisture, then feel the color of the swelling with the square inserted, whose shape preceded. Accordingly, because it is withdrawn into the pocket of the insertion, judge about it that it is between itself.
When we have come to the cure with iron, then it is necessary that you order the sick person to have blood let if possible, and you will see his body full.
Then he should lie on his back on a high thing slightly, and put many cloths under him.
Then you should sit on his left side, and order the minister to sit on his right side, who will extend his penis towards one or two sides of the skin of the testicles, and towards the side of the scrotum.
Then take a wide spatula, and dry the skin of the testicles from the middle towards the back along its length: and make the incision according to the equidistant line that divides the skin of the testicles, until it reaches the white scrotum encompassing it: and examine the scar, or rather let go of it, so as to cut it off: and sit your scar in such a way that he is cut off from the part which hangs with the hair more: and carefully look at it with the scar according to the quantity that you can.
Then pierce the full scrotum with a wide water-perforation, and take out all the water.
Then separate the two labia of the incision with a hook, and extend the knife upward, and do not touch the skin encompassing the testicles: and cut the skin however it is possible for you to cut it, be it completely or in part, especially its thin side. For if you do not examine it carefully, there will be no security in the incision, but water shall run out of it.
But if he should move outward from his skin during the time of your operation: then, when you have completed the incision of the skin, reduce him. Then gather together the two skin folds of the testicles with a stitch.
Then take care of him as you would of other wounds, until he heals.
That if the skin of his penis should become corrupted by another color, then it is necessary that you bind with ligatures, which are suspenders, fearing the flow of blood.
Then cut off the testicle with the suspender, and remove the penis: then take care of it with that which we have said.
But if water is aggregated on the two sides, then you should know that there are two branches: so dry one half according to what you have done to the other, equally.
And if it is equal for you, so that the operation shall be one, then do as follows: then wash away the blood. And introduce into the incisions a wool dipped in oil, or in oil rosated: and place another piece of wool which you have dipped in wine and oil over the two testicles, and press it down with your fingers: and place above it double cloth, and make it thin: and bind it above with a ligature, which has six threads according to this form.
Then take two cloths, and bind them together, and fill them with carminated wool, according to this similarity: and may the ends which are pressed by the cloth be placed behind the shoulders of the arms, or wet wool: and may they be agregate with a stricture in the lumbars of the arms: and one end may take hold over some until the back, and the other end may take hold to the side of the chin: and may the two ends take hold under the two hips, and the other end may take hold to the two inguinas, and may they be agregate with a stricture in the lumbars of the arms.
And sometimes this wire is artificially treated with a cautery at the site of the section with an iron tool; and it is as if you take a sharp cautery knife and separate the skin of the testicles from it: and it is ignited, according to what we have said: until the time when it is removed from the white sifac that contains water: then take the cautery, according to this form.
It assimilates Greek letters.
Then pierce that sifac with it, and it is ignited until all the moisture is gone out.
Then spread that sifac with a hook, and scrape it with a sharp cautery, and cut it as much as you can do, until you have removed all of it.
And let the fire not touch him.
And you should know that this operation is more beneficial, and farther from the flow of blood, and better than the operation with a section.
If, however, it causes you contrariety in the hour of the section, or in the hour of the cautery, hot swelling, blood flow, or anything else: then you should do what contradicts it with the cure that is appropriate for it, according to what has been stated.
If, however, he is timid and does not wait for this operation, because of its horror: then administer the perforation according to what I tell you: and that is enough.
When it is certified to you by that which we have said about the meanings of the wire, that it is an aqueous one: then you should make the sick person sit on an elevated seat.
Then pierce the swelling in the lower part of his body with a sharp tool; and place the perforation according to the length of the body, and make it an open space that is wide enough until all the water runs out.
Then put a cloth over the site, and tie it up, and let him go so that he can drain off the remaining water: then take care of the injury, until the wound heals.
If, however, there is an obstruction to the outflow of water at the time you pierce it: and this should not be done except for that reason, because the white flap [of fat] causes an obstruction in the wound-hole and prevents the exit of water: then you must insert a feather into the wound or a tool with which the water is withdrawn from the hydropic [wound], whose shape preceded it: or add something to the operation of the wound.
And know that water returns, and is added after six months, or about them. When it is added then it returns in the same way, and the sick person will spend his days.
Chapter LIII.
On the care of the ramulus carnosus.
You should know that in this section on the ramulus, it is from fear of losing its head and it will lead to harm in several dispositions. Therefore I leave him to my healing.
And I remember the operation on it, and the appearance of the apotheosis.
I say then that many things happen in the bodies from which the testes are composed: and it is made from many causes, namely.
Or from acute or bitter effluxion that flows into the testes. Or from a blow.
And the color of the apotheosis is according to the color of the body, and it is not felt that there is any pain: and the apotheosis is gray.
And perhaps it is a stone apotheosis, whose color is dark, and there is no feeling of it.
And sometimes it is from the swelling of the arteries, and the inflammation of the veins: as it has already recalled: or from the inflammation of the venae.
That which is from those things from the swelling of the arteries is known by the disposition of the apotheosis, when you squeeze it with your fingers. And you should not touch it completely.
That which is made from the inflammation of the veins does not emit anything by touching with the fingers.
It is also possible that a section be made on this form and on the remaining flesh: and it is as if you were to cut off the skin of the testicles. Then extend your hand up and remove it with the string or thong: and free the suspension from the river, and tie the river: and cut the suspension after you have freed it from all parts of the body's sides.
So if your consolidated hand is with those flesh-bearing hands, then you must attract your hand and cut it.
And if the attachment is between some of the thongs or in that which is between the river: then you must free all that attachment and cut it with a round incision.
But if the birth of flesh is in the place of attachment which is behind: then you must cut all of it and remove your hand, as we have said.
When your operation is complete, then fill the wound with wool infused with rose oil and wine: and then take care of the wound with the remaining cure, until it heals.
Chapter LXXIV.
De the cura for the vine ramification.
The use is a blisters-like swelling that is somewhat swollen with a soft skin, similar to the blisters of the testicles: and it becomes difficult on the part of weak motion and exercise, and walking.
And in the cure for this sickness is from fear, because of which the memory of its predecessor.
But it is necessary that we say the operation in her according to what did the first.
I say, that you should make the sick person sit on an elevated seat. Then push the suspension of the testicles to the lower. Then hold the skin of the testicles with your fingers, with the river that is next to the shaft: and it should be held by another minister, and extended with an extension of a fierce.
Then cut with a sharp chisel-like chisel in the straight direction of the river, until the suspension is detected.
Then remove the scabs from all parts, as we have told you in the extraction of the arteries which are in the temples.
Then tie them together with a double thread, and tie it again at the first place where the thread enters the veins, and again at the last of them. Then dry them in a straight line in the middle section for the length of the body, and remove what has accumulated from the corrupting moisture.
Then care for the wart with the cure of the other wounds, so that the warts do not grow again and damage the scrotum which nourishes one testicle. It is not wrong because of that.
If, however, all the veins are cut off, then they should remove them for this reason from the testicles with the veins: so that they do not be deprived of their nourishment, because of the incision, and do not scar or dry up, and are not injured with them.
Chapter LVI
As for the cure of intestinal worms.
The end of this worm is from a section which occurs in the large intestine near the navel on the inner side of the thigh below the groin.
Why do the intestines come out from that break towards one testicle? And this break is either from a tear, or from the length of the intestine.
And these two types of causes occur for many reasons: either from a blow, or from a fall, or from a noise, or from lifting a heavy thing, and similar things.
And the sign, when it is from the length of the intestine. It is that which happens gradually over a long period of time, and not suddenly; and it is a bulge that is equal to the depth: because the intestine is compressed by the tear.
And the sign of it is when it is from a tear in the intestine, because it makes a sudden sharp pain from its beginning: and it is a bulge that is different, visible under the skin nearby; and this is because of the exit of the intestine, and the course of the intestine to the outside of the tear.
And when it is removed with a sharp blade: and this is called the intestinal ramus, and the zirbum: and sometimes it is done with a sharpness.
And sometimes it runs into the stool, and is retained there: and it is with it that the disease of the bowels is precipitated: for it causes pain before, and especially when it is pressed.
And in the cure of the disease of this kind there is a danger with iron: so that care should be taken to prevent a setback in it.
And the mode of operation is, that you may instruct the sick person to reduce his intestine by his own hand to the interior part of his cavity, if he obeys the return. Then it shall be raised on its back between your hands: and wash its legs.
Then extend the skin that follows the skin up to the back, and dry the whole skin of the testicles by its length. Then fix in two lips of the incision hooks, according to which it should be opened by the length: and the section should sit according to the quantity, that it may be possible for it to come out of it with its omentum.
Then scrape the siphons, and what is under the skin of the testicles, until it is detected when it gets white, firm from all parts: then introduce your index finger into it that follows the testicle, in that which is between the white siphons, which is under the skin, and between the second siphons, and release with it the adhesion which is in the back part of the scrotum.
Then move with the right hand to the inner skin of the testicles: and when this is done, extend the white siphons up, with the left hand: and wash the omentum with the siphons at the side of the section: and order the minister, that he should raise the omentum up: and you will release the adhesion, which is behind by the complete removal.
And examine your fingers, that there may not be anything left of the intestine in the siphons or hard. If however there is an injury from him: then push him towards the lower venter.
Then take hold of the acme, where sits a thick filament, made from ten fils: and insert it between the last sifach, that is, the tunica, which is beneath the skin of the testicles, which follows the incision: then cut off the extremities that protrude from the filament, until there are four fils. Then join together some of them with the figure which sits in the form of a cross: and tie them up with alsifach, of which we have spoken, because it is under the skin of the testicles, ligamentum vehementi, until there is no possibility that any of the veins, which nourish them, should send anything to them: so that no apostema of heat does not occur. And put again the second ligature, distant from the first by two fingers' length. And after these two ligatures have been released from the sifach, which is under the skin of the testicles, a quantity equal to the length of a finger: and cut off all the rest, following its curvature, and take out one.
Then dry up in the lower part of the skin of the testicles, from which runs blood and pus: as we have told you before.
Then administer wool soaked in oil, and place it on a mandrel: and administer the ligature which we have described. And when the white sifach, which we have spoken of, is cauterized after the incision has been made, to the effect that there is no flow of blood. This often happens. And release the ligature until it falls away by itself.
But if its fall is delayed, then steep it in warm water: and place on it the one which we have spoken of, until it falls away.
Then take care of the mandrel with the remaining curing of the wound, until it is cured.
of the ramie
The ramie
In Hac Ramice non vidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.
And first of all they said that it was done as we have reported in Ramis which is with the vine. That is, so that the ligatures are used after the section on her with ease from below: then cut in the middle, and heal afterwards with it as it opens itself, until they fall off: and heal the wound, according to what we have said, until it heals.
Chapter LVII.
Regarding the section that was made in the groin.
When a rupture occurs in the groin, as we have said, and a place is made, and does not go down to the testicles any part of the intestines: and if it goes down, it is little, and comes back again at all times: indeed if it is prolonged for a long time, a fissure is added to the sifach, until the intestines go down into the sifach.
And that happened because of the extension of the sifach, which is in the groin, as we have said. That is, because it extends the sifach: then it softens, and a place is made, and it emerges.
And the treatment of that is with a poultice, as preceded by its report.
And sometimes it is treated with iron, in this way: and it is so that the sick person lies on his back between your hands. Then cut off the place of the rupture, which has been made and is emerging, by cutting across the width, according to the quantity of the three fingers.
Then tighten the ligature and, which are under the skin, until when it is taken off there is the white sifach, which is under the skin that follows it.
Then take a ray, and put the member on the place that emerges from the sifach, and press the member towards the deep of the groin.
Then cut off two place that are emerging on the end of the ray from the sifach, and join them together with a stitch: then remove the end of the ray.
And do not hit the patient with anything at all, nor stretch him out, nor anything else, as I told you to know about the cure of intestinal worms.
Then the care of that wound. How then do you hit the lines, clean it out, and restore the break, until it heals over.
For Sisach is struck against, and no excellence is added to Rupture.
And the cauterization is better in this place: for it is nearer to health.
Chapter LVIII.
Regarding the softening of the skin of the testes.
The skin of the testes is often softened in certain men, because the flesh between them becomes soft and the appearance of it is changed.
Therefore it is necessary for him who is asked to care for himself, that he lie down on his back, and hit all the softened skin on top of the natural skin.
Then he should gather together two lips with a stitch: and if the patient wants it, in the first place three stitches of the softened skin, or four, and a firm stitch.
Then hit between the stitches.
Then care for the cure of the other wounds, until they are healed, and the lines drop out.
Chapter LIX.
Regarding castration.
You should know that castration is excommunicated in our law: and because of it I will remind myself not to mention it in this book: but its reminder is only necessary for two reasons.
One reason is that it be in the knowledge of a doctor when he is questioned about it: and so that he knows how to cure himself if it happens to him.
The other reason is that we often do not want to castrate certain animals for our own good, as sheep, horses, and cats and similar animals.
I therefore say that castration is done in two ways. By means of friction. Or by splitting open.
In that which was made by friction, the method of operation is this: that we make the animal sit in hot water, until his testes become soft and lax and hang down: then do you spread them open with your hand, until they have healed and are no longer apparent to the touch.
In castration by splitting open and cutting, you must hold the animal, and press the skin of his testes with your left hand.
Then bind the suspender and dry up all one side of the cut, until when they come forward both two hairs: then cut them after you have scrubbed them so that there is nothing left but a thin skin, which is over the line.
And this method of castration is better than that which was done by friction: for friction may have left something behind from the testes, whereby the animal desires to have sex.
Then take care of the wound, until it heals.
Head
Of the treatment of hermaphrodite the two ways.
Hermaphrodites come from testes, second by two ways. A man is born of testes, second by two ways. One is because it appears in him that follows the space, or in the skin of the testes, in that it stands between the two testes, figure like a woman's pubis, and when he runs urine comes from it which is in the skin of the testes.
But in women there is one species, and it is a woman's pubis over the spine like a man's small testes, prominent to the outside: of which one is like a man's penis, and two like two testes.
And the cure of the three species, two of testes, and one of women, is this: for you must cut off the flesh that has been added, until the impression of them disappears. Then take care of the remaining wounds.
Yet regarding the second sex, from which urine flows, which is on the testes skin, there is no operation or cure at all.
Chapter LXXI: On the Incision of the Hymenal Membrane
Regarding incisions of the hymen and prominent flesh on the vulva of women.
If the hymen is strengthened by being sewn on to the natural place until it grows and looks bad; and sometimes it becomes beautiful in some women so that it spreads like a man's member and reaches all the way up to intercourse.
Therefore you should hold back the hymen with your hand, or with a hook, and cut it off; and do not cut it at all, especially deep at the root; so that blood does not flow.
Then care for this wound, after cutting, until it heals.
Yet the central flesh, which is born in the opening of the mother's womb, until it fills itself up; and perhaps it flows out on the outside according to the resemblance of a tail: and because of this some call sickly what has a tail. Therefore you should cut it off as we cut the hymen and care for it until it heals.
Regarding the treatment of the clitoris, which is a woman'
Chapter LVII: On the Treatment of the Clitoris
The Alratica is such that it is a woman' And it is either natural or accidental.
The accidental one is from an illness that precedes it; and the same one becomes either from flesh born, added, or filth with a thin blade; and it forms either deep in the mother' belly, or in her sides, or above or below her: and it prevents coitus and impregnation, and birth, and perhaps menstruation.
And understanding of this is obtained by an obstetric examination, if the discharge is apparent nearby.
But if it is not apparent, then feel it with your fingers, or with a ray of light.
If, however, the wound is deep and close to the lips: then bring it closer, and remove it.
And let it be placed on two lips of the pulley.
Then place your fingers of both hands simultaneously, and let the woman sit with her legs spread on her back. Then open two lips with force, until the subtle wound is removed, and the discharge is opened.
Then take a piece of wool, soak it in oil, and place it on the spot: and let the woman sit for all time, so that the site does not become inflamed with another source.
If, however, the wound is thick and dense: then it must be separated with a similar leaf of myrrh.
If, however, the discharge is born of flesh: then hang it with a hook, and cut it: and let there be with you the medicines that will stop the flow of blood without scratching, such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and thus the aggregate with alumen and resin.
Then administer a large copper tube, so that the wound does not heal quickly, let it remain for several days: and administer milk of wheat, then treat the rest with the cure, until it heals.
And when the birth of flesh comes about in the mother: it is necessary that they be injured according to this method: while there is no scald-flesh of the cancerous type, for the cancerous one is in the mother and does not oppose iron at all.
Chapter LIII.
Of the cure for hemorrhoids, Athahelil, and Boethor of the red rub on any wound in a woman.
Hemorrhoids are an opening of the anal orifice, from which runs a lot of blood constantly.
So when hemorrhoids are treated, they become thin: and I have already spoken in the division of their types and their signs, and I will tell here those that receive the cure from them, and those who do not.
I say that those hemorrhoids which are in the opening of the womb and do not seem to hurt: then there is no cure for them with iron.
But these which are outside the opening of the womb and fall on it, are those which heal.
Therefore let the woman enter into a cold house. Then extend the atharel with forceps, or with an coarse cloth, and cut them from their roots.
Then powder them on top of the flow of blood from one wound that has been powdered without killing: as acacia, and dragon's blood, and thorns, and similar things to them.
Then push her feet against the wall at a time. Then put her into cold water.
If the blood flow persists: then let her sit in a decoction of sumach, and of saltpetre, and of gall, and of similar things.
Then take barley flour, and make a poultice with honey and vinegar, and make a pad with it and put it on her back.
But if blood comes out with it, then it is good: and if not, then let it adhere to the back of the woman, and stinging nettle, without scarifying.
Then take wool and dip it in tarathrus (taraxacum), or in the juice of arnoglossa, or in the juice of alder branches, that is, glans, in Pontic wine, and let it adhere to her thigh.
But when the poultice has dried, then take care of the place with ointment, until it heals.
Albarth is really similar to red capillary hair, and is harsh in appearance.
Therefore let him cut what appears, according to what I said about the teeth being equal: and take care of it, until it heals.
Chapter LXXII
Regarding exit wounds that occur in the womb:
Appear in the womb many kinds of poultices, such as cancer, and stone poultices, and sores, and pustules, and blisters, and herpes, and colic, and fistulas, and hemorrhoids, and ulcers, and warts, and teeth.
And I have said already all these diseases and their kinds, and the signs of them, and the cures of them separately: it is necessary that I say in this treaty about a hot apoplexy which happens in the mother when she is from apoplexies which gather her blood, and to know how it is done its opening with iron.
It is therefore necessary that you should consider. Then if the pain of the apoplexy in its beginning is acute with its percussion, and flame, and fever: and you see it red: if it falls on it, then do not suit with its perforation: and cure it with that which it endures over maturation, until when it rests the sharpness of accidents.
Then it is necessary that you should make the woman sit on a seat which she will cover, and recline, or lie down on her back, and put her feet at the side of the lower leg: and let her hips be expanded, and let her put her arms under her knees, and tie each band to it.
Then the midwife shall sit on the right side, and administer the instrument by which the opening of the womb is opened.
And it is necessary that when you administer this instrument, you should keep the mother's womb closed with a sharp implement: so that it does not enter into the instrument more than the depth of the womb, and does not wound the sick woman.
But if the instrument is more than the depth, then it is necessary that you should put a layer over the depth of the womb: so as to prevent the entrance of the instrument into all of the depth of the womb: and it is necessary that you should put a turner which runs in the instrument from the upper side: and that he holds the instrument, and that he turns the turner, until the depth of the womb is opened.
When it then appears that the birth is approaching, and touches with its hand, and is soft and smooth: then it is necessary that you should separate it from its head with a wide spatula.
When then the pus is drained, then it is fitting that you place a piece of licorice root submerged in rose oil: or oil of yellow wormwood, in which there is some styptic; and place the licorice root, and extract a piece from the deep matrix.
And place outside on the matrix, and over it a clean woolen cloth soaked in water, in which have been boiled some mallows.
Then let the wound be treated after two days with the ointment that is suitable for it, until healed.
And when the wound and scar are washed away, so that they clump together with water and honey: then with water in which have been boiled lily roots or long aristochnema: then return to the ointment.
That if the scar is hidden within the matrix, then it is fitting that you refrain from treating it with iron, but rather tend to it itself with what we have said regarding division.
Chapter 70.
¶ Doctrine on Obstetrics, how the embryos are treated by the womb, according to a not-natural exit.
It is necessary for the midwife to recognize first of all the figure of a natural birth.
From these signs then it is known that when you see a woman compressing herself towards the lower parts, and desiring to breathe air, and being relieved on her when birth approaches, and hastening of the exit of the fetus: then know that this birth is according to a natural figure, and its exit is above her head, and second with it: or hanging, or pendent from the umbilical cord.
When then you see these signs, then it is fitting that you compress her belly, so that the fetus descends quickly.
For when it has descended above its head, it descended second with it, and is cleansed from it by good cleansing.
But if this birth is beyond this, it is unnatural, unacceptable.
For when the fetus has exited on his feet, and the body of it has come out before the head of it, and the feet of it, and the hands of it one or two: or has exited the head of it and the hands of it: or has exited the navel: and perhaps has turned over its neck, and similar figures that are unacceptable.
It is therefore necessary that the Obstetrician be prudent in all these matters and guard against error and deception; and I will show you all the figures of these, and how the art works in each case, and what it means by them, and I will explain it clearly.
When the fetus has come out by its natural way of birth, and has risen on top of the woman, and her delivery is difficult, and you see her strength already weakened: then let her sit on a chair, or let the women hold her; and pour over her with foenugreek decoction, and with wet oils.
Then the midwife shall insert her fingers between the woman's labia, and find with them the second child, and dry it up with her nail, until she has taken away what is in it of moisture; and she shall press the woman's womb, until the child comes down.
If then it does not come down, then it is necessary that the woman be clensed with a clister of foenugreek, with sise-seed oil.
Then command her to compress herself after the clister; and make her sneeze with a handkerchief, and hold her nose and mouth at the same time. For the child will come out immediately.
What if two hands of the child have gone out first; then it is necessary that you reduce them with ease little by little. But if it does not obey in going in, then put the woman on a chair, and raise her feet up; then bring the chair down onto the ground: and let the woman hold herself so that she does not fall by the concussion.
But if then the hands do not come out, and the child dies: then make an incision and remove the residue of the child; and tie his hand with a cloth, and pull it out with equality: for he will come out.
The exit of the child is at its feet. When the fetus has come out by its feet, then it is necessary that you push them up; and then turn the child little by little; afterwards, make it even.
Then he should take one of his feet and stretch it out gradually.
When he has thus come out as far as the hips, then command him to compress and make him sneeze with the bandage on: for he will go out, if God wills it.
And if he does not come out with him when we have described it, then reduce the fetus gradually until you put it back in its natural shape. For he will go out then on an easy exit.
That if he is prohibited from doing the whole thing which we have described: then take a ball of aloe vera and oil of sesame and a dissolved gum: and beat it all up in a mortar with a good beating: then take the line with him as a woman's cry, and his lower legs. Then make him sit in warm water until he gets a hypochondriacal condition.
When you see that his lower legs are now heated, then make him apply myrrh to them: and let him lie down. When he has thus held the myrrh for an hour, then make him sit on a seat. Then make her sneeze: and tighten her mouth and nose: and apply a gentle compression to the lower part of her legs. For the fire will come out at once.
Exit of the fetus over the knees and hands. When he has come out in this form, then insert your hands gradually. Then the woman shall rise up on her neck and hang her feet down to the ground: and she herself shall lie on a bed and join her hands. Then squeeze above her navel gradually. Then pull out what is under her feet from the toenails until it is ready in the lower part. That if the fetus does not come out, then take his feet and move them violently. Then squeeze what is above the hypochondriac gradually until the fetus rises up towards the upper part. Then insert your hand and slowly massage the fetus; and order the woman to squeeze, until the fetus comes out.
The exit of the fetus hangs downward between the hands. Take hold of his hands in order to pull him down. If he cannot be reduced, then take away from her, and let her walk.
But if she cannot walk, then let her lie down on a bed; and with a vigorous shaking, shake her legs.
Then apply the ointment you have prepared from mucus.
If she accepts it, then let her sit on a chair. Then study to pull his hands, and arrange the fetus according to its natural form; and order her to sneeze, and tell her to squeeze herself, until he comes out.
The exit of the fetus is over his neck, with spread hands, and its face is toward the back of its mother's body. It is necessary that the midwife hold the fetus by the hand; then rotate him little by little, and stretch him with ease.
But when it is even, then place it on a blanket that we have described made of oil and mucus.
Then order her to move little by little. But when you have done that, then let her sit on a chair, and order her to lean to the right side. Then order her to squeeze; and make her sneeze with a pinch.
The prepared exit of the fetus is on the side. When it went down to the opening of the mother according to this method with a second, then cut the second with your fingernail, until it is discharged from moisture.
But if he hangs over the face of the fetus and his neck, then cut it from the navel: so that he does not remain, and he dies.
Then push the fetus into the insides, until you place it: and order the woman to squeeze herself a few times: for he will come out slowly.
The exit of the twins, or the fetus of many. You should know that twin children are often born: and sometimes they are born three and four at a time. However, this is unusual, and rarely happens.
Five, however, is a foreign number, and they do not live long apart: but, although they multiply, the second one remains: and, separating them by a slit, distinguishing between them, it binds them at the navel of each.
And sometimes when they go out, they go out like a single fetus from a natural exit, easily: and they go out with an admirable exit, as we have told you.
If some of them are difficult to deliver, and they reach that which we have said from an unnatural exit, then take care of them as we have told you: and, sitting behind a soft midwife, let her do what she does easily and slowly, and let her assume whatever form she wishes with him who is prepared by nature's guidance to salvation.
Remember that it forms itself in the mother's womb from embryos, and sometimes they are aborted.
Sometimes when it forms in the womb one, and two, and three, and four, and five, and six, and seven, and more than ten: and I have already proved with myself that a woman has emitted seven, and another fifteen, all formed.
That which is done by the measurement of a wise sage.
This therefore should be in the knowledge of Obstetrics. Perhaps, however, it will attain to that which is similar to it: oppose it with that which is necessary
Chapter LVII.
Of the extraction of a dead fetus.
When you are concerned with a dead fetus, and when it does not go out, and you compel the use of the hand, then you should reflect on what I said in the division from medication, and understand.
If then the woman is of sound virtue, and is not with any of those accidents from which she fears harm: then it is necessary that she lie down on her bed, on her back, and let her head be inclined downward, and her legs raised: and the assistant should hold her by the two sides, or bind her to the bed, so that her body is not taken out at the extraction of the fetus.
Then moisten the jaw with oil of olive, mucilaginous, and fenugreek seed, and linseed.
Then the midwife shall moisten her hands with these oils and mucilaginous substances; then she shall insert them into the womb with ease. Then let her inquire about the site to which she shall insert the hook from the fetus, and about the appropriate sites for that.
Therefore consider at that time, if the fetus is ready to come down from above its head: then insert the hooks into its eyes, or its throat, or its mouth, or its palate, or under its beard, or in its collarbone, or in adjacent places of the ribcage, and below the hip bones.
If however descent is towards his feet: then between his breasts, and his middle ribs.
And it shall be that she hold the hook with her right hand; and she should place a knot in it in which is between the fingers of her left hand; and she shall insert her hand with ease, and shall fix the hook in one of those places that we have mentioned, until she has reached the loose part.
Then she shall fix another hook opposite to it, or a third one if she is able: so that there be an equal tension, and it does not decline towards a side.
Then it shall be extended by an equal extension, and should not be extended only according to the straight line, but should move on all sides, so that the exit is alleviated: as happens when a tooth is removed.
And it shall be that there is between that one, so that the extension is softened. That if a part is retained from it: then it shall be that the midwife shall moisten some fingers with oil, and shall insert them on the part, so that they rotate with them that retains it.
But if a part of the fetus exits: then the hooks shall be moved to a higher place: do this until the entire fetus has exited.
If therefore the hand goes out before others, and it is not possible to reduce it, on account of its constriction: then it should be, that a cloth should be folded over it. Then, remove it until you can pull it out completely, cut it or fix it in the joint of the plant, and so you should do for the other hand, and for both feet.
If however the head of the fetus is large, or if there has been a constriction at its exit, or if water has accumulated in its head: then it should be that he should put between his fingers the Spathumile spinosum [spoon], and wash away with it the head, and remove the water: or he should break it off with an instrument called Almisdac [skewer]: of which shape it came with the shapes of the other instruments in the chapter after this.
Likewise let him do if the fetus has a large head of nature, then it should be that he separates the algenegam [hair]: or takes it out with Misdach  [scissors], as we have said. Then, grasp the bones with pincers.
If however the head goes out and is constricted at the fork: then it should be found, until the moisture which is in the chest is discharged.
If however it is not complicated, and does not submit to the exit: then cut the head suddenly, according to what is possible for you.
If however the lower leg is swollen, or there is water in it: then you should cut it open, until the moisture comes out.
If however the fetus is on its feet, then the attraction of it is easy, and the direction of it to the mother's mouth is easy.
If however it is constricted at the belly, or at the chest: then you should remove it with a cloth which you fold over your hand: and open the belly, or the chest, until what is in them comes out.
If however other limbs are taken away, and only the head remains: then let the midwife put her left hand in. If the mouth of the mother is open, then put your hand in deep into the mother's mouth, and ask it with your fingers, and pull it towards you to the mouth of the mother: then put in one hook, or two hooks, and pull it together with it.
If the mother's mouth is clenched, because of the heat that comes to it: then it should not work on it, but rather at that time, it is necessary to administer an infusion of liquid, thick: and administer plaster: and sit in water that softens and moisten.
If the fetus is on its side, then it is possible to make it even: then administer what we have said about a single fetus.
That if that is not possible, then cut it short, and remove it.
And it should not leave anything at all inside the second.
When you have finished your operation, then administer what we have said about the hot apostemata that happen in the mothers.
That if blood comes out, then go down into the water of cauterization, and administer the remaining cure.
And I have already seen a woman, in whose womb a dead fetus was: and then she became pregnant with another force, and then a dead fetus was born again. Then happened to her after a long time an apostema in her navel, and it swelled up, until it opened: and it began to emit pus.
So I was called for her cure, and I treated her at a long time: but there was no solid wound.
I then put over it some strong plaster of projection: and she came out from the place of the mouth. Then passed a few days for her, and she came out with another mouth. I was therefore surprised from that inside, because there is no mouth.
So I thought, because they were the bones of a dead fetus.
I therefore enquired about the wound, and drew out many bones, while the woman was in better condition than before: and now she had been for a long time in that condition, and sent forth from her place pus a little.
And I do not find this strange here, unless that there is in it a kind of knowledge, and an aid to it, which the crafting physician gives with his hand from cure.
Chapter LVII.
Regarding the forms of the instruments necessary for the extraction of the fetus.
Form of the Twist which opens the womb.
Here is the form of the Strigore, which are equidistant from the books, and which have two twists at each end of two beams. However, this twist should be made slightly finer than the strigore: and to make it so, either should be made of ebony, or of wood from a bush.
And the width of each beam should be as broad as two fingers; and the edge of each of them should be as broad as a finger; and their length should be a palm and a half, and slightly less in the middle; and there are two additions of the same kind of wood at the center of both, which have already been fixed, whose length is half a palm and a little more; and the width of each of them is as wide as two fingers, or slightly less.
And these two additions are inserted into the mouth of the womb, so that they open up with them when you rotate the two twists.
A different form, similar to it, but finer and lighter.
Be made of ebony wood, or of bush wood, according to the similarity of the forceps. However, at the end of it there are two additions, as you see here above: and the length of each of them is almost a palm; and the width of each of them is that of two fingers.
But when you are going to open the womb with it, then make the woman sit on a bed, with her feet hanging down from between her legs. Then introduce two instruments joined together into the wound; and you, holding the lower end of the instrument, place it between his thighs. Then open your hand with the instrument, as you do with forceps, equally according to the quantity that you want from the opening of the womb, until the obstetrician does what he wants.
Form of the spinning other than what said the ancient Form of the driving by which is driven the fetus.
Form of the Almazac, by which is turned the great head: and it is like a pair of forceps, having teeth at the end, as you see them.
And when it becomes blunted, like forceps in this form, as you see, having teeth like serrated knives, by which it is struck and turned.
Form of the Vincum having one spine.
Form of the Vincum having two spines.
Form of the spatula having two ends for cutting the head off.
Form of the two spatulas also holding open.
These instruments all work and the more they multiply in kind, and are prepared for use by the surgeon, so much the faster they are in doing their work, and the higher among men because of their number.
Therefore do not despise these instruments, but rather have you prepared them. For necessity is the mother of invention.
Head 78.
§ On the extraction of the second.
When the Second is retained during childbirth, then you should prevent it from falling, so that it does not hinder its breathing. Then make her sneeze with a pinch: and tightly hold your hand over her nose, and the nostrils of her. But if it comes out this way, it is good.
But if not: then take a ram's horn, and pierce it through the hole in the ceiling: and put in it herbs opening the mouth of the womb, such as calamus, rutabaga, anethum, chamomile, fennel, cassia, and centaury: take all these herbs, or some of them, and boil them in water, and put them on the fire.
Then he will place the embulum around the foramen of the cooperatum bone and another extremity in the jawbone: and he should hold it until the vapor has reached the concavity.
Then he will blow into it as we have said above. For the second time it comes out with ease.
If it remains after this cure and does not come out: then order the Obstetrician to dip his hand in olive oil or mutton fat. Then he will insert it into the wound and ask where the second time is. When he has found it, then he should take it and spread it out little by little.
If it is annexed in a deep cavity of the jawbone, then he should insert his hand, as we have said before, until he finds the second time, and remove it little by little according to the direction, so that the matrix does not break at the sudden tug: it should be turned over with ease to the right and left side: then it is added in quantity of attraction. For it itself will obey, and be drawn out, and free itself from the adhesion.
That if the jawbone is tightened, as we have already related: take care of it with sneezing, and after the treatment with herbs.
If it does not come out easily with all that we have said above, then be careful not to tire yourself out by repeatedly trying to remove it.
But it is necessary that when it comes out at the jawbone from her, a few should be tied to her waist. Then cleanse it with the four-fold ointment. For it itself will rot and dissolve after a few days and come out.
But when it has rotted, an evil odor is emitted from it to the stomach and head, and injures it. It is necessary that you administer appropriate suffumigations to it.
Some have already been experienced in the sufumigation with nasturtium and dried fig.
The form of the instrument that is used to suffocate a woman during the second and menstrual period.
Let a piece of twig be made similar to the one used for suffocating, or from corn; and let it be placed on an edge wide over fire; and let suffocation be placed on plums; hold it until that suffocation is consumed; and let another be taken.
Chapter LXXIX.
As for the cure of an unbroken wound.
Many boys are born, and their women are not yet broken open by the subtle siroc of the air. It is therefore necessary that the midwife should pierce that siroc with her finger; and if not, she should pierce it with a sharp spatch; and let her take care, lest she touch it.
Then place over it wool soaked in wine and oil. Then care for the wound with ointment until it is healed.
But if you should happen to notice that it has become oily, then place a lead plug in the hole for many days, and let it be taken when the boy wants to defecate.
And it also happens that the oil comes from the consolidation of a wound or pus. It is therefore necessary that that consolidation should be removed; then care for it with what we have said about curing and lead.
Chapter LXXX.
As for the cure of fistulas which occur in the lower part.
The fistulas which occur in the lower parts are the result of a nodding or swelling which occurs near the anus of the buttocks, or in the space of one of the parts; and there is one fistula or several.
When that nodding is broken open, it opens, and from it runs a watery white fluid, or subtle pus.
And when there are fistulas penetrating from among these. Then those which penetrate are known by that which goes out from defecation, and moisture, when a sick person uses it for defecation; and perhaps they go out from them with wind.
And are from them Fistulae when they are in space penetrating up to the meatus of the urethra, and up to the meatus of the vagina. And are from them those that penetrate up to the joint of the hip, and up to the tail-bone.
From this, from which the fistula is recognized that penetrates up to a place, and also from which does not penetrate, that is, when you introduce your index finger into the anus: and introduce a thin probe of wire or bronze: when there is no curvature.
If, however, in it there is a curvature, then introduce into it a thin probe of lead or a quiver of horse-hair, until you feel the touch, or a hair on your finger.
If you do not feel this one either, and there is no discharge from the opening, nor is it curly or red as I said: then know that it is not a penetrating fistula: so turn to treatment.
And when the fistula is penetrating up to the meatus of the urethra, or up to the meatus of the vagina: then the meaning of this one is the exit of urine from it, and its prohibition from it so that the place consolidates with medicines.
But if it is penetrating up to the joint of the hip, or up to the mouth of the hip: then its sign is that a probe goes as far as possible into this one, if there is no curvature up to the mouth: and discovery of pain in the surrounding part, and that it runs out pus from it all the time: and that it does not dry up in it with medicine, nor consolidates with unguent.
And in these fistulas: there is no cure at all for all of them that penetrate: and the cure for them is work and futility from stupid doctors, who make up a practice on it.
But in that one which is not penetrating, and is not old, there is hope of cure with a knife: for I tell you, and have already tested it: and it is, so that the sick person lies between your hands on his back: and wash his legs all the way up to the thighs, and his thighs are bent towards his stomach. Then introduce a lead or air tube if there is tortuosity in the fistula until you know where the thread ends up.
But if he feels it weak at a certain point, then you should introduce your finger-tip indicator at that point.
But if you feel the thread already penetrating by itself through your finger and also through the skin or meat: then you will certainly know that it is penetrating: do not therefore work on it, because it is not a cure, as we have said.
They said, however, that he is cured by flesh in some people and by the application of a fine cauterizing fire along the length of the fistula, as preceded, and introduce the lit fire into the fistula until it reaches a certain point. Then repeat that twice or three times until you know that all the added filtered flesh, which is similar to a feather tube, has dried up.
Then care for that with a smooth paste of butter, until the flesh that has dried up comes out: then care for that with an ointment-like substance that generates flesh and consolidates it.
But if he is cured, it is good.
And if not, then he does not cure with any other treatment ever.
And if it comes out and does not reach your finger which is in the anus, and is between the thread and a thick stuff of flesh or skin: and you see a fistula running along the skin surface, then dry off the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and you will dry out with the thread that is in the fistula until it reaches the dryness of the thread's end, and let go of the thread and drop.
Then clean those filtered flesh tubes, which resemble a feather tube, so that nothing remains of them.
But if blood wins over you and separates you from your own work by solving those flesh, then it is better that it happens, and quicker in its healing, cauterize it with fire, or with acute medication.
For the cauterization, since it gathers good habits with fire, to add heat to their flesh and cut off blood and dry up moisture.
Then that care with linen wrapped in butter, or triturated clogs, until the place discharges pus, and those flesh that have been burned dry out from the pus.
Then that care when the wound with consolidated ointments, which generate hard flesh: and there are medicines in which are sterility and drying out.
For when they are cleaned, then they are healed: and do not put off repetition.
But if the fistula has reached as far as the hip and extends from the surplus of the body: then put your hand into it, and ask it.
But if you feel a trying, and between you and it is an obstacle of skin, or flesh, and it is close to penetration: then there is no operation in it, unless by the way of trust and hope.
That is, because it is administered in him one of two ways: or as it cauterizes itself, as we have said: or as it severs it, until the resulting concavity, so that it is possible for you to put a linen and cure from the nearest. And do not proceed much with the section, lest you fall into a control of some kind of snake, and it happens to an exit of infirmity without will. Then that care with it which we have said.
Perhaps then is healed: or lengthens the wound, and cleans it after drying up it until close to the hip, as we have said, or with a trying, or with another acute extremity of instrument. Then clean those filthy flesh that are in the section, until you can examine them closely.
Then endeavor to restore the wound of all with the section, and join it where it consolidates: and remains a fistula open in the inner part of the anus, and will be easier on infirmity.
And sometimes the fistula follows this manner: and it is when you insert a probe into the fistula; and it is in the side of the anus near the surface of the body with skin and margin of the anus: then take hold of the extreme end of the perforation, which is like a needle aleskef, that is, corium preparantium, according to this form. And insert into it a twisted thread of five strands and surround it. Then insert the probe with a thread into the fistula, until you feel a resistance.
If then it penetrates into the inner margin of the anus near, then remove the thread from that hole: so that you insert your finger in the anus, and remove the extreme end of the thread, and join both ends together at the same time: and tighten them well, until the flesh which is between the two ends of the thread comes together, and falls off: then care for the wound, until it heals, and is cured.
If, however, the opening of the fistula is not penetrating: then let it penetrate in any way you prepare it for yourself, unless it is in a deep place. For it is not good for you, to make it because of the snake, so that you do not strike yourself.
Then do with it as we have said, until it is cured.
The shape of the needle which is found in the fistula, whose curve is acute very much, and the other part is not acute, so that it does not strike what is not necessary, as you see.
Chapter LIII.
The suture of hemorrhoids, from which runs blood from the incision of them: and care for fissures.
There are hemorrhoids in two ways. Or they are inside the anus, similar to charcoal, or plums: or almost like grain of wheat. And from them there are small and great: and blood runs from them always, and one is cured, and many are not. And they are outside the bone, and at its extremities.
But those that are outside the bone are very few, and of little moisture, from which runs the yellow water, or a little blood with regular course; and they are according to their color to the body.
And the cure of that which is within the bone is, as you command the sick to sweat: and it is expressed, until it comes out through the anus, and appears blood-clots to thee. Therefore therefore hang them with a hook: or hold them with your nail. Then cut them at their roots.
But if they do not retain the hooks for their moisture and their own softness: then take them with a rough cloth, or with a twine of double-twined wool, and draw them out with your fingers. Then cut them, and sprinkle over them after the incision certain hot powders, so that they may stand in place of cauterization. Or cauterize them according to what has gone before in the chapter on cauterization. Then cure them with the remainder of the cure, until they are cured.
That if the anus does not yield to emission, then bind the sick-person with a clister that has a small mordication, so that it may irritate with him who is in the ano, and yield to emission quickly, when he expresses himself with sickness.
But if the blood-clots are external from the ano, then the matter is lighter and easier: and it is as if you take them with your nail, or take them with a hook, and cut them. Then cure them with that which I have said, until they are cured.
And who hates the incision with iron, then it is necessary that you administer to them a sutura in this way. Take a silken thread, and introduce it into the cavity. Then draw out the blood-clots towards above, and cause it to penetrate with the point of the needle on one side of the root: and wrap the two ends of the thread round it, in the lower part of the hole made by the needle, and let them lie side by side: and tighten the blood-clot with a firm constriction. Then remove the knot, and extract it out.
Then take away all of the knots, and leave only one behind: and do not harm yourself, lest you cause an excess of blood to flow from it.
Then place over it a cloth soaked in rose oil or unguent, and put that on top of it: and order the sick person to lie down. Then let go of him, until he falls.
When the knots have fallen, treat them with ointment, and with the rest of the cure, until they are healed.
§ On the treatment of fissures. For often a person suffers from dry stool, and from natural contraction.
When they have been long constipated, and there is no medicine in them: then you should wash them with the solution of Spongia, or with your own finger, until they become moist, and the upper skin which prevents them from being consolidated is removed from them. Then treat them, until they are consolidated, according to what should be done.
But if they are not consolidated: then treat them again with a more forceful solution than before, until they bleed a lot, and then treat them, until they are healed.
§ On the treatment of scurvy, and not of scurvy; and of dry knots, and of bee stings.
Chapter LIII.
You should know that scurvy is a round knot-like color on the body, similar to the claw of a head; and it appears throughout the whole body, especially in the lower parts of the feet and fingers; and it causes pain when walking.
Then let it be cut off what is in the shape of a claw, and held with forceps, or hooked; and root it out from its root.
Then treat that wound, and if you have cautery, treat it according to what has been said in his chapter.
But of the dry knots there is one little eminence, rough, filiform, round on top of the surface of the body. And often it happens to boys' hands.
And the cure of this is that you should spread out the splint and press it down on it; or you should tie it with silk thread; or with hair, until it falls off. And if the bone is broken, you should cauterize it according to what has been stated above with fire or with sharp medicine; and these splints that are immersed, whether they are immersion splints or not with an instrument which I call a splint-platter, are removed very quickly.
But a worm is also an excellent thing, fine, thick, on the surface of the body, wiggling into the depths deeply: and when it comes to be cold, it feels in it a similar stinging of a worm; and it enters into the whole body; and much of it is made in the hands.
And the cure of this is that you should take a tube from a goose feather or a swan feather, strong; and put it down on the worm, until it holds a circle of the tube in its parts. Then rotate your hand with the tube, until you separate what is in the circumference of the worm; and put it in the depth of the flesh, and remove the worm from its root.
And if you want to, do this with the tube of air or iron, according to this form.
Let the tube be positioned above a limit by pulling down a wisp of hair, so that the grasp of the finger and its rotation are eased.
And if you want to, cauterize the worm according to what has been stated above in the cauterizing of Athelil in the chapter on cauterization.
Chapter LIII.
On the forms of instruments that are used for cauterizing in animal diseases, and for relieving urinary obstructions and bowel constrictions.
When the clister is made of silver, or of gold-plated brass, or of ordinary brass, or of mallet
And when it is made of these small instruments, and of the large ones, according to those in which they are administered.
So then it is necessary to keep the lungs of young children pure; and if they are weak or sore, then also their enemas.
A large enema.
The head of the uterus, that is, the upper part to which a ligature is tied, should be wide according to this manner: and it should have a distinction so as to be tied as you see, and its lower extremity which enters into the pelvis should be dull, that is, closed, soft, drawing towards subtlety: and on one side of her there are two holes, and on the other side one hole.
And the width of the hole should be according to the thickness of the radii, and the thicker the smaller, and let the uterus in which the medicine is placed from an animal be: or from a paper sheet, which is according to the shape of a small aspartate: whose root is one palm.
And let many holes be pierced according to what has been opened up, and let the space that is between all the hole be according to the thickness of a finger. Then put into those holes a strong thread from raw silk, that it be from ten threads, or something like that, and bind with it so that it is like an aspartate. Then when the uterus is put into this, a strong constriction should be bound on the head of the enema between two distinctions. Then take the enema with you.
And this is the shape of the uterus which has been depicted here, and the holes.
The quality of the enema with you is this: that it fill the uterus, or the uterus from medicine which is heated according to the quantity of tolerance of the nurse: and let it not be hot very much, or cold very much.
Then let the sick person lie on his back, and raise his legs towards the upper part: and place under him, that is, a blanket over which men sleep, or a mattress.
Then dip the extremity of the enema into oil, or into wax from the rind, or into mucus from fenugreek, or similar. Then insert it into the anus with ease. Then the servant takes hold of it with both hands and squeezes it hard until all that is in the clister is emptied into the intestines.
Then he removes the clister, and raises his weak legs against the wall.
If the medicine makes him feel better, then he should hold on to it as long as possible. And if he sleeps with it all night, it is more effective in healing.
If instead you use the clister to soften his hard bowels, and then hasten his discharge: then repeat the clistering until he is healed.
If there are hemorrhoids, or painful blisters in the anus, then sit in a hot clister gently, with ease, using the clisters that the boys clisterize.
And this should be the form of a thin clister, made on a stiff skin.
Chapter LIII.
I have already spoken in the division of the treatment of wounds that suited the book, and I now say here the treatment of theirs with the hand, and with the second aid.
I say then, that wounds differ according to the place where they are struck, and also according to their nature.
Therefore the wounds which are often caused are like the blows of a stone: or the cut of a knife, or a blow with a lance, or a piece of wood, or an arrow: and similar things from among many.
But wounds which are caused according to the places of the body are, as regards their nature, like a wound struck on the head, or the neck, or the breast, or the belly, or the limbs: and similar things from among many.
And I am telling the treatment of certain wounds, so that I may set forth the reasoning and rule for the remaining wounds.
And I shall begin with simple wounds of the head; for the remembrance of the authors will come at the beginning of chapter three.
I say this. When there is a simple wound on the head, and it is not a fracture of the bone: consider then, if it is from a rock-throw or similar, and he has already torn the skin only: and it is a great wound, and you fear for the possibility of suppurations: therefore draw near, and immediately perform cephalic phlebotomy: and do not delay that: and extract therefrom according to the quantity of its power: if it were not to prohibit phlebotomy, especially if it were blood which comes out from a small wound. And let the phlebotomy be made from the opposite side of the wound.
And let the phlebotomy be made from the opposite side of the wound. And let the patient beware of over-indulgence in wine and rich food.
But if anything prohibits moderation, then he should abstain from food, and do not approach meat, nor wine.
And place on the wound if it is a suppuration of hot pus, an infusion of oil of rose-water, or with wine in which there is stenosis.
But if you are free from suppuration of heat, then place on the wound if it is new with its own blood, and has not been changed by air, then I will tell you after a little while: and if it has already been changed by air, then place on it an ointment, until it heals.
But if the wound is large, or from an incision of a knife, and similar: and the edges of it are not gathered by pus, then gather them together with a stitch, according to what I will tell you about stitches in wounds of the leg.
But if the wound has already touched bone, and hangs down, and there is no support for it, except in a little suspension: then cut it. Then take care of the wound with medicines, and restore in it hard flesh at a place where there is skin, and command the patient to eat food which has roughness, such as are heads of animals, and cooked wheat, until it is like a pulse: and those things are similar.
If it is putrefied in the skin and does not adhere to the bone: then cut off the putrefied part, and throw it away; then treat that.
But if there is an artery in the wound, or a new one from which blood flows: and it does not get cut by medicines, then inquire about the artery. But if you do not cut it open, then dry it out with Spatemoli, or tie it up. What if necessity compels you to do this when it does not grant what we have said, then cauterize it, until the blood stops flowing.
But if these wounds are small and simple, then the matter is easy and light: so that dust over them dust: for they harden before they change with air.
The way of the dust that has been made into a paste. Take a part of olive oil, and two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of burnt lime: mix them together well, and strain them: and fill them with the paste, and tighten them tightly until they adhere well to the wound, and are hardened with blood.
Then tie the wound from above with dust, and let it go, and do not remove it until it has healed, so that it does not break open. For the medicine will not be removed from it until it has healed.
And when it has hardened by itself, for you do not have olive oil at hand, and dragon' s blood also does the same operation on many large wounds, when it comes to be placed on them and tied down, and are wounds that have recently come with their own blood, which has not changed with air.
What if it has been changed by air in some way, especially when it is in the season of summer, then this powder's intention is not good: so take care to put on it a kind of digesting ointment that we have mentioned, or put on it a paste made from barley flour, made with water and honey, until it discharges pus. Then care for the remaining wounds until they heal.
If, however, there is a fracture of the bone and it is small, then extract it with the gesture: I will already say the cure for fractures of the skull because what follows needs to be heard.
Regarding the wounds of the neck.
If, however, an injury has occurred in the neck, there is no difference in treatment between it and a simple injury to the neck.
If, however, an incision has already been made on the nerve of the neck, or on an artery: then if it is a nerve, there is no skill in it unless it is allowed to heal with the application of astringent poultices, such as zine, and rest, and similar things. Because they harm nerves, and make them jump.
And do not put anything cold on the wound at all: because the substance of nerves is cold, and its continuation is with the brain, which is a superior member: so let the cure be carried out by doctors using lard, such as lard mixed with sweet water a few times with oil, or rosewater, and myrrh, when it is washed away with sweet water: and also mineral stones, in this way, and moist ointments.
If, however, the wound is large, then apply a stitch: or cover its edges with a powder. Then care for yourself, until you heal.
If, however, the depth of the wound or an injury has occurred in a lower part of it, where pus has already accumulated: then pierce it in a more depressed place.
If, however, an incision has been made on a nerve, and it is followed by a flow of blood: then separate it, or dry it up, and tie it up: or burn it if necessity dictates to do so.
If, however, an injury has occurred to the spine with a lump, or to all of it, and it seems that it will not recover on its own: then join the skin edges together with stitches above the lump, and do not touch the lump, but bring it back to its natural shape. Then tighten the wound with a strip, and leave it for several days. Then treat the wound with ointment when there is inflammation and drying out, until it heals.
If, however, the fracture has already made an impression on the bone, then examine it: if there are any fragments of bone, remove them all, or as many as you can: and if it is not prepared, leave it until the tendon rots, and separates and heals by itself.
If the tendon is still fresh, then powder it with the powder which you have made ready. If it is a tendon that has been injured and has become a fistula: then treat it with what is mentioned in the chapter on it.
On Tendons in Spatel
If the wound is caused by a lance or knife, and you can see its depth, then examine it carefully. If, however, a wound from a tendon makes one weak and breathless, then know that the tendon is mortal.
If it is not deep and is fresh with its blood: then do not put powder on it at first, nor tighten it up, so that the blood does not stay in its depth and flow into the heart, causing weakness: but put on the wound an attractive ointment, and leave it for two days.
If, however, you do not have ointment ready, then place on the wound a clean cloth to wet it, so that it sucks up what comes out of it from the moisture: and let the sick person sleep on the tendon so that the gangrenous matter gathered in it is cured.
If, however, the wound has passed three or more days without any sickness, no spasms of the heart, no breathlessness, and no other symptoms of illness, then know that the tendon is healed. Then treat it with care, and with the rest of the cure, until it heals.
If indeed the healing is excised and the wound is always opened, then you know that a fistula has already been made. So then treat the cure from its own chapter.
If the wound is from an incision of a sword or chisel and it is simple on the surface of the chest or back, then treat the cure with what preceded it from the stitch, if it is large; or with dust, if it is small.
If it has already made an impression on the bone and incised from it with a twig, then inquire about the fracture and approach from outside to remove those twigs if they are separate. If they are not separate, then let them go until the bone rots away, for the extraction of them will be easier.
But as for the remaining wounds and accidents in the other members, the judgment in the cure of them is the judgment that we have spoken of.
Regarding the wounds of the belly and the exit of the intestines and the emerging of them.
The rupture that happens in the belly is great and medium and small.
So then when the large one exits or the number of intestines.
Why does it happen and why is the suture of them more severe and difficult?
And the small one also becomes difficult from a different mode. So then, if you do not approach the place of its entry immediately, follow this, so that it does not become difficult to reduce them, because it inflates, opens up, and thickens out: why is the entrance to it difficult?
Therefore, because of this, it is better to have a medium disruption; for when the rupture is not difficult to reduce the intestine, as it is difficult in these two species.
Know that the suture of the belly is according to four modes.
The two common sutures meet together in the suture of the belly and in the suture of the other wounds of the body; and the other two sutures meet by themselves for the remaining wounds. Indeed, they are more appropriate with the sewing of the eye; and I will tell you both times, with explanation and demonstration.
I say then, because when the wound is small, and something comes out of the intestines, and difficult to reduce; then it is for two reasons. Or because of the size of the wound, as we have said: Or because there is an inflammation in the intestines because of cold air.
When then should this be so? Then you should heat the body, so that you dip a sponge, or a wet cloth in warm water alone. Or you should cook it in water with squash, celery, and pepper, and tie it with the intestines, until the inflammation resolves.
When then does the eye make a stitch? And it is better than water alone in resolving inflammation.
When then do you see that inflammation has already resolved? Then wet the intestines with the water in which it was cooked, or make it salt. For through this the entrance is relieved when it is small.
But if there is no return after this treatment, then find in the disruption a little bit, with the instrument with which they are cut.
And the first cure is better when it is prepared, than the incision; and there is no coercion to cut after necessity and defect of the instrument.
Be it a part of his eye that is twisted, acute, and another part that is not acute, and the edge is not sharp with the sharpness of the blade, but rather somewhat blunter: and this is what resembles a scar, as you see.
When then does the wound increase and enters into the intestines? Then you should reduce it to its own natural form in its own place, if possible against that: because it is better.
When then is the incision wide in the lower part of the eye? Then you should lay the sick person on their back, and raise their legs from the head. And if it is in the upper part of the foot, then put its head, and the chest of him higher than his lower.
And likewise if the rupture is in one of the two parts of the foot, then put your intention, and always have your attention on this, so that the part where the wound is sits higher than the other side.
And so it should be, that you admit this into large wounds and moderate wounds.
In wounds, but small ones, put it according to what is prepared for you.
Then make it present between your hands that faithful minister who holds the whole wound in his hand: and spread the lips of it. Then discover from him who follows a thread something after something: and this is the method of common surgery of one thread.
And it is, so that you take it now, or number now according to the quantity of the width of the wound. Then let go from the end of the wound a quantity of the finger of the hand, that is, doctor: and fix now one except that you introduce into it a thread in two ends of the skin, with two ends of sifah which is under the skin from inside, until you make it penetrate from the other side, and you have already joined the two ends of the skin, and the two ends of sifac: and there are four orders.
Then tighten with double thread around the needle from both sides at the same time, until two lips of the wound are joined together by falling out.
Then let go of the bulk of the finger as well, and fix another one in them: then make it straight with a thread, just as you did with the needle first. Therefore do not cease to do this with that which you hold from the needle, until you complete the contraction of the whole wound.
And let there be a medium needle between the bulk and the subtility: because the fine needles very quickly strike the flesh: and the coarse ones are difficult to enter into the skin: therefore it is necessary that there be a medium in subtility, and in bulk.
And it is not appropriate that the needles be placed in the two extremities of the skin that is very close: so that the flesh does not become infected quickly, and the wound does not open before its own consolidation, and does not also increase with the stitch, so that the wound is not prevented from consolidating.
Then cut the ends of the needles so that they do not hurt the sick person while he is sleeping: and place them on the skin's ends with feathers taken from all parts, so that they hold the needle's ends: and let them go until you know that the wound has been consolidated.
And this type of stitch with needles is much more convenient for small wounds. For it is sufficient in the stitch of their needles one, or two, or about them.
But the second common stitch is that which joins the four ends: the two ends of the skin, and the two ends of the thread in one piece, with a needle in which the filament is twisted evenly in thickness and subtlety.
Then when you pierce with the needle all four ends, bring them together from the part where you started, so that the twisted filament falls from the upper part of the wound: so that the stitch is made, as it were, like a stitch in a cloth which is stretched; and place between each stitch the thickness of the little finger.
This type of stitch is known to men.
And with this type of stitch I sewed up a wound in the man's stomach, which had been cut with a knife, and it was a large wound of about a palm's width: and about two palms' worth of intestinal tissue came out from within the middle intestine, and there was a break in the middle of the gut.
So I reduced it after he had stayed without bowel movement for 22 hours.
And so the wound was consolidated after about 15 days: and I cared for it, and he recovered: and he lived many years, thriving in his own affairs.
And the physicians judged that he would not heal.
And by a miracle, I did not cure that with ointment. For I was in a place where the ointment was not found, and there were no doctors. So I placed a hot cloth on the wound twice a day and gave it a shower with honey water until it healed.
I will describe two different types of sutures according to the description of the speech.
And so you begin with an acute suture: and insert it from the outside to the inside part.
When the needle enters the skin, and goes into the flesh following the length and width of the whole body: release the end of the thread you inserted from the outside, and let it penetrate the opposite end from the inside to the outside at the opposite end by a little margin.
When you have made it penetrate, then make it penetrate again in the same end by a little margin from the outside to the inside: and release the end of the thread that you inserted from without, and let it penetrate the opposite end from within to without at the opposite end by a little margin. When you have thus made it penetrate, then make it penetrate again in this same end by a little margin from the outside to the inside: and release the end of the thread that is in this margin, and let it penetrate the other end from within to without: and make it penetrate with your own penetration in this margin, which is in this part, until it penetrates throughout.
Then also begin from this same margin, and take the thread with the end that is out of the skin: and bring it out from without at the opposite end, taking it from within to without: and make it come out from the skin through the end that has come out: and then take the thread that comes out of the skin, and bring it back again to its place.
Then also reduce it in that skin, and take the end of the thread that is out of the skin, and bring it back again to its place with the opposite end: and let it come out from the skin through the margin that is out: and then take it that comes out from the skin, and bring it back again to its place; and make it come out from the skin through the other margin: and then take it that comes out from without, and bring it back again to its place, making it go in and out twice: and then make it go out from without entirely according to this example.
And the upper thread of this suture is so that it may be sewn with the skin as it is done with its thread: in such a way that its thread goes from one side to the other end of the skin; and so that you let go of it on one side with one thread and let it go on the other side with another, until you are finished.
The second kind of suture is its own, which Gallenus said.
This speech of his is told, that he may apply the second one according to the similarity with which some physicians sew them, so that they collect all the part by nature: and applying the end of the skin to the other end, and the end of the thread to the other end. And this is how I tell you.
It is necessary that you fix this now at the end of the skin near you from the outside part, and let it penetrate into the inside with it alone: and let go of the two ends of the thread. Then you turn this around again, and let it penetrate from the outside part to the inside in two ends of the thread, that is to say, on both sides.
Then you turn both around again, and let them penetrate from the inside to the outside as well, in two ends of the thread, that is to say, on both sides: and turn both ends of the skin from the inside to the outside in two opposite parts.
And this way of sewing is better than the common easy one, and it is a suture which the memory before it reminds.
This is therefore the speech of Galen as well.
And some said. The suture of the foot with two toes. That is, so that you introduce one thread into both of them: and begin with the introduction of the nail, since it is with you, and let it penetrate up to the other side, according to the suture of those who sew their nails evenly.
And you should know that when the rupture is in the middle of the foot: then the suture of it is more difficult than that of the other places of the foot.
Judgment of true medicine is the judgment of the wound, and judgment of the remainder of the wound.
That is, because when you sever a fresh wound with its blood, before it is disturbed by air: and reduce the entrails, and itself, and make itself whole: then put on the poultice of meat.
That is, if the air has already disturbed the wound: then put on a certain ointment, which is present with you, until it makes pus: and fall off the hair, and harden the sifac, and shine. Then care for that as if the cure of the remainder of the wound, until it is healed.
But if you do not have the medicines with you, then put on it immediately, so that it may begin to emit pus, and change the poultice every day as I have taught you, until it is healed.
For you do not need other medicine in many cases, when wounds are simple.
But if you should happen to injure a member of the body with a wound, then dip the wool in oil of moderate heat, or in rose oil: and put it on in the vicinity of the places that are between the thighs, and under the armpits.
That is, if it feels pain, or punctures, or corruption in its entrails (for this often happens) then cleanse the wound with wine mixed with rust, black, and warm: especially if putridness has already set in the intestin
And you should know that what comes from the large intestine is easier to heal: and that which comes from the small intestine is more difficult to heal.
But the intestine which is called the jejunum does not accept healing from a wound that has occurred in it at all: and it is because of the multitude of its turns, that it is from intestines, and its greatness, and because of the lightness of its body, and because of the closeness of its nerves.
But if that which proceeds from the ulna is a curl, and you have found it so: reduce it according to your reduction, as you reduce the intestines equally.
If, however, the space has been passed over, and the wound is already well, or black: then it is necessary that you tie it with a thread above the place which has been discolored from it, so that the flow of blood does not occur. For in the curl there are veins and arteries.
Then cut what is beyond that ligament, and put two ends of the thread hanging from the lower part of the wound outside the skin: so that it will be eased on you by its attraction, and extraction of it at the edge of the curl, and emission of pus from the wound.
Remembrance of the wound which happened in the intestine.
When the disruption has occurred in the intestine, and it is small: then it is possible that it is restored in some men: for I saw who was wounded in his belly with a lance thrust, and it was a curl on the right side of the stomach, and it was an old curl: and there was made a Fistula, and came out from it a discharge, and a pus.
Then I applied the cure, until I was not confident in its cure: and I did not hesitate to examine it, until it was healed, and the place had hardened.
After I saw the place now consolidated, I feared on the illness, that might happen to the intestine of his own evil accident: and it did not occur to him from that evil accident. And he remained in better health of his, eating and drinking, and enjoying himself, and entering into a bath, and exercising in his walks.
And some of the experimenters said, because when it happened in the intestine a curl, and it was small: then it should be tied according to this way. And it is, that you receive big ants' heads. Then take two pieces of flesh from the wound and place one of them on top of two wounds. And when he has come up to it, and has tied his mouth, cut off the head, for it is attached, and does not release itself.
Then place another fly near the first one, and do not stop doing this with the fly after the second amount of wound on the whole body.
Then reduce the wound, and burn it. That head remains attached to the intestine until the food reaches the intestines, and heals, and does not cause any harm to the whole body.
And it is possible that the intestine be tied as well with a thin thread: which, if torn from the intestine, is attached to it when it is inserted into the cavity.
And it is, that you take the end of this thread from the intestine, and burn off a lot of it. Then tie the end of this thread with a thin woven thread. Then insert that thread into the cavity, and burn it with the intestines. Then reduce the wound to the breaking point.
And this method of suturing with flies and intestine is not worth much except as a second aid and temporary measure.
You should know that the wound is great and wide, especially if it is in one of the small intestines: then it is not a skill except with a delicate thread, and its healing is not at all certain.
Of the care of Zuchium and fistulas.
You should know that every wound, or bruise when it has healed and become old, and has turned into a sore, and does not heal, and always discharges pus, and does not close: then it is called universally a fistula wherever it may be in the body, and we call it Zuchium.
And a fistula is, by its nature, a filtered, hard, white, sensitive, and painful finger: and for that reason it is called by some risati, that is, a finger.
It is in some hours humid, which emits pus. And perhaps the moisture splits in some hours. And sometimes this moisture is great, and it is little; and it is thick, and it is thin.
And I have already预先在分类中，当我说了创伤时，既然任何不愈合的伤口，或在其中没有形成新的肉，都不是因为原因的新；这只是因为新病。
其中之一是，身体里血液不多；或者由于邪恶的意志；或者因为身体本身，嘴唇上长着坚硬的肉，阻止了肉的生长；或者由于很多原因，包括声纳和臭气；或者因为伤口自己腐烂，释放出来的物质质量不好；或者治疗方法不适合治疗；或者疾病在身体里扩散，导致该地区出现一种传染病，就像在塞萨洛尼基那样；在那里，各种疾病很难消化，治愈速度很慢；或者由于该区域的解剖结构不同。
我已经展示了所有病因和迹象，以及用手手术治疗它们的办法；这里，我将告诉你如何通过手术疗法治愈痿痨。
所以你知道，瘀疮发生在身体的各个部位。 因为它们渗透到大血管、神经、 ruột、生殖器官或脊柱等组织中；或者渗透到肋骨、关节或骨头中。例如，手和脚就发生在手指和脚趾上；而其他肢体的瘀疮则发生在靠近主要脏器的部位，以及相似结构的地方。
那么这些瘀疮就变得很难治愈，而且不会被治愈；需要精力和奉献精神来照顾它们，因为它们很顽固且难以治疗。例如，手和脚就比较难治好；而其他肢体的瘀疮则取决于它们的部位。那些靠近主要脏器的瘀疮更难治好，需要更多的精力和奉献精神来照顾它们。
If it is from the fistulas of which the depth does not reach these places that I have said: and you hope and trust in the cure of them, and you see to know them, then take hold of them with an attempt out of air or iron, if the fistula extends according to rightness, and inquire into it with itself.
But if there is a tortuosity in the fistula, then investigate it with a thin lead tent. For lead, with its own body, mildens itself, and cares for the tortuosity.
That if the fistula has many openings, it is not possible for you to indicate over it with a tent. So that it may spread out from its own openings. And therefore it spreads out from its own openings:
For the humidity which clisterizes itself, turns towards other openings, and runs out of them.
Then ask yourself how it is possible for you to know: that you may know that there is an opening, or a nerve, and that the fistula extends far away, or close by: or that the fistula is one which has many openings, and stands over all that, with great strength of yours: with your own question, by which you question the sick, and by the finding out of pain at the compression with your hand on the place, and similar indications and causes of accidents apostemati.
And when you stand over all that with a true station, then go forward to cure according to confidence: and is, as you consider then, if it is a fistula close by appearing, or in a place of health far away from the joint, or from a nerve, or an artery, or a vein, or one of the places which I have said to you: then dry up the fistula according to what has been premised in my narration, and take away whatever is in it from filtration, and corrupt flesh, which comes out at its opening from flesh, or the membrane, and similar things: and cure it, until it is healed.
But if the fistula is of a long depth, and extends according to rightness: then it should be separated from its depth as much as is possible for you. Then wash it with all its corrupted flesh.
Then administer the poultice of fresh meat mixed with acute medicines: and introduce it until you reach the fistula which you have confined with iron: do this several times, until the acute medicine has completely corroded what remained in the concavity of the fistula from the corruption.
Then restore it with a unguent that generates healthy flesh, until it heals.
If, however, it does not heal through this, then caustic it according to what we have described.
If, however, the cause of the fistula is an opening, and you can certify this for yourself: then examine it, and cut it as we have told you: if it does not prevent you from anything of new flesh, or nerve, or main member, as we have said.
If, however, it is detected for you an opening, and there is some corruption and blackening in it: then shave it, until the whole corruption has been removed. Then take care of the flesh with what heals the flesh, until it heals.
That if it does not heal, and discharges pus as it did before: then know that you have not achieved total eradication of the corruption.
Then detect on top of it again, and carefully examine its rasion, and wash it with your final strength.
Then restore the flesh. If, however, it heals, that is good: and if not, then know that that corruption is far from the body, which you have not achieved. Not therefore is your craft in it, except to discharge it into nature.
That if the corruption is in a small opening, and it is possible for you, attract it with subtle forceps that are appropriate for it.
If, however, there are many bones, then carefully examine all of their attractions, and do not discharge any of them with your strength.
If, however, it gives you a contrary force from any humidity, and there is no timor (fear) or error in cutting them: then cut the humidities and flesh, if they are there, and free the bones.
If indeed you are not prepared to remove the bones from your hour, then place them upon a branch that will decay them; and let them go, until they decay as they are in the vicinity of their bones from flesh and moisture.
And guard the limb so that it does not harden. And constrict the section which you followed in your operation. Then place over the bones, if needed, the triaded sulfur drowned with oil: or the submerged in Egyptian ointment, or some ointments of violets.
For when those certain humors decay and separate from the bones, the removal of them is eased, and their attraction is avoided.
If, however, there is a large bone, such as the femur or ilium, and that which is corrupted from it is a part of great size, then shave it with the last razor, until the corruption and blackness are removed. Then restore the limb.
If, however, what is corrupted within it is a part of great size, and the corruption has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to cut it off, and to incise it all the way to the place where the corruption ends: then care for it, until it hardens.
And I will tell you the story of the man who happened to have a leg injury: so that it may be an example and aid for your operation.
He was a young man of about thirty years of age, to whom it happened that there was pain in his leg, because of something which had moved within the body, that is, from the inside, until it reached the limb, and there was a great swelling: and it was not caused by an external cause.
So he remained with that error of the physicians until the swelling had opened up, and many materials had entered with him. And his treatment was postponed until the leg had been bound up, and many openings had been made in it: all of which discharged pus and body humors.
So many doctors had gathered around him for about two years, and there was not one wise in the art of surgery among them until I was called in, and I saw his foot, and the materials that were flowing out of those orifices with a great flow: also the whole body of a man was already covered with poultices, and his color was citrine.
So I entered one of the orifices, and my hand came to the jaw.
Then I scrutinized all the orifices; and I found them all flowing into one another from all parts of the limb.
Then I stopped up and followed one of those orifices, until I found part of the bone: and I saw that it was corroded: which had already been corroded, and had become decayed, and had holes in it, as far as it penetrated into the marrow.
So I closed up what I had found, and I prepared it from corrupt bone.
And I left out what was not in the bone except that corruption, which I did not cut away, and I closed it up. And I have now eradicated it.
Then I placed a patch of wound healing with long-consolidated medicine. But it was not consolidated.
Then I probed again, and I found another bone above the first detection: and I saw continuing corruption with bone; and I closed it up, for what seemed to me also come out of that corruption.
Then I tried to restore it. But it was not restored.
I probed again on the limb, and I did not cease to cut bone by bit, and I tried to restore it; and it was not restored until I cut out from the bone a little palm, and I took that out with its marrow.
Then I restored it with medicine, and it was quickly consolidated, and healed; and such a repetition of the operation, and sectioning of it, was not necessary, unless for the weakness of the nurse, and her lack of tolerance, and my fear over it from death: since it happened to him in all times from excessive evacuation of bad syncope.
He was therefore sound in health; and he had grown up in a strong bone, and his body was well formed, and his strength returned to him; and his habits were healthy; and he did not suffer any injury from walking at all.
But if the jaw is broken at a point in the body where it has already been broken: then you should join it together again, as follows: take a piece of string, and tie it tightly to the end of the bone; and order someone who will hold the jaw up with his hand; and put another piece of string, made of coarser wool, over the first ligament. Then tie the jaw up over the flesh which is under the bone; and extend its end so that you can pull the flesh down towards the bottom; and you should cover the place where you wish to join it together, so that the saw does not cut the flesh.
Place a piece of wood or a slab under the bone from below, because when you do this, it does not hurt the damaged flesh.
And it is necessary that the join should be a little forward from the damaged part, so that it does not show in the appearance of the wound, and does not seem to be a joint; and does not allow its own natural movement, but allows another person's power to move it.
If the bone is damaged and does not rise up from one side to the other: then a part of it continues with another part; or the damage is in the middle of it, or on one side only of it: then cover all the flesh completely. Then place the wood under.
Then join it from the first part where the damage is, until it continues as a joint on the other side: and let the join run along the length of the damage a little forward, in the way that I have said.
If the damage is at the joint: then cut the joint which is damaged, and join it up again; and join the bone where it continues on the other side.
But if the damage is between two joints: there is no natural movement in that place but only a sore spot.
If corruption is in the palm of the hand, or in the palm of the foot; then the matter is difficult, indeed. Indeed, you should inquire how the corruption appears to you. And scrape it off, and clean it up in such a way as is possible for you, and with whatever skill you have: when it does not give you an opposite vein, or nerve.
And know that there are many knives and saws for cutting these bones, depending on the position of the bones, and their preparation, and their thickness and softness, and their size and smoothness, and their variety. Therefore it is necessary that you prepare an instrument suitable for each kind of operation.
And know that these operations require a long study on the face of the tool with which you work. And the knowledge of these methods of the art is a witness to the diseases; for then you will already, through yourself, find out what is suitable for each disease.
And I am confirming to you at the end of this chapter the number of instruments, which you place as examples over which you work, and a proof from which you experiment on others.
The form of another saw.
The form of the razor joined together. Let the head of this razor be made according to the form of a star-shaped claw; and its points be made according to the form of a star-shaped point.
And it does not suit, except that they rub with it when they are cutting, when they are corrupting, or have a broad and wide opening.
Major form of the razor.
Wide form of the razor.
Form of the razor in which is enclosed.
Other thin form of the razor.
Form of the other curved end of the razor.
Form of a small, thin hook-shaped tool for cutting hair.
This is like a rasp and its end is like an axe: it is shown in many places from the scraping of bones.
Form of the razor which is used to scrape the bone, that which has been pierced out with holes from the bones.
Its end is triangular, its angles are acute.
It fits from India. And likewise it is necessary that all which we have said of razors, and incisers, and saws be made.
Of the incision of ends, and sawing of bones.
The ends putrefy, or for an external cause, or an internal one.
But when you have been healed with medicines and not with the art of healing, and see corruption inciding into a member, but nothing is affected by it: then you must cut off that member to where the corruption reaches, so that the sick may be freed from that which is greater in the defect of the member.
And the sign of that which has happened to it is that a member is discolored until it is healed; for if fire has burned it, or putrefaction after nigridine: until that corruption incises into that member, and creeps through all of the body.
Then prepare with the incision, and likewise if the cause of corruption is from percussion of some of the venenosi: as of the sea scorpion, and of the moth, and of the nettle, and of the same kind.
But if corruption, or a blow is in the end of a finger, then cut off the finger, and not leave space for the corruption, so that it incises into the remaining hand.
And likewise if it occurs in the hand, then incision is made from the root quickly, and not leave space for corruption, until it takes place in the brisk arm.
And if it has entered into him, then incision is made in the arm at the knee in its junction.
But if corruption has passed through, and you see him all around the hip: then death is in that one. And to administer besides that from cure, is the quantity of virtue.
And likewise do to the foot, when corruption has entered into a finger, then incision is made in it at the knuckle: and if it takes hold in the shank of the foot, then incision is made on the whole foot. But if it has risen up to the knee, then incision is made on the leg at the junction of the knee.
That if corruption has already reached above the knee, then there is no healing in it, except removal and abandonment to sickness to death.
And the mode of incising a limb, or of binding it is, that you stretch the ligament below, which you wish to incision: and tighten another ligament above the place. And let one minister of ligament extend to the lower: and let another minister of ligament extend upwards to the top. And you separate flesh that is between the two ligaments, with a chisel flat, until all the flesh is detected. Then incision is made, or bound.
And it is necessary, that you put from all parts a cloth of linen, and does not touch the serra place to sound health: and happens infirmity in the addita, and a blister hot.
But if it has happened to flow of blood inward while you work, then cauterize the place quickly: or put on top some powder to cut off blood. Then turn back to your medication, until it is completed.
Then bind the wounded limb with a suitable ligament, and care for it, until it heals.
And I tell you what happened to the man in his foot, this same thing that I tell you.
What happened was that it occurred in his black foot, when the ash that is made like combustion of fire; and that corruption first happened in his finger, until he began to hurt his whole foot.
Then the man recovered from the swelling, when he saw that the corruption was occurring in his limb with great pain which he felt and because of the ash of him; and it happened to him near the joint, and he got well.
And after he had passed a long time, that corruption again happened to him in his finger of his right hand.
Then he came to me, and I tried to restore that excess with him when I put on his hand from the medicines after purifying his body: and that excess did not respond, and began to hurt in another finger; until the corruption happened in his hand.
He called on me to wound his hand; and I did not want to do it, hoping for a response from me about that excess: and I was afraid also of death at the incision of his hand. For the strength of the man was above death.
Then he turned away from me, returned to his land; and he came back to me about it because he wanted to, and he wounded all of his hand; and he got well.
And I did not tell this story except to make an aid about what falls from this kind of disease: and to make a sign of what means, and according to what is done.
Concerning the cure of ulcers, and the quality of cauterization with medicines.
When an apostema (ulcer) occurs on a part of the fatty body, and the space of the apostema is prolonged, until it causes a collection of pus: then it bursts, or pierces, and what is in it comes out, leaving a hole behind that is like a hole, and the skin over it is as if it were a thin cloth; and it does not reach its last stage of corruption, nor prints into the mouth, nor into the nerves, nor into the ligaments: it deserves to be called a sinus: and it is not called a fistula: however, if the space is prolonged, until it causes the corruption to impress on some of these limbs, then it is called a fistula, or a fistula.
And the cure is so that you fall on all this skin as if it were wound up; and above all when it is thin and has become like a sheet; and you trust because it does not stick to the place, for its corruption.
But if you hope that this skin will stick and not cause that last corruption: and if there is a thickness of flesh on the skin, then cure it with Myrobalans: and it is so, as you consider towards the sinus.
Then if it is big and the pus that comes out of it is foul-smelling: then Myrobalans with Egyptian medicine, which is vinegar, oil, and saffron, parts equal, are mixed together in a dish: and they are boiled on the fire, until the medicine turns red: and it comes to be like honey.
Then take from it what you need: and dissolve it with water and honey and Myrobalans with it to the sinus: and tightly close its opening, and release the medicine into it for a duration of two hours.
Then extract it with an expression: let it be for days, until the sinus is clean and the smell has gone away.
And when you want to use it as a Myrobalans with water of ash, when this medicine is not present with you: and it is so, that you take the ash of oak wood, or ash from oak wood: and pour over it water. Then boil it, and Myrobalans with it, until you trust that the sinus is now clean.
That if the tolerance of the sick person is not good with Egyptian medicine and water of ash, then Myrobalans it with water and honey, to which has been added some crushed saffron. Or Myrobalans it with honey and wine, because of the property of honey to clean and wash away: and it makes the wine adhere to the sinus, especially when there is an abundance of astringency and dryness.
Sometimes you do it, and trust that the corruption of the sin has already been removed: then you wash him with water, because he washes himself when he gives birth to flesh in him.
And it is as if you take the plaster of Dyafinicon: and dissolve him with olive oil, and wine astringent: or wash him with some medicines, and other ointments, whose properties I have written in the book of ointments.
That if the orifice of the sinus is strict, in which the cannula of the clister does not enter: then enlarge it with iron a little: or put in him licorium infusum in unguento Aegyptio, or in unguento Basilicon, until it is enlarged.
And likewise if the orifice is also wide, then join the lips with a stitch: and let go out of him a quantity in which to be infused clister without addition.
And likewise if the orifice of him from which there runs pus is raised upward: then dry him in a lower place which is in him, so that the pus runs down from it: for when the pus is constricted in the depth of the sinus, it does not allow flesh to be born in it.
That if it is not possible for you to dry the sinus completely around its lower part according to what you wish: then strive that you prepare the member in a preparation in which runs from it pus with ease according to which you prepare it for yourself. Strive that you do not retain in him anything at all of the pus: and take medicines consolidatrices which are put on a mark, fitting to that which you wish. And extend them over a linen cloth. And let there be such a quantity of the cloth, that there may be communication with all the sinus. Then cut with forceps in the direct orifice of the sinus hole, slightly wider sinus opening. Then extend from the unguentum with soft cloth over another cloth according to the quantity of the hole: and put it on him in a distant position from the orifice of the sinus so that pus comes out from it: and do not hold back the cloth in great size, until after a few days one time.
The one who is above the sinus opening is he who moves all the time so that he exits what is gathered in him from pus: and know, that which runs out of it is a lot, or little: or digested, or undigested.
And when you consider this place again of the sinus itself, does he feel pain in his lordship, or not be in it pain, and is there in it blood-clot, or not be there blood-clot?
So when your treatment extends thus far, and you see the matter that comes out above the sinus opening, then know that the sinus has already become attached, or drawn close to attachment: so then loosen it in the morning, or on the third day: and when you have loosened the wound, then change the cloth with another one, and renew the ointment.
But if the pus comes out of the sinus after a long time, do not despair about its attachment, for its healing is drawing near, because there are people who delay the generation of flesh in their wounds, and there are those who act differently.
But if the pus comes out of the sinus after many days, then know that the sinus does not become attached.
But if the attachment of the sinus is delayed and its duration is prolonged: then add to the drying of the medicines, that the physicians may do as they should, so that they are in their substance moist, and in their power dry: just like the unguent with dafinicon, when added to it, there being an excess of addition by drying.
And from the greatest one when he is being healed, it is as if you take the unguent with dafinicon and you loosen it with rose oil and you apply it over the old wound to equal it in its substance.
Then make fast the wound with him, and use it.
And this same action is done by you when the unguent with dafinicon is not present, or when honey is heated, and you use it. Take myrrh, and aloe, and olive; let them be boiled together with honey, and poured over fire. Then wrap a cloth over the wound, and tie it tightly to the sinew: and pour the ointment you have made on top of the wound, until it is thickened: and sprinkle the herbs on top of the wound, and wrap them in the cloth, and tie it up.
And sometimes, when he applies it to him, take the long arzuola herb, and roots of the star lily, and the lily itself; and flour from the herb, and the centaurea. Use them either simple or combined, rub them together, and strain them through a sieve: and sprinkle the herbs on top of the honey that you have made, and use it.
That if the disease of the sinus is prolonged, and does not heal with this treatment: then you shall know that there is corruption in its depth; or it already makes an impression on the bones, or on the other hard members, or on the ligaments: then cure the sinus with fistula treatment, as has been stated.
Regarding the cure of a finger bone that is green and swollen, and the cutting of the finger, and the sectioning of it.
Panaritis is a swelling that arises under the nail of the thumb or foot, and perhaps it arises in the other fingers too.
When therefore the disease of it is prolonged, and neglected in its cure, and turns to a blister with heat: or it corrupts, and discharges pus, until it corrupts the nail's root; and perhaps it corrupts all of it, and perhaps the corruption reaches to the mouth, until it has an odour that is loathsome: and perhaps it makes the end of the finger large, and perhaps it darkens its colour.
When therefore you cure the finger, with what we have said regarding its division, and your cure does not bring relief: then you must cut away all the excess that remains under the nail. Then sterilise the wound after it. Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.
For the bone is sound, and the nail also is sound, and the addition of the dry nail already compresses the flesh toward the inside, and begins to prick it, and hurts it: then you should put on a fine radium under the angle of the nail that pricks the flesh, and push it up: and cut the flesh with ease, and put on what remains of the flesh from burning medicines, abrasives until it all moves away. Then take care of that with the ointment, until it heals.
If corruption has already set in at the tooth, then you should cut out that tooth, and remove it: for it does not heal at all while it remains in it.
If you see the corrosion and corruption entering into a finger, then cut it at one of its joints, according to what has been said above as a reminder. Then take care of that person, until he heals.
If, however, the nail is torn or struck: and there is a sharp pain in it, then you should let blood from it first. Then dry off the nail with an acute spatula, cutting across from above to the nail bed.
And guard it, so that the cut does not reach the flesh under the nail, for you would cause a painful wound to the sick person, and it would be a cause of the birth of flesh added to its place.
Then take care of the place with what is seated there that it hurts.
The finger that is added to some of the hands of men may well be a whole flesh: and it may well be that there are bones in some of them, and it may well be that there is a nail in it: and in some of their fingers the birth may be in the root of the joint, or it may be born in some of its joints. So this that is born in some of the joints of the finger does not move: and this that is born at the joint of the finger may well move.
Therefore, whoever has this flesh, cutting it is easy. That is, so that you hit him at the root with a flat chisel.
But whoever his birth is in the root of the joint, treatment is difficult. Therefore, abstain from cutting it.
In that person who is born in the finger near the last knuckle, then you should hit the first flesh of his incision roundly up to the mouth. Then tighten the jaw with one of the screws convenient for that. Then care for the flesh, until it heals.
However, the consolidation that happens from one side to another, it often happens or from the birth of man, namely, is born with it, or from the consolidation of the wound, or from the burning of fire, and similar things.
Therefore, it should be that you separate this consolidation, until the second fingers return to their natural shape. Then place between them a chisel, or damp cloths soaked in oil roseate: so that they do not quickly consolidate and separate between them: or place between them a thin lead sheet, until the site consolidates as necessary.
And also if it happens that some fingers consolidate with the palm, then dry this consolidation, according to how it is prepared and convenient for the shape of the member.
Regarding the incision: Vitius enim est et insensatus, si ex una parte incid
Veins that are swelled up, thick, full of melancholic excesses which occur in many parts of the body: and most of them are in the legs, especially in the femurs, because they walk and work, and carry the weight.
Therefore, it should be that you administer a strong infusion of the body with black cholera from time to time.
Then take the blood of the patient by the bazilicus method.
The treatment of these veins with iron is according to two methods. He should wash them, and draw out the black blood. And another way is to cut the vein and take it all out.
But the section is done this way according to this method. First, wrap the leg with warm water until the thick, foul blood resolves. Then tighten the bandage around the leg from the upper hip to the lower knee with the stump. Then cut a wide section in one, two, or three places.
Then wash it, that is to say, draw blood from the lower part of the leg with your hand all the way up to the top, and from the top it should be done by the phlebotomist first. Then cut off the toe all the way down: until it comes out of blood as much as you see is enough to drain, and what the strength of the nurse can bear.
Then bind it up: and tell him to refrain from foods that cause black bile: and keep on with the bloodletting and phlebotomy when the veins are full, and let the sick person be warned against it.
But washing it out is done this way according to this method. Scrape the wound of the nurse, if there are many hairs in it. Then put him into a bath: or wrap him in the leg with warm water until it reddens, and the veins stand out: or exercise him strongly if there is no bath present, until he warms the limb.
Then cut off the skin at right angles to the vein section along its length: or at the end of it near the knee, or at the lower part of it near the heel.
Then open the skin with a hook, and scrub off the scar tissue with all its parts, until you feel it: and at this appearing of it, you will see it turn from red to black by the fall of the day. But when you take off the skin, you will see it white as a cord.
Then introduce the radical below it, until it is removed and withdrawn from the skin: suspend with a blind hook, soft.
Then dry off another piece of flesh next to that piece of flesh with three fingers. Then scrape the skin from the upper part of the leg until it is scraped off. Then wash it with water as you did before and suspend with another blind hook as you did at first.
Then dry off another piece of flesh or more pieces if you are able to do so. Then wash and cut off the very last part next to the heel.
Then pull it out up to the section that is above it.
And do this, until you pull it out from the upper section, or longer sections, until it is completely withdrawn: then cut it off.
But if it does not comply with you regarding withdrawal and washing: then introduce a strong double thread and tie it up and wash it off: or introduce the radical below: and turn your hand around all over, until it is completely withdrawn. Then cut, so that it doesn't get cut. For if it gets cut, it will be difficult for you to wash it well, and it will enter the wound underneath.
When you have completely withdrawn it: then place it on the spot of the wound that is soaked with wine and oil or ointment, and care for it, until it heals.
That if the vein is contracted, it has a curvature that makes it difficult to find the right spot for suturing and does not go according to what we said regarding straightness: then you must find on all parts of its curvature and the spots of its contraction.
Then suspend it with a hook, until you have completely washed it off: and be careful next to the section on your body not to cut yourself: for it will be difficult to wash over you, or to withdraw it. Preservate therefore your prudence.
The form of the incident in which the grape is cured.
The form of the blind vinery.
It is not for him the prudence like that of the other vinery, nor has it the acute extremities, so as not to wound the vine by its excessiveness; and its bent is coarse, soft: because if it were delicate, it would fall with its own delicacy; but its grossness is superfluous, as we have said.
On the extraction of a vein from the leg.
This vein is generated in the legs in warm countries, such as Algeria and Arabia, and in dry and hot countries, scarce of tenderness, that is to say, where no grass or tree grows.
And perhaps it is generated in other parts of the body besides the legs.
And its generation is from that which happens beneath the skin, just as it happens within the bodies of snakes and worms, and of worms between the skin and flesh.
And the sign of the commencement of this vein is an acute inflammation in the leg. Then the place becomes sore. Then the vein begins to come forth from the place of its sore, as though it were a root of a plant, or an animal.
When therefore this extremitas begins to appear, then you should wrap a leaden wire around it, the weight of which is of two drams and a point, and fasten it there: and take off the lead when you have wrapped it round.
As often as anything goes out from it to the outside, wrap it again with lead and mark it. If it is prolonged for a long time, then cut away a part of it, and wrap up the remainder. And do not cut away its roots before it has gone out entirely. For if you cut it, it is torn up and enters the flesh: and it makes happen a pustule, and a putrefaction in the place, and a bad sore.
So then it is necessary that it be handled with care and removed gradually until it has completely left the last of its own and nothing remains of it in the body: and from this same vein comes out in some men, which is five hands long and ten [palms] wide. And already it has reached me, because he has gone out of twenty palms.
If however you hit yourself at the time of your own treatment: then introduce a rayon into the hole and pierce it with a long ray with the body, until all that is in it has completely come out of the matter: and administer to the place with medicines for several days. Then care for yourself after the treatment with poultices.
And this same vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears in the joint of the foot or in the foot itself: and many orifices are formed for it, and it comes out from every orifice with a branch.
So then take care of it as we have said in the division, and along with it what has been stated above.
Regarding the section about worms that are generated under the skin, and it is called "aegritudo bouina".
This disease is called in some region "aegritudo bouina" because it often happens to cattle and is a bare patch [of skin] one inch long that arises between the skin and flesh.
And it was shown in the whole body, going up and down: and it was evident to the sense in its walking with a limb from one limb to another, until it breaks off wherever it breaks off in the skin, and comes out.
And its generation is from the decay of certain kinds of food. As happen worms and snakes, that is, earthworms and roundworms in the belly.
And they fear its malice. Because when it is being shown in the body and it is lifted up to the head, and it reaches a place: then perhaps it opens within it and comes out, and destroys the eye: and this happens often.
So then you must care for him and extract it, then he will not make that injury except by walking on it and feeling it.
It is necessary therefore that you should hold up what is above him, and what is under him with strong constriction. Then dry over it, and extract it.
That if it penetrates the flesh, and not injure itself: then place on the spot cautery with fire, until it dies.
And greater is that which is feared, is corruption of it, which corrupts the eye, as we have said.
But if you see it already reaching to the head near the eye, then hold up under it with good strong constriction. Then dry over it, and extract it.
And it is necessary that he should use his own purification of his body, with medicines solu
And guard himself from foods generating corruption.
§ On the section about disease of Nakir.
This disease is called in our land Nakir: and it is a pain that happens to some member: then it passes from one member to another.
And I have already seen it myself, according to what I tell you. I was called to a woman sick in some wiles. And she lifted up her arm, and I saw swelling in the armpit of the biceps.
And after an hour had passed, I saw one swelling go up with fire, like that of the skin, going up at her shoulder faster than it could be: so as to be like flowing silver, when it runs from place to place.
So then the pain left that place, and was fixed in the shoulder.
Then she sat for an hour, and it ran in the remaining body, until it reached another arm.
Then she told me, that all over her body it was going away, according to what I saw.
I am therefore amazed at the speed with which he moved from one member to another. And indeed before that I had not seen this disease in my eyes in such a way. However, I saw many who were suffering from pain moving from one member to another; and I did not see him with my eyes as I saw him in a woman.
And I do not think that it was because he was a man, since a woman was among those who were suffering from dry blisters on their legs; therefore, this sensation seems to be due to the movement of blisters.
And it is necessary so that it does not appear in this way in those who are delicate and have moist bodies, hidden blisters.
When you apply the cure to him and the patient feels this pain: then if it appears to your eyes as we have said, then gently press on top of him, and quickly dry out on top of him, until this movement is restrained: and cauterize the place.
If, however, you do not see him with your eyes: then apply the cure to his body with an Excursion, and with it drive away the blisters, and make them turn red with bitter pills, and pills of serapeum, and similar ones.
On the extraction of Arrow-fish
The Arrows differ according to their species, and according to the places in which they are found in the body.
However, there are different kinds of arrows: for some have large points and sharp ones; others are curved, and some are straight. And among them are those that have three angles. And among them are the tongues. And among them are the arrows.
However, those that fall on different members of the body, are according to two ways. Or, since the members are from the main members that are curved, such as the brain, and the heart, and the liver, and the lung, and the kidneys, and the intestines, and the bladder, and those similar to them: When then falls in any of these limbs, and appear to you the signs of death, which I will tell you afterwards, then it is necessary that you extract from them this arrow, for death follows him in which he is, in many dispositions. And when these bad signs do not appear to you, and the arrow is not hidden deep in the limb, then extract it, and take care of the wound.
For when the signs of the brain fall in it, and the arrow penetrates the bone, and comes out above the brain, it is: because from this there happen violent headaches, and scotoma, and dizziness, and redness in the eyes, and swelling, and reddening of the tongue, and spasms, and confusion of thought, and amnesia of cholera. And perhaps it comes out blood from the nostrils, or from the ears. And perhaps is severed speech, and destroyed word. And comes out from the wound place a white moisture similar to pus. And comes out from it a liquid similar to meat water.
If then appear to you these signs, then refrain from cure, and extract the arrow if it does not come out.
The signs of the arrow when it falls in the heart, are: that it is near the left nipple: and feels as if it were fixed in a hard thing, not in a soft one. And perhaps the arrow has a movement similar to pulsation: and black blood runs from the limb. And follows it this cold in extremities, and cold sweat, and fainting. Know then, that death has certainly come.
And the sign of the arrow when it wounds the lung, is the exit of frothy blood from the limb: and the veils which follow the neck, are torn, and change color, nurse. And breathes a great, strong breath: and seeks cold air.
If the arrow falls into the breast, which is within the chest: then it is near the ribs: and a great anxiety with intense pain, with sighing: and all the limbs of the shoulders move.
And if the arrow hits the belly, then perhaps it will discharge something indigger from food.
And if the arrow falls into the Belly, and is fixed there: it will discharge something of dung from the ulcer, or a rib, or an intestine which has already been torn. There is then no hope for its cure, nor for the extraction of the arrow.
If the arrow falls into the Bladder and discharges urine: and it proceeds from it something to the outside, and the pain is stronger over the sick one: then you know that it is fatal.
The rest of the limbs, such as the face, and the neck, and the throat, and the tools, and the aid, and the spinal column, and the forks, and the hip, and the leg, and those similar from the body are saved according to many dispositions: when the arrow does not hit an artery or a nerve: and there is no deadly arrow.
And I tell you that I saw such things of these arrows, so that it indicates through it about your cure.
That is, because a certain man the arrow fell into his lacrimal eye, at the root of his nose. So I extracted it from him on the other side, with fat from his ear: and he was healed, and there did not come to him any harm in his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from the Jew, which had fallen into his fat eye under his eyelid: and the arrow was already hidden, and I did not succeed to get it out except by its small end, by which it was attached to its wood: and it was a great arrow of the arrows of the Turks, with a soft iron, in which there were no ears.
He is a Jew, and no accident has befallen his eye.
And I drew out another arrow from the throat of a Christian.
And it was an Arabic arrow, and that one has ears. So I drew two arrows against her, and already one had been submerged in his throat. I was subtle with her until I pulled her out: and the Christian remained healthy.
And I drew out another arrow from a man who had fallen on his belly: and we thought that he would die of it.
After that I had left him for thirty days, and nothing was changed in his body from his disposition, I drew out the arrow against him: and I was clever with it, and pulled it out: and he remained healthy, and no accident happened to him.
And I saw a man to whom the arrow had fallen on his back, and there was a fracture on it. After that it was seven years later, the arrow came out of the root of his thigh.
And I saw a woman to whom an arrow had fallen into her belly, and there was a fracture on it, and the arrow remained inside her: and she did not change from her disposition in anything, and the woman did not find any harm in any of her natural operations.
And I saw another man to whom the arrow had fallen on his face, and there was a fracture on it, and it remained, not finding him much pain: and many such things.
And I drew out the arrow from the prince of the king, which had fallen on his nose, and had already leaned a little towards the right side: and the arrow was completely hidden.
So they called me to cure him after the fall of the arrow for three days. Then I found the arrow's shaft firmly.
So I asked him what the problem was with it, and I myself felt a prick and pain on his right side. I hoped that it was a spot at the end of the bow.
So I hoped that it was a spot at the end of the arrow. So I placed a plaster there which contained the attractive and curative power, confident with myself that the place would heal, and a sign would appear to me, like a mark on the arrow, so that I could cut above it: and did not happen in that place an accident indicating that the arrow had struck the spot.
So I persevered with the plaster for many days: and no accident happened, and the limb healed during that time: and it remained weak from the space of taking it out, until he felt an arrow one day in his nose. And he told me about that.
And he told me about that. So I applied to that limb a sharp medicine, persisting for many days until it was opened up: and when I tried to move it, I felt the tip of an arrow which was sticking in the wood.
Then I added to the opening of the wound by that sharp medicine, until we could see clearly the tip of the arrow: and passed by with me about a space of four months.
Then after the limb had grown bigger, and seemed to me to be able to put my fingers into it, and to move it, but did not yield to departure: then I did not cease to soften, and to contrive over it with modes of contrivance, until one day I came upon it with bent forforks, according as their shape appeared in the end of the cap: so that I took it out. Then I restored the limb.
And some doctors say, that the cartilage of the nose is not restored. So I restored it, and the limb healed, and the illness was completely healed by a sound health: and did him no harm at all.
And I tell you about the quality of extraction of certain arrows: that you put that rule and sign on it which I did not say.
For the parts of this art and their distinctions are not included when they are told; nor does that book include them, and a prudent craftsman compares little with much: and as it is painful, he includes what is absent: and he finds a new operation, and a new instrument from the descent of foreign things of this art when they happen.
I say then, that arrows do not come out of the body where they are fixed, except according to two ways. Or by attraction from the place from which it entered. Or by the other part of the opposite side.
And that which comes out from where it entered, or is an arrow going in a fleshly place: and is attracted, and goes out.
That if it does not submit to going out at the time at which it falls: then you must let it go for a few days, until the flesh that is around it Rotates: and its attraction will be relieved, and its exit.
And likewise if it is lodged in a bone, and does not submit to you to go out, then let it go also for a few days: and again every day with its attraction and movement until it goes out.
That if it does not submit to you to go out after a few days, then you must cut off the arrow in the bone from all parts with a sharp tool, until it grows larger. Then attract it, and pull it out.
If the arrow is already deeply embedded in the body, hidden and concealed from sensation: then feel for it with your hand. If you can feel it, then draw it out with some instruments suitable for attracting it.
If you cannot reach it, because of the constriction of the wound and the length of the arrow in the depth: and there is no bone or nerve or vessel there: then feel along it until the girth of the arrow increases, and it becomes possible to pull out the arrow.
That if there are any ears which hold it fast, then free the meat from within them by all means you can, and by any devices you have: if it is not possible to remove the meat from the broken ears, or from their twisting, until it has healed.
And you, when you carry out the extraction of the arrow, wherever it is, then use your twisted hand with forceps to all parts, until you have made it heal: and with the greatest care, so that the arrow does not break, and it becomes difficult for you to attract it, and to extract it.
That if you cannot reach it in one hour, then leave it for a few days, until those which are around it rot. Then try again: for it is a relief if you have blood flow opposite to you, then carry out what we said in our book on treatment: and guard your skill from cutting bone or nerve or tendon.
And carry out the extraction of the arrow by any means which you can: and let it be with ease, and with peace, or tardiness, and with firmness, as I have told you.
And it is necessary that, when you draw out the arrow, you make it so that the injured person walks with a limp, according to the position of the arrow when it entered the body. For this reason it is more difficult. If, however, you are unable to do so, then administer what you can from the figures.
But the arrow that comes from the opposite side or has already passed from it: or does it feel a bulge on the top of the skin near it, and see it sticking out: then cut off the top part of it, and make a second cut according to the amount that is held in it by the arrows.
Then attract it: for it becomes easier to come out.
If, however, it is held in the bone, then twist your hand according to its roundness, until the arrow presses against the bone and increases its own force: then draw it out.
And if not: leave it for a few days: then try again, until it comes out.
That if the arrow of the bow is in it, then push it with it.
If, however, it has fallen and you are able to apply an impulse: then introduce the instrument that is sharp, so that it enters into the end of the arrow: then push it with it.
If, however, the arrow is pressed together, then push it with the instrument that enters into it. For the arrow lightens through that.
That if the arrow is poisoned, then you should, so that it enters into all the flesh, in which there is poison: if possible for you to do this. Then take care of it with him when it comes to that.
That if the arrow is falling in the breast, or in the belly, or in the groin, and it is near to that which you touch when you try, and it is possible for you to cut off from it: then cut off, and be careful not to make a wound on the flesh, or on the nerve, and pull it out.
Then take care of the wound, if you see it, and take care of that, until it heals.
And this is the form of the forceps, with which the arrows are extracted.
They have tips similar to a beak, made like iron; when they grasp onto an arrow, they don't let go of it.
And there are many kinds of them, large and small and medium-sized, according to the size and width of the arrow and the depth of the wound and the constriction.
I have also found forceps that are bent at one end and straight at the other,
And the form of the forceps that is thick is
This is the end of the forceps that is wide like a radius, so that it can guide itself into the concavity of the arrow, and it pushes with it.
Regarding bloodletting through veins.
There are 30 veins that the practice of bleeding from them is customary in the body.
Of these 16 are in the head: two pulsating veins that lie behind the ears, called the two herbs; and two arteries that appear at both sides of the nose; and one vein that is in the middle of the forehead, and a vein that is found at the tip of the nose. And two guide veins that are in the neck. And two veins that are in the upper lip of the mouth. And two veins that are in the lower lip. These are the veins that are called Algecirach. And two veins under the tongue.
But the veins that are bled from the arms are five veins in every arm.
One of them is the cephalica vein, and it comes from the lateral side of the head; it is called by the common name of the capillary vein. And [the wound] becomes black. And [the wound] is in the middle, and is composed of two branches, one from the temple and one from the head: and it is called a common wound of the body. And  [the wound] of the Basilica, and is placed on the domestic side: and it is also called Titillicaris. And  [the wound] is a common wound of the hand. And   [the wound] is on the tendon of the bicep, and is placed on the edge: and that one is where phlebotomy is performed, and that one appears above the thumb with a visible thickening.
And   [the wound] of the salutation, and it is a common wound between the ring finger and the little finger, and there are two branches.
In the leg and in the foot there are three wounds. One of them is that which is under the thumb from the forest side. And the second one is Saphenous: and its location is near the heel from the domestic side. And the third one is Nerve: and its location is near the heel from the forest side.
In the leg there are also three similar wounds.
Regarding the phlebotomy of two wounds after the ears.
The phlebotomy of two wounds after the ears is a treatment for old hemorrhoids, hemigraine, saphenous venous disease, and bad ulcers on the scalp.
And the quality of phlebotomy is according to what is said. And it is, so that it is washed out with a cloth: and rubs the back of the neck at the location of two wounds with a rough cloth for good friction. Then he tightens the sick man's neck with a tourniquet until two wounds appear. And their locations are after the ears in two depressed locations on the scalp. So then you will feel with your finger, and where you feel the pulse of those ears below your finger, there are signs with cauterization.
Then take the scalpels and that is called "Incisus. Then insert it into the wound under the skin until it reaches the mouth. Then wash your hands with water and skin towards the top, and cut the skin with a scalpel cut. And make the length of the incision as much as two fingers spread out, or about that: and allow to come out as much blood as you wish.
Then tie it up with a knot, and let it be until it heals.
And now has preceded at the beginning of the book incision of the incisions, and their cauterization.
Of the two arteries which are in the two times of phlebotomy, is to the old hemorrhoidal disease: and the salt, and the careful attention: and the course above the flowing blood acute toward the eyes.
And the quality of phlebotomy is according to what I tell you. The sick man strings his neck very much, until two veins appear by a visible appearance: and they disclose their pulsations under your finger. For then are the signs with the caustice.
Then wash the skin above the vein toward the top with your index finger, and introduce the scalpel cut underneath, and wash the blood upwards. And cut it, as you did with the two veins; and allow the blood to flow according to the quantity of your need.
Then solve the constriction of the wound, and place your finger on one vein an hour. Then put thereover the cloth and knots, and tighten it with a strong constriction: and let it be until it heals.
And now has preceded at the reminder of them, and their incision, and their extraction at the beginning of the book.
The true treatment of venesection is after phlebotomy of the head, for ancient diseases of the face: and for hemicrania, and for redness: and for foul ulcers.
And the quality of phlebotomy is according to what I tell you. The injured man will lean his neck out, until the vein appears. Then take the instrument called a fossorum.
Place the prominent acme that is in the head of the fossorum on the vein, and strike it with a comb or some other way: and let the blood run according to the quantity that you want. Then solve the puncture wound, and tighten it, until it heals.
And sometimes when it opens with a phlebotomist. However, it should not be that the phlebotomist is acute of limb, as are other phlebotomists, but rather of a broad extremity. And phlebotomize it according to the transversion: since the mouth is nearby: and perhaps in that place the phlebotomist will break when it is thin.
However, the treatment of two veins that are in two tear-drops of two eyes, is for the eye from scabies and redness: and a blister in an eye, and ancient diseases of the face.
And the quality of phlebotomy of them is that it tightens the injured man's neck with a vein. Then phlebotomize them: and you stand over his head.
And make the phlebotomy according to the transversion a little bit along the length, with a little phlebotomist, and a little width, for there is no flesh in that place. If the phlebotomist is thin of limb, perhaps it will break.
Then let the blood run according to what you need. And place a cloth over them, and tighten them at night for one hour, and then solve them.
But the phlebotomy of the nose is useful for an acute fever and a swift hemorrhage and facial diseases such as a nosebleed and red spots that occur on the face: especially when it is old.
And the quality of this phlebotomy is that it tightens the neck. Then hold the nose with your left hand and take a fine, long phlebotomy needle; and fix it on the mid-point of the leporium (nasal septum), between that which separates the nose. Since the vein does not show clearly there, and because the blood begins to flow immediately:
And you should keep your hand with the needle moving slightly: and make the blood run out according to your need. Then tie it up for one night. For she will recover quickly.
But of the two phlebotomies of Guideius there is a difference: one is for constricting the hot flux, and the incipiency of leprous diseases, melancholic affections, impetigo, and bad sores, and corrosive ulcerations, that is to say, venesections.
And the quality of these phlebotomies is that it tightens the neck with a ligature on each side: and let the workman stand over the sick person's head, and let the sick person sit on a chair.
Then take a wide phlebotomy needle of the same length as the nose to be phlebotomized. Then extract a measured amount of blood, or according to what you see is necessary for that. Then do the same for the other nose.
Then loosen the ligature and squeeze two veins together, so that there is no constriction of the sick person. And let him go until morning. He will be cured.
On phlebotomy by Albucasis. But the phlebotomy of Al-Ghabiri is a means to bring about drunkenness in the mouth and corruption of the tongue; and bad sores; and cracks of the lips, and also those bad sores which are in the nose and around it.
And the quality of this phlebotomy is that you make the sick person sit before you; and tighten his neck with a strap. Then turn the lips of the person; and look at the two veins; one is on the right side of the lip, and the other is on the left side of it; and the indication of both is by the color of amber. And this is true: because there are small veins around them, black. So cut one of them with the other one.
But if there is doubt about you, and you don't know which of them is which; then turn to the incision that is bigger than them, and more apparent.
And also make the same thing with the two veins that are in the upper lip: and much more, because custom is used to it; and cut the two veins that are in the lower lip.
On phlebotomy Veins under the tongue after phlebotomy of the head. But the two veins that are under the tongue certainly require phlebotomy; because phlebotomy of the head is to remove the phlegm that is in the throat, and the disease of the throat, and the disease of the mouth.
And the quality of phlebotomizing them is that the sick person sits between your hands in front of the sun; and eat his tongue, and look at the two veins on one side of the mouth, and the other vein on the other side: and the color of both should turn to black.
So phlebotomize one and then the other; and guard, so that you don't put your hand on them when you are phlebotomizing them. For there are arteries under them, and perhaps it happens that the flow of blood from these arteries is stopped.
But the three veins that are phlebotomized in the cubit, are those in which phlebotomy was customary in all people.
And phlebotomy from them is made according to two ways. Or by pricking with the phlebotomist on the side: or by oiling to the subtlety of the decline: or by cutting with the phlebotomist with a razor, and it is Anesiac. And this is his form.
And from them are species wide, and subtle according to the amplitude of the veins and their form Phlebotomy with a Myrtle sits wide, like you see. And it is convenient to open the veins closed, full, flowing, apparent, thick, and those which contain the gross blood, turbulent.
And this phlebotomist is of less amplitude, and subtler extremities.
And it is convenient to phlebotomy from the veins that contain the subtle citrines blood,
But the basilica which is one of the three veins phlebotomy, the iuuamentum of it is. Because it draws blood from the diseases which are under the throat and neck, from which follows the chest and abdomen: and it is convenient for the phlebotomist to make a cut with the phlebotome from her, so that he may not hurt, and sit over the fear from her, because there is an artery under her. If then he should make a mistake, and adds to the cut of the phlebotomy, he will strike that artery, and will spill out the blood flow. Therefore it is convenient, so as not to phlebotomize her with a cut of the phlebotome: but sit cutting with Anesiac.
That if not the Basilica appears by a manifest sign, then it is necessary, so as to remove her away, and turn to another, or seek some branch of it: or phlebotomize in the place of her, with a string of the brachial artery. For this reason it is apparent, and I will dry it with the phlebotome Anesil, as we have said.
But if you wish to use the phlebotome of itself, then you should approach it before the stricture of the arm, so that you may touch the place, until you recognize the pulsation. Then mark the spot with caustice, then the arm as well, and dry it up with the phlebotome Anesil in a compressed section, as we have said. And let it not fall on the pulsation through space from the site of the artery.
And when you see that, as you tighten the ligament, there is swelling in the place that you marked with caustic, then that swelling is the swelling of the artery; so remove it.
That if you see the blood rise up at phlebotomy, like a boy's urine, and it is thin blood, red in color: then you will know that it is from the blood of the artery. Then draw near, and place your finger on the spot for a long space, then remove your finger. But if the blood is cut off (for it is often cut off) then tighten the arm, and let go of itself: and let there be rest from its motion: and let it lie in fear for it.
And let not the patient move for a few days, until he is healed.
But if the blood does not go away, and it hurts you: and is not present for you in the moment of your need; then cut the artery, if it appears to you. For its extremities do quiver, and the blood is cut off.
Or take the skin of the fist, and find it; or take half, and tighten it over the place of the stricture descending, with a ligament and dust up to another day.
Then if the blood is cut off, it is good. Then if not: then take care of the patient with his own recollections from the place where the blood has been cut off: and cutting off its blood is not difficult in many dispositions, because of the small wound, and the possibility of a ligament from the arm.
But the venesection of the brown-colored blood is a procedure that draws blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body: indeed, it is composed of the branch of the Basilica and the branch of the Cephalica, as we have said.
And it is fitting that the venesection should be made by one who is not afraid of phlebotomy, for under her is a nerve. If therefore you add phlebotomy to the puncture, and find a nerve, there will be stupor in her, and the cure of her is difficult, and perhaps she will not be completely cured.
And this nerve appears often to the sense. But if it is hidden in some people and is subtle and does not show itself: then you should put your venesection so that the phlebotomist makes a section with Alnecil and απομακρυνθείτε from neruam with your strength.
That if the vein is between two nerves, then find the vein in length.
On the cerebral vein. But the procedure for venesection of the cerebral vein is that it draws blood from the head and renders the diseases of the eyes.
And it is fitting in this vein to use your own, if you wish, so that you venesection it with a phlebotomizer and oil, or with a phlebotomizer and myrrh: for this vein is salutari of all veins, because it is not subcutanea artery, nor is there a nerve.
But it is fitting for you to go to venesection, so that you have the head only of a pig, and ask for a softer place: and it does not harm him, if it is not found with a blow first, so that it returns over it with phlebotomy sometimes.
But perhaps he is blistered in some people when he is not phlebotomized in a blow first, but it does not harm him that blister, but that blister hurts him in a certain thing.
On the usefulness of phlebotomy and precautions to be taken when performing it. The quality of phlebotomy and the complications that may arise from it are what you should consider carefully in its correction.
First therefore of its concerns is that you should know that phlebotomy is not performed unless for the preservation of health, and perseverance in it, and caution against the advent of illnesses.
And so that phlebotomy be made from one of three veins which are in the bed, namely the cerebral, and the femoral, and the bazilica. And so that phlebotomy be made at the beginning of the day on a fasting stomach, in summer, and autumn, and winter after digestion, when the signs of fullness are evident.
And let phlebotomy be made on the first day, or on the third day, having elapsed three hours after the end of the day.
But phlebotomy that is administered in illnesses does not have a determined hour: but when it provokes convenience and necessity towards it, at night, or during the day, and at any hour, and at all times.
And it is not necessary that boys be phlebotomized until they have reached the age of fourteen. Nor should a pregnant woman be phlebotomized until she has reached her seventh month. Nor should seniors who have already passed the age of sixty be phlebotomized.
When anyone wishes to undergo phlebotomy for any reason: he should wash his intestines thoroughly before phlebotomy with castor oil, if there is much waste retained in them: so that the veins do not attract uenae, putrid effluents from the intestines, onto the main members.
Nor should a patient who is convulsed, that is, nauseous, or a drunkard until he has removed the intoxication from himself. Nor an invalid with hydrophobia.
And let phlebotomy be repeated again after a fever, or a cough, or a flux of blood, or the multiplication of copulation, or labor, or exercise, or vigils, or fasting, or any that dissolves virtue from the corporeal or animal substance.
Then consider in subtlety of humors before that, if blood is thick with food and drink, and medicines: if possible to him that.
Then introduce steam, if it does not forbid itself anything: or exercise himself with some exercise, that the blood be subtilized.
And place phlebotomy in his chest, on the third day, as we have said: and be careful, so that his chest is emptied of all animal accidents on that day: such as anger, fear, and pain: and of all bodily accidents, such as labor, punishment, excess, and those like.
And let him make these present things his usual use, from which custom of men by the aromatic, and fragrance, and delight, and like things by quantity of possibility.
Then let the phlebotomist sit on a tray, that it be higher than the phlebotomy tray: then he shall draw out his arm, and rub himself with the phlebotomist's hand twice, or three times. Then let him tie a ligature with the thong, and twist it around: then he shall wrap it up twice.
And let it be tight and warm, because if it is not equal, or by excess in the constriction, then it forbids the course of blood: or in mildness, then also it forbids the course of blood.
Then after the constriction, let the phlebotomist rub his hands together on both sides, until the veins swell, and present themselves to the sense.
Then the phlebotomist shall wipe the phlebotomy with a little oil, old and of his own.
Then let him place his index finger of his left hand on the vein where he wants to make the phlebotomy, a little: so that the vein does not run away, and the piercing sound. For from the veins is it that he draws like a running string during phlebotomy: and those are full of blood: and when you place the phlebotomy on it, it is constricted by the phlebotomy, and deceives the phlebotomist, and does not open the vein: and if it opens it, then it is constricted: so that therefore it is necessary that the phlebotomist should tighten it, and be careful in all these things.
Then let him deposit the phlebotomy. If then a new vein is opened from one side, then it is good. And if not, then repeat that same vein slightly below that place or above it with speed: if the spot does not bleed.
That if it bleeds, or grows weak, then discharge him for a day, or two days: and do not tie the ligature. Perhaps, because the heat of the wound may attract the bleeding. And let him not be bathed in a bath.
Then let him repeat the phlebotomy if he wishes it.
That if the opening is small, or the blood runs gently: and be careful that not an excessive amount of blood comes out: then repeat the phlebotomy in the same spot according to the direction, and add a little to the procedure.
And do so with speed, before that place bleeds: for a bleeder place is often found in many people during surgery.
If then you see that he has already bled, then do not repeat the phlebotomy at all: for it does not excuse with you to let anything happen. And put something on the spot from a mixture of oil: because it softens the course of the blood. And is better in this place than his own oil, and than any other oil.
And administer the same oil to all your phlebotomies when you wish to stop the course of the blood: and they make it alfarach, and saffron, when put from one of them on the spot.
For the blood is softened and dissolved when it is thick.
That if a great apoplexy happens in the spot of phlebotomy, for many times it has happened, especially to him who is not phlebotomized except from that vein, or is an opening of a small vein, then bind and put on the spot a sponge soaked in water and salt, warmed slightly: and tie it tight for one hour: for it is dissolved.
You should make it so that after the flow of blood from the wound itself, with its own complement, or from another new wound.
That if it remains in the place after a few days of bruising, or redness, it does not harm that: and if there is swelling, put something on top of it of aloe, or of dissolved myrrh: or some of the juice of mint, that is, calamus or something like it.
And many times indeed have there been hemorrhoids and eminences in the practice of phlebotomy at the Basilica.
So place your hand on it, then if it is soft and fragile under your pressure on it, then that eminence is evil. Cause therefore so that you put something on it from that which I said. For perhaps blood will flow from it of the artery.
But make an aplaster with it where there is stenosis, so that the place hardens. Then take care of the wound with the rest of the cure, until it heals.
And it is fitting that every man should give up some of his blood according to the quantity of his virtue. And what seems to shine on the surface of the blood.
For if the blood is black, then let it not go out until it turns red: and likewise if you see it thick: then let it not go out until it thins: and likewise if it is sharp, then let the sharpness be taken away from it.
And it is fitting for him who is full, strong, and accustomed to the extraction of blood by a single blow, so as to increase the phlebotomy of the new one, and to be a phlebotomist on the back: but in him who is weak, be contrary to that.
And it is fitting that he draws out the wound with blows, and that the hole is closed tight: and better it is if it is administered in the phlebotomy of the new one, so that it is a transverse section, not a puncture.
And this method of phlebotomy is safer from the flow of blood, and from the incising of nerves: and it is more praiseworthy, and healthier than phlebotomy by width and length.
And he who is accustomed to having syncope during phlebotomy, it is necessary that he eat a little bread before phlebotomy moistened with water of gravel: or if it is cold, he should take secaniabin; and let him give himself blood in three or four vessels.
And if his complexion is cold, then he should take before phlebotomy bread moistened with syrup of myrrh, or with syrup of honey flavored with spices, or with syrup flavored with odorous substances.
If syncope occurs during phlebotomy and it is the cause of a lot of blood loss, then he should drink water of meat and syrup of scent, and he should use aromatics with algarrobite, and he should open his chest while doing so: and he should use whatever we mentioned in the division on syncope from evacuation.
But whoever wants to let his arm bleed and make up for the blood loss: it is necessary that he who does phlebotomy for extensive evacuation, and whose power is weak, should make up for the blood little by little over a certain period of time.
But whoever wants to let his arm bleed and make up for the blood loss, and whose body is strong: then he should do it after seven or nine hours since his first phlebotomy.
But whoever wants to draw blood from his body towards the opposite side of which he leans: it is necessary that he should do so on the second or third day.
But in the body of which there is much blood already heated and sharpened, and it causes a fever: it is necessary that he should get out of it blood in one vessel, and extract from it a great quantity; and increase the opening until syncope occurs: after that you have kept all the conditions of phlebotomy: and let your hand rest on his pulse during the course of the blood, so that syncope does not occur at the place. For many times this has happened when the phlebotomizer is careless, and he falls by neglect.
And it is not right that you should tie the arm when you wish to cut, and cut the blood according to the second way, when the orifice of the vein has already been closed, and let the exit of the blood be difficult, so that it rushes over itself with a sudden movement, and let it curve and extend quickly. For this is bad to tie tightly, let go of it until the blood is bled by the second way.
Or move it with sharpness of phlebotomy this that is coagulated from blood at the orifice of the vein, and put over it something dissolved in water of salt. And put over it some of the alkaloids of the arnica, or of the sage, and put the compress on it gently until the blood exits.
But if the vein is already torn, then let go of it, and do not tie it, until it has healed.
That if necessity compels to bleed by the second way, and there is no excuse, then either phlebotomize the person above that place, or in the arm of another in a different vein.
But the vein of the arm is phlebotomized at the place of the fuscus and basilica, when they are not found, and are hidden, since it is composed of them.
And the quality of the phlebotomy of it is, that it should put the hand of the sick in hot water, until it turns red, and the vein appears clearly.
Then tie over it with a little tight binding on the middle. Then bleed by the second way little by little, not wide, and not along its length: and let the opening be wide, and let your bleeding be over the vein a little.
That if the exit of the blood is prevented, then again put the hand in hot water, and let the blood run into the water, until you have satisfied your need.
But if you are in the days of summer, then you are excused from again putting the hand in hot water. For certainly the course of blood is put into warm water at the time of the winter.
And phlebotomy of this vein is salutary for all veins, because there is no pulsation of blood under it, and there are no nerves.
On the right hand, phlebotomy is salutary for those with liver sickness.
And the quality of phlebotomy is such that you squeeze the hand with a ligature, or your own hand, after you have put it into warm water, until the blood stirs and shows by touch to be very cold. Then phlebotomize it by passing through. And if you cut it entirely, it will not hurt him at all.
And keep your hand away from the phlebotomy after. Because under it are naked nerves of the fingers stripped of their flesh.
Then repeat the hand to warm water, and let the blood flow into it. For if you do not heat the hand in warm water, the blood will clot in the incision of the vein, and the course will be stopped.
But when you extract a quantity of blood as needed, then put oil and salt on the vein so that it does not consolidate quickly.
And likewise it is necessary to do the same with all branches that are tight.
The instruction for the phlebotomy of the left hand is this: because it is salutary for heart sickness; and likewise do the same for the phlebotomy of it as you did in the second place equally.
The instruction for the phlebotomy of the saphenous vein is this: for diseases that are in the lower part of the body, such as those of the kidneys, and retention of the monthly flow, and sickness of the kidneys and bladder, and old sores of the legs and feet, and other similar ailments.
And the quality of the phlebotomy is such that he puts his sick foot into warm water; and let him make friction on it until the blood comes out; and bind above the ligature with a thong. And this place is even on the calcaneus, appearing opposite to the thumb; and many branches emerge from it in front of the foot.
Therefore let her bleed from a larger branch of her, or at the calcaneus in their gathering; for it is better and more salutary.
If she should bleed from before the foot, then be careful of the nerves which are under her on the surface of the foot.
And put your phlebotomy where you want to phlebotomize her from behind, as if you wished to pierce her; and let the phlebotomy be done.
If however the blood flow is forbidden, then turn her other foot to warm water; and let not the blood run into her until it has drained off.
If however there is an error in the phlebotomizing of the first vein, then let it remain with the phlebotomy up to the same degree, for the place is salutary; and do not wait for it from the malice, when you cauterize the nerves, as we said.
And likewise with the saphenous vein of the other foot equally.
But the location of the sciatic veins, as we said, is on the calcaneus from the lateral side.
And the incision for her phlebotomy is, to the pain of the ankle, when it is due to the warm blood.
And the quality of her phlebotomy is, that it should enter into an infirm bath, and cause a tingling; and tightly tie her foot from the lateral ankle up to the calcaneus with a long and slender thread: for it does not appear otherwise than because of this.
When however it appears, then phlebotomize her according to whatever talent you have, or at the location; and it is better, or as if you should pierce her with an incision, or cut her off by a section. For the place of her is salutary, and she herself is hidden from many people greatly.
For the place of her is salutary, and she herself is hidden from many people greatly. If however you do not feel her at all: then phlebotomize some of her branch, and that which appears on the back of the foot, and opposite to the ear; and cauterize the nerves, and let blood run in quantity as much as you wish.
Then cut the strip tightly, and put it on the place where the blood has been let, and tighten the place. For this quickly heals.
(Concerning Wind-sucking and its quality of use.)
Wind-sucking takes place from horns, and from air, and from moisture.
And Wind-sucking takes place in two ways. (With scarification and the extraction of blood) one is Wind-sucking with scarification, and extraction of blood; and another is Wind-sucking without
(And this Wind-sucking, which is without scarification), takes place in two ways: one is Or on the other hand it is with fire. Or without fire.
And those Wind-suckings which are performed with scarification and extraction of blood, are four places in the body. Of these four places in the body are: one is Wind-sucking of the Alnocrati, and it is at last of the head: and Alkehel, and it is in the middle of the neck: and uenosas Alhagdahim, and there are two laminae of the neck from both sides simultaneously: and uentosas of the mind, and it is under the mandible in the lower mouth: and uentosas of two spatulas: and uentosas of the tail; and uentosas of two flames, and they are in the middle of the two arms: and uentosas of the two chaps: and uentosas of the two shoulders.
(And Wind-sucking does not extract blood from you from small scattered veins in the flesh, and for this reason its power does not fall out of them, as is the case with phlebotomy.) Nor does it need to be administered Wind-sucking either with fire or without fire in any sickness which happens from fullness, until the whole body has been emptied.
If need calls for Wind-sucking because of sickness, or because of custom, let it be administered at the beginning, end, and middle of the month, and at any time.
For it is because he is a man who, when blood multiplies within him, does not become ill from its extraction by vomiting, but remains in his head giddiness and dizziness.
And of them is he who finds swelling and redness on his face, on his head, and on his neck. And of them is he who finds itching on his face, on his forehead, darkness, and dullness in his eyes.
And of them is he who scratches the place of his venesection. And of them is he whose laughter multiplies. And of them is he who finds the taste of blood in his mouth, or spits it out with his tongue, and vomits up blood. And of them is he whose sleep multiplies. And of them is he who sees in his sleep blood and redness, and slain men, and plagues, and things like those.
When then do we perform venesection if we see anything of them, and especially if it is in the third month from the beginning of the month: let us then perform it after two or three hours have passed since the middle of the day.
But the venesection of the nape is: for it turns to giddiness in the head, and because it flows out into the eyes. But it should be done after emptying the whole body.
And this venesection is at a place phlebotomy of the head.
And it should not be used as a person with a cold complexional appearance, or one who is hoarse. For it inflicts great harm.
And because of that, it should not be used as a person who has old age, and in whose head there are diseases of cold.
But whoever is accustomed to it, he gets over it by oblivion.
And because of that, you should order the venesection, so that he lays his hand with a gentle press down below, fearing the generation of oblivion.
Ventosatio or Alkehel is the place of the Phlebothymia of Fuscae and of the Basilica; for that reason it provides relief from asma, constriction of the windpipe, the instrument's fissures, cough, and congestion.
And it should be that Ventosa Alkehel is pushed further back, because if it is placed lower, it generates weakness in the heart and stomach.
But Ventosa Alkehel, it brings relief to the pains of accidents in the head, and to the eyes, and to the headaches, and to the perforations, and to the pain in the roots of the teeth; and it is the place of phlebotomy of the Basilica.
And it should be that you prevent the Ventosator from touching his hand with the scarification, so that he does not hit an artery and cause a flow of blood.
But Ventosa under the chin, brings alcohol into the mouth, and corruption of the gums, and similar ailments that are in the mouth: and it is the place of phlebotomy of Alieherich, which are in the two lips.
But Ventosa spatulas, brings relief to alchafacham, which is made from a vibration and heat.
But Ventosa of the inner parts, brings relief to the phlebotomy of the three veins, Basilicae, and Fuscae, and Cephalicae: because it itself attracts blood from all those tiny veins that are in the flesh: and these tiny veins attract the blood from other larger veins until it reaches the attraction of the three veins.
And it should be that you prevent the Ventosator from going too deeply in the scarification, because the place is deprived of flesh, and under it are nerves and arteries.
But Ventosa that is applied on Alchazaus, brings hemorrhoids of the Anus, and ulcers of the lower parts.
And it should be that you prevent the Ventosator from making the Ventosa too small, and that it is made of iron: because the place does not endure strong suction, and perhaps the fine Ventosas break: and it is scarified with a large scarification.
The veins of the legs diminish and are evident because they draw blood from all over the body, and increase old pains in the kidneys, uteruses, and urinary bladder; induce menstruation, and produce bothorrhea and emesis; and stand at the site of phlebotomy of the two saphenous veins, and alhorcobeni.
However, they weaken the body greatly, and cause fainting in many people.
And the alhorcobeni of the two leg veins is a close connection to the alhorcobeni of the two saphenous veins.
The quality of the position of the leg vein is that you place the venose in the first place empty, and suck with a moderate temper: and do not prolong the position of the veins, but put them quickly, and move them quickly so that the humors go to the site of adventitious equally: and do not cease to repeat this and continue, until you see the site has already turned red and swollen, and appears to be red blood: then therefore cut, and repeat sucking slowly. Then consider in the disposition of the bodies.
For he who is among men of tender flesh and rare pores, should cut himself once, not more: so that the site does not ulcerate.
And prescribe to the venous cutter, so that he amplifies the cutting, and digs a little: and moderates sucking in convenience, and speed, and smooth movement.
That if there is thickness in the blood, then you should cut himself twice. In a vessel, however, the first opening is a path of subtilization of blood, and its liquification: and in the second, indeed, the perscrutation of exquisite extraction of thick blood.
But if the blood is very foul, then let there be a third cutting: so that it leads to the last.
And to the last, when we wish to extract blood slowly, or little by little, a single cutting is sufficient for us. If we wish to extract a lot of blood, we make many incisions.
And if we measure, that the blood is thick: then it is necessary, so that the incision is deep: and the term equal in the incision, is the depth of the skin.
What is that which needs to be administered from oils during the placement of the ventosas, and what causes the veno-sandus.
In that indeed whose skin is thick, hard, dark, and the pores of which are tight, it is necessary that the places of the ventosas are anointed with open, soothing, and resolved oils: if it is in the time of summer, as is the oil of a number of things, or oil of caraway, or oil of almonds, or seed-oil.
And if it is in the time of winter, then oil of narcissus, or oil of lilies, or oil of chamomile, or oil of mustard: and to these similar ones.
But if there is too much coldness, then oil of bitter-fennel, or oil of benzoe, or oil of albus, or oil of annatto: and to these similar ones.
But if the veno-sandus is of large pores, of tender flesh: then it is necessary that there be a prohibition from oil, and that these anoint the places of the ventosas after the veno-sandus with rose-water, or cold water, or water of the marigolds, or seed-cress-water: and to these similar ones.
That one whom the blood is of much moisture, he washes the ventosas with vinegar, or with water of myrtle, and of sumach: and to these similar ones.
Whom the excessives are thick, he washes his ventosas with old wine, or water of samphire, or decoction of anetium, or of chamomile: and to these similar ones.
And it is necessary that the veno-sandus be caused in a bath, or in a dressing-room of the bath: and it is necessary that be administered after going out from the bath for an hour, or for two hours.
And it is not appropriate for anyone to sleep after wound care.
What is the need for someone to be fed or bled before wound care.
And after that, it is necessary to consider the first things: if the person is cholericky and there is an acuteness and inflammation in his blood then it is necessary for him to take cooling things like granulated mulberry: also dandelion with vinegar and lettuce and secanabium and juice.
And place on his food porridge and meat that is sour, and cooked food with acorn: and similar things.
And if his complexio is cold then it is necessary for him to take syrup of honey or almond or alsecaniabin made from seeds in wine: and he should take medium-strong wine that is between new and old: and let him be directed to eat a little food. And place on his food porridge and hay: and pigeons, that is, many birds: and let him eat pigeon pellets.
And it is necessary for the wine of wound care and phlebotomy to be stronger than food: and it is necessary for it to be given in a drink to some people in hours of tyrrhenic alfaroch or medicine of musk, that is muscata, or alesselithe before wound care: and before phlebotomy or after: so as to strengthen the main muscles and refine the blood. And it is not appropriate for them to drink it in hot wine.
Of wound care without scarring. But wound care that is without scarring are those that are placed on the liver, and the spleen, and the podanum, and over the windpipe, and the navel, and places of the reins, and the pixied anus: because these members do not undergo scarring on themselves.
And it is not sought for them except for an attactio from one member of blood to a member: such as we place Wound care on the breasts in a fever of blood flow. And we use them so that we can heal a cold, irritated member of the body, in the same way as we put wind on the belly and navel. For it itself tightens up the member, and warms it, and takes away the pain because it has healed that cold irritation.
Also, it is placed on the hips when there is an accumulation of fluid or a stone. For its own power of attraction may perhaps open up an accumulation or remove a stone from its place.
And it is the same when placed on the liver and the spleen to relieve any irritation in them. For in both cases, if there is an accumulation of wind, it opens it up.
And these Wind-relievers are applied with a slight cut only. And sometimes they are applied with fire.
And sometimes they are applied, filled with warm water, in cases of pleural pain; and that is to say, so that it becomes full of the Wind-reliever, and great in size, with just warm water alone, or with water in which have been boiled the herbs that are suitable.
The form of the application of the Wind-relievers with fire:
Let the width of its opening be that of two fingers put together, according to the form we have given; and let the quantity of it in the depth be half the length of a palm: and let it be placed on one side of the member at the point which is about halfway along it, a small hole, according to the quantity which is put into it: let it be made of brass, or yellow metal, broad-edged, smooth, equal, sharp, or triangular: so that it does not hurt the member at the point where it is placed on top of it: and let there be a cross-bar of brass, or iron, where the candle is placed with fire.
And this great Wind-reliever can also be made, larger than we have described, and a slightly smaller one, according to the diseases and age of the person who uses it.
For the Wind-relievers are different for boys, and those which weaken are different from those which relieve men, and from those which are suitable for large bodies.
The quality of this placement of the wound with fire on the limb is that, as you light the linseed oil with fire from linen that is out of center, or a candle made of pitch: and place it in the middle of the hip bone across which is in the middle of the wound: so that the fire is set around the lower part of the wound, so that the body does not burn.
Then place on the limb and the finger is placed on the hole that I said, as long as we hold the wound open: while we are holding it open, let us remove the finger, and steam will come out of that hole and immediately dissolve the wound.
Then with oil fire according to its way, and repeat it if you are not used to it.
But in the wound that is administered with water in pleurisy disease, there is no transverse hip bone or hole: and it is not administered unless it is filled with water, and placed only on the limb.
And this is its form.
And this wound is the more large one, because it takes a lot of water, it is better.
The suspension of blood sugar.
Blood sugar is not administered in many places unless the limb cannot be placed on a wound due to its smallness, such as a lip, and gums, and similar ones. Or in a naked member from meat, such as a finger, and nose, and similar things.
And the quality of using them is that you come from blood sugar that is in sweet waters, clean from corruption.
Then they are left off during the day and night in sweet water, until they become hungry, and nothing remains in their stomachs. Then the body is emptied out with phlebotomy, and with wound opening. Then the limb is washed, until it turns red. Then they are placed on top of it.
When therefore they are filled and fall, and it is possible to suck the place with a flowing [blood], then it is more appropriate to tie up: and if not, then suck the place with vinegar. Then, when there is much water, and it is frothed and pressed out.
If the course of blood continues after the loss of blood from the wound and there is a residue: then put a cloth made of linen into cold water, and let it rest on top until the residue has dried up.
If the blood multiplies, then sprinkle powder on top of the wound, crushed eggshell, or similar things from astringent: until the blood has dried up.
Or place on top of the place half of crushed herbs that are used to stop bleeding: and let them be left until the herbs have stuck to the place, because the blood has dried up.
And it is necessary if the necessity arises to repeat the application of bloodletting, when it is possible, to change them.
If however bloodletting by suspension is prohibited, then the place is cleaned with recently flowing blood. Or tie it up now on the places until something of the blood goes out. Then place them on, for they themselves, as soon as they feel a little bit of blood, stick immediately.
When therefore you want them to fall, sprinkle on top of them some crushed aloe or salt or ash, and they fall immediately.
This chapter is also often necessary in the art of medicine, and it is the restoration of a fracture, and a dislocation of accidents in bones.
Know you sons, that many doctors of our time are proud of this chapter, and the crowd, and have not ever examined the ancient book, nor read a letter from it.
This is why this method is not used among us because it belongs to the sciences which are kept secret on our earth. And I have never found it at all useful, and I have not succeeded in it, except for the length of the reading of old books, and the study of their intelligence, until I extracted the science from them.
Then I adhered to experiment and practice because of the length of my life.
Then I have described to you from that all the science that contains my book: and on what concerns the experiment of mine, which I will abbreviate to you, since I have shortened it, and freed it from the occupation of elongation, and abbreviated it by the end of abbreviation, and showed it by the end of depreciation: and I formed in it many forms from the forms of instruments that are administered in it, when it is from the addition of depreciation, as I did in two preceding chapters.
Chapter II.
It is necessary, that we should say in the prologo of this chapter, the sum of the discourse, and chapters, to which the intellect of the artisan is considered in the first place on the truth of it: that is to say, that you, and who are ready, know, or learn this noble art, and others from you.
I say, therefore, that when it happens to anyone that there is a fracture, or dislocation, or torsion, or fall: then you should take care in the first place to phlebotomate him, and solve him, or both simultaneously: if not prevent anything, such as weakness of strength: or is he who happened to some boy, or old man of decrepitus: or it is a time of severe heat, or a severe cold.
Then be satisfied with your food, cold drinks, meats of birds and heads; and prohibit wine, thick meat, and food that fills the veins with blood. Until you are completely cured of your fever and no longer have any discharge from the wound; then return to your regular routine with that person, after his habit has been restored.
Since then, when the broken jaw begins to be healed and fed with food that is nourishing and abundant, dry, and heavy, and full of blood; as with food made from wheat cooked with water, and rice, and heads, and feet, and entrails of animals, and eggs, and fresh fish: and strong wine, and similar things. Since this regimen will make the fracture heal faster and better.
And know that bones that are broken, when they are in a person who is in their old age and decrepitude, it is not possible for them to continue and be healed according to their nature always, due to the drying up of their limbs: and they are healed and continue in the end of their leniency, such as the bones of young boys.
However, nature heals a broken bone from all parts with some kind of glue, in which there is roughness, by which it clings and binds itself together, until it becomes whole and firm, just as it was in the beginning, until it does not prohibit any of its functions: and because of this reason, you must put food into the diet that contains a lot of moisture, and is dry, and heavy, and full of blood, as we have said.
And know that the types of fractures are different, according to the difference between the limbs: for a fracture of the leg is different from a fracture of the skull: and a fracture of the breast bone is different from a fracture of the spine: and similarly all the other limbs are different from each other; and I will come back with a reminder of all the types of fractures that have been mentioned in their own chapter, which is distinct from the others. They also differ in the types of fractures of bones, even within themselves.
For the fracture is curved, except that which happens to it in the sternum. And when the fracture is according to the length of the bone; and there are fractures of the hand, that is to say, of the sternum, and additions proceeding from it, as are in the reed, when it is held by a knife for writing. And not proceeding: and there is a fracture with the ulna and dislocation in the head; and there is a fracture, a small crack.
And every species has an art, or its own instrument for repairing it, according to the memory of it, distinguished in its places.
And from this it is known that the fracture of a bone is its curvature and eminence; and its appearance to the sense, and its sound when you press it with your hand.
And when it is not in place, the curvature does not appear, nor does its sound at touch with your hand when you press the bone with agitation; and there is no great pain in it: then it is not a fracture there, but possible that there is a curvature or a small crack; so you need not to move it with your hand and compression completely, but rather place something firm on it from the doctors, of whose memory it has been said, after time has passed when it comes to its place: and then tighten it tightly with a string.
And you should know that the place when it is curved, and is divided into two, except that which happens to it in the sternum; nevertheless, all parts are removed from each other: so you must begin to straighten it from your time, equalizing it before it happens to it an apostema of heat.
But if it has happened to it an apostema of heat; then you should leave it for a few days, until the apostema is at rest. Then make it equal on all sides according to your ability, with ease and art.
You should know that restoration and equality of this are easier than bones, in which satagination occurs.
Then tighten him up, according to how you want his memory to be.
If, however, satagiae have occurred in the bone, then it is necessary to extend this broken member from two parts, if the hand is affected, or the foot: or with your hand only, if the member is small: or with two cables, or with a cable and a hand.
And your position should be such that you put the member on a place of equality, according to its natural shape, until all the parts of the broken member are extended: then be careful that you do not add anything in any way, and in any form you can: and be careful, according to your strength, that no pain occurs due to your operation, or negligence: and be careful according to your strength, so that you join one two bones with its associate, according to the better forms.
And it is necessary in that hour, so that you try and touch him with your hand. If then you see anything different there, straightened out it is, and equal it out by the amount of your strength.
And be careful that the extension does not become sudden, and strong compression, as many do with their stupidity. For often by such operation of theirs, they cause hot apoplexy, or contraction in a member: as we have already seen this from their operations many times.
Then, after the equality has been completed, and the work of stretching the member is done, and it has become stiff, and quiet, and calm: and warn the sick person about him. And make him careful not to move in the hour of his strength, and his sleep at its revolution, and agitation, and his delivery, and all his movements at the last of his strength. And so that he does not cause a position to be in place where pain follows. When he feels pain or injury in the position of a member, then it is necessary that you change him to another position from which he does not feel pain.
And if with him so that his position is equal, straight: so that there does not happen to the member, when it is restored, a curvature,
and the quality of a broken member is, according to whether it is narrow.
You know that broken members differ in their break, and their size, and their shape.
Which of them are small, such as the arm, and the finger, and the paw, and such things, then it is necessary that there be a soft, thin cloth. Which, however, are thick, such as the hip, and the leg, it is necessary that there be a broad, hard cloth.
Since the wide ligament connects a large member and tightens it from all parts with an equal tightness so that it does not enter it with a wound.
Then begin to put after your evacuation the ointment suitable for it on the fracture site with a soft cloth in a poultice. Then begin to wrap the ligament over the site of the fracture three or four times, as much as the limb deserves: and hold your hand lightly with the bandage.
Then walk with it to the upper part from the site of the fracture, and tighten less than the tightness you tightened the broken spot, how tight you tightened the spot. Then stretch yourself with the bandage from the site of the fracture slightly, and soften the tightness gradually, until you take it off at the healthy spot on the skin.
Then take another clean one, and wrap it again over the broken site with the bandage. Then walk with it to the lower part from the fracture spot. And let your operation be in the tightness of the bandage, and the softening of it, as we said in the first upper wrapping.
Then place between the folds of the envelope or cloth a piece of linen, with which to cover the fracture, if it is twisted; and if not, do not place anything in it.
Then wrap another bandage over the top. Then immediately apply a warm poultice to these bandages if there is no swelling or bruising; and an ice pack if there is swelling or bruising.
If there is swelling or bruising, then place a poultice on it and let it sit to draw out the swelling; and leave it for a few days. Then bind firmly around the area.
And the bands should be made from middle sections of a long cane, thin and shaped wisely; or from a crib-like material made from pine, or from bark; and each band should have the same width and shape, and this same figure.
However, the band that is applied to the limb should be slightly thicker and wider than the others; and the length of the band should correspond to the size and shape of the member.
Then bind the bands together with another piece of linen wrapped tightly around them. Then tie the top ends together with a loose knot, as we have said regarding the tightness of the bandage; and let the length of the band be less than the distance from the fracture, for the tighter it is, the more it will hurt; and if it is too long, cut it short.
And let the middle bands be neither too thick nor too thin, and let them be made of soft linen.
For if the bands are too thick, as when a band of linen is wound around with a knuckle from a string of linum tortum, it causes great injury; for the bandage slips out of its place.
And thin bands are also not suitable: because you do not achieve what you want by using a band that is too loose.
And it should not be less than the thickness of a finger between the band and the member.
If one is injured through the extremities of the limbs after a constriction in healthy places: then place under them from a loose cloth or red wool, until there is no more injury from it.
But when the fracture is with the ulnar bone, and there is a rupture on the skin, I will come to it with a reminder of it in the second chapter for singularity.
And you should know that not every broken limb needs to be immobilized with splints from the first day. That is, because the limb is large when it is, you should not place it on top of splints, unless after five days or seven or more, according to your security from the appearance of callus heat.
And this is the way that the ancient splints were made, which were placed on top of the fracture and dislocation.
A common shortened way of making splints, suitable for restoring fractures with many layers, especially for women and children; because it does not injure from heat, nor does it freeze.
And it is so that you take from a flour miller's cloth, and there is a flour that hangs on the walls of the miller's motion: and lay it down as it is, except for that the wires are covered with white wax; and place its coating not thick, nor thin. Then use it.
A different way of making splints, suitable for restoring fractures and dislocations and twists. Take almes, and lauren, and acacia, and ewes' milk, and mug-beer; and honey of both kinds, of myrrh five parts, and of aleth 20 parts to mix it with water of alethil; or with white wax if the ointment is for a warm injury. Then use this splint. For it is a good composition, which restore broken bones quickly, and suit many people.
A different way of applying an plaster which is also used for fractures and twists. Take myrrh and meslin and other herbs in equal parts: of myrrh 10 drachms, of meslin and other herbs 5 drachms, of acacia 6 drachms, of armenian bole 20 drachms; all well crushed and mixed with water or albumen: and give it to the patient.
This is a method of applying an ointment for joints, bones separated in their own places: and to soothe pain, injury to them, fracture of the bone, and twist. Take a lamb's wool, and immerse it in vinegar and oil, and place it on the spot.
And this plaster is not useful for restoring (health), but is good for soothing inflammation of heat: and it drives away the pains (of their own accord).
This is a method of applying an ointment which restores a broken bone. Take leaves of fig and leaves of wild papaya; all well crushed, and make an ointment of both.
This is a short method of applying an ointment, to be used for restoring a broken bone: and when you wish to use it for soothing inflammation. Take roots of echinacea and chamomile and flowers of violet and herb-seed, all in equal parts; well crushed all, and mixed with wine, if it is not a member which needs to be warmed.
If it is however to be warmed, then prepare that with water of coriander and water, and use it.
This is a stronger method of applying an ointment in case of inflammation which occurs first when restoring a limb. Take roots of echinacea and linseed and balm of gomsuc and mealy-fruit and violet and chamomile, all in equal parts; well crushed, and mixed with water of willow, or with sweet water, or with wine. All this is due to the heat of the member, and the calmness of his heat.
Hippocrates, indeed, did not say in his book that a broken member should be placed in a poultice made of straw and oil, unless it has become infected, nor did he say anything else, and he relates, that it should be between coarseness and softness.
But Galenus, however, has related that they should be placed on a broken member during its restoration, those things in which there is drying up of heat, such as Myrrh and Aloes and Olibanum, and similar ones from these that we have mentioned.
The mode of the poultice which is applied to a wound and pain. Take wool and chickpea and hair of man's teeth, or feathers of bird, and aloes, and salt in equal parts: they are to be ground and shaken up, and made into a poultice.
But as regards the quantity, so that the binding remains and then is resolved, you are to consider this then, if it does not happen that the pain remains sick, nor itchiness, nor the broken jaw moves from its place: do not resolve it over several days. If, however, it happens to him in the place that there is a severe itchiness, or an annoying pain, or an inflammation: then hasten and resolve it at once, and take away the poultice from him: and take a sheet of linen, or a sea sponge, wet with linen: and dip it into warm water, and wash away the place with it, until the itchiness is appeased, and the pain subsides.
If, however, it happens to him in the place that there is a severe itchiness, or an annoying pain, or an inflammation: then hasten and resolve it at once, and take away the poultice from him: and take a sheet of linen, or a sea sponge, wet with linen: and dip it into warm water, and wash away the place with it, until the itchiness is appeased, and the pain subsides. Then let the member rest for an hour. Then put on the member a sheet of linen smeared with vinegar and oil, or with oil only: and bind it over him for the night, so that he is safe from being affected by heat, and let the pain in the member subside, and let the pain of the member cease.
Then repeat the application to the member of a thin poultice, and of a few: and do not tighten it with your own constriction first, and with something fine, until it is healed.
If you see that the apthalma [a small flap of skin] is red, painful, swollen, and all other symptoms have disappeared completely, and the plaster has dried up and the constriction has relaxed, then apply it again as you did at first, equally.
If any of these conditions do not exist in the member, do not remove the plaster until after three days, or four, or five, or seven. And when the plaster has been removed after twenty days as far as the member seems to you to be free from its symptoms, according to what we have said, until such time that the fracture seems to be united, and the coagulation of flesh above it is approximated: add also then to the constriction more than your first constriction: and add also to the swelling of food as much as the recollection of it preceded.
If you see the place of the fracture is drying up and becoming weaker than necessary: then know that food is forbidden to reach it. So wet the plaster with warm water at every turn, and let it remain on for all three days, and let the constriction be slightly relaxed.
By this means the operation runs to the member with food, and heals quickly.
But that which the clumsy restorators do from a fracture of the limb, when they do not restore it in the first place, according to what is necessary, and restore it according to its tortuosity, is an error of their operation, and a great fear: and if it were right, the ancient ones would have said it in their books, and would have operated with it.
And I did not see any trace of theirs at all on that, and it is better not to do so.
Regarding the making of an accident in the head.
There are many kinds and shapes of fractures, and its causes are separate.
For from a fracture is caused by a blow, and the blow takes the bone away until it reaches the socket, which is under the bone, as it does in wood by an axe: and for this reason this type of fracture is called a axial fracture.
A certain bone was struck by the blow, and it struck his face, and the incision did not penetrate to the very end of it: and this kind of fracture is called Kalaan, that is, an absolute luxation.
And there is a fracture of two bones, or a large one, or a small one.
And from a fracture there is a bruise, or an abrasion: and its cause is a blow with a stone, or a fall on a stone, or similar things.
And this fracture is also penetrating, which is beginning to approach a skin flap, which is under the bone: or it is on the face of a bone; and that kind of fracture of the two bones is also small, or large.
And from a fracture there is one that is hidden in the bone in a hair's breadth: and it is a small split, and for that reason this kind of fracture is called the Capillary fracture.
And from them there is one that is made by a fall, or the hitting of a stone, and similar things, which cause the layer of bone to enter inwardly, and it is done by a crushed piece: such as happens in the case of caldarius air, when such an occurrence takes place, and a part of them enters inwardly.
And many are made in the heads of the moist bones, such as are the heads of boys.
And all these kinds of fracture occur separately, and I will go back to remind myself of all this in its place.
And we know all these kinds of fractures by their appearance on them, and by questioning them with the touch, and by removing the corrupted flesh that is above them.
Indeed the Capillary species is recognized by this, that it is detected on the bone, and is cleaned off, and is kept over it with a caustic: for the fracture appears black.
In the cure of a fracture, consider first the nursing injuries: then if you see from these injuries what signifies an obvious sign on the fear, such as vomiting cholera, spread, loss of intelligence, absence of speech, syncope, acute fever, çıkış of the eyes, and their redness, and similar things to these injuries in many dispositions, it is certainly not a cure: and if you see non-terrifying injuries, and hope for salvation: then begin to treat them.
If he comes to you wounded first when wounded: and it is that in the days of the half, then you should study to seek out all the arrangement in the ablative of the bone before the fourteenth day second.
And if it is in the days of summer, then you should study to remove the bone before the seventh day, before what is under the bone from a patchwork, and the accidents that we have described.
That if the fracture of the bone has already reached the patchwork touching the brain, and is with a little, and the attraction: then you should study to strike down the broken part, and broken, according to what I tell you.
And is, as you shave the head of the wounded: and detect above the bone in any way possible for you: and according to the shape of the wound, and what is easier over the weak.
That if it happens to you during the detection of the flow of blood from the bone, or a warm poultice: then you should oppose it with what is necessary. And is, as you fill the place with liniments soaked in wine, and oil rosin: and make the wound quiet, until it subsides poultice, and are secure from the flow of blood. Then begin in the cure of the bone, and its removal.
And it is done according to two ways.
One way is, as you strike the bone with a sharp chisel: and this is the form of it.
Then administer another Incisorium after the first wider by a little: and this is the form of it.
Then also administer a third Incisorium wider than the second.
And the second way is, as there are by you a number of chisels different: some are wider to some, and some of them are shorter to some: and let them be in the end of their sharpness, and let them be of iron, or of fuel: and use convenience in their striking over the chisel, so that they do not wound the head, and hurt themselves.
If the jaw is strong and firm, then you should perform incisions around it before administering any incisions with knives called tera-brae that do not cut deeply: they are not named so unless they do not pass beyond the border of bone to that which is after it; for tera-brae is a rounded extremity above it, which has an acute tip, similar to its margin, and a small circle prevents it from submerging and penetrating the thickness of the bone.
And it is fitting that you should take from these tera-brae a great number, of which each corresponds to the quantity of thickness of bone, until you have all the cranial tera-brae present: whose acute quantity in length and breadth corresponds to the quantity of thickness of its bone.
And this is the form of the three types of tera-brae, or trepanations.
The quality of piercing around the fractured bone is this: that you place the tera-brae above the bone, and rotate it with your fingers until you know that the bone has been penetrated. Then replace the tera-brae in a different location and place what is between all the apertures of a thickness corresponding to the radius, or around it.
Then cut with the incisorim-tools what is between all the apertures from the bone, and make it thinner than you can by hand on top of it, as we have said, until you have cut through the bone, or with your own hand, or with any other tool that you have prepared for it: such as scalpel-blades, and fine tweezers.
And it is necessary that you should take every precaution so that the tera-brae or any of the incisorim-tools do not touch.
When you have thus gone around the bone with piercing, and separated it away from its socket, if it is still attached to it, and you extract it, then you should saw it off, and make equal its end that remains in the bone with another similar incisorim-tool. Indeed, it is necessary that he be less and more subtle with other incisions.
If anything remains of the small bones, and the fracture is stable: then take them easily with you, along with the instruments that are with you. Then care for the wound afterwards with liniments and ointments as we have said.
And another method of the operation is easy, far removed from fear: which Galen said, and praised it highly: and this is his saying. It is necessary that you first begin to grasp the bone on the side where the fracture is more severe and more evident: until when you have grasped it, and placed under it the far extreme of this lens-shaped incision, whose this is its form.
And the lens-shaped part, which does not cut anything: and the acute side of it on its two sides rubbing along the length, as you see: so that the lens-shaped part is placed at the chisel, with its acute edge facing the bone.
Then hit on the incision from one side with a small mallet, until you hit all the bone with ease, as it rotates: and you are safe from any panic, that there does not happen to it an accident, which you fear absolutely.
And if the medicant is not a fool among men, and more unaware of it, and is not asleep, then if anything remained attached to the bone in some places from the padding, he would hit himself with the extreme end of this lens-shaped incision, and free himself from it easily. For it is freed from him without harm, and without fear.
And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate all the way down to the padding, and that which is cut off from the bone is the face of it, and there remain in it roughness and subtleties: then you should smooth out this roughness, and remove those subtleties with very sharp razors from those which you have prepared a number of different quantities, so that you can administer them to him at all times more convenient for them, and more straight according to the one which leads you the operation, and the broken bone, and its form. It is necessary that you use your razor sharp blades, especially when cutting the root of the tooth. Then use a smaller blade after the initial cut.
It is necessary that you use your razor sharp blades, especially when cutting the root of the tooth. Then use a smaller blade after the initial cut. And do not stop doing that according to continuity, until you reach the point of administration which is thinner, and their all being more delicate.
In every one of the remaining crevices of the palate, and for the fine hair and fragile fractures, it is necessary to exercise care, according to that which leads to the correction of it.
And this is a thing that is not hidden over all, to which in this art there is any study, and stands on what we have written and shown in large fractures.
But if a patch is held to stop the bleeding when you cut the tooth: then it is necessary that you take linen cloth according to the amount of wound, and immerse it in rose oil, and place it over the hole of the wound. Then take another cloth doubled or tripled, and immerse it in wine and rose oil, and place it over the first cloth: and do as easily as you can over it, so that it does not stick to the syringe.
Then administer over it a broad bandage: and do not tighten it, unless by the amount that holds the bone only: and let it go with this cure for one or two days, until you are free from the hot application. Then dissolve it, and administer after it the medicines with which there is a superfluity of dryness: such as lilium roots, and herb flour, and thistle powder, and aristochnocoa, and similar things: and it is, that you make from these medicines a powder, which is powdered over the bone like those that are dry.
And administer universally in it all the medicine of its property which is to cleanse, and not to bite. And be careful according to your skill, that the bone in your cure is clear: and it is not in it the scent of oil, or any type of smell.
And be careful according to your skill, that the bone in your cure is clear: and it is not in it the scent of oil, or any type of smell. And do not leave the virus to aggregate therein at all; for when the virus aggregates over the cerebrum's pannicule, it corrupts it and it putsrefies itself, and a great malady happens after that: and it has already happened in the head's sinkhole, when it was cleansed away from it the mouth, especially when its care was neglected, and blackness appeared on its surface.
Consider therefore then, if accidents happen to the sick which we have said, you will know that it is certainly perilous.
And if blackness does not happen, unless it is medicine which is placed upon it, and it is in the power of that medicine to cause it blackness: then you should take from honey one part, from rose oil three parts, and with them a cloth. Then place the body on the sinkhole; then care for the body with the species of cure which are suitable, until it heals.
Of restoring a nose when it is broken.
You should know that the nose is not broken unless both of its upper parts break at once, or one of them; for there are two bones in it: for the lower part of it is cartilaginous, and does not break, and does not happen to it except by friction, and twists, and roughness.
If one of its two parts breaks, then you should put your little finger in the nose's hole, and equalize the break with your own index finger and thumb, until it returns to its natural shape: and let it be done with art, easily. And because, so that the accident does not happen to him on account of your operation.
That if the fracture is in the upper part of the nose and does not reach that finger: then you should equalize its end with the curve in which there is a small thickness.
But if the fracture is in both parts of it, then you should make it like that: and proceed with its restoration on the day when it was broken, if it is possible. And if not, then after the seventh, or tenth day near the calm post-hemorrhage heat.
Then introduce into the nose the licorice thread from a linen cloth if it is broken in one part: or introduce two licorice threads if it is broken in two parts: and let it sit in the licorice thickness of such a quantity that it fill the nostril hole.
And said certain ancient restorers, as if they were to pour licorice into butter and exchange it every day. That, indeed, does not seem right to me; let it rather be poured into the albumin with the powder of a mortar. Then remove the licorice, until the nose is firm, and the cartilage is hardened.
And sometimes, when the licorice feather is introduced into the nose place of an Goose, after it has been wetted with a soft cloth: and it works so that it holds the nose fracture more securely, and does not prevent the sick from breathing.
But this is not necessary. If you want to, do that: and if you want, make licorice.
That, if it should happen to the nose while you are working, to patch up the post-hemorrhage heat with a green plaster, or with a cotón immersed in rose water, or with a little of dandelion.
But if the post-hemorrhage heat does not occur, then it should be, that the plasters themselves are made with a sisami flour, and the thur's powder mixed with albumen is dried. Then put on top of it a thin layer of linen cloth, and do not bind the nose at all.
But if the nose bones are broken or crushed, then it is necessary to cut them above, and to extract what remains with the tools that are suitable for them. Then take care of the incision, and look after the nose when it is healed, and consolidated with the plasters suitable for it, or with an ointment.
If a fracture occurs in the nose, then it is necessary to treat it with a sling and administer a plumb line, until healing occurs.
On restoring the lower jaw when it is broken.
When the lower jaw is broken and the fracture is not with the ulna: examine then if the fracture is only to the outside, and does not break into two pieces, and treat it from the inside: then the diagnosis will be easy.
Therefore, if the fracture is on the right side of the jaw, then you should insert your left finger into the bone to support it: likewise, if the fracture is on the left side of the jaw, then insert your right finger: and push it in with ease from the outside towards the center with your other hand from the inside of the bone, and adjust it so that it is even.
If the jaw fracture has already separated into two pieces, then you should administer external pressure from both sides, according to its straightness: until it is possible to adjust it.
If, however, an accident has already occurred with the teeth, or a dislocation or fracture: then tighten them with a gold wire, or silver, or silk thread. Then put on top of the broken jaw ointment. Then place over the jaw a double cloth, and place over it a large piece of leather cut to size: or a fragment of skin from the sole of the foot, equal in length to the jaw.
Then bind the jaw from above, according to how you have prepared the ligature, and let the application remain in place until it is not destroyed: and instruct the sick person to use a soft diet.
If, however, you think that something has already changed in some way or another: then see to it, and loosen the binding on the third day. Then straighten out what has been altered from it, and cover the jaw with a powder of grinding, mixed with chalk or flour, after you have removed the ointment: and place over the covering a piece of fine wool.
While that plaster remains attached to the wound, and the bone arrangement does not change, remove it, do not tear it off, until it heals: or tighten the fracture. This fracture is often tightened in seven days.
If, however, a warm sweat occurs during this time, then administer to it what we have said often in sedating it, until it removed that sweat.
And if the fracture is with the ulna, consider. I have already separated the little fragment from the bone, or from the saw; then be careful in this that you remove those fragments of saw with it when it suits you to remove them from the instruments.
But if the wound opening is tight, then enlarge it with the phlebotome in the quantity required by your need.
Then, when you have removed those saws, and there remains none of them, then plug that wound opening if it is wide; and if not, put on the wound those plasters that fit to it, and let it heal up.
The Restoration of the Fork, when it breaks.
Many forks indeed break from the front part of the shoulder, and its fracture is made in one of three ways.
Or it breaks and separates into two, besides that they come off in sawing: and it is easier to restore it.
Or, on the other hand, if they come off in the bone: and it is more difficult to restore it.
Or, on the other hand, that fracture is with the ulna.
And the operation in it when that fracture is without an ulna, is, so that you have these two ministers, one to hold the aid which follows the broken Fork, and another to extend the neck towards its side.
Then make the fracture of your fingers equal, until it has that shape which is necessary: and do not let it be突出 or sharp.
If you can tolerate a larger extension, then you should place under the tingling ball of cloth or wool: and make its size according to your need: and extend, and relieve the fork, and wrap the ball in your hand, until the fracture is equal, as required.
If you cannot bring the extremities of the fork to the outside because it reaches the depth: then it is necessary that the sick one lie on his back: and you should place under his shoulder the mid part of the pulp in its size, and press the minister of the shoulder to the lower part, until he raises the bone of the fork which is in the depth to the top: and then, correct the fracture, and make it equal with your fingers.
If you feel a sharp pain from the fork, and it moves: then you should find on it, and pull out the cause of the pain with ease.
If it is held in the bone, then use the incision tool which you have prepared for it, after you have placed under the fork the holding device which holds it safely: and this tool is made of wood or iron. And this is its shape.
It is shaped like an ear which has not been closed in.
And its width should be according to the one you can tolerate it from the size of the bone, and its evenness. Its length, however, is also according to what is possible for you in the operation.
And it has two extremities, as you see: and one extremity is wide, and the other is narrow.
If, however, the break in the bone which you made when you pulled out the cause of the pain is wide, and secures itself with the warm apposition: then add two lips of the wound with a suture.
And if the break is small, or you do not have warm apposition: then fill the wound with cloth, and powder according to the size of the cut wound.
If an apostema becomes hot, then pour oil, rosewater, vinegar, and wine over it and place it on top.
Rather, when the stricture is in a bone without an injury and without cutting, you should place on it a patch made from flour that has been ground with alum. And place a beam of wood on top of it. Then place a ball under its tip, if you can tolerate that. Then take a large spinning top that the Saracens use, which is long and wide: its diameter should be that of a hand or more. Then place a double layer of felt over the beam and the patch. Then take an asterism from a thin board, whose width is that of three fingers, and its length similar. Then wrap it in a cloth. Then wrap the cloth and the asterism together at the place of injury and its location. Then place the alquimista over the fracture as if it were a bandage, and wrap it around its neck, and under its tip, healthy and under the injured tip: and let it be so that it does not cover you completely, and entirely, so that it does not move the asterism off the bone's fracture. And for this, you should see the injured person every day. Whenever you see that the ligament has softened, and you see that the asterism has moved again: then straighten it out, and tighten the ligament.
Then place a soft cushion on its back, and under its tip near its pillow at night, so that when it moves it will not feel the asterism's edge. Thus the fracture in the forearm is healed by elevation of the shoulder.
Or bandage its arm to its neck: and do not loosen the ligaments unless there is an accident from itching, or from an apostema, until twelve days have passed.
Then remove the plaster, if you see his face towards that. And add to the tightness, and let him go, until it is restored and coagulated.
And indeed the fracture is bound and supported according to many in twenty days; and sometimes it happens in some people with less than that.
De restoration of the fracture of the spatula.
Rarely does the Spatula break, and in its width place: and do not break from it except for its edge.
So when it breaks from that place, and it breaks in the middle of it, and it is not known that except for touch: then according to what is the shape of the fracture prepare the preparation of it. And reduce it to the natural form at all the skill that is possible to you.
Then place on the spot powder with chalk and a wooden board, and put a cloth on top of it. Then place over it a broad plate from a thin board according to the quantity of the spatula whole, or larger than that little bit.
If indeed under the plate is crushed in some place of the spatula, then make it equally crushed with a soft board, until the plate descends according to equality.
Then wipe off from above with a long-lasting alchemist's glue, with a tightening that approaches, and the rigidity of the plate, until it does not move away from its place.
And consider the ligament every day. Whenever indeed the ligament softens, tighten it and make the plate equal if it moves away from its place: and let him lie on his sound side.
Indeed the spatula is restored in twenty days, or in twenty-five days.
So when this number is completed, then solve the ligament: and you are in safety. For indeed it is from the bones whose communion is not feared, nor their solution.
If, however, it proceeds from the bone stump and pierces beneath the skin: then cut over it and remove it. And do as we said in the fracture of the furrow from sitting down with hot, if something happens from that.
On the restoration of a fracture of the chest
The chest sometimes breaks in the middle of it, and that seldom happens. The extremities of it are often broken, and they are broken by its accidents.
When it is broken in the middle, which inclines to the lower parts, and there happens to it a very painful pain, and difficulty in breathing, and perhaps spitting out blood, and the fracture is declared in the broken bone, and does not hide the sense, The restoration of it is that it should lie down on its back: and put between its Spatula.
Then press its shoulders and join the ribs from two parts or sides with the hands: and gently adjust it to the right shape, in any way possible, as it should be, unless you bring back the figure of the bones, according to what is necessary.
Then put over it plaster and a support, and put above it an astylar from a thin board of willow, or larch, and similar ones in levity, after you have wrapped it up in a cloth. Then gently adjust it by binding it over the broken bone so that it does not move: and move it with the binding according to the roundness to the back a few times, and tighten it by stricture while it is falling.
Then consider the binding at every hour, and whenever it softens, tighten it: and if necessity calls for its solution when a pruritus, or corrosion which happens in that place, or pain, or fever: then approach it, and solve it, and cut away the plaster, and correct whatever has happened with the manner of its cure.
Then reduce the plaster, if you see to that face: and attach it by stricture, until it is healed.
When costars are broken.
You should know that a fracture of the ribs does not occur unless in the places which follow the back, and from the extremities thereof toward the front. And it does not happen to them any weariness, except therefore, because they are cartilaginous. And his knowledge is not hidden from the sense of touch during inquiry with the fingers.
And the restoration thereof is so made that a broken rib with the fingers in the second way possible, until it has regained its shape, according to which it should be. Because it is necessary. Then he makes an embossing, and tightly joins the broken bone with a splint, if it requires it.
And if the fracture of the ribs is inclined toward the inside: then it happens to the sick a bitter pain, and a pricking, such as that which happened to him who had pleurisy: for the bone pinches the wound, and also happens to him difficulty in breathing, and coughing, and much blood. And this is a difficult cure.
And the ancient have invented for this with many devices; and of them are those who say that you should put in food which generates inflammation and ventilation, that it may inflame the belly, and be extended, and push the fracture toward the outside.
But we abhor, so that it is not a cause of quick making an ointment of heat, if it does not happen. If, however, it has already happened, then he adds it in.
And some of them said: Let it be placed on a windy place, and then blow upon it with force, and it is similar to reasoning. However, they are afraid that the wind will draw away the secretions toward the place of weakness because of its debilitation.
And some of them said: It should be that the place is covered with wool which has already been submerged in hot oil; and let there be placed feathers between the ribs, until it is filled up; so that it is a ligature of equality when it is rolled thus according to its roundness.
The sick person should be nursed with food and medicine until he recovers from the pleurisy.
If the sick person is obstructed by a disease, which he does not tolerate, and his mouth pricks with pain while he is hurt by the wound, and we are afraid of him: then it is necessary that we should split over the place, and discover from the broken rib. Then let us put on it a tool that keeps the air away, whose memory precedes: and let us pierce the mouth with ease, and let us pierce it itself.
Then let us gather together the two lips of the wound, if it is large with a stitch: and let us cure him with plasters, until he heals.
If, however, during that time there occurs a swelling of warm pus, then let it come close, and pour into it a bit of rosewater oil, and put it over the place: and let the sick person be nursed with it as is right for the swelling.
At that time also let him lie on his back on the side where he sleeps, until he recovers.
The restoration of a broken spine of the dorsal and cervical spine.
Of the bones of the neck, when a fracture happens, and this rarely occurs, and also to the spine. When that happens to someone, and you do not know if he is healing or not healing: then trust. For if you see his hands already softened, and stuporified, and lifeless: and can not be moved, nor extended, nor constrained: and when you constrain them with your fingers, and prick them with an aiguille, he does not feel it, and does not feel pain in them: then you shall know that he is not healing, and is mortal in many dispositions.
If he moves them, and feels the constriction with your fingers and the prick: then you shall know that the bones of his neck are healed, and that the sick person will recover with treatment.
If there occurs in him a similar thing to that of the spine, and you do not know if he is healing or not: then look at his feet: if you see them already softened, and what happened to the hands also happens to them: then when he lies on his back, he walks with a wavering step and without will: and when he turns on his stomach, he walks without will: and when he turns on his back again, and wants to drink, and cannot: then you shall know that it is mortal. Therefore do not undertake his cure.
If something does not happen to him from that, the matter is lighter.
And his cure, if it happens from that, is as follows: to apply oil of rosin, well rubbed, on a sponge: or when you have washed it with lukewarm water.
Place on it from time to time in the day until it is well-healed: then place on the spot a compress that comforts, dries out, and binds tightly with the bandage: and order the sick person to rest quietly and calmly. And do not let him sleep on the part where he has pain, until it heals.
If something happens to the bone that separates (the flesh), or if it is already separated from it: then you must cut off the skin and remove it. Then bind together two lips of the wound, if it is large, with a suture. Then take care of the person with some ointment, until he heals.
If the bone is finally broken at its end and the tail is cut off: then you must insert your thumb of the left hand into the wound, and with the right hand, as well as possible, and by equal rotations.
Then place on it and remove it: and take care of the wound with the cure that has preceded, until it heals.
For restoration of the ankle.
Chapter XI.
Rarely do the bones break at the ankle. If they break, then their fracture is not, unless it is broken at the ends of the bones: and they are broken in length, and turn towards the inside: and it happens to the sick person that there is pain in the spot, and a bruise: and the leg turns when it breaks.
And the restoration of it is as follows: to extend your hand over it, until you stand on the fracture, which is as in the figure of it.
If the fracture is only in its extremities, then make it equal, as you prepare it from equality, until its figure is similar to its natural one.
But if the fracture is in length, or has already turned towards the insides: then make him lie down on his stomach, until it is prepared for you to restore its fracture. When you have made it equal, then put a plaster on it; and afterwards put a wooden support or skin over it: and tightly tie the bandage so that you do not fear a change in the fracture, nor a removal of the support.
And the equal concavity with it, so that it fills it, until he takes it by the bandage according to equality: and order the sick person to sleep on his back, or on his healthy side.
But if it happens to him that there is a hot swelling: then cease from extending it, and from its restoration, until it cools down: and put over it what sits on it according to what has preceded, and then return to its restoration: and tightly tie it as it should be.
But if it happens that it is broken or crushed, remove it.
The assistant to the restoration of a fracture.
The assistant is that which is between the chest and the head of the spatula.
If it is broken, then its restoration is according to two ways.
One of which is: that you take a flat piece of wood of middle thickness, according to this shape, which follows.
And bind together with two strappings in the two extremities.
Then hang it from a high place: and let the sick person sit on a chair. Then he will throw his broken arm over the wood, until it reaches to its little joint, in which middle there is attached a piece of wood.
Then hang him from above with something heavy, that he may stretch himself out for the minister below. Then let the doctor treat his own fracture with care until it heals, as is necessary.
And another method is for the sick person to lie on their back on a mattress: and their hand suspended from their neck with a bandage. Then order two servants to hold his hand above the fracture: and one to hold him below, and to stretch out each of them on either side.
And if you will, so that the extension is stronger, then tie up under the fracture with a bandage and above it with another bandage: and let each of the two servants stretch out their hand to either side.
If then the fracture is close to the edge of the shoulder, then it should be placed, one bandage under the collar-bone and another above the fracture towards the hip.
And likewise if the fracture is close to the hip: then it should be placed, one bandage on that spot and another above the hip.
Then let the fracture heal easily without work, until it is healed in the way that is necessary, and applied with good application: then tie it up, if there is no swelling.
But if there is swelling, then do not tie it up until the seventh day. And put on the wound wool wetted with vinegar and olive oil, until when it quiets down the swelling; then tie it up: and the way of tying it up is, to put a plaster over the fracture.
Then place a new cloth bandage over the plaster. Then he should hold his arm up with the help of an assistant and place his open hand on his shoulder.
And place a cloth and tie it above the assistant's arm so that the arm remains in place: if he does not forbid you from doing this or anything else, nor should you move around on him.
That if you find yourself moving around due to the pain of a broken bone, then use crutches: and it is, that you place upon the fracture the larger and stronger crutch than the others. Place the splint between all the fingers of the length: and let its length be according to the fracture with the addition of three digits from every part.
Then tighten over the splints the strain that I said at first chapter.
And it is so that your strain is stiffer on the site of the fracture than this strain that I have spoken of above. And to the extent that the fracture becomes more elongated, let the strain be smaller.
But if you see the splints and the strain, as we have said, at the hour when you restore the limb immediately, then do so: but if you wait for the poultice to cool down, then let go of the strain and the splints until the seventh day, as we have said.
Then consider the ligament for all three days so that the itching does not occur in place or swelling is increased, or stops food from reaching the limb due to the tension of the strain. So then correct this whole thing, according to what we have said.
But if you are not sure of it, so that nothing occurs from it: then do not loosen the ligament until after three days or more.
And let her sleep on her back, and his hands on his belly: and place under the pillow a blanket full of wool that is equal.
And consider every hour of night or day so that the figure of the broken limb does not loosen, nor do the ligaments soften. So then correct this whole thing with your virtue.
And place food for the nurse according to the order that we have set forth, so that there is a light meal at first, until the mouth begins to heal: then it should increase his food.
For the habit of the assistant and the limb is that it is strained for forty days: then so let it be loosened, and given a bath, and treated with ointments that correct it.
That if the fracture were rotten, ground: then do not loosen from it the ligaments and splints until fifty days, and until two months.
On the restoration of fractures of the brachial bone.
The arm is composed of two bones called the two humeri.
Of which one is small and that is what follows the thumb. And the other is large, and that is what is positioned below the little finger on its lower side.
Perhaps therefore does the larger bone break alone, or the smaller one; and perhaps both break at once.
When then does the small bone break above, then is its restoration easy, and its healing easier.
And when does the lower bone break? It is a bad fracture, and its healing is difficult.
And worse is it when both bones break at once.
If then the bone that breaks is the small one above, then it behooves the doctor to restore it with ease, to put the little finger in extension, until it is equal with the other.
But if the broken bone is the larger one: then it behooves, in order to put on a stronger bandage with force, until it is equal with the other.
And it behooves, in order to give the hand its shape and position at the restoration of its bone, and to put on a bandage that extends beyond the little finger. And let the thumb of the hand be made higher on its upper side than all the other fingers; and let the flexor muscle of each finger be made lower, or not present; and let the sitting position be square on one's self, and let the little finger face it, or stand in front of it at right angles, so that it does not incur trouble.
Then let the arm be extended from its lower side, or by its hand, or with a bandage. And another one let extend from above.
Then the doctor let adjust the bone until he makes it equal in shape as well as he can.
If in the fracture of the bone are present splinters, then let you seek to reduce every splinter to its place by your own power.
If it does indeed appear to you that there is a separate satheiatum, and you stab the skin, and there is no hope of restoring it: then find above it, and remove it according to the manner which we have said in those preceding.
But if the fracture is with the ulna, I have already done to that chapter a single treatment, so take care of it from there.
That if it should happen in the beginning of your restoration to be a hot swelling, then put on cloth made hot with oil made red with saffron, and white of egg, and place between thickness and thinness: and tighten the cloth on it tightly until it is settled: then remove the eggshells, and put on a prepared plaster from dust that has been ground with albumen. Then put on plasters, and let the plaster which is put on the fracture be wider a little, and stronger.
And you know that the number of plasters for the arm is six in several dispositions: whether it is a fracture in one finger, or in two fingers at the same time.
Then put on your plaster on the site of the fracture stronger and more tight, and a little more with the plaster according to what has preceded in the beginning of the chapter: or put on a softer plaster on it slightly according to what has preceded.
And let there be cloths that are wrapped around the fracture, soft cloths, wet: and not be hard, rough. And let there be a thread that is tightened with its own linen, between thinness and thickness, as we have said.
And consider the limb and ligaments after days. That if anything should happen for which correction is necessary, such as itching that happens in a limb: then it should be, to soak the limb with warm water, until that itching quiets down, and you remove the limb not constrained, until it quiets down, and then repeat the plaster.
That if the plaster is already softened, and the bone has been removed, and similar to these: then correct it completely with your virtue, and consider again.
If nutriment is prohibited from reaching the limb because of the swelling of the scar tissue, then it should be left for a little while and then tied up.
If this doesn't happen to the sick person of what we have said, then it shouldn't be allowed to heal without any problem unless after twenty days or so.
Then the patient's hand should be suspended from his neck. And the neck should be kept level and protected from violent movements. And let him sleep on his back.
And you should know that this fracture is restored in thirty days or in twenty-two days; and perhaps it is restored in twenty-five days. All of this depends on the condition of the skin and the strength of the body.
[On the restoration of broken hands.]
You should know that it is rare for a fracture to occur in the palm of the hand or in the knuckles of the fingers. And this doesn't happen to him unless there is a lot of friction.
When, therefore, a fracture occurs in the palm or through friction: then it should be made to sit on a level seat; and a seat should be set up before him for equanimity. Then place his hand on top of it.
Then he should make the bones that are broken straight and equal them with a surgeon's skill; until such time as they are joined together by good jointing.
Then it should be put on plaster and a splint if this doesn't happen to cause a warm swelling. Then place the splint from above by the quantity of space; and you have already covered it with linen cloth.
But if the fracture is around the lower part of the palm near the root of the fingers, then make a sphere-like shape out of cloth; and instruct the sick person to hold it with his own palm that is broken: and then tie it down with a long piece of cloth.
And let it remain as a splint from the kino, in which sits the soft part, so that the kino may be applied to the plant body: and bind it, according to what is necessary.
But if the fracture is on the outside, then it is right: so that you set the splint from above, and another splint from below in the plant: and let the hand be open and straight. Then put the splint on, as the hand is extended: and place it between the fingers with a ligament.
That if a fracture should happen to any of the finger joints, then if it is the thumb, it is equal according to what is necessary. Then tie it with the plant: and if there is pain, then put a straight splint on it, so that it may not move: so that the fracture may be kept still, and not move.
But if the fracture is in any other of the fingers, like the middle, or the index, or the auricular, and the annular, then it is equal, and tie with a finger that follows it: or tie them all according to their extension, and it is better. Or put a straight splint on top of it, like we said for the thumb.
And consider in your restoration, and after that position of the bones: and oppose it with what is necessary, when anything happens to it, according to what it tells us.
On the Restoration of a Hip Fracture
The hip bone often breaks, and is felt: because it turns to the inner and rear parts.
And the restoration of it is so that a ligament is tied above the fracture, and another ligament is tied below the fracture. And the injured person stretches out on their face.
Then he extends all the ligaments to his side for equality: and this, when there is a fracture in the middle of the bone.
But if the fracture is near the root of the hip, then let there be a ligament to the side of the pelvis, so that it falls towards the top: and another ligament below the fracture.
And so likewise if there is a fracture near the knee, then sit close to the knee ligament, so that it sits towards the lower part.
Then the doctor shall make both of his hands equal to the bone, until he reduces it according to the natural shape: and shall join the bone with a good joint.
Then it should be put on plaster and stricture if it does not happen to a member of apostema. If it happens in him an apostema: then let it be left for a few days, until the apostema is warm, and then return to your cure.
But the stricture of it should be so. It is necessary that you roll over the fracture a hard bone, i.e., a bindum: and double it twice, or three times: and remain of it an excess. Then roll up the leg, until it comes to the heel of the borned.
And introduce a long thread between the coxae and the leg near the knee towards the lower side, and bring the ends of the thread from the upper part of both members. Then roll up on the leg and coxae what is in excess out of the bindum.
Then put over the coxae in the place of the fracture the stars of it, and put from them one star on the bone of the leg.
Then fill with wetting substances between the leg and the coxae with soft cloths, so that the stricture is equal.
Then begin with the stricture strong from the middle in three rollings, or four rollings, on the place of the fracture. And as much as you lengthen with the ligament at the place of the fracture, your stricture is smaller and softer, and gentler.
Then bring to both ends of the thread that you inserted between the coxae and the leg. Bind then with the two stars that are above. Then move with the two ends of the thread towards the lower side, until you come to the heel of the foot. And bind also the ends of the stars from the other side: so that the ligament does not move from its place.
Then let go of that which is tight on it while it remains in place so that corrosion does not occur to the member, nor apostema, nor swelling, and things like them. So if something happens from it. Then with the solution applied to it, and make straight that which has happened there entirely, according to what we have said many times.
But if a piece of bone pricks the bone: then it is necessary, so that the wound heals, if you can do it. And if not, find on it, and move it: and be careful with it whose memory is before it, until it heals.
And sometimes this fracture of the hips is bound together with staples, as we have said in the arm and leg.
However, in restoring it that way which is broken, there does not happen a lame limp. And if it is restored alone, besides that an other leg is applied to it, then it is necessary, so that he who has it always limps.
And you should know that the hip is bound up in fifty days, or a little added, or a little minited: all of it is according to the diversity of complexions, and the other dispositions.
Regarding the restoration of the fracture of the knee-cap of the thigh.
You should know that the fracture of the knee-cap of the thigh rarely happens, but it does happen to it often by wearing away.
But if something has happened to it that is a fracture, then there must be either a crack or a hole in its parts. And it is with the ulna, and without the ulna. And he stood on it all with feeling.
And the restoration of it is such that it equals what has been broken out of its parts with the fingers, until it collects, and joins together according to what is possible from equity and ease, and making.
Then put on the plaster from flour and sieves mixed with albumin; and put on top of it a round cloth, if you like it: and tighten it gently above that.
Then consider all the dispositions which we have described in the other fractures: such as the heat apostema and others like that: so that you oppose every mishap with what is fitting to him, until he heals.
For the restoration of a fractured limb.
You should know that there are two bones in the leg, one is thick and is called the femur bone; and the other is thin, and is called the fibula.
And it happens to both of the kinds of fracture that occurs in the two bones of the arm; and for this reason the restoration of the latter is made as the restoration of the other is equal, and the operation is one.
If both bones are broken at the same time, the limb turns towards all sides.
And if only one of the thin bones is broken, the limb turns towards the front.
And if only the thick bone is broken, it bends downward; and it is one of these that does not show you.
Then administer the extension, and equalization, and tying of the ligaments according to the equal one.
However, if the fracture of the limb is a bad fracture, having many wounds: let it be that the extension is less, and gentler alleviation for you.
And in the limb there is in the operation something upon the arm: and it is, as when you make the ligaments equal, and complete all your operation, then take two membranes from pine wood, which is made in the making of splints which are placed under tables; and they are made from palm leaves: and choose among them those that have a small thickness, and none of them are small: and let their length be according to the length of the leg from the knee down.
Then wrap up with two pieces of cloth, each on one side, according to its length. Place one side of the leg from one side to the other, and the other from one side to the other: and let them go down from the knee to the bottom of the foot.
Then bind the two Fascia in three places from the two ends and the middle. For when the constriction is forbidden, the leg leans to the right and the left, and stands in good position.
And now let the wooden splint be made according to the length of the leg, and let it be placed in it so that it keeps it from moving.
And it is necessary above all, so that you do this when the fracture has been healed by itself.
Then consider the leg every day, and take care with it with the last effort from inflammation or any other thing. But if something of that happens, then oppose it with him when something needs to be done, until it is healed, if God wants it so.
Of the fracture of the bones of the foot and fingers.
The heel has not occurred a fracture inside.
But of the bones of the foot has occurred when a fracture, and of the fingers a little also has occurred, and it has not occurred to them except for rubbing in many cases.
Which if a fracture has occurred in the bones of the foot, and you see those bones moving far from each other, then let the sick put his foot on the ground prepared, like a walker.
Then stand you, and put your foot on that which raises from those bones: then press it, or trample it: and make it equal, until it returns to its place.
Then put a plaster on him from above: and put a piece of wood under the foot from below: and put beneath the navel a plate with two flat heads.
Then tighten it with the leg when it is going down strictly, after you have wrapped it with rags, and with the others with which it needs to be tightened.
But if they pass three or four days, then loosen the ligaments. If the bones are broken or dislocated, reduce them carefully. Operation therefore is, as you see.
But if some of the fingers are broken, then restore them and make the bones equal as I told you in restoring finger hands. Then place your hand with a pin according to the length of the finger and make it a little wider; then put under the foot this plate that I told you, and tighten it by a firm holding.
But if what is broken is more than two or three bones, then put over each finger an astilet of its own quantity, wrapped in a cloth: and tighten the plate on the foot's bottom: and stand on one side of the plate outside the foot's navel so that it holds fast by good holding.
And it is convenient for you, that you not forget, but consider all that I told you of the other broken bones by the accidents which we mentioned: and oppose to every accident with what is necessary.
Regarding the fracture of a woman's vulva, and of the ribs, and of a man's testicles.
When the vulva of a woman is broken, then make her sit square. Then tilt her slightly toward the back of her own, and hold her back.
Then fill the woman' vulva with cotton, until she is filled up: and let it be in the vulva from that like a ball.
Then shake the woman, and rub her back slowly. For that cotton will go out, until it is before the woman' vulva like a ball, and the broken mouth comes back.
Then put on her back a little downy thing. But when she wants to urinate, let the cotton move with ease, then let her urinate: and reduce it according to the way that you put it first: and then bring back to her own downy thing first.
Let him wait seven days, or at most a week; for the bone itself is healed.
And if you wish, take a wisp of hay and tightly plug the hole with an arrow-head, and insert the whole wisp into his cavity. Then blow into the tube with force, until the hay is bent inside, for it is because of the fracture that it bends.
Then fill it with poultice, and let it stand a few days, as we have said, until it is healed.
And when the hip bone of a man or woman breaks, then administer to it the restoration that we have spoken of for the hipbone of Anchae.
And do not hide from those who are nearby, who are few in number, especially from one who is studious or has some use.
And understand my book well, for the fracture itself signifies to you many things concerning the straightness of your own will in the restoration of its health, and the tightness of it. Understand therefore.
But when the hip bone breaks, take a goose's throat; and insert the hipbone into it. Then place over it a patchwork of cloth, and let it be bandaged up, and let it stand for three days or about that time, and if God wills, it will heal.
Of the restoration of broken bones, when it is with an arrow.
It is fitting for him who has suffered a fracture with an arrow, especially if it is a large one, such as the hipbone or the bones of the limbs, or something similar to that, as you think proper, and do not delay: if you are aware of the signs of bleeding, as we have said.
Now if the arrow bleeds blood, then you should, as you think proper, cut off its ends so that it may become powdery on top of the bone: if there is not another present for you.
Then begin to restore the fracture on that very day; and do not postpone it, unless an aphemia occurs.
If, however, an aphemia becomes hot, then cease the restoration until the ninth day, until the aphemia cools down. And do not approach it on the third day and especially on the fourth; for you would make bad accidents happen to it.
If, however, the broken jaw protrudes above the detected wound; then you should seek to reduce it with ease and a small extension.
If, however, the extension of it and its alignment with your hands have not been prepared; then reduce it with this instrument. It is an instrument made of iron, whose length is the quantity of seven fingers or eight; and its width is according to the amount of the wound. And for this it is necessary that the doctor take from them three or four according to the amount needed for his cure in any type of fracture.
And let it be round; and let there be little thickness so that it does not break under the pressure on the top during the operation: and let its sharp ends have a rim at their ends. And let its upper part be of little thickness, from the middle to its lower end.
This is its shape.
In this operation, the sharp end of it should be placed on the top of the prominent bone; and push it with a certain force all at once, until when the jaw moves and aligns in some way.
So consider how you align the ends of the fracture opposite each other.
If its ends are slender, and the instrument does not accept them well; then you should seek to hit one of its ends with a blow, until the instrument can obtain a grasp on it.
If you cannot reduce them with the one we have described at all, then hit it with something sharp that is convenient for you; or cut it with a saw in any way possible for you.
Then remove what remains in the bone from hardness and small bark.
When therefore the bone is reduced, and remains after the reduction a painful and annoying pain, then know that the bone has not returned to its natural place.
Do therefore that which follows. For you have a great impediment to the injured part when your restoration, which you make, is completed with the bone.
Then dip the cloth in black strychnine wine. And especially if it is in summer. And do not place on the bone of the skull, or anything where there is oil: lest it cause corruption and decay in itself.
Then administer the medicine at the hour of your restoration of the bone. And dismiss the detected bone: so that you may fall with the hooks into the second hole according to the quantity of the wound.
And with all caution, do not tie the bone when it is fractured. For many have done this foolish thing of the physicians: and they have caused to happen on their injured persons or death, or corruption, or rot, that is, illness. And be your tightness soft, gentle, diverse from the tightness of the fractures of the other remains.
That if the bone is ill, or is a great bone, and you have some bad accident which we have described, and hanging pain in the place: then it is not necessary that you should place on it stars. And make them solutions out of tough cloths in the place of the stars, and tie it with them.
When however is after one day, or two days, and you see the bone begin to generate pus, then remove from above it the cloth which you placed on it with wine. Then administer leeching, and ointments with which we usually heal wounds, such as the tetrapharmacon ointment, and similar to it.
It is right for you to release the ligaments. And consider the wound every day morning and evening until it heals, and it will heal.
And it is necessary that the limb be prepared so that the pus comes out from below with ease.
If many days pass without the wound healing and it does not close and the pus does not come out: then you should know that there are small bony knots. Why should you ask about the wound with doubt? How many of those small knots are separated, remove them, and pull them out. And which of those small knots are not separated, and poke the limb, and cause pain, try to hit them, and remove them in any way possible for you.
If the wound swells or becomes red, that is to say, there is a feeling of heat, or another type of corruption and putrefaction: then you should oppose each one with what comes to it from healing, which was mentioned before in its chapter.
And from that in which it is necessary for my speech to stand, and which you should bring to mind when a bone breaks, and comes out above the limb, such as the hip bone, and assistants, and similar bones of the large limbs, that is not to say that you expect attraction from them, because many times death occurs from them, but leave them until they rot.
Perhaps they will fall down by themselves after twenty or thirty days.
Then therefore take care of the wound if it is yours: and otherwise, leave it.
On the healing of a break in the bone.
Many times this surgery has occurred in the wound of healing a break. Especially, what is near joints: and it is fed from that part of the limb. And perhaps prohibits the limb from its natural action.
Consider therefore then, if the fall is recent: administer to her medicines which have a constricting effect, such as aloe, and olive oil, and myrrh, and sarcocollus, and acacia, and similar ones.
Thus, so that you receive from these certain ones, or all of them: and bind them with a stringy medicine, or with egg white, or with vinegar: and place them on the swelling on the stump, and tie them tightly over the good constriction.
And release the constriction, do not separate it after many days. Then remove it, and repeat another one until the swelling goes away.
Or tie a lead strip at an angle over the spot. Because lead is a property that removes whatever scares the body part.
But if the swelling has already turned to stone, and is tight, and urgent necessity calls for its removal: then find on top of it a small piece, and cut off the protuberance: or saw it with a few blades, until it comes off: and take care of it, until it heals.
As for the cure: when it is restored, and the limb remains after it, not in its natural shape.
When the fracture of the bone is restored, and the limb remains after it, feeble: then it is not done for no reason at all. One of these is a multitude of solutions of ligments and of their ties not following what is required: or because of the excess of constriction of the ligaments, until it is prevented from the supply of blood running to the limb: or because of the multiplicity of ointments applied at an inappropriate time: or because of the scarcity of blood in the body, and its weakness.
And its cure is, to feed the sick, and to make the body strong, until there is an increase of blood in it. And administer a bath. And bring joy and happiness upon him.
Then put the knife on the member: so that the knife attracts much food to itself. And he will intensify his emulsion with warm water until the nutrition has passed, and return to his own natural shape.
Curing broken bones when they are being healed with twists.
When it happens that a member has been restored after its healing of curvature, or prominence of bone, or misshape: and the nourishment is given through that shape of the member, however natural the member's action may be: then you should not prevent him from giving his speech, which he imagines, to break the member again.
And there were many stiff-necked doctors and healers who made that known on our land.
And this operation is most wonderful, leading to death or great fear, as if it were deadly.
But if the claudication and misshapen-ness are recent: then it should be emollient with warm water, in which have been boiled softening herbs, such as leaves of willow, and root of mistletoe, and mallow, and similar. And let him make an emulsion with a softening poultice, like a poultice made from the roots of dandelion properly prepared.
Or let him be cooked with the mucus of the root of willow, and mixed with chicken fat, or oil from sesamum: and let him be poulticed with it.
Or let them be cooked with fig leaves, and pressed with columba flour, and similar things that are called by medical names to decrease consolidation.
And when the misshapen-ness has been released with frequent, ancient, and gentle friction, which is done with wet hands. And let the member's motion be given to all parts in every hour.
But if the curvature has already preceded, and it is a strong one, made to be hard, and provoked to require cure with iron: then let the upper part of it be cut off, and the continuity of the bone be healed, and let whatever excess there is from the misshapen-ness be removed with very fine incisions: and let ease be given to it with care and attention.
On the Dislocation.
A dislocation is the departure of a joint from its normal position. Why does it interfere with its natural motion, and 왜 이는 멤버의 모양을 변경합니까? and causes pain and severe injuries.
When a dislocation occurs, then one should hurry to restore it: nor should one delay at all.
For if delayed, the site may become stiff, and there is a chance of reducing the dislocation with it.
Therefore, one should not move or stretch at all during the restoration period. For it often causes a spasm to occur, and painful injuries.
But when this occurs, then you should, to make sure the blood is removed from the injured area. Then it is dismissed, until the stiffening subsides.
Then the member is soaked with warm water and oil. Then reduce it with ease.
And take care of each member, restoring it to its original place.
I have already arranged the chapters on dislocations, as well as those following, from the upper part of the body to the lower.
Chapter on the care of a dislocated jaw (mandible).
The two jaws are rarely dislocated.
And the dislocation of the upper jaw occurs in two ways only. Or, indeed, they depart from their places by a small distance and become slightly looser. Or they are completely dislocated, and become looser towards the chest, until the saliva is removed by the injury, and he cannot hold it closed, nor close his mouth, and the tongue rolls with speech.
When, however, the dislocation is small, then it returns of its own accord with a few movements.
If the dislocation is complete and intact, then it should be treated promptly with reduction, without delay: and it is necessary that the nurse holds the head, and the doctor inserts his thumb of one hand into the root of the dislocation between the mouth and tooth, if the dislocation is on one side. Or he should insert both thumbs at the same time, if the dislocation is on two sides. And the other fingers of his hand are outside, which equalizes it.
And order the sick person to clean their teeth and eat with all parts. And the doctor equalizes the jaw, and pushes it back to its place.
That if the reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are dislocated together: then he should administer steam with warm water and oil until the reduction becomes easy: and do not delay the reduction of the jaws at all, as we have said.
When they are therefore closed and equalized, and the mouth is shut, and do not relax: then place on them soft cloths, with a pad that has been made of wax: and oil of rose.
Then bind it together easily with loose ligaments.
And let him lie on his back: and his head should be placed between two cloths so that he does not move to the right or left: and he should not be forced to chew anything: but soft food should be given to him to eat, until such time as his jaw no longer hurts, and it is closed: then he can eat what he wants, and administer it easily.
He should not work on the operation of his mouth during digestion and drinking, and whistling, until such time as the jaw is closed, and healed.
That if the reduction of both jaws is difficult when they are dislocated at some time, and do not return to their places: then often occur there fevers, and frequent farts: and perhaps a swollen belly, and perhaps pure cholera.
For this reason you see that loss; for if you don't know, it is a loss, and he often dies who gets this in ten days.
The Reduction of the Dislocation of the Furcula and Extremity of the Humerus
The furcula does not dislocate from its inner side, because it continues with the chest. And it dislocates sometimes towards the outside; and that is felt by touch.
And its restoration is such that he lies on his back and extends his arms. Then gird your hand with the garter; for it will return by itself.
Then place a pad on it, and feathers, and tighten it.
The extremities, however, which follow the bed and continue with him, rarely dislocate. If it dislocates on one day: then let it be reduced and made equal as we have said, and let you be prepared.
Then place a pad on it, and feathers, and tighten it. And tell the sick person to adhere to rest and quietness until he is healed.
And with this same cure the extremity of the humerus is reduced when it separates from its place as well.
The Reduction of the Dislocation of the Humerus
You should know that the humerus does not dislocate unless by three ways.
The first is that it dislocates towards the upper arm towards the lower side. The second is that it dislocates towards the chest. And perhaps it dislocates towards the upper part of the humerus, and that is rare.
And it does not dislocate from behind, because of the scapula. And it does not dislocate from the front, because of the nerves.
It dislocates and moves towards the lower side towards the titillus; mainly in those who have little flesh there. For he who enters them quickly exits and quickly enters.
But in those whose flesh is abundant, the opposite holds, that is, because he exits with difficulty and enters with difficulty.
And perhaps it happens to some men that they are struck or fall and dislocated their shoulder. They say that because it is already dislocated.
Therefore, let you experience that thing until you are certain about its status, and then proceed to treat it.
And be known the dislocation when it is towards the lower side of the joint: and distinguish between a dislocated shoulder and a healthy one. For you will find a great difference between them: and in the head of the arm there is an ache, and under the touch almost as if it were itself; and cannot bring the hand to its ear, nor move it in all movements.
And likewise, if it is dislocated towards the chest or upward: then there is a clear feeling of touch, and it does not hide itself away.
And of this dislocation, its reduction is easy when it is young or a weak boy.
And its reduction is, so that you lift your hand up toward the sky. Then put your fingers under its touch and join them together with strength upward to their place: and lift your hand up and extend it downward. Then put it down again, for himself he returns quickly.
But if it does not return by that which we have said, and there are many days from the time of dislocation: then let the infirm person bathe in hot water, and apply an ointment that softens and soothes, such as if they were cooked the roots of aloe, and foenugraecum, and melilotum in water, and it is applied.
Then the infirm person shall lie down on his back: and a ball and wool be placed under its touch, which is equal between the soft and the tight.
Then let the physician put his calcaneum on the sphere, and he shall raise the head of the humerus with force, and draw the hand of the nurse downward.
And if you wish, reduce him according to this manner: and it is so, that you may make the man who is longer ill present, and stand at his side, and introduce his humerus under the hand of the nurse: and lift up her hand to the upper part, until he be suspended in the air. And another shall hold the hand of the nurse downward toward the thigh of the patient. If the man is light: then it shall be necessary that something else should hold him up with it, so that he does not fall down: for he will immediately return to his dislocation.
And he shall be reduced also according to another manner: and it is so, that he is placed on the ground a long wooden piece, whose head is round in figure: as the handle of a mortar: which neither is too coarse nor too fine. Then let it be placed under the patient after that they are placed on the head of the wood, and the cloth made of soft fabric; and let the patient stand according to the length of the wood.
Then shall his hand be extended downward from the other part, and shall his body be extended from one side with force: for the joint returns to its place with velocity.
That if his reduction is difficult by all the things which we have said, then use this cure: and it is so, that you take a piece of wood whose length is two times that of the arm, and whose breadth is four times that of the fingers, and whose thickness is two times that of the fingers: and whose head is round, that it may ease the entrance into his depth according to this form.
Then let them bind on the round head with soft cloth so that they do not wound the wood on the patient.
Then place the nurse under the tickle, so that the hand is extended, or the arm over the wood until it reaches the lower part: and tie the wood on the support and the arm and the end of the hand.
Then place the arm over the steps across the width, and extend the hand towards the lower part, and dismiss the remaining body suspended from the other side. For the wound to be sewed immediately.
When this entry is therefore finished in whatever way possible: then you should place a ball of equal size made from wool under the tickle. Then place the prepared plaster made from ground stone with incense and albite on the whole shoulder as it turns away upwards.
Then tighten the knot under the tickle as it goes down: and wrap the ligament around the plaster upwards: and attach her hand to her neck, and dismiss it, and do not move her hand for seven days.
And you should place a meager diet for the member until it is healed: for it is faster to heal with it.
Then place a broader one after seven or five days, and exercise it with movement. But if it remains firm and does not weaken, then it is healed now.
But if the wound dislocates many times, because of the moisture that occurs with it, or for any other reason: then you should administer a cauterization with three holes, as was mentioned in the chapter on cauterization.
If all of this is done, and the ligament is loosened after seven days, and the wound does not close with the plaster and the knot many times, and does not firm up, and falls down, and cannot raise it upwards: then you should know that the nerves which are in the shoulder have been cut or stretched or weakened: and you should know that the wound never closes in its place.
But the dislocation which happens towards the chest and the nipple, or to the rear, is caused by a push and an extension with the hands: until it stops, and administer a remaining knot and care, until it heals.
If it should happen after recovery of the strength of a member, and delay in its movement, then let the sick person use the bath often, until that strength is relieved, and return him to his natural state first.
On the Treatment of Dislocation of the Elbow.
Know that the elbow joint dislocates with difficulty, and likewise returns with difficulty to all parts, especially to the front or back.
And its dislocation is not hidden from you: for it falls under your sight and under your touch, according to whatever figure it dislocates. And when you join together a dislocated elbow that has recovered its strength, it becomes manifest to you. For the dislocation is twisted, and it cannot bend the arm, nor can it touch the shoulder with it.
And you should reduce the dislocation at once, before it experiences a hot swelling.
For if it happens to that elbow joint that a hot swelling occurs, it is difficult to reduce it; and it may be that it does not heal at all, especially when it is dislocated towards the back. This is worse in every respect to dislocation, and more painful to the arm: and often dies with it.
And when its restoration is from among those that can be reduced, it extends its hand with both hands: and the arm is spread out, and the fingers of the hand are placed above the elbow joint and under it, and he pushes back the dislocation with his thumbs of his hands simultaneously, or with the base of his palm, until he returns to his place.
Or, on the other hand, the dislocation is towards the front: then he returns so that he doubles his hand with his own hand, until he strikes against the base of his palm the elbow joint that has been dislocated.
If the dislocation does not submit to reduction, then administer a sharp extension, a strong rub: and it is as if two ministers extend the arm: and they hold him also, so that he does not move during the extension.
Then the arm is to be rotated back to its full extent after it has been enveloped with a doubled-over cloth or wide bandage on his hand.
And when the doctor touches with his own hand the joint, he should dip it in oil: so that it may be from those which help in the lubrication of the joint by ease. Then he should push the joint with a sharp push, until it is released.
And after the reduction of it, it should be placed on it a plaster, in which sits the clotting, and drying with alum: and let it be tightened by tightening while healing. And hang the arm from the neck of the nurse: and let it be left for several days.
Then unfasten. If then the joint remains fixed in its place, then loosen the bandage from it, and let it be left.
And if you see that the joint is not tightly tightened, then repeat the plaster, and the bandage, and let it be left for several days, until it is tightened. Then unfasten it.
If however it has happened to him that he is light after the reduction of the joint, and the disposition is in movement: then administer moistening in bathing, and subtle rubbing, and compression, until it is healed, or put on top of the joint an ileum, that is, a piece of chamois leather. Then tighten it, and let it be left on it day and night. Then take it off, and let him enter the bath. When however he sweats, then rub the joint with moderate rubbing. Then repeat on top of him a piece of chamois leather once, and twice, and third time at the entrance to the bath, until it is relaxed.
And if you want, put on top of him a heap of fine mud, moist, heated with butter, and tighten over him.
Let it be done several times. It is healed, and returns to its own disposition.
De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.
If the wrist is dislocated, that is, the joint between the arm and the hand is disconnected, then...
And reducing the dislocation of it is easy. Contrary to the remaining joints. However, it is necessary that the speed be in the reduction of the dislocation at the time when it is dislocated, before the measurement is taken: or happens in that measure warmth.
And reducing the dislocation is, so that you put Al-Mahassari's weak hand on a table, and extends his assistant hand: and puts the doctor's palm on the eminence of the joint, and pushes it until it returns.
However, it is necessary that you consider whether the palm has already reached the stomach of the hand: then put the weak back of the hand on a table with extension and reduction: and if the dislocation is going to the back of the hand, then the position of the hand should be inside the table, that is, the interior part of the hand should be placed on the table, so that the doctor's palm rests on it.
If then he returns immediately, it is good: and if not, then bind it with a plaster while the Apostema is resting: and let go of it, and do not return to it.
For if it does not bear, and you cannot reduce it, after a few days, the joint remains according to its torsion: and does not hurt the weak man, unless the hand is softened, and he cannot grasp anything: then know that the nerves have been cut off, or rubbed.
So there is no skill in it, except that it is bound with a bandage close to its danger. And perhaps it doesn't matter.
But since Al-Mahassari does not return, then put the plaster on him, which we have described. He should then be strung up and left for five days; afterwards he should be unstrung and left, and his hands exercised.
But if he is deprived of movement and something heavy happens to him: then make him soft with warm water and sometimes rubbing, until he becomes soft.
The cure for dislocation of the fingers.
When a finger is dislocated completely, or one of the fingers is dislocated towards the back of the hand, or the thumb is inside it: then extend the finger and push with your thumbs until it returns to its place.
Then support the head of the finger and hang it on the side where it is dislocated for two days.
Then hang him up and extend him, until he becomes straight again on his own day.
When it is night, bind him according to the above narrative: and do not stop from unbinding him on that day: and exercise him with movement: and bind him at night.
Make those days a few, until he is strangled.
And also do the same with him if he is dislocated towards the palm of the hand: and bind him on that side, and perform your operation on him, until he heals.
And also do the same with him when he is dislocated in other parts.
The cure for dislocation of the spine of the back.
When something like this happens to someone: there is no cure for it, because death approaches the sick.
And a sign of this is that the sick person leaves the bed of their own will, and cannot hold on to it: and often some limb of theirs weakens, or two limbs, or two arms, or one arm: or one of the spines leaves its place. Or one of the spines is dislocated from one of its places.
Many times, therefore, they are removed, as many times is the removal made towards the four sides.
Those which are moved towards the rear, then, are called Girdles.
The cure, however, is this, that you should consider then, if Girdles occur from infancy: then there is no cure at all from it, nor is there any healing at all from it.
But in that which occurs from accident, or blow, or similar things, the ancient doctors have long ago spoken of the methods of cure. Whose much does not return with profit.
I have, however, abbreviated from that, of which little excuses its much nearness to me with regard to my intention: and my exposition of it, which I exposed, and formed a different instrument from him from which they showed it, and exhibited itself.
I say, then, that in the girdle which occurs from the front part, there is no art nor healing from it.
And similarly in that which occurs on both sides also.
And they are not cured from them, unless that which occurs in the back own, with what I am telling you: and it is, so that he extends himself on his face on a level platform near the wall: and he expands himself under him a damp cloth, so that his chest is not injured.
Then a straight piece of wood is placed in the mud on the ground at the end of his foot, about his head: and another piece of wood around his feet at the other end of the other foot: and the servant holds the wood, and sits it not fixed in the mud. And the other servant hold another.
Then he turns himself about on his head, and under his chin with a soft ligature firmly: and extends the end of the ligament to the wood which is by his head: and ties it on him.
Then he tightens another ligature above his shoulders, and above his knees, and at his heels. Then secure all the ligaments, and tie them to another piece of wood which is at his feet.
Then all the attendants should stretch out to the timber of the ligaments, and not remove the two timbers from their places where they are fixed: verily, however, they are not fixed, as we have said.
And the doctor should place his palms on the spine with strength until he has recovered: or he should place it on the panel. Then he attaches his feet to the panel until he has recovered.
But if he does not recover with this treatment, then take a panel whose length is about three arm-lengths. And fasten one end of the panel to the wall that we have mentioned, which is near the sick man, at the end into which he should enter. Then place the middle of the panel on the spine. And the doctor should place his feet on the other end. And tighten it well, until the spine is compressed, and return to his place.
Then if you wish, operate with a turning saw that is turned by your hand: and it is, so that you fix in the ground near the head of the patient the two timbers whose length is that of an arm: and near the head of him at the other foot the two timbers.
And the length that is between every piece of timber should be a palm: and there is made in every place a hole, in which the saw runs: and all the wood should be firmly fastened in the ground so that it does not move at all.
And the round timber is inserted: and there is a saw which turns around in two holes of the two timbers.
And at the end thereof is a hole, into which the timber is fastened, whose length is with that by which it turns round: and there is also such a hole in the other two timbers.
Then tighten the ligaments that you have tightened inside the patient's body with a turning saw that is at his head: and the ligaments that you have tightened in his legs with a turning saw that is at his feet.
Then let the attendant of every turn stand with his hand turned by a lever, with which he turns the turn: and the doctor is equidistant from Spondile, as we have said.
This is the form of the turning table, which follows.
Then, after Spondile has returned and equidistant position is reached, then it should be placed, dried plaster with albumen . Then stand. Then place above the plaster a plate from the table, whose width is three fingers wide, or about them. And its length the quantity which takes up the place of vibration, and on the sound side of Spondile.
Then bind with a strap, that we have said. And use delicate food for nourishment until he is healed.
That if anything remains of excellence in the place at the end of recovery: then it should be administered medicine that softens and softens, with the table which we described during a long time. And now is administered into that lead layer.
And when it happens that a failure occurs at the end of the back of Spondile: and it should be considered by this dislocation, and it is the opening which it already emits. Why it should not be made to him with this medicine: for perhaps will happen make him die.
Of the cure of a dislocated shoulder.
You should know that the shoulder joints of the arm, and the shoulder joint of the upper arm, do not occur, except by a dislocation; and they do not occur to them what occurs to other joints from a small distance, and because of their position.
And a dislocated shoulder can be located according to four parts. Because it is dislocated forward and backward.
And much more dislocations occur inward; and little dislocations occur forward and backward.
And the cure of its dislocation inward is: because when you join the cruris a healthy nurse with the sick, it is longer: and his knee joint eminens is more than the healthy, and cannot make the sick double his foot near the hip: and there is a place that follows the hip that is heated, so that the head of the hip has already reached it.
And his sign is that which happened to him, if it was a dislocation to the outside, that are his opposite accidents from these accidents.
And the sign of him to whom a dislocation has occurred in front, that is because it spreads his healthy leg according to the complement: however, he does not double himself without pain who is in his knee: and if he tries to walk, he cannot go over that one to the front: and he holds back his urine, and he farts behind him, and when he walks he stumbles over his heel.
And the sign of him to whom a dislocation has occurred in back, that is because he does not spread his leg, nor can he double himself before he doubles his knee: and it is shorter the other leg: and his knee is soft, and the head of the femur is at the place of it.
The reduction of this dislocation is that you should consider then, if the dislocation is old, which has already been healed with the owner of it. Then if you administer the reduction of it, and remains after its own disposition: then is not at all cure. Therefore it should not be supposed that he is perfect.
But in that one whose dislocation is recent, and it is from the four kinds of dislocations: then draw near to this, so that you join him, and extend it towards the inside and towards the outside, and move it with your right and left: perhaps it will return, and does not need another cure.
But if it does not return in this way, then you should prepare, a strong instrument, and extend his leg from the lower part: or with his hands, or with a ligament that binds above his leg: and another minister extend his hand from above, so that he puts his hands under his toes. Then tie it up with a soft ligament over the root of the pelvis, and hold the end of the other ligament.
And sit extension of it or from the anterior part of the groin to the part of the fork, or from the posterior to the part of the back.
And let all these extend one way by turn, until you lift up the sick man with his body from the ground and let him hang.
For this reason is this kind of extension a common species of the four kinds of extensions.
But if this return of dislocation with it that I have said, is good, and if not, then it is necessary that all the kind that I say about cure is his own.
In reduction however of him when dislocation is to the inside, it should be, that the sick man should lie on his sound side. Then put the ligature over the root of the hip, in so much as it is between the head of the hip, and the place which is under the groin. Then extend the ligature to the top from the part of the groin to the higher part of the body, to the part of the fork.
Then take another strong minister his arms, and decrease the big place of the sick hip, and extend to the outer extension strongly. For he has already returned to his place.
And this kind is easier than the remaining kinds of cure, which this member is reduced.
But if he is excused on you, and does not obey to the entrance with this kind of cure at all: then it should be, that two nurses should bind the feet strong, weak, over the two heels, and over the two knees: and let be the length of each from his compeer quantity of four fingers: and let be the width of the sick man extended in two quantities of two fingers.
Then hang up the sick man on the head of the wood, which is in the house: and let be the length of him from the ground quantity of two arms.
Then command a strong youth to support the head of the hip: and hang up with the sick man in another one: and push forward another youth, supporting the hip with strength, because the return is to its place with speed.
In reduction therefore of its own, when it is dislocation towards the outside, it is necessary that the sick man lies on his back, according to what we have narrated in having a gibbosity. And tie up ligaments over its leg, the sick one himself, and over its chest.
Then two pieces of wood are placed, one at his feet, and another at his head. Then a piece of wood is placed in the middle of the foot, firmly fixed: over which are laid wet cloths so that they do not harm the sick man; and let the wood lie between his thighs, so that it does not attract towards the lower ones by extension.
Then all the ministers extend to their side, and the doctor adjusts the reduction with his hand.
If he therefore submits to the reduction, it is good.
And if not, place over it the board, and press it, as we have said in the gibbosity, equally. However, it is necessary that the sick man lies on his healthy side.
And when the dislocation is towards the front, then it is necessary that the leg of the sick man be extended quickly: and this same narrative is told on the side: and the doctor places his right hand palm on the hip of the sick man. Then he should hold him with his left hand, and with that holding place he should put him extended towards the lower side of the knee.
And if the dislocation is towards the back: then it is not necessary that the sick man be extended towards the lower side, and that he sit raised on the ground: but it is necessary that he be placed on a hard thing, as also it is necessary for him who dislocates his thigh towards the outside, according to what we said about his lying on two thighs: and let him be face up, and the ligaments extended: according to what we have just said.
And it is necessary that the compression with the board be administered also to the place from which the joint departs, when the reduction has been completed, according to what is necessary.
And the sign of his recovery shall not be hidden from you: and this is, that you stretch out two legs of the patient; and when you see them equal, and the sick man ties up his leg, and extends himself without excuse: then know that now the limb has returned, as it should: then join the two hips together, and put on a splint, and bind with bandages, that is, rotate: so that its width does not move to any part: and let the sick man rest for three or four days.
Then loosen the ligaments, and the splint, and compare the legs together: then if you see them equal in position, then know that the dislocation is now set: so let the sick person walk.
And if you see any softening: then go back, and put on the splint, and bind it according to your first order: and let him also be at rest for three days.
Then loose that, and let the patient walk a little on each side for a few days, until he is well comforted.
Of the dislocation of the knee joint.
The knee may be dislocated three ways. By the outward, inward, and downward way, that is to say, by the rearward.
And it does not dislocate forward.
And the sign of the dislocation is, that you command the sick person to apply his leg to his hip. If he does not apply it to the hip: then know that the knee joint has been dislocated.
And the restoration of all kinds of dislocation is, that you let the sick person sit upright, so that he may extend his leg over it if he can, and rest his back against your chest: and put his foot between your feet.
Then you should fasten the knee of the patient to your palm, and make them straight with your fingers over the knee joint. Then apply with your palm two sides of his genitals with strength. And another minister extends his foot, until he returns to his place the genu.
And the sign of the restoration is that it adheres to the thigh with the hip in a gentle way, not laboriously.
Then bind him up, and adhere the thigh to the hip. Then bind them together with sutures of twine for days, or four. Then dissolve them.
And do not let the patient walk for a few days, until he is healed.
But if you do not get his reduction, then administer a strong extension with ligaments, of which the pre-story in the cure of achilles, until he returns to its place.
The cure of dislocation of the calcaneus.
The calcaneus is sometimes reduced with a small movement, and sometimes dislocated after the second compliment. And the dislocation of it is done, or towards the inside, or towards the outside.
And the sign of dislocation of it is that you see the calcaneus swollen, proceeding to the side to which it is dislocated.
But the cure of the reduction of it is easy; and is, that he be extended with ease with hands, and be smoothed out, until it returns to its place.
In the cure of him when it is dislocated after the second compliment, you should make the patient sit straight up: and hold him by a strong minister strongly from the back part of his waist, in the middle of it.
Then hold with your right hand your foot from the upper part of it, and with your left hand from the lower part of the foot where the heel is.
Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand. Then with two fingers of your left hand.
Then extend with ease, and push the chest of the foot towards the hip without labor.
Do this twice, as we have narrated it.
Then press the chest of the foot to the leg in the third place, and you tear the joint.
If then he returns in one juice, or in two the second way, and you see the foot even, it is good: and if not, then repeat the operation on himself: for he will return again.
If however it is forbidden to you the reduction with him that we have described: then make him lie on his back on the ground, and fasten the splint firmly on the ground so that it falls between his thighs: and you have already wound the cloth around him so that it does not hurt the sick.
Then let the servant take the foot of him: then the other servant extends the leg, or with his hands, or with a bandage that binds over the neck of the foot. Then let all the servants extend against the extension of their own: and the splint be standing between the two thighs of the nurse while she holds it, so that his body is not pulled towards the lower part by the extension.
Then let the doctor adjust the dislocation with his hands, and the other servant hold the leg healthy from below. For the dislocation returns with velocity.
When however the dislocation returns, and it is declared to you that the return of it is healthy: then put on a splint and padding, and tighten it with bandages firmly, and tie the foot to the leg with a bandage.
And it is necessary that you should beware and fear the nerves that are above the heel at the back, so that the bandage does not press on them painfully, and hurts them.
Then let go of him after two days, or three. If however the bandage becomes soft, tighten him up: then let go of him in a third or fourth day: and forbid the sick one from walking for forty days. If however he tries to walk before that space, there is no security except that the dislocation be dissolved on him, and it is corrupted, and does not receive after that cure.
If it happens that he has a hot apostema: then you should give him sedatives and embrocations until it goes away.
On the dislocation of fingers of the foot, and their treatment.
It should be treated with little extension without effort; and this is not difficult, indeed it is easy.
If the dislocation is in the toes of the back of the foot: then he should make the injured foot stand on an equal place of the ground, or on a board: and it is as steady as when walking.
Then you shall stand, and put your foot upon that which protrudes from them, the joint. Then step on it with your foot with force, until it turns, and does not appear to be out of place, and does not project in the spot.
Then put under his foot a board which takes all the foot, which has two heads. Then tighten it with strings by tying for three days. Then solve it, and allow it to rest from walking for several days, until it is tightened and made secure by reduction.
On the species of dislocation with a sprain or fracture.
When something of this kind has happened, and he is inclined to the care of it, and to its restoration; death often succeeds many times, and therefore it is not necessary to be hasty in his treatment, which is of this kind, unless he is prudent in the art, compassionate, merciful, slow, not brave, nor presumptuous: and that he uses in the beginning of medicines which sedate hot poultices only: and lets the sick man rest by divine judgment. Except you hope for salvation from destruction with gentleness of sickness, and in which there appears some hope. Therefore, he must begin the reduction immediately at the start of the affair, before the appearance of the apoplexy [i.e., fever].
If then the limb returns [to health], according to what we have ordered, then administer the treatment that calms down the apoplexy: and care for the wound with the same thing that suits him when it comes out of the dried ointment.
That if the dislocation is with a fracture and happen in the bone of the separated places, then try to remove them, and do in it what we said in the simple illnesses from because it preceded in those places.
And be careful according to your ability, and guard yourself from the entrance into a path of fear: according to my prediction for you.
For that is better for you with your Creator, and more enduring to your glory, and more safe to your body there with them at that time.
