Oh children, you have completed this book on the latest of science in medicine; for which I give thanks to your diligence and knowledge throughout it all, as conveyed through your discussions, explanations, and statements—showing me that you understand deeply even those parts concerning surgery. (This translation aims at retaining meaning while adapting slightly older or more formal language expressions common in the period.)
When the operation is humbled in our region and at this time of complete privacy, I enter where my science prevails; until now only small descriptions have been seen by me within free texts from Antiquity, which I will alter these into errors to correct them, thereby elongating both strength (science) and art.

Through what Aquilus says is its name, may in small things it partakes mostly within the work of hands (medicine).
May we already have mentioned this in the introduction of our free work; who do not know what we have told them about anatomy, will fall into error and serve as dead men'thy subjects if they see only some aspects that are fashioned within this science and taken from its knowledge and experiments.
Here comes the medieval medical treatise to translate line by line into English:
Here comes another doctor who ordered that the patient swallow a stone from within him which he had processed in his state; the stone was large and came out of him and they extracted it using a tool from the bladder, so that this home (i.dict organ) died on the third day.
And he called it out for extrication from there because of the greatness of the stone and due to its location in relation to the spleen, which ultimately led to death.
And another doctor took the fee of a duke from our land for surgery; and brought in a blackened tool that had fractured his thigh bone there; he ignorantly set the broken bone on the ground, between pillows and bedposts with strong structure, without laying it down to breatim.
Here they return to set the ligaments according to their wishes, and secure them with belts during daytime hours as commanded; thus entering until the thigh and buttock are in the center of rupture.
And you called upon him/her (possibly referring to the healer or physician), and used tools for untying ligatures, achieving calmness and alleviation of their pains.
Even though decay has been confirmed in the limb, it cannot be restrained and will not stop wandering within the malady'dict one until its cure is found.
And another doctor pierced an abscess and it ruptured within days; by then his cunning had reached the Lord of him.
The cause is that the head (brain) excess of melancholalc humor has come to it from all over, but only affects one member where it was already housed.
And for that reason, men and women, it is necessary for you to devise the operation in two parts: one associated with health (healing), and another related to potential danger or major complications.

And you already have descended this second volume by three chapters.
Commencing the division of the free space, and first from the primary partitioned section. The ordered first chapter within the body'supremacy, in the forms of instruments and iron tools needed for operation.
The division of the second section. The Second Chapter on Surgery and Perforation, and of Vials, Drops, Pus Extractions from Herbs and Appearances to those Things: Here the entirety is ordered according to the forms of these instruments.
The third part for restoration and detachment, as well as care of twisting and superficial forms to these patients: the head is ordered within the body weight, and shapes of instruments are arranged accordingly.
When you pour out the quality of that cautery and its non-essentials, it is forbidden to perform further cauterizations in this complexion.
So that the speech of cautery and their own is long and elaborate, and subtle by science; they discuss much about these things among themselves, and to me enough one of their discourses suffices, for fear of prolongation.
And so it is said that the cautery comforts all of the body universally, except for two kinds of matters (parts), which are parts of its own matter.
In the complex tail and dry matter; there are those who say that instruments (cauterization) will benefit this area, while others suggest doing what is contrary to it, as its nature is like water and dryness, making treatment of such ailment involving these elements necessary when they come together. This suggests cauterizing both moisture-laden areas and those lacking in wetness for effective healing from conditions where the presence of opposites (moisture/dryness) is required due to their inherent nature as well as necessity based on quality and dryness, indicating that treatment should target these combined water elements which are being cauterized.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: "Direct that one who says against him, for cauterization it is greatly beneficial in all malady of the tail and dryness that you find on the body' extrication of a man’s joint from humidity.
Through his speech, which I have heard at times before me, it has come to my attention that something of the kind has been discovered by him.
May nevertheless not remove what has already been extracted and exercised on the cautery tools for yesterday'se exercise, and comprehend the complexity of human composition and the disposition of diseases in their bodies, as well as the causes of those illnesses and the intervals between them.
May in other complexities not be due to fear but rather from the effusions and moist conditions that are already agreed upon by all doctors; there is no disagreency about performing drainage procedures on these matters within their skill set for cauterization.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
May the medicine'dict act come to him in his limb that he lays upon, and with great force it will enter into the ill-affected member making recovery difficult and causing departure.
May the focus (the flame), due to its sublimity and beneficial substance, only does what is necessary and not more so; we have come together through experimentation and long study of this art concerning truth about causes, hence excusing us from lengthy discourse. If you had been free during this pause to reveal your secret motives at the fire'dictate (the foc), it would sharpen our understanding here—this operative technique in hands which expels diseases is demonstrated through philosophical dialogue; and if so, clarity will be found within these very sessions.
And learned ones (doctors), who understand when it is most appropriate to perform cauterizations and breaks/pauses, come during the best times of early morning.
Even says that cautery is convenient at all times, as the harm from accidents submerges into the water where the cautery has been applied and most especially if for pains or necessary pains such as fractures and bleeding which do not suffer delay because of what malicious forces are greater than small harms entering through time.
So do not hurt your feet or legs; they are valued only by the ignorant common folk and physicians, hence why healing with cautery is not a complete solution, as it leads to those consequences.
E the cause is not healing itself where they should be, for then instruments are only used in a medical place that changes complexity and dries out the humours which are the reason why pains come.
Even though there are excess tools above medicine due to the patient'se urgency and magnitude of their operation, let it be known that such instruments should not interfere with treatment.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
Even the common language among physicians is that it'dicts where to apply cautery in medicine and what not to pursue, as I understand them but do not believe can be fully treated with medical knowledge or by other means of applying cautery.
The cause is contrary to water; I understand that the remedy in medicine comes into play only when applying poultices for certain illnesses, and it'se here where a healer applies the caustic itself as part of treatment, reaching towards the root of the issue. Here comes the first sentence to translate: And from here onwards, those who use cautery are considered as medical remedies, according to what is understood by ordinary people and sometimes doctors too.

The First Point/Topic: This cauterization will confer humility and coldness to the accident of which you suffer causes; these are due to moisture and abundance of fluid rampancy in room air, from head to limbs' joints, as well as excess sleeping time, dental pain, gout (as per previous text), general affliction caused by dampness leading also to paralysis, numbness/palsy, and fits similar to apoplexy.
The form of this cauterization is as follows: initially command the humors to be evacuated by medicine at the topmost part of the body, for three or four days according to what exhorts from the malady and its age, along with the patient'se customary practice.

If the patient has had it for a long time and needs healing within which recovery is solidified, then so be it (or in other words, "then take care").
May I not see all these healing tools of cautery for everyone, but only in wise homes through fear; and as for me, better is it when my head rises due to the solar influence on our breathing together with other members, especially when the head at the groin naturally swells.
And if it is necessary for the initial type of cautery, it may save and be better than before me; from that hot iron they take care to acquire health benefits.
Capitol second.
Of the pointed cautery of the head (or possibly referring to an instrument
When the chronic and long-lasting pain affects the entire head, and it is caused by an extension in the belly (possibly indicating a distension or swelling), doctors use knives and cupping sets and scalpels and cauterizing tools and leeches and medicinal herbs and similes/representations; mostly if already one has used such treatment on any of these causes, it is considered that the belly's head might have a strong formation in its nature. It does not require excessive force or harsh methods because this part may be formed from dense matter (this could refer to hardened tissues within). Therefore, they use another cauterizing tool on such an area; these are usually less powerful instruments as indicated by "pauc. Return that over the patient's head with caustic, within which their intestine has been cut open. Cut the ribcage and expose its bone as much as we have counted and treated it with a cauterizing instrument in the part of the back where it has been called for treatment—and this is the location where breathing through a ventouse occurs (ventosa refers to suction used by doctors historically). And lift your hand forcefully, and do not touch the abdomen, for it inflicts great pain different from that of other caustic instruments on the head.
Here the lancet is applied in its place, four times whereby each time that this lancing has been done to these horns on the head and back respectively, it was with a very subtle cauterization tool which belongs here; thus this constitutes our method.

When the head's pain is firm or when it hurts in the elbow inside, medicine specialists must be applied to treat the head wound and administer another form of treatment as mentioned herein for diseases; thus no further cauterization should occur unless necessary.

If the amount of blood that has accumulated due to obstruction in the intestine is reached where your hand rests, place your hand there such that the artery does not get obstructed further, thus preventing bile flow blockage.
Return the cloth in water and salt to that place, and leave it there for three days; then return the bandage at the edge of the border, and take care until the inside is healed.

The phrase "Cauterizacio d'emigranea antica" can be translated line by line as follows:
When you treat the fluid that has been mentioned before in healing, and what is said about the divisions of illnesses, do not neglect this treatment, for if there's a sickness from which it takes more than just the first cure by medicine or by pointed heat within the instrument used to apply them, then mark where the pus lies along the long line of its extent—this is what you indicate. Hold your hand over that place as though holding fire inside the lancet while introducing it there; this way, through brief restraint and repeated insertions using forceps, ensure reaching into the bone interiorly.
However, it is necessary for you to guard against the continuation of the jaw' extruding its teeth and causing dislocation or pain in those nerves which control such movement, so that there be not spasm.
If it is about the custody and caution of blood flow from the artery that expands, there is fear in him who does not know what he causes to come out and doesn't study or observe; then perform the operation on him with care.
When recalling the regimen of fluid accidents in accordance with the physician'thy way, at this place we shall do so now.
If the malady does not supply this caustic and affects the part of the body that is heated at the head'dict (head or nape), then apply it there as we have described, taking care to cure what lies within so that it may be made well.
If you go now, administer the same type of pointed cautery we have discussed earlier in this chapter on acid-based cauteries using two lancets for application; and so it may result even better healing.

If the tweezers of fire are applied and I direct where they touch those which cleanse our worlds, ensuring prolonged burning with torchlike heat; or if a pin is used for patient's refusal to pull out their hairs, then tighten the bandages on my hands so that no filth enters through when these human strands are born.

Regarding the cautery of gout and joint pain:
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
So when treating gout due to excess cold fluid produced by the spleen and there is no further aggragy of pain, then apply bandages with warmth therapy; thereby alleviating the pains once more.

If it is necessary for points to be made on the surface of the foot, then use a pointed cautery for that purpose. If pains penetrate into the abdomen or other joints and these motions cause discomfort, then it is necessary to apply caution in any of those points with either three or four cautions from this instrument (cauterizer).
If you have the required cautery tools at hand, then heat that specific one and do not press your finger too much on it before use; just pass your thumb through the probe of the lancet as needed.
If pain enters into both hips and shoulders, administer the aforementified treatment we have discussed in our chapter.
If the pain is only in the limbs alone, it calls for sweat induction; thus, a needle will be inserted into the circulatory channels of these two lines (likely referring to meridians or specific points on the body).

For the treatment of blood loss from a wound through an incision with a surgical tool (likely referring to using a lancet or scalpel for precise cutting). The translation reflects practices that might have been used during medieval times
The treatment of blood loss caused by an incision made with a surgical tool (possibly referring to lancet or scalpel), where one must decide whether the wound itself is being bled out and needs direct intervention, or if it’s necessary first to make incisions or apply cautery directly on body parts. Following these steps often makes recovery difficult. The translation reflects medieval medical practices for managing bleeding post-incision where immediate control of hemorrhage was challenging due to the nature and location of injuries at that time.
So when you have applied a cauterizing agent to the patient'thy hand above where bleeding started with your surgical tool (implying that pressure or heat was used), maintain it there until such time as blood flow has ceased in those areas previously treated, ensuring no further effusion. The translation here details medieval first aid measures taken after an incision causing a wound: applying something to stop the bleeding and keeping steadying hands-on treatment till complete cessation of fresh or continued hemorrhage from that initial injury site with surgical intervention during those times when such direct care was available.
Rest with just few and good healing applications of the olive-based poultice for several days over those spots where there are sparks or fires (this could metaphorically refer to areas affected by inflammation, possibly interpreted as heat from a fire).

You understand that this illness moves gradually in children and when the newborn first lifts its head.
When certain measures are taken due to an impure cause that is not clean or pure.
May you not find this illness in children; and all those whom I see have suffered from hernia (a protrusion of an organ through the surrounding muscle wall), for which my work has been salvation to them herein.
Even you have seen that the child'thy head was filled with water and its head remained swollen all day until it could not stand any longer due to the great size of their head, and perhaps because moisture has increased inside where breath is expelled (where air flows out during exhalation).
This moisture is added between the navel and bone, or it is placed on top of the sinews; this holds their hands.
When the operation in that case is moisture between bone and flesh and swelling only slightly present, then cut at the place where pain appears once a week on the spot of injury as two notches deep into which flows the humidity; this forms the inflammation:
So if moisture increases and ulcers worsen according to this mannerism, here are two cracks as follows from it.
If the humidity is in your nose, it means that you have opened up all parts of your head and water gets squeezed out when you compress this area with your hands; here's what they are suggesting: When you cut into the head at this location three cracks according to this methodology.
And reduce the inflammation inside, and strengthen cracks on bedclothes and linens; apply warm ointment above to keep it within for a day or two, tightening of bandages around limb joints with moistened compresses while providing rest. Eat dry food by little portions if the body is comfortable enough after healing inside until restored healthily.
Here comes another incision method you consider necessary due to the size of the ulcer and the collection of water within it; sometimes these occur at the back of the skull (occipital bone), or in the area between, on the right side, or on the left side. Therefore, make an incision where the ulcer appears and collects fluid, doing so as soon as possible when you can manage to do this action:
And observe that you do not cut the vein and blood vessels of sanctus (blood) se and moisture for their expulsion through excretion.

And if there is not an opening (for bloodletting), then make and insert the end of the artery into the swelling at the aorta, sealing it with wax and oiled linseed to prevent excessive bleeding from just the site of cannulation. When applied externally with forceful attraction on the stomach area where they have previously gathered (presumably referring to fats or grease), these substances will be drawn out from their bodies, as noted by those who are observing them.
If there is no puncture for this methodology, take half an onion or small bellows where they are pressed and thus hold the arrows together by quantity, pause it at the end of the limb and wrap it snugly around that spot which has been padded.

The terms suggest that by holding this water with hands made from organic materials like gut or paper, and placing one end on a specific location referred as the 'auricularia' (likely referring to part near ears), while extending another hand within which it will be ignited. This could possibly indicate an ancient practice of treating certain health conditions using
And then place the gut and make water enough times within that it is completely evaporated (as stated by one's cup), applying this to what was said of drawing out excess moisture from the stone beyond its surface ("canula ayssi co desus es dit de la peyra extrasadora").

The phrase suggests an iterative process of boiling water with this substance until all moisture is removed from it (presumably for medic
And when a beast is drawn out into this part (likely the auricularia), if it's small like us and seems to resemble our presence, apply pressure on that which draws forth as directed in division; but for larger creatures whose cause has come upon my spirit within herein ("aurelha"), I administer its removal through gestures and cuts, setting this offspring apart from all other causes present there. Here the text refers to a form of therapy or healing practice whereby an external entity (possibly pus caused by infection) is removed with specific movements—gestures ("am oncis") which could imply physical manipulation or incision-like techniques, and "onces" suggest repeated applications for effectiveness. The mentioning that this process sets the issue apart from other causes suggests a holistic approach wherein differentiation of problems within an individual's body is essential to treatment—a common theme in various traditional medicine systems reflective across cultures during medieval times or beyond, indicating their understanding and attempt at targeted intervention.
When pus is produced in the wound during extraction, while you care for that which we have mentioned before regarding its division and treatment of drainage flows, pay close attention to your gauze as it may absorb more fluid if not given enough time under sunlight exposure.
So if there is any cause of worms here, extract that thing or those things gently, possibly with a catheter inserted up to its wide end from below; this shall be the form.

When there is a heavy accumulation of moisture in the eyes above and below (the upper and lower lids), it means that excessive fluid has gathered, possibly indicating an imbalance within the body' extraneous humors
Therefore, the excessive accumulation in their eyes implies that perhaps there is an overabundance originating from water appearing on top of and below (the upper and lower lids) which affects the entire body negatively; it suggests dampness as a cause for this condition.
Thus you must open the crack for release (perhaps referring to relieving pressure or blockages), and take those out that are throughout in quantity as well as temporarily detach them so they can be removed easily; this suggests addressing any excess elements at once while separating what is temporary from permanent. This implies a treatment approach involving careful assessment of the entire body, identifying which components need immediate removal (such as fluids causing dampness) and differentiating between transient issues that require prompt attention versus enduring conditions requiring more substantial intervention

If it is not possible to tie them up, then use a pin with thread and insert that into the figure's skin where you want (the treatment spot), placing one more needle above the major tear duct in such manner as its position may elevate your hand which will raise this part of action. Adjust these pins evenly between fields to lift them, raising both hands simultaneously and lifting the entire coda that rests upon it (where we have been advised).
With appropriate adjustments made to the patient' extrémités buccales (mouth), and care for that which is healed inside:
If you have an abscess or crack in your intellect or body, unclog it with wool and appearance, and apply oil.
And if some adjustments are needed for the eyes of their hair (their eyelashes), then use that which you have employed in addressing ignorance, and it may also serve as an artificial closure here; perhaps a suture is possible therein.
Ataxiny is second in this form: And convert the eyelid and divide the figure as I have recounted; using art, make dozens or thin wires of which length corresponds to the length of the eyelid and its width relative to the thumb's width at the joint.

The emphasis is on performing these actions with careful precision and finesse suitable for sensitive areas of the body ("cheek"). This suggests that what follows requires gentle handling typical in procedures where care must be

When the eye is closed and contracted, it tightens its lid when retracting into itself or one of its sides due to poor foundation (malformation) or incomplete treatment/cauterization (perhaps referring to improperly performed cauterizations), which causes pain attributed to solidification or incompletion of these treatments, either accidental or intentional.

The way of the operation is that you take a needle in which has been bent double (double-ended or curved), and leave it on your skin; through tears from both sides, entering into each other's tear duct – this method implies an early form of treating eye conditions by possibly targeting fluid flow between the two lacrimal sacs. Here "operation" could mean a procedure to correct something (possibly related to blockages or disorders in tear drainage), and using bent needles, it might be aimed at restoring proper function through an intervention directly with the patient's skin involving tears associated ductal pathways for therapeutic purposes.

This illness that is called 'alconati' (which in English would be understood as rheumatism, referring to joint diseases) isn’t just any malady; it resembles the way limbs are stretched apart like streams of water and thus differs from other ailments.
May the action of working on it be that you place the patient's thigh high on the specially prepared and cushioned seat, secure your head with both hands at the waist where illness appears to progress toward in time, drying off any moisture without letting descent occur, keeping everything steady until disease comes as usual.
If it does not descend into joints, understand that water is involved.

When teeth are so prominent as to be natural parts of those areas (specifically the legs and chest), which venerate them greatly; therefore consider: if a tooth is not appropriate or related elsewhere in the body, it roots there by its form—meaning that nothing can extract it. However, should something attach itself where no such prominent teeth exist, then take note of this attachment with an instrument made from India steel fine filament (a sharp-edged tool). This procedure resembles a tooth extraction performed on pigs and requires force similar to pulling out nails using the mentioned iron wire.

When the treatment of bloodsuckers present in the division between curing and medicine does not suffice (possibly referring to parasites like those transmitted by mosquitoes), consider that they are located within the humors of the body, where excess moisture resides. In this case, you should acquire a tongue for use as an instrument in treating them.
Thus, when you encounter a sudden gout attack, extract that small or subtle fragment delicately.
If it is not possible to extract it from there, then take a concave canula and insert that into the hollow of the malady, placing a hot iron pin inside the curve of the canula so much (until the sickness dies out and stays within the hollow), thereby preventing the disease for the entire day.

So other appendices that are torn when they cross and aren't mature according to their complement, like those attached at joints; when an appendix enters a limb via these openings, it can damage the connective tissue or nerves of that joint, causing pain in that part. If you delay the removal from this state until the inflammation reaches the main organ (usually the intestine), then piercing will occur to what is not mature yet; if at the navel where it has not ripened fully, perforate therein before full development occurs - causing indigestion and elongation of body parts downstream from that point.

Here comes the first source sentence to translate: And place your hand over there where the appendix has extended onto the ligaments and insert the said instrument into that location, provided you have not touched it with your hands; if so, remove at once what was grasped by the sinews and push the intestine back towards its parts in the abdomen.
If you have torn the fabric (referring likely to skin or some other material), then take that one with which you sewed it on; and cut away all excess of it.
If it is contrary to your artery or vein, surround that area, and return to your operation; take two needles and insert them into those fields strong enough so as not to break the skin when you pierce through this abscess in the groin wound which causes penetration by these fingers, holding it firmly with four parts upon the points of the needle.
If you wish to do so, place the needles and insert them where pain spreads throughout the body and expands; when it subtly descends and is inserted therein by yourself, ensure that such substance as lubricant entered during treatment remains inside for healing purposes.
If the navel's prominence is due to fat or moisture in him/her/it (referring back to "lu"), then cover it with cloth and purgatives, which remove humidity from within them, drying out that very thing inside of them, taking care also for whatever comes up during cleansing.

And when the patient lies in their bed outside of home (likely referring to being ill or hospitalized), as soon as you place your tool into water on them, that momentarily settles upon it; remove just enough moisture until not a drop remains for that hour—if after extracting this much liquid from their body without fully drying the patient out, they may die due to resolution of bodily fluids or fall ill with five symptoms (possibly referring to fever and other signs), which is considered an appropriate number leading up to death.

The line translates into English as follows: "No-malign (not cancerous), this cover that you should keep loose and pull out the other one from within it; place some Egyptian wax over there, soaking up excess moisture in its cavity; also provide healing oil for what's inside to ensure proper cure." Here, a remedy or treatment method is being prescribed. This could be related to managing skin conditions or lesions where one part of the covering needs more attention than another—possibly involving dressings and topical treatments as common in medieval medical practices:
If it is black bile (which they considered one of the four humors associated with melancholy), which has darker color, then apply your pointed cautery to its place and reason within you.
May it be that the foreskin is on the head of the penis and one part has been cut off while another remains intact; once you have performed this cutting (circumcision), ensure its completion within which healing can occur, and continue to care for that wound until complete recovery after circumcision.
And examine the testicles and foreskin blackness and hardening; consequently cover all that has already been darkened and corrupted, or is about to become so; apply liniments on this affected area with honey mixed from freshly ground brown flour of millet and various seeds crushed and rolled.
Return that part back into its cavity; there is care for it within which makes it heal.
May it be necessary for blood flow (bloodletting), then apply leeches according to this method.
When two types of lances are used for improvement, it is due to the flow of blood and phlegm when they become corrupted.
If the head of the gallbladder is corroded and destroyed at once, then when you insert a bronze tube into the flesh of the foreskin, the gallbladder will discharge its bile through that hole.
In the attachment of the foreskin at the base of the penis (and this adherence is not torn away here, but where it attaches; and it does not get pulled out by circumcision; when you have an abscess or carbuncle within that area, scrape it sharply inside to dissolve the bandage and completely remove the foreskin head.
If it is difficult to remove those exquisitely, then cover your hand with sponge and seek out any cause of the head or prepuce; thus when subtle, firm pressure will pierce through due to its delicacy during gentle manipulation.
Return the separation between the foreskin and head of hair on the penis to its subtle state in which it already lies within the mucosa, preventing other humors from sticking there.
And if it is necessary for his healing salt (consolidation) to be taken internally within what has been established, then do so accordingly.
The provided lines from the medieval medical treatise seem to be in Old Spanish or a similar
In translating this line, it's important to note that "mundificacio" here likely refers to some form of refinement or purification (from Latin 'mundus', meaning world/universe). The context suggests a discussion about the cleansing and care
The phrase you've provided can be interpreted in the following way:
So they say that ancient times did not practice circumcision among free men, nor do so in their laws today; only because they have acquired through experience and experimentation which causes them to abandon the major part of craftsmen and barbers using circumcision and mouth cleaning with a razor or sandpaper. They use ligature made from strong thread and small knife for this purpose.
E you have already adopted all these methods and not found anything better than careful application with the scalpel or needle where skin is involved in formation, here escape of semen occurs below the pubis, from the foreskin between two tunics, rapid movement of flesh thickens there too, which makes it difficult to be certain about other insights into this safe and painless condition.

May harm befall you if your work is done with an iron and rotten tools during surgery. The natural tongue of the child is short by nature, and through habit it often sticks in such a manner that there'thy need not be molding or shaping; you have seen this yourself.
May the world-making that I make with hemp thread and needle be strong in virtue because their thickness is proportionate; thus as for strength they match when compared together, which means you will have balanced two amounts of thickness each time, following a rhythmical pattern. Through this action, compression on the figure made by the hand (the web) holds down all parts of the thong (crotch), without leaving any gap at all.
And the first step of the operation is that you make the child predominantly so as not to force the iron into their thigh bone only for today; let it be within tomorrow.
Whenever it is possible for your intellect to receive that joy, then apply such happiness throughout the entirety of this action you can perform. Here you prepare to ensure that it's not giddy and conceal the tools in your hand or on your chest so that the child does not see those things nor anyone else among them.

So that when you stretch it out on your hand in front of the location and insert another one to its equal measure.
If you cannot hold it with your tongue, extract that from the joint and incise it there.
If it has been three days since the application of cold poultice to the area with an inserted aplication device (apostome), then apply warmth as soon as possible so that the applied material can recede, and gently exfoliate this easily removable layer. Additionally, prepare what you will use next for its application on them at your discretion.

The phrase in Latin, which translates from medical terminology into English as:
Hold urine in the bladder to prevent it from being caused by excess humors due to stones or kidney congestion, which seem like symptoms described by those who practice healing arts at this division.
If there is not dissolution of the fluid we have mentioned beforehand and fever has arisen as a cause on the abdomen, then administer withdrawal using an instrument similar to this: It may be made of silver or subtle lion conqueror, with delicate needles like slender lance in length analogous to that between one' extrication tool (fine catheter) and hand.

The provided text appears to be an excerpt from a medieval medical treatise
Extraction of stone." This line suggests that the subject matter pertains to removing a stone
We have already divided the minerals of stone and treatment in medicine, as well as distinguishing between stones formed in urine streams (kidney or ureteral calculi) and those originating from bladder issues." This translation conveys that within medical practice there has been an understanding established for differentiating types of kidney stones based on their formation sites—urinary tracts versus the bladder. It also implies a comprehensive treatment strategy involving both therapeutic measures and categorization according to stone composition, which is crucial in directing appropriate care or intervention plans tailored by medical professionals for patients
We have discussed the stones with action and part." This line indicates that there has been a conversation about particular types of kidney or bladder stones for which medical interventions are planned (operaio), along with specific

And that is what explains their exhibition and the shortened version." Here, a reference might be made about how certain conditions leading to kidney stones are elucmediate in causing symptoms (man
Therefore explain that stones formed in the bladder mostly affect children; and as urine is like water due to its subtlety when it flows out of the bladder, these are seen therein (implying they form or deposit within); whereupon bile froths from their liver veins, rolling with gentle motions along bodily currents until dressing arrives at that particular spot; and in its arrival delivers a crow to those stones." This translation reveals the author's perspective on bladder stone formation—particularly within children (enfantz) as being more common. The text describes urine, which is likened metaphorically ("aygua") due to its fluid nature when exiting through the urethra and details a process where bile from the liver veins creates frothy movement in what could be an attempt by ancient medicine practitioners (potentially herbalists or proto-urologists) to understand bodily processes related to stone formation. It also suggests that this phenomenon is addressed ("dressing")
This is how health recovery in those children within which they have reached fourteen years, and it's difficult to cure diseases of the limbs (hips/knees). May in young people migrate due to these fluids that move between them.
From which stone the jawbone is larger and from which cure it can be easily obtained; if there is little of it, then contrary to that one.
So when we approach the cure for that, bring with you what cleanses the male uterus through which it drains out all of its fissures where your belts are located; these openings occasionally prevent the entrails' infusion and inquiry into them.
Return its position to the thighs and count it down as far into the bladder or where it may leap from place to place until descent stops:
Here returns the cautery between your hands prepared, and all of it is done quickly on its own things in Lucca, that the bladder as whole may descend into divisions at once.
And through proper application reduce both that which has been removed and everything else from there.
So if you feel pain in the space (presumably referring to an area of discomfort), then touch it gently with your hand over there.
If you have not yet touched the patient' extrication in all of today or yesterday and if malady is stillborn within their left side (abdomen), take it out now with your hands and place it into its own cavity. Through the stone door where he stood just now. When that little one is converted into something small within the bladder neck.
Return them on top of that limb they are lying upon, and remove them from the parts outside this location where your section lies.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
Return it into its cavity; this is how it enters here: And divide in it what is between the knee and thighs, not on their place of sleep (above the left knee), but rather over that stone where its section lies undernethy's belly; there a transverse portion ensues for wide dispersal along with stitching according to how much laces uplies atop it—and none may exceed what is already present in one’s belly, lest the patient cannot endure.
And you know that there is some stone within which the limbs are formed and joined together; from it healing herein (from this condition) requires great effort for water to flow through them.
From that fluid it looks like a lion and is round, made of urine stones for its treatment (or remedy).
So if it is that which protrudes from or extends beyond its place, adjust in the crack/fissure.
If there is not a surgical tool available (for-getada), then the one you are preparing for will be operated upon gently or carefully, and this part of it where your forceps rests—that should also undergo careful manipulation with these instruments; do not avoid doing so. Or if you insert slowly an instrument designed to curve sharply into that extremity which has been grasped by the forceps, proceed accordingly without delay (forthcoming).
May you not be able to place your hand on it; then increase the disruption a little bit, and if you see flow of pus, remove that with sulphur dissolved in vinegar very strongly.
If the patient'thy bladder is one at once, then you will lead your hand to its mouth (the opening of the urinary bladder), and press over it; also leading a small amount herein; as if they are motions most dear.
If there is much pain, it may be ignorance that you have deeply inserted the large section into the waist, for which two causes of wounding are here: either because it remains or comes down from continuous urine discharge, thus not being fully consonated (consolidated) in its place.
May administer the removal of it from within that has been pushed outward (possibly a foreign object or organ), or in cases of bone fracture, place their fingers inside where they extract that same thing into pills.
So when you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with crushed aloe and dragon'sin blood, tightening it up afterward. When pressure is applied over that cloth bathed in oil and vinegar (or wine), or when it's brushed with rosemary and water foam, this will help to alleviate the abscess by applying local heat/cold treatment.
Return the bowel (intestine) above the belly (abdomen), and do not unlace (remove or loosen) it inside for three days.
When that air disperses, apply water and oil herein; take care to keep it well-lubricated with both ointment and wax inside until healed.
May if you cauterize the wound on the ground with healing and decaying substances, as it appears that I am in my bladder congealed like urine within me (and through this a person is prohibited from excreting their body waste), so insert herein described instrument into the soil whereby you extract such organ.
Here applies the water mixed with vinegar and salt, everywhere excluding all specifics, that which is required for healing within as long as it remains so cured.
In the hours of complete healing, when you have both thighs and adjust the stopped medicines on the location.
If the stone is small and located in the bladder, where it stays therein, then urination of this kind is prohibited; otherwise healing occurs through what you recommend daily when approaching a section, which are said to be suffering from obstruction (blockage); already have extracted fluid, and now take hold of a hollow iron tool with this form:
From outside the body cavity, gout is lodged in a pipe (likely referring metaphorically or historically as an outdated medical tool).
Return it close at hand (to the area), and hold it there firmly until it does not return to its bladder cavity again.
Return the iron into the wound with ease until the point of the puncture instrument enters that stone (the foreign object in the body). Here begins the process with your pointed instrument in your hand, and you perform the puncture of it until one from another part enters that space, at which point the urine is then discharged or expelled.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: Place your hand over what is falling out of the lower part of the body away from the wound, which has been pierced and where urine flows forth; therein lies the inflammation (or urethritis).
May if this treatment is not within your means for any reason that prevents you from doing so, then take a finger now and place it under the stone (referring to bone or limestone used as an impaction), and another finger below the stone. And raise it over the stone in that space between her knees. Return (or restore) that which has been extracted therefrom. Return these two ligaments and cleanse the hardened sancus with them; this is done in soil (presumably referring to applying some form of treatment or poultice made from local herbs).
It is not necessary to use hemp cord daily for the bladder, but rather to prevent it from returning there; and the other lashing above unless when the hemp cord is removed from above the belly button, at which point the cobra returns to its place and takes back the prey.
When it is necessary for you to lift the foot upwards (as when removing something from under it), raise your leg at its joints or return them as far as required and collect all that has come out together with these actions.

So if she clenches it tightly right away and commands her body that should insert into that (likely referring to the previously mentioned intestine or hernia), then proceed with caution.

This seems like an indication of continuing to another section about hernias in the text, possibly for
This sentence from the medieval medical treatise appears to discuss hernias as an accumulation of moisture in a white cavern within which humors reside and are contained by intestines (genetics). The term "cipher" here likely refers to body cavities or spaces. In English, this might translate more broadly into: Thus, the condition known colloquially as hernia is simply an accumulation of moisture within a white cavern containing humors in
In some instances the pannus (a layer of inflamed tissue) is formed in the part where humors are naturally located within it; and this area, between which we have previously identified as being occupied by a white cavern—that holds intestines contained therein—is actually filled with other fluids. This suggests that hernias may not only be related to fluid accumulation but could also involve the presence of different types or additional bodily contents within these cavities, distinct from what was previously understood as simply moisture ("tart"). Here "cuyat" likely means there is a disruption involving multiple substances. A clearer interpretation in modern English might be: In some cases,
The generation of this hernia is for purification which causes it to flow out from the intestines, and some are expelled through beating upon these areas:
This moisture has colored movements, whether the color is lemon or turns to vinous red or black dungy clay, and even sea water white, it comes from there for more reasons.

When you wish to learn about the color of humidity, observe the moisture in which inflammation has entered, and according as it appears therein—the form is preceded; then note the hue that emerges when such exudate enters at its site.
So when we come to the treatment of him who is afflicted with gout (implied by context), if it's possible for you to administer bloodletting, then do so at his place; and sometimes cut into his flesh as well.

May you make an incision against the call of apostema or infection at the time of cutting or treatment, when such opposition arises from what needs healing for it, then attend to that which has been mentioned as necessary according to this text.
If the patient' extruded (or protrudes) their intestine and fears a second operation due to its horrendous nature, then perform an incision according to what I recommend; when you have verified this fact by understanding that which we have discussed regarding signs, it is clear that there indeed exists a hernia.
When you perform the action of separating (or perhaps "unclasping") the groin over any raised anatomical division ("cezelha"), piercing through the localized swelling in its lower part on the spinal bone, and stopping the incision according to the length of time:
When I have made a wide opening where the water flows through.
Return your pause over the place where it is and apply that one here, thus causing my blood to flow from the water (the source of pain). Return that which is within so as it may be healed.
Might there be opposition to the water in that hour when you pierce through it: at which point, no pain is felt due to water causing contraction and preventing treatment of the water inside the frog; or adjust a small one within its confines.
You know that water returns, and it is collected for up to several months or until those days are over; when added, according to the physician's methodology, holes will be made as indicated by them so that the humidity may pass through said holes today.

From "the treatment of intestinal protrusion." (Note: This translation is based on the limited context,
The arrival of this intestinal protrusion occurs because the parts (budels) within it have risen above their usual position in the abdominal cavity as part of its nature, leading to them moving upwards towards or into those areas where they are normally located inside.
This rupture is either of the cistern or exacerbation due to various causes such as: a blow, teasing, loud noise, lifting heavy objects, or mere appearance.
The water of the humors, when it is extended through contraction, makes you painful for long periods without relief and becomes inflamed within your body cavities; as a result, seepage occurs into the bladder from where the catheter will be inserted.
When the patient' extricates from one section of their cistern (bladder), suddenly strong pain occurs; and various apparent spasms affect the area below where urine is discharged, due to intestinal contents being expelled through it, which requires treatment.
In some cases a part of the intestine protrudes through the cavity and is called an enteric hernia herein referred to as "herniation.

Moreover strictly prohibited by customary laws."

The inclusion here reflects cultural belief

When the second one (likely referring to another object or element being held back) is retained by the patient's body, you must command the witch that holds it in place and perform this turning away actively; hold your hand tightly over their mouth and nostrse, so if for some reason she does exit suddenly, be ready.
If not, then take a piece of flail and pierce through the covertly made hole therein; pause where that burning plant' extrudes its fruit (i.e., when it bursts open), accompanied by calamus and ruda and anise and camphor and clove spices.

If this treatment is not to be abandoned, then command the midwife that submerges her left hand in sesame oil or millet meal paste, and inserts it into his/her navel where you want, holding down one finger of hers with yours as he has already found. If she's also bound to him by a thread (possibly for contraception), then insert that thread there too along with the left hand inserted in her belly button; when both have been placed and it seems effective, remove them little by little outwards until they are removed completely so mother does not get detained hard. Based on my understanding of these languages (Latin-based and similar ones), here's a rough translation for each line, although please note that due to the archaic nature of language in historical texts such as medieval
The translation for this line would roughly mean: "If the mother's mouth is constrained, we have recommended treatment with starvation and medical care from plant drugs." In a historical or medieval context, such advice might suggest that if there was an issue related to breathing (possibly due to obstruction in some way) implicated by having one’thy 'mouth,' then interventions would be
The translation of this complex line from the medieval medical treatise could be interpreted as: "If not all causes recommended are external, guard that you do not fanatize over it in endless abstraction; however, if something ingests into a woman's mouth lies within her belly (as with an intestinal worm), then wrap and take this remedy daily for several days until dissolved. This suggests practical guidance on how to address certain medical conditions like parasitic infestations of the digestive tract, emphasizing observation over excess theoretical pondering. The use of 'cristeriza' here likely refers to a specific treatment regimen which may include dietary adjustments or possibly an enema ('tetra-farmacocon').

Of healing for those ulcers that come upon us.
The ulcers that occur in the lower section of the navel and on one side or within a portion, which originate from behind or below:
When it is a fistula or abscesses (with "fistula" meaning an abnormal
When that connection is ancient and conducts moist warm or syrupy vapors (with "poyridure" referring to a type of mucus discharge), and some of these cysts have perforations through them, it's indicative of an old humoral imbalance within the body.
Those penetrating things that they are afraid of due to their exit and intoxication; some even resort to the purgative for those ailments, which makes them suffer from these issues.

And when the forked (or double) duct penetrates into the belly and does not further enter therein, it is that you insert your thread hereinto the belly, and introduce a subtle needle or iron into the fistula where there's no obstruction.
If in that state of tightness the substance enters underne extricable lead or fur within which you feel the attempt or touch, then:
If you do not feel that at all nor proceed from any cause of indigestion or dysentery, then as we have said before, understand that it is non-permeable, and thus attend to your care.
When the fistula penetrates into the bladder or the vein of that person, it signifies their need for urine extraction from there and its prevention so that the location can be considered part of medicine and thus solidified in treatment.
May it enter into the juncture of the thigh or within the bone and infuse pain throughout the circuit; if such penetration does not occur smoothly within the bone, causing more pain in that part where force is applied immediately afterward (in this medical treatment), for which ointment has no effectiveness here nor can it be solidified.
In all those perforating cures is not complete healing, and the treatment of these by doctors requires toil and fatigue among their patients whom they must firmly bind up.
When not potent and ineffective, healing by iron is hoped for as per your recommendation, and that which has already been done will proceed furthermore.

When the cause is to administer one of three medications: or that which cauterizes it where we have mentioned; or when heated inside until its cavity has been restored for you to be able to insert and treat with what was said before, so as not to injure those contained within, ensuring treatment over the abdomen in accordance with patient's willful desire, and that any ulceration present can also be cauterized here using a similar tool; then take care of yourself by performing restoration on all parts inside it where you may work through crusting. And if poultice applied outside does not consolidate (heal), or the fistula protrudes in the buttock part, and pus leaks out due to gout as directed previously; then address these issues accordingly with sharp instruments for acute extremities like knives, lancets etc., following what was stated earlier. And in some cases the fistula is healed according to this method: when you insert a thread into the fistula, it penetrates through its extremity and reaches both the navel area and at the back of the abdomen surface layer by layer with said thread as follows:
And insert into that faithful covering of fields or enclose them, and try to insert the flesh within the forked part where continuation of their condition occurs.
May if it penetrates into the margin of the anus, then you cut out that foreign object which you have inserted into one's rectum; and extract its end part, adjusting both ends accordingly, applying each day or two until possibly when said object is encased within those flesh tissues wherein are located between the extremities (ends) of the fingerstick.

May if the orifice of the fistula is not penetrant, then you must force it to open by whatever means are prepared for this purpose, so that nothing can enter inside and heal within; apply therein whatsodictates have been specified for its cure.
The shape of the spine is what causes a fistula: its curve is sharp and the other division is not sharp, therefore it's unnecessary to insert anything when needed sometimes.
From the seam of hemorrhoids where blood flows in that part.
Here comes the first sentence to translate: Excrements are expelled twice daily, some of which seem as if they were from grain, and those appear similar to fatty substances. From those small and large joints derived from the same times and are one, these muscles (or limbs), which lie on both sides of it (the body or torso).
Even if there are openings at the patient'thy buttocks due to minimal moisture in these places, where clear water flows or a small piece of sanctum blood continues constantly and according to the color of their body,
And the treatment of that which has been inserted into her colon is to command the malady (the disease or imbalance) to settle and express itself within where it ignites and humors appear before you. Now you bite and clamp your tongue with the part of your tooth that is used for biting, and then proceed to strike those teeth where necessary on their gums.
May if the knives are not tightened in those places due to their moistness, then take a rough linen cloth or a heated iron and press them there; also dust some ash particles on top of your incision for they will be at that spot where you cauterized. Or cauterize them according as the procedure has been done in this book of treatments. Return that sickness with care so it is cured within whatsothy are taking as treatment, or in other words, ensure proper healing through the treatments being administered.
If the belly does not resist excretion, then crush it with pestles in which small biting is applied and wash it with the water present in the colon that provokes expulsion during evacuation of the bowels when the malady (likely constipation or obstruction) presses.
If the hemorrhoids are outside the anus, then their cause is humidity and dampness; it'thy that you grasp those with your finger or tongue, insert them back in place, and apply care to these so they may heal as have been mentioned here.
And for those who cut deeply (incisions), following this method as described here: take up the thread and insert it into that needle while bringing out the swellings on top of them; then, inserting another part through the eye of said needle, wrap around the outside parts with this filament immediately after withdrawing from the needle's hole—laterally; initially repair (stitch) the injured area. Also apply some force to that thread and remove it carefully as needed while working on these swellings located at various body sites above, ensuring a precise stitch lateral orientation for initial closure of tissue injury.
When all is absorbed and only that one not being removed, let the excess of the blood from that flow outwards.
And place your hand over the belly, dipped in oil or cloth; and put it on top of the colon to command the humors inside to stop flowing. Return that which is within the box and when it has expired, care for those inside with linen or other medicinal treatment contained therein until they are healed.
When such wounds are incurable and beyond the scope of that medicine, you must apply those poultices with artemisia or your own salve within them to make them moistened and housed by what flows outward from below (pus), which prevents their consolidation; and take care for these when they have become congealed.
When you hold those areas that were violently rubbed and are now scraped, ensure they are healed properly.
Understand that this is not standard Latin but rather a mix of medieval medical terminology influenced by various Romance languages: Italian and Spanish elements combined with some archaic or regional vocabulthy which could be from Old French, given the historical context when these types of treatises were common. Here's an attempt at translation into English line by line:
Now when it is discovered that the fluid has entered into the loop of the joint and is lodged between the bones or within an abscess (the fornixes/uncial cavities), and has been eradicated from its source, take care of it hereafter.

In terms of the instruments used for administering medicines (assuming 'administer' refers here as in medical administration, which may not be entirely accurate due to language barriers):
As for the instruments used to administer medicines: Some are made of silver or alloy/coated with tin and lead; others are small sizes correspondingly appropriate based on what is being applied (smaller ones are designated for treating children), while those intended specifically for adults who suffer from ulcers, tendernces should be used.

Here come the causes for which movements are painful due to worms present with leeches in their treatment bed or because of slipping out from spaces (or escarpments), or striking against a staff, sword, axe, or saddle—all things related to these movement-causing reasons.
May the humors that are present in the body'se places such as head (the crown/head), chest (breastbone), back (spine), abdomen, waist, and extremities resemble worms crawling upon them, similar to those found within the members.
E you recommend a cure for some diseases, in order that the pause and reasoning over those other illnesses can be made.
When you eat simple diseases (likely referring to digestive issues), but remember the complexities of these illnesses will arrive at the mealtime in third-period capital letters, indicating that certain symptoms or complications may become noticeable during this specific time and should be monitored closely.
So when you have a simple headache that is not due to fracture, consider if it' extrinsic from the bedpost or phantom; then press and massage your forehead immediately without delay, removing any cause preventing bloodletting on top of such swelling. Extract as much venous (blood) as possible thereafter according to its quantity unless no obstacle forbids further bleeding, mostly if that portion is the one where you are suffering from pleurisy and it's scarce in amount.
When a fracture occurs in the opposing parts of the affected area, and care must be taken to prevent filling (re-injury) from foods rich in moisture or heavy substances like meats.
May if from careful examination you find no cause at all, then it reduces intake of food and does not approach meat or drinks.
When pressure is applied over the gangrene, if you heat it with oil or wine in which it fits tightly, do so carefully.

If the air has changed its state, place a cloth inside while it is being healed.
May it be if the child is large or due to ignorance of spacing and appearance, and their lips are not properly adjusted for puckering as recommended by the stitching instructions they receive; then adjust those parts accordingly.
May it be that the child has been discovered between bone and flesh, but not restrained by him alone with a small suspensor; then attend to that which was found, administer medicine as needed for its repair in place of fracture (bone), using things like cabbage leaves and figs where there is swelling: such must be prepared within the bounds.
If decay occurs in the spine and does not attach to the bone, then you cut off all this putrefied substance and extract its fluid, with care taken for it.
May if in these plagues the artery or vein through which blood flows is not cut off by medicine, then you should examine that vessel; and if it has been damaged but not severed, you will cauterize there with a sponge or lint (or both), whereupon you must cause to suffer so much as necessary for healing.
If these plagues are simple and small, then their cause is the humidity or dampness; here you must sprinkle this dust upon them so that once the air changes those will be consolidated.

When one uses only caution without having your current remedies and essence of dragon at hand,
And now this operation takes place on the great humors when they have been paused upon them and are still fresh from their passages through which air has not yet disturbed them.
If the air has been altered, and mostly in summer time, it is not understood that you are at this place of dust protection, hence take care of those which we have mentioned earlier; do so by resting on these special powders or stopping over parts made from flour mixed with water and honey inside them to apply poultice—and look after those healing treatments until they recover.

When foul breath comes from the bowels (implying bad or rotting stool due to an infection), there is no difference in medicine between it and when such condition occurs within the head; both are simple cases for treatment, as per medieval medical understanding. The text implies that diarrheal diseases with foul breath could be treated similarly whether they present in different body parts (the
When the nerves of the colon are involved or an artery is affected (implying potential bowel obstruction, inflammation, or other serious gastrointest07352_instructions)-then it's not just about urgent care but rather preventative treatment involving water that causes strong pus formation. Administer such remedy with herbs and simples as they are useful for the nerves and against this condition, thus following a traditional approach to managing serious complications associated with colon issues during medieval times; herein lies not immediate surgical intervention but natural healing methods aligned with humoral theory (using plant-based treatments). No pressure is exerted on any cause of total madness; for the substance of nerves continues in it and settles in the brain itself which holds all its members together.
If water is needed for the healing of base illnesses, then some washing with either scented or unscented oil can be applied along with other stones and pebbles as directed by this method, and ointment on rheumatic joints.

If you have already immobilized the vertebrae of the spine or all, and thus saved the veins in the neck, then adjust your lips to be sewn over the bone's surface without touching it; thereafter realign that area according to its natural shape, securely fasten with sutures. Leave for several days until healed. And maintain this treatment as long as swelling and excitement are present within what is immobilized so that recovery may occur.
May you if the child already has pain in their bones, then strike that area immediately; and if there are fragments of bone within them, remove as much as you can from those pieces. And if it is not possible to extract these with hands alone, let water enter where the child'thy flesh resides so they may become cleaned out (implying purging or cleansing through natural means like drinking fluids).
If it is a new case, then crush over that powder which has been recommended for you. May it be that if in the patient there is an abscess (fistula), then treat that which will remember to come back into its own cavity, within their head (capitol).
If it is a percussion of lance or cottle, and sometimes the depth changes, then often when the bubbling occurs in the patient's abdomen, remember that these are signs of wind entering the intestines; know that this fluid (bubbles) indicates death.
If there is no depth and the putrefied matter has entered its sanctum within you since morning's first hour of polishing (first-hour bath), then pause in that place where it enters your body, so that none of the sank remains trapped deep inside this location and returns to the heart; perhaps a greasy ointment applied here will ward off these advances for today.
If the ointment is not at your disposal, then rest in the sweating place of the swine farm until some water comes from the humidities; and make sure that gout (the disease) sleeps on top of the mud so that flows downward the aqueous substance already adjusted in it.
May it be that even if the patient has passed through three days or more without worsening of malaute spasm, tremor of a diseased heart, or strictures in their bowels (plagua), then you will use the other good measures available to them. Then take care of this person with healing cupping and treatment for whatever else is needed until they are cured.
If the healing of it is forgiven and has been long observed, then you wisely know that a fistula (a chronic wound or abscess tract) forms; therefore attend to this with your own judgment/carefulness.
If the swelling is due to a fissure or rupture of space and it appears simple on the surface of the skin or back, then cure that which has been preceded by suture if large, or apply powder if small.
May there be pain in the bone already and now your sharp tools have opened these wounds for extraction if they are separated. If they are not separated, let them be laid down as flies are dragged out; their extraction becomes easier in this way.
From other accidents affecting other body parts, health recovery is dependent on what we have discussed here.
From "the diseases of the abdomen.
The discomfalte (disposition) within which you find yourself in your belly is either great, little, or wandering.
Here is the line by line translation of the medieval medical treatise into English:
And so the best interruption is that which comes hereabouts, for in this place it is difficult to reduce the hernia, as with any of the specialties discussed thus far.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: E sapias che la sutura dell'addome è secondo quattro maniere, magari le suture vengono eseguite comuni come quelle per altre malattie del corpo.
When two other stitches communicate with each other or themselves in the abdominal (stomach) stitch, perhaps even more internally within their own seam.
When you recommend each one of your explanations and declarations.
Therefore say that when the child is small and suffers from some cause of distention (of the intestine), it becomes difficult to reduce this condition; either because of its diminutive size or when swelling occurs in the intestine due to cold air.
When the fluid is ascending (coming up), at that time when you cut and immerse a moist cloth in water alone, or squeeze it into water wetly with herbs like celandine, and spikelets/thorns of nettles immersed in this liquid to keep inside the inflamed part.
And when dipping occurs in this way where there has been a puncture, it is better than water alone for the resolution of inflammation.
So when the inflammation is resolved, then you moisten the intestine in which it has been elevated with water and vinegar; this allows for easing of the patient' extraneous matter caused by a small cause.
If it is possible to release the interior from this treatment, then divide the rupture into small parts with an instrument that has been previously inserted in her ears (note: there seems to be a potential error or confusion here as "ears" are not typically involved in treatments for conditions described. It's likely referring instead to inserting some kind of therapegy device).
The initial text translates as follows in English line by line:
From the tool, its form is taken into consideration.
The one sharp division, and the other not acute, and the subtlety, which is not the subtleness of bone - both are blunted by a few.
And when the swelling is increased and comes out of its place (the intestine or hernia), it'se better that its reduction be according to its natural form in its proper location, if possible over there, four times better than elsewhere.
When the disruption is wide and occurs in the lower part of the belly, then make sure that you spread out the prolapse over their two thighs, placing cushions on top so that your head rests upon them; if it's below the abdomen, place a pillow undernethy head and arms.
If the disruption is in one of the parts of the abdomen, then halt your understanding and consideration immediately so that what lies within can be pushed out without interference from you.
And when you attend to large abscesses and swellings,
In minor pains, pause what you have prepared for treatment and make the minister (medical practitioner) between your own hands present; this thumb holds all disruption in its palm, adjusting lips' positions accordingly while providing care to where sutures are needed due to some cause within or outside.
Here is the line-by-line translation of the medieval medical treatise:
Here comes the first source sentence translated into English line by line:
When needles move between tightness and subtlety, the small ones penetrate flesh; large ones find it hard to pass through bone, hence why they may enter in delicacy or bulkiness.
When the needle is inserted into any of the patient'thy thighs or other areas provided for comfort, to ensure that flesh does not separate and lice do not burrow underneath their consolidation (recovery).
And ensure they are not sewn for too long so that flesh is not prevented from healing properly.
Here comes the first source sentence translated into English line by line:
These surgical needles are carefully placed in the small wounds for them to heal properly; it is enough that either a single needle or two (perhaps tied together) be used therein for suturing those wounds.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
When the needle has entered these four extremities, reduce the needle of that portion from which you are extracting it, to ensure that the wound cavity below rises up to where the clean cloths (for suturing) lie stretched out, so that the stitch is as good a second dressing with those clean clothes.
When there is a pause between any one of the stitches in that part, it refers to the thickness of the body' extraneous matter being sewn together with threads or linens through surgical procedures (
Here comes another translation: This stitch knows about humans. It might imply that each practitioner has a deep understanding
This suture has taken care of the impaction within a man' extraneous matter lodged in his stomach, which was caused by larger than normal accumulation (probably referring to gallstones or similar blockage). The foreign material had been present for over twenty-four hours and required intervention with cautery tools located two palms away from the patient’s navel – implying a degree of dislocation in both bile flow within that area, as well as possibly some internal bleeding. Consequently (and accordingly), you have reduced what had been protruding through this hole formed by gallstones for over twenty-four hours since it became the site from which foreign material entered and caused blockage or disruption in both bile flow within that area, necessitating its removal to restore health.
And in the spaces of fifteen days or thereabouts, they have been consolidated and healed for it, with bleeding allowed by motion to move out over time, becoming integrated into their conditions.
E the other doctors had not healed; and by a miracle of fire, they could no longer cure that wax in the place where it was neither being burnt nor treated with any medicine, perhaps even after two visits per day immersed in honey water within the flame.
May you direct two kinds of stitches according to what is narrated in Paragraph.
When you begin with stitching of the navel, and insert the needle from the divided front to the back portion,
And when the needle enters into the coccyx and that portion of the body where it was previously inserted, hold its end in the hollow of which you have entered with the needle; make the other tip penetrate from one part to another between the extremities of my patient.
When you have felt that penetration, then make another such penetration in the extreme end of each limb from where it was previously inserted to its current position; and withdraw the extraction site within this area so as for the needle not to protrude outward.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: When your entry point enters into that cavity at the end of the limb where all of it goes inside,
E begins from this side of the body and draws that out to its extreme, pinching with a needle at the navel which penetrates, thrust it into that same navel and downward along the extremity on the other side opposite here; then remove that very one inserted in there.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: And here you apply another poultice and bring it into contact with whatever is needed, according to that which has been applied previously as an example for your treatment approach.
The sum total of this suture procedure is that you make stitching with fine linen where the fur grows, sewing it along the part of the limb extremity (presumably referring to a joint or area requiring repair), and leaving another such length while the wound heals.
May the second special kind of suture that Gualia dictates and is spoken by him for himself to perform is such that he sews up one half as much as his physician does when caring, adding all parts together into their appropriate division in nature; and they apply another part from themselves and mirror it onto each other'dictated portion.
When you hold the needle at your appointed spot on the departed part, and make that pierce into that portion of it therein located, and turn over the needle to have that penetrate from forepost backward through those two extremities of the cistern; here is how:
When those joints are rotated and cold humors permeate the divided parts within their respective cavities at both ends of the limbs opposite to each other in relation, it signifies an imbalance that needs attention from a healer.
This stitching is better than ordinary sewing and it's the kind of which memory recalls its use.
This is the discourse of Guiliel or Guillaume (Gualia being a variant spelling).
Might you lubricate the intestines with oil using two needles to make an entrance for this other thumbtail that must enter into these same stitches which are sewn together on their chests, allowing entry through one of them made by your hands (the inserted thumbnail).
When you understand that a disturbance occurs in the abdominal area of the womb (uterus), then it is much more difficult to sew than elsewhere in the belly (abdomen).
May the remedy of medicine for sickness be judged by other illnesses.
The cause is when you continue the recent plague nearby as it changes that area of its body (humors), returning the intestine and hernia to their cavity while holding pressure on that skin tissue, preventing further discharge or spread:
If the air has altered the humors and they have gathered on that area where you are currently inside, causing painful pus formation in those fields; then take care of it as for other diseases within which one is healed.
May you not have the medicines present at this very moment; however, place them where they are now for it to begin restoring flesh and blood, provided that healing starts today with what is currently available between us as we teach one another, until he becomes healthy again. At which point there will be no need for other medical interventidero medicaci
May you fear that the vermin communicates in injury to the principal members? Then submerge wool in warm or vinegar oil and apply it where between the angles of joints, there are beds for pus (abscesses). Here is how each line translates:
If there is pain or putrefaction in your intestines (budels), they will worsen day by day, and if the obstruction has reached its cavity (the opening within the hernia) it causes sharp pains that tightly grip you, mostly when the protrusion enters into this space.
Be aware that what is from a thick intestine heals better than what is within the small intestines; this means more substantial issues tend to be resolved with time, while smaller ones recover quicker.
It is difficult for the intestine being called "gout" to receive healing from seed (medicinal herbs) within its cavity; and this difficulty arises due to:
May it be that what you proceed from the dirt is fabric and obtain such fresh material by which you reduce those swellings on the thighs according to your skilled handling of them.
If space has passed and black fluid has been drawn out there, then stretch that faithful hand over the place where it was discolored to allow the flow of sanction (blood), which in the fabric (tissues) are veins and arteries.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
Remembrance of illnesses when they occur in the intestine.
When there is a disruption in the intestine and it's small or petite, it may be restored to its cavity with water for percussion on the lancer blade, which was lodged painfully deep within one'thy stomach area, consisting of old age (or decay) fetus/abscess formation through fistula that involves medical handling and wind movement.
And now you apply the treatment to him that was not confirmed in his healing and where health is restored and located; may it cease subtly within this focus of curing and location stabilization.
E you have already secured the location firmly, placing pressure on the thigh that experiences an intrusion of evil within their abdomen; and it does not happen to them by chance but due to this evildoing accident which overflows into their digestive systems where food is processed and consumed. Additionally, they find themselves in bath or engaging in physical exercise at these times.
And experienced practitioners who when they work with the hernia, as per this method: take large cauteries; and adjust the lips of the patient's body accordingly by placing a plug from these cautions over their lips where it protrudes outside due to mouth breathing; thus, when you place them on top of those plugs, they adhere without dissolving.
Return rest or compression for the first time on and will not cease making additional forms as needed according to the quantity of all swelling.
Return that and its contents within the intestine back to their cavity, and break those attachments inside the belly so that the intestine is healed; do not cause harm to anyone'thy health by any means (the way of mending).
And it may be possible that the intestine is drawn out under subtle force from within which belongs to the patient's animal-like intestine; and you hold its extremity with a thread tied in an anchor, folding over, and wrapping this thread around the same organ. Then take up said thread on fingers or nails (and another for legs), detaching fleshly parts of these threads as they come out, inserting them into needles/pins at that location to reduce disruption.
This cutting of stitches is not our only means of trust and hope.
If the child is large and wide, mostly if it's in one of the delicate intestines, then do not think that they are ill or needless treatment for all; their natural correction will happen on its own.
Of treatment for hernias and fistulas.
You understand that when a child or patient becomes infirm and develops ulcers and sores without healing over time in any part of the body, everywhere there is universally referred to as an abscess; it calls for our attention (and urgent care).
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
In damp environments, where water collects and becomes heavy (or excessively moist), the humidity dissipates over a few hours. And in some cases this moisture is moved, and it's scanty, heavy, and subtle.
And have shown all those causes and their symptoms are within the realm of medicine in this division.
When you have thus made yourself aware of the treatment for an abscess which is caused by surgical operation, then:
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
And therefore this one among these ulcers that come from the illnesses difficult to heal does not receive care and attention; it requires labor and lack of knowledge.
If there is any depth in the ulcer that does not reach these places mentioned herein and you hope for its cure, and wish to gain knowledge of it, then take iron or silver attempts; if the ulcer afterward straightens out, seek assistance from him immediately.
If the fistula is twisted, then investigate that subtle lead which lifts its soul and causes the curvature of your body' extrication will be required.
If there is an obstruction with horror in it (a blockage or impaction causing severe discomfort), you cannot attempt to communicate over it.
Now apply the poultice for his wounds using these same poultices and let their moisture be absorbed by other such poultices, circulating from them as well.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
When you have stood over all these causes and see them stated clearly, then go to the cure according to your confidence: for you consider it possible that there is an adjacent fistula or in place salty/acidic spot near joints of connection (ligaments), nerve endings, arteries, veins, or any other locations which cause pain and are present.
When it is dried out as directed by the physician of you, and held that which is infiltrated therein due to decayed or corrupted flesh, whether born within the body itself, or from parts and semblance, and cures whatso extricable then.
May it be that the fistula is of deep ingression and secondarily sealed, so you must insert therein as much as your arm allows, purify all his rotten flesh with hot poultices enclosed in sharp medicines, and place these within the cavity of the fistula, which you have understood to be iron.
When some cold humors have been inside for a few days that the sharp medicine dissolves all of it in the cavity of the flaccid ulcer,
And restore that which is within waxen substances inside, where healthy flesh lies until it has healed.
If not healed by this method, then you will need to cauterize it as recommended earlier.
May it be that the cause of fistula is arse (anus) and you must certify this matter; if so, inquire about it according to what we have recommended, provided there'dict not any vascular or nervous issue from which a major limb suffers.
May if the bone is discovered and there'thy any decay or blackness, then you must remove it wherein the decay resides entirely; take care of that which embodies inside so as to restore its healthiness.
If the patient is not healthy and has excessive phlegm as usual, then you will understand that you have not yet reached the cure for all corruption; accordingly, attend to this situation carefully and meticulously make an assessment of its nature and purification within it at once, and restore what remains.
And if it heals, eat; but if not, then understand that the corruption is deep within the body and has not yet been addressed, so you must now seek to eliminate that very thing.
If the bone is rotten, or it may be that you can extract it using delicate forceps which I recommend for this purpose.
If you have a stone in the bones, then carefully extract all of them without causing any damage to your strength.
May you encounter any contrary cause of the moistures, and in their ignorance have not fear or mistake; hereby inspect those ligaments or bones that are present herein, and break them apart.
If you are not prepared with the bones of your hour (chest), then place it on the bed that moistens this wetness and keep what is liquid, so as not to solidify; ensure also that the section which has been marked out in your operation remains intact.
Having feared, place your hand over the pot (cauldron) submerged on top of it for three days or in an Egyptian casket, or among some other fumigants they use when those bands tighten and their bones are separated by abrasion.
May it be that there is also a large bone with the thigh or hipbone (or something similar to them), and when from here you have rottenness in your face just enough so that you can remove that roteness for as long, only then will they turn away their flesh downwards until such time where it's sheltered against further deterioration, at which point restoration of the body begins.
May it be that what has been damaged from within is a great part of the body and that damage has already reached the bone marrow; at this point, it becomes necessary to close that area wherein corruption arrived, ensuring everything contained therein remains fixed inside as healing occurs.
And recommend that you bring water into the patient'se thighs so as to simplify and assist in your operation.
Once upon a time (at an unspecified age beyond "xxx" years), to which now suffers pain in his groin, and of the disintegrated parts is material that enters into the groin itself where it becomes its own great abscess; this matter does not come from outside.
And now the fever has spread because of doctors' error inside it, and materials have been dragged in; its treatment focuses on where the fistula is located until a cushion-like focal area forms within which all hands are working diligently to drain out pus and moisture.
And after several years of treatment by doctors, not in these fluids but within the body' extrinsic healing is reached.
And the cushion of it and the materials that flow from it, all through a great channel within the body; and already the patient'thy flesh was entirely saturated with this yellow liquid, its hue being lemon-colored (citrine).
Now insert the cauterum into one of those orifice and ensure that it reaches the bone, placing the cauterum in contact with the bone.
Return and examine quickly those preparations for all parts of the change,
And then I cut and incised into one of those orifices within which I discovered a piece of bone, whereby I disarticulated it, and already was crushed and decayed and degraded; moreover, there existed corrupted flesh within that cavity through which something had penetrated.
And when you find what has been discovered about my bones and prepared by it,
And if it is that bone was not in the body but rather this degeneration which had already been cut off and sealed away, you have indeed removed it (or performed an amputation).
Return your hand for the restoration of the patient' extrication by conservative medical means over long periods has not been solidified (or fully achieved).
Return and investigate further on the second bone over the first discovery found above it upon arrival here, continue to observe for deterioration of these joints.
When I find that the water appears from that corruption of his body, and fresh meat has been performed for him as treatment and restoration, but it is not restored yet.
And now you discover another way and carefully insert the bone piece by piece, restoring what remains of it, until inserted entirely into one palm'dictum (measure), extracting that part from its marrow, and restore it with medicine; thus consolidating fracture healing.
It is not necessary repetition in the operation of lying and sitting unless for the disposition of the humors inside her body and their reduced tolerance or fear of death, as she tends to overindulge during involuntary defecation episodes throughout all hours.
So heals it entirely, and nothing is within the hard bones; good fortune lies in his disposition of himself inside his body, returning its vitality; conversed among themselves without causing him discomfort during walking or harm from any cause.
May if the bone protrudes in the joint and you have grasped it using this method: hold that second limb with a strong cord, command your assistant to stretch out that part of the bone therein; use a thick rope from the first one applied on the body tissue where said bone is located. Extend that flesh so as to bring each segment back into place and then remove it for cutting at the designated spot without leading any piece astray.
When you raise a staff or tabletop for opening the mouths properly, it is allowed when not using a saw that does not corrupt the flesh of the body.
When the saw is applied to the area that has been gradually crushed, if it appears in the cavity of decayed bone and not at its initial manifestation, then use another tool on it as well.
If the bones are decayed and not prominent, it is one continuous division of itself or in that place where its ruin occurs; thereupon you must pause (and wait), and grasp whatso extricates all parts at once: and if this first cutting reveals the corruption within those two divisions continuing to each other, then take up a saw for removal.
If it is a small wound at the location of decay that we have discussed so far, then...
If there is a deformity in the joint, cut out that distorted joint and continue cutting from where it connects to the other parts.
If decay is in the continuous flow of joints, it is not by reason but due to humors.
If the corruption is in the chest or the foot, it'thy difficult; however, when you seek out wherein said misery appears to thee and abrade that place as thou knoweth possible according to any manner which may be within thy power, thereupon shall correction hereby made unto thyself provided thou do not invite pain into body or nerve.

From the joints of limbs and bone interlockings.
The extremities are swolthy or due to internal/external causes, or if after treating that corruption with these remedies does not relieve it, and the corruption itself departs from a limb of which you touch but find no cause, then insert your hand into that body part wherein the malady escapes so as not to let putrefaction proceed beyond death or greater harm due to excessive bleeding.
And the name of that person, it is because their limb has been cut and set on fire until its blackness was burned away by the flame, or if you pour oil into the wound within this body part wherein they have suffered injury, causing pain throughout the whole body; therefore, bind tightly to them.
If it is caused by the concussion of some poisonous causes, like from sea serpent (scorpius marinus), black bile (humor veneficus or melancholthy/depression - veneres urae if maleficia humoralis refers to this condition as related to excessive black humor in the body) or ergot (rubeola vulgaris, which is a fungal disease that affects rye and can lead to painful
If the concussion or damage occurs at the end of the limb (extremity), you should incise the wound and do not leave spaces for decay to enter into it, thus preventing further contamination within the body.
When you reach the heart (the seat of emotions and vitality), then cut out that part from within where rot or decay takes place in the fireplace of the chest, so as not to give space for corruption therein while it burns away.
If that individual enters into your arm at the joint, then you should enclose it within the cud (which refers to a swolthy or sore area).
If another occurs along with the decay and times I send it to the thighs, then in that case is death of the humors; administering other causes for cure depends on quantity of vitality.
When there is a disorder of the foot that causes its deterioration, then insert it into one of the nuts (possibly referring to using a splint or bandage for support).
If one climbs up a slope of the foot, then cut through it entirely on the foot. May you enter into the region of discharge (likely referring to an area where fluid is leaking from within), then incisions are made on the cushion inside the joint'dictum (the specified point or zone).
If decay has already reached the abdomen (denolu), it is not an infection but expulsion of humors from within, and lead to death due to this condition known as gout.
Here comes the first source sentence translated line by line into English:
When cloth is wrapped around the entire body so that it does not touch the affected area and allows for proper drainage of the set wound (aspiration), this will help in healing, as stated by our doctrine.
If you wish to stop the flow of sanctus when working on it, then cauterize the location where it was cut out immediately, and place some grains restraining its flow; return your healing practice within which this has been done.
Return its injured part back in line with ligaments and tendons, and take care of it so that it heals properly.
And advise them to enter their home through the sole of their foot, this accident that you recommend for which they have come here occurs due to cold and darkness assembled at the fireplace within their house.
And when that corruption initially occurs within your body where you hold all of it, then attend entirely to the entirety of the foot.
And then that home prepares for themselves to go towards the body part where it is agitated with pain and dryness from within, insert their finger into the joint connection, apply pressure there, leading to healing.
Once it has occurred with that physician in this matter of mine advice.
And now I am affected by it and so have been forced to reflect upon that excessive water which is held over the body' extrinsic part; restore cleanliness of the external parts, for this surplus does not affect again where else but back into these internal areas.
And now you are asked to insert the hand into it (the cavity), and do not wish to perform any actions that might arise from there due to its excessive nature; for when the malady of the womb is about conception, such intervention may be considered unnecessary or inappropriate.

Of care for the belly and quality of enema administration with medicine.
When an abscess is present in the patient's carbuncles and the space of the abscess extends within until collection forms a sickness, it breaks down and perforates; this illness affects the body (and has spread), so treat with water as if applying ointment previously used. Do not damage bone or nerves nor ligaments while holding hands—this is called an aspiration without any rupture of cystic structures, without fistula formation.
Even if spaces are extended within where infection spreads to any part of the body, it is then called a fistula and will not go away by itself.
Here comes the first source sentence for translation: And its treatment is to insert that thong wholely as you turn it, mostly when it slips and falls like a cloth, ensuring it does not stick due to decay.
May you hope that the belly will stick together and that this impairment has not occurred due to any previous action, where there is pressure on the belly, then take care of it with a cleansing enema (clister).
When you consider the belly (abdomen), and if it is large, and this band holds inward fragrance from Egyptian medicine made of oil, wine, and honey that are taken parts to be used with water for dressings, they are adjusted into a vessel within which the medicament becomes formed and travels down into the delivery site (likely referring internally), where melody is sent.

If the malady does not tolerate Egyptian medicine or ashes of charcoal water, then cleanse that with its own waters and honey mixed three times, and similarly wash it with viletta (water) and honey mixed together; for the property of honey is to purify and cleanse, and mostly when saturation has been exhausted in terms of moisture content.
When you have done some washing and find that the belly has become distended, then cleanse that which makes it swell to relieve the body in this place.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: And if wax drips and dissolves that oil, or you administer some medicines and ointments they already have properties in their treatment within the intestinal tracts; what do you apply this fluid with?
If the flow of urine in which it is not received through the catheter has stopped (presumably referring to a medical situation where there's difficulty or stoppage with bladder irrigation), then you gradually increase that small amount, pausing each time covered by Egyptian ointment or honey wax envelope until amplified.
If the catheter is large enough, then you will attach the lips of it and fasten with as much quantity in which they insert into the rectum where they place their addition.
If the fluid of which circulates in his limbs is elevated above where it currently resides so that the limb can flow back into its position, when the limb is compressed within the curve of the body (where flesh has been generated), then:

When someone is above (or upon) the navel area, it causes pain throughout in any moment because of what has been adjusted or positioned on their belly button. To know if what flows from below your belly is good or poor in nourishment, or indigested.
When you thus contemplate that location wherein it hurts or is inflamed in the patient, and whether there's an abscess present:
When your medical care is prolonged in this manner, and the material placed on the patient' extrications adheres or sticks as such, then you may remove it for three days, and when removing the bandage, change it and renew the ointment.
May if you find the narrowing of sinews allows space for a subtle virus to enter therein; do not despair because he clings to it—healing will occur in those parts where fat tissue accumulants generate over time, and on which pain occurs. Here come bodies of flesh that grow excessively (possibly leading to obesity or other related issues), causing discomfort during feverish periods when sickness manifests itself; these are the areas affected by your ailment.
If the belly'seeks ease and rests inward for days on end, you know that it does not adhere; but if its lack of attachment is prolonged due to indigestion, then adjust with medicines aimed at drying them out, which are saturated both by their own essence and virtue. If these remedies themselves become wet in the process and find a place for additional application when overdone dressings (ointments or balms) need attending to, treat them accordingly using oil of frankincense along with exudates as necessary at that moment while they are being applied excessively on adipose tissue.
Here is the line-by extraline translation of the medieval medical treatise text:
And when it seems so at that moment, as soon as you have entered and the thing is gripped within (it refers to a procedure or treatment), use this oil; apply perfume and myrrh here too, and mix everything together with dust over the melted substance. Apply these lines on cloth and bandage it above that which has been encapsulated inside where it's engrossed/absorbed (the patient). Use those same layers applied to this melting material; apply them onto linen or wool, placing what you have gripped within over the swelling area.
Here are the translations line by line:
If the swelling persists and does not heal with this treatment, you understand that the corruption is in its origin (source), and now examine bones or hard parts of limbs; already know how to treat fistulas, as instructed by your superiors.
Of caring for suppuration of the palms and nails and incision of fingers, inserted.
Panarici is applying the treatment of which no delay in doing so with its nails on either part (foot or hand), and quickly as well for other reasons mentioned herein; when prolonged care leads to a specialized cauterization intervention, it rots completely, damaging not only that specific area but also all surrounding parts comprehensively. Furthermore, while the decay progresses within its nails carrying an offensive odor inside where they reside and reaching their extremity turning black (color), thus causing pain in said location:
And when you have taken that water which we mentioned in the division and do not interfere with your treatment, then wash off all excess moisture from the wound, and apply hot irons accordingly to this water; for these cauterizations will heal very quickly.
If the bone and unguent (medicinal salve or ointment) are healthy, and the additives of the unguent enter into the lesions to consume them, apply pressure on that small angle of the needle where it pierces the flesh; with this force pushing said substance inwardly towards its target, ensuring healing without causing additional damage. And monitor closely until you see recovery signs within which timeframe treatment is completed—ensuring care for the salve (ointment) during recuperation.
May it be that if there is damage to the bone already in place and you extract it here because none of those times can heal a damaged bone within this context.
If the thigh and calf are moving downwards in this position as remembered by you, then carefully ensure that it is healed inside one of them according to what has been recalled.
May if there is percussion or incision on the tongue and in that intense pain, then when you commence to lance the swolthy part (gonitis), seal the wound with salt applied directly under the skin near the transverse abdominal muscle; thus preventing it from entering into the flesh which has been previously constricted above this point. Hereby causing profuse pain in the inflamed area, due to excessive tightness of the adjusted body cavity over that spot; and take care for there where water yields (i.e., fluid comes out) upon pressure at such place, indicating its need for medical attention.
May adjust it, which is in the muscles of healthy people, as they are tender to touch when full, and also in bones or tendons where there can be pain, holding their hands firmly.

From those who are fat (people with corpulence), the section is tender, and it's your duty to insert that portion into the bed of the spine.
May those who are born at the joint' extrication of healing is difficult; hence keep yourself protected from it.
May those born in this place have their meat inside the bone encapsulated within the mouth and use one of those instruments appropriately to ensure that what is inside remains healed.
Mighty comfort that you provide for the spaces between them caused by their movements or because of birth defects they did not know about themselves, or due to combustion from fire (fever), so much so that those who experience this tightness return these places back into their natural form.

Most likely the cure involves two methods: one is that it should be made clear and drawn out of the black sickness, and the other method is raising the vein and extracting entirely.
The section of the text provided for translation reads as follows in English:
Return that one back (likely referring to an object or patient previously mentioned), and command it/him not to consume foods causing black bile production (which medieval physicians thought could lead to certain ailments).
Repeat the cauterization for varicose veins when they become filled and come up into the groin.
May the elevation of them according to this practice be: you who lift the cushion for their thighs, if in water they exercise their muscles, and place it underwater so that they swell up and the veins become enlarged; or when there is no bath present, enter until the body becomes bruised.
Return the cecum to its position either at the end of the vein in the back or on the sole of your foot where it meets the heel; there you must insert a needle and draw out blood.
Return the intestine (or hernia) within its cavity and place your hand over it where you observe symptoms appearing, which are signs of that pain descending into blackness as time goes by.
When you remove it from under the belly button (belly button), take that white thread back for its string.

The spices of breaks are motions, and their forms are various, the causes being different: for one type of break is caused by impact from a space (likely referring to an injury or trauma), which enters both bones causing pain as if in the handle of a sword, leading this specific cause/type to be named; another time the crack comes through any part of the bone itself and cuts into the flesh without passing inside the shinbone – for such cases we call it lifting out or complete dislocation.
E from these bones breaks it is either large or small, and the break caused by compression or avulsion; due to impact or casting on stone, they appear like this.
This break or foreign object that has already entered the periosteum (the layer surrounding bone), either in the face of the bone itself or within these broken bones themselves; it could be large or small.
When a bone is broken, it is set in the subtlety of the hairline and for this reason that kind of specific fracture called "capillary break".

In the treatment of fracture considerations should be made for wounds related to humoral imbalances; and when these injuries indicate significant distress as vomiting from cholera, extension, loss of understanding, abscess formation, syncope, acute fever, or examination by doctors/prayers concerning those affected individuals—none will heal properly.
If an accident of misaligned spirit you perceive, then you begin healing for them.

Realize that your nose is not broken but rather splintered or dislocated; one bone may have been displaced from its normal position, and this particular piece of the injury consists of cartilage which isn't fractured—merely stretching and twisting. This suggests a possible nasal fracture without actual breakage that can occur when force is applied to the nose area resulting in misalignment or overextension rather than outright breaking, possibly leading to discomfort but not necessarily immediate severe damage as with an open bone fracture (compound).
If one of the bones is broken into parts, then insert a small object into your nose to hold it together at the place indicated by that very toe which has fallen off and gone outside (the body), until you return the nostril according to its natural shape. If it is pain caused by water within you for your ease, then take care that nothing interferes with this operation concerning the patient'thy thighs.

Translation of the given line regarding jawbone breakage assessment: "When the jaw bone breaks and is not shattered into pieces (not comminuted), but rather fractured in one piece, its extent must be evaluated; if so curved at different angles due to displacement ('depression'), it requires careful consideration.
Even then, if the break is in the seventh part (thigh), insert your left tongue into the mouth of the malady; similarly, if it's a fracture on the right mandible, insert that indicator from the seven parts there; push with this instrument to facilitate the breaking down of the fractured bone fragments toward their respective departures, at which point you will proceed.
If the jawbone is separated into two pieces, then cover it with extension of parts according to proper direction so that healing can occur.
If you have pain due to dental issues causing disruption, apply pressure on those parts from which you hope relief will come through the flow of silver or gold (referring possibly to mercury amalgams used at the time), and place your hand over the broken jawbone for a pause. Then take two cushions: one under their legs and another beneath their chest, holding onto their hands continuously so that it is not destroyed during application.
And command the malady (disease) to rest and calmness, and stop it from consuming its food slowly through sucking (as lizards do).
If the figure is swollen in any manner, then you should tighten and loosen that part of it each day; rectify what has already been altered from within by applying salt or albumin (from eggs) mixed with flour made from chickpeas, which will reduce inflammation.

If the fracture is in a young bone (plagua), consider if it has separated or dislocated, and then handle those displaced parts carefully according to where they have been pushed inside during that injury of the joints/bones.
If the poultice applied is dry, then increase it according to your need with wax (flebastum).

Herein lies where one returns posture after bone recovery." This line of medieval medical advice speaks about a specific restorative technique for recovering from an injury, possibly involving hernia care and muscle adjustment following the treatment of broken bones (os). The patient's choices in behavior ('mannerisms') are considered during their healing process. They likely use cushions to support areas like shoulder blades which might be affected by a condition such as a hiatal or scoliotic hernia, and they also take measures with the alignment of muscles around these regions for overall posture correction that should correspond well-known physical therapy practices ('all mannerisms'). The goal is returning to an improved state after healing bones.

When discussing the fracture of coastlines, it is not merely in large areas that such damage occurs; rather, it affects their backbone – essentially referring to significant portions or structural weaknesses ("fractura de las costas"). Moreover, when looking at the extremities (the ends) after a departure from these regions and encountering bodies of water nearby ("per aquo quar so cartillaginosa"), it is not through direct impact with those waters but due to their inherent soft or fragile quality. This could suggest that areas prone to damage might be weakened by factors like erosion I realize now not out of fear for being questioned about these things ("inquisicio"), but rather because I understand the importance and necessity of investigating them thoroughly (“am les ditz”). This indicates a shift from concern over potential scruties
The restoration process should aim to mend the fractures at these places according to what is possible ("manieyra possibla"), and in doing so it must be done carefully (“enguales la restauracio”), taking into account how much time has passed since they occurred – akin to addressing wounds that have had more or less healing room. It may also involve the use of plasters ("emplastre") and splints for any broken bones, following instructions derived from these observations (“indigeys de aquel”). This reflects an approach tailored not only with practical considerations but potentially incorporating wisdom gained through experience or observation as well.
If the backbone fracture is declining towards the parts of detachment, there will be severe pain and piercing sensation as if you are puncturing that which has cried out (referring to the injury), and because of this your clothes may stick to the body; difficulty in breathing occurs along with coughs, vomiting from motion sickness, and all these require difficult care.

If you cauterize the wound on your patient'thy recovery site, then line up linen soaked in olive oil and white wax therein, moving gently between coarse texture and subtlety; place that cloth over the stricture where the apothecary has treated it until healing occurs. Then remove the bandage made of beeswax mixed with crushed clay ashes for plaster preparation, apply pressure bands prepared from these materials to hold down what was previously placed there (the cured limb), which you have secured and strengthened firmly; that is where it will heal.

The hip bone is fractured and it's declared that the broken parts are brought together internally as stated in this section of "Capitol .xiv." (This translation assumes typical usage patterns from related languages; however, without additional context or understanding of specific medical terminology used during medieval times, some interpretive assumptions may be necessary.)
The restoration of the hip bone is performed by tightly binding one ligature over the fracture and another immediately after it, with pressure applied to both patient's abdomen and face (This translation attempts to convey a procedure for immobilizing or stabilizing a fractured femur using bindings. It implies that multiple steps are taken in succession during treatment.)
Extend the minister's ligature to its position upon the broken parts of bone as they lie in place (Here "liement" refers to something used for binding or fixing together – possibly a sling, bandage, etc., and this line describes how it is applied once fractures are stabilized.)
If it is necessary to remove the hip bone (presumably from where there might be an obstruction or for surgical reasons), then extend one of their ligatures along with part of the pelvis and apply another immediately after fixing them, thus extending in that area (This line outlines a protocol likely related to preparation before making an incision – suggesting careful handling is needed when dealing potentially delicate structures during medical procedures.)
If the joint is prone to swelling due to excessive heat or moisture (denolh), then it will be tightened with sinew specifically for this purpose, and its extension will occur in parts immediately.

E introduce long pin between the thigh and the bandage provided by the dress placed on their parts quickly, and turn over the extremities of the pin inserted into the painful part soaked with excess bandage fluid to the position above both leg wraps and cushion.
Return pressure over that joint in the location of that fracture has been applied, and pressure from one stone is placed on the bone at the hip socket area.
Now fill the spaces between the sheet and thighs with moist cloths to ensure that bleeding stops (bleeding).
Here begins the constriction of a tight band around the site of the three or four layers of swelling and as you move away from the location of the fracture, your constriction becomes less strict and wetness is placed more gently.
Return the limbs to their parts until they reach the chest cavity, and tightly bind the limbs of others with ropes from other parts, so that its thread does not stray away from its place.

And in some cases this break of the thigh is strenuous than those that are adjusted with pins, as we have mentioned earlier on our bracelets.
Even in the act of restoration for such a condition does not heal the limpness of the patient; and if it is restored alone, another cushion must be applied to that other area, so that lameness continues from where it was caused initially.
You understand that the thigh is tense for about a month or several days, and all this depends on the variety of complexes and other dispositions.

This medieval text discusses a treatment method for fractures involving specific herbal remedies.

Envelop the cloth over any of these garments as per their length around you, and pause one above the junction between the cushions on each side, ensuring they remain within the base part (most likely referring to a body or limb), holding your hand in that position.

When bone breaks and is broken (fracture), treatment at a healing place or restorative facility takes place:
With this injury to which you have applied your plaster (cast), mainly if the bone in the thigh or adjutant'se hip is large, similar as such for whom you bind and cauterize at once when their conditions of flesh puncture are mentioned by them.
If the patient faints, then you must hold them so they remain in place until their breath returns and there is no other cause for this condition.
When beginning to repair the fracture on that day, do not extend it unless an ulcer develops.
May you apply cauterization if there is an ulceration present; afterward, let the restoration of it occur within one day, provided that the ulceration yields to treatment by then, and not until the third day onwards will we subject them to ill fortune.
May it come to light that if the bone is fractured above the navel and you must perform reduction, then do so for ease of your hands and a little extension thereof.
May it not be your preparation and the position of the patient are in their throats, at that time reduce what is already there with yours; this joint made of iron has a length of seven or eight digits (fingers) long, its width corresponding to the size of the clay used by you for such repairs. Therefore, it' extraneous preparation and position necessitate your physician to remove these three or four times according to what is required in their care during bone fracture healing.

Movements are gently applied to this joining in the healing site of a fracture, mostly at joints, and carried out by you (the practitioner), shaping the figure of the body; firmly preventing the limb from its normal movement.
And consider whether the binding is recent; administer to them medicines that have tightened their joints today and yesterday—and hereinafter we mean leeches (for bloodletting), wine, honey, linseed oil (or similar remedies) for those who take some or all of it. Apply this poultice on the binding site with straw-stuffed fabric; tighten them there by good constriction—this is how we proceed to treat such cases.
Even the extraction that does not dislodge it for days should be removed carefully; and remove it in turns until the swelling subsides. Or press down on its bone layer with a piece of lead, as this metal has properties to drain out all the fluid accumulated in the limbs.

When the broken bone has been set and restored, Roman law dictates that even gently should one not disturb it again as per its natural course of healing.
When a bone fracture is healed, and the limb sensitive to touch and cold is returned: this pain occurs not for reasons of motion but due to causes such as: excessive lubrication from moisture in ligaments or joints (which prevents nourishment reaching the limb), an overabundance of corpulent substances, unnecessary movements outside their time frame; or spasms and debility occurring within the region between thigh muscles.
Care for the fluid includes draining it from the malady and making the patient's heart tender within so that their sanctity may multiply there, apply washing, and administer gauze and honey on them.

Then when you have decreased the displacement to its place, and if it is delayed in doing so, then a lameness occurs at that point, making reduction difficult due to accumulated fluid (humors).
And so do not cover the patient who has gout or is prostrate during anaphylaxis because frequent movements bring on spasm and pain.
When you acidify the fluid (which likely refers to introducing vinegar or some form of substance that increases acidity), then when you press on the flabbiness of the thigh area and allow it time for restoration, and reduce its swelling with water poultice and oil applied externally; also apply bandaging internally.

The provided text discusses the treatment of dislocated jaws and presents two methods based on severity:
May when the displacement of it is slight, in major movements returns by itself a little.
If the dislocation is entire and complete, then immediately administer reduction for it to not be delayed in total.
The minister holds the patient'se chin, and inserts the doctor's finger of one hand into the gap of dislocation in the jawbone beneath it (if the dislocation is from one side; or if it comes from both sides, they use their two fingers), placing them on those parts where clothing has been removed; he commands the patient to cease movements that could worsen the condition and release any part detached from its place. The doctor then relocates the jawbone back into position until returning homewards (to normal location).
If it is difficult to reduce (the dislocation), and mostly if both jaws are displaced, apply cold water or oil down the tailbone area, so that even reduction of both may occur soon; thus have we said.
And when they return and their thighs are swathed again, with the mouth of the malady not softened but closed over those small pieces of wool on cloth, its cautery made of wax and oil is applied; thus making it easier for them to breatdict.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
And if it is administered easily, and does not touch the mouth of food intake or drinking/sipping, then the jawbone will not become numb nor get sick within that moment when it enters therein.

Regarding the reduction of a shoulder dislocation and injury to the limb' extrinsic muscles, here is the translation:
The fur finally is not dislocated from the loin for its continued presence on the thighs; and some have become dislocated to the back region, which has been stated in feeling.
The restoration of him is that his malady ascends upon his two thighs and extends their sinews. Return that location in your palm with strong compression, and it will return (to normal).
When pressure is applied over that plaster and powder, it becomes hardened there.
May the extremity of that which is between his legs continue there today, and not be dislocated on any day; provided it has been reduced and returned according to what we have said and as per your equipment.
Return the compression on that plaster, and apply pressure, extraction; command the humors to settle down and return into rest until healing occurs.
At this moment of healing in this place, reduction is achieved for the extent of the muscle when it is separated from its location.

As you understand that the muscle is not dislocated but can be in three ways; one way being when it becomes dislocated upon separation from rest or suddenly afterward, this describes how such an injury may occur and points to immediate actions for treatment based on whether a dislocation has taken place.
The second is that it becomes dislocated away from the main body of the muscle, and this requires immediate attention (suggesting urgent care); however, it's not dislocated behind oneself at shoulder level or in front due to nerves – indicating specific locations within which a dislocation might occur but doesn’t necessarily imply an injury. This translation reflects key aspects of musculoskeletal injuries and their immediate considerations for medical attention while differentiating between possible positions where issues may arise relative to the shoulder joint's range of motion influenced by nerve pathways, as per medieval understanding of
Mostly it becomes dislocated and separated from the parts where ligaments are thin or weakened – often occurring in those joints subjected to sudden movements; sometimes also when muscles suddenly contract under stress (possibly indicating an injury due to a contraction). This line outlines typical scenarios for why injuries might happen, suggesting that both passive structures like thinner ligaments and active ones such as struggling with the force of muscle contractions can lead to dislocations – aligning well with medieval concepts where they understood certain body parts were more susceptible due to their anatomical or physiological nature.
And when the limb is acidified by palpation or breaking up, and its muscle is set with applied compression due to displacement already present, apply pressure as needed according to what has been broken apart.
Now that you have cried out because you are overserviced here and the process of healing begins.
When dislocation occurs as it approaches the joints; so that you can distinguish between the displaced muscle and its counterpart; when you bend at the top of the affected muscle where an edge appears due to contraction, and in this area cannot be reduced back into place by any movement or manipulation.
If it is a displacement of the hip or knee joints, and you must apply touch treatment without fear (of hurting more).
When this dislocation occurs and cold affects the malady, then a light reduction takes place when it is cooled down.
The reduction of the swelling is what the minister lifts up from under it to its parts above; and with gentle pressure he applies his hands promptly, raising that joint towards strength in their place, while the minister raises this lifted area back into position gently until return occurs.
May if we have not returned already and accidents occur causing dislocation in days to come, then the swelling of the limp is immersed in tail water and administered with a poultice made from linseed applied along with fennel seeds and honey dissolved in water; it should also be given.

If you wish to perform this second action: and make present a home that is long beyond the malady, and resides within it; insert your muscle quickly into its place touching the malady's tendon swiftly, lifting said tendon upwards inside wherein the malady remains suspended in air, while another servant pulls the ma (presumably a ligament or connective tissue) from beneath his stomach. If the lumbago is loose, then I place that which causes it to be suspended, thus causing serious injury; when this happens, the displaced one returns immediately.

Extend one part at adict times with each hand movement until union returns to its original location by speed alone.
If reduction of him becomes difficult for all the reasons mentioned before, then use this treatment method: grasp a staff with its length equal to two arm'thy and hold it at an angle of four digits from the thumb base, according to this form.

Then tightly hold the pressure points above strictures using fingers or hands, attach these presses to the body's surface and secure it to the chest while maintaining this position for seven days; ensuring that there is no discharge from where you have secured your hand on the skin during those time frames.
When food is briefly paused from the bowels of sickness and rested in such manner that the member feels comforted, then it has been placed on the path to recovery.
And if it is given more substantial food and exercise, then even if it does not soften or relax, it already heals.
May it be that if the joint is dislocated due to humidity or for another reason, then in that case administer three treatments as prescribed in the manual of cautery.
If all this pain is present and the bandage and constriction are loosened for several days, and they become loose again on their limb (meaning that it can be raised above its usual parts), you know well that these nerves of yours, which form either the head or extension/softening part of your muscle, have not been fixed in place.
When joint pain is caused by the dislocation of that which causes it in the legs and chest, reduction (return to place) must be done with forceful pushes and extensions until return.

You understand that the elbow joint is difficult and appears dislocated; it's often completely out of place at all angles, primarily behind where you rest your arm (usually on a support or pillow), and when you adjust the misaligned elbow back into position as dictated by whatever posture has been assumed due to its displacement—that is manifestly apparent. Now that it's realigned in this manner, notice how the joint forms an indentation where previously there was no curvature; consequently, your arm cannot bend at the elbow or touch something related within reach.

If the dislocation is at the joints ahead of us, then return your hand to its position while pressing down on the area where it hits against the sole of their hand.
If the dislocation does not submit to reduction, then apply vigorous extension and strong motion.
When two ministers stretch out their arms, they hold that instrument between them to prevent it from being damaged further by extension.
When you have turned and raised all parts of the arm, place it under the patient' extrication cloth or sling for support.
When the doctor touches the joint, apply some oil to it so that those causes which help in its lubrication are addressed; and then strengthen the joint with forceful massage until returning normal function is achieved.

And let it be loosened; and if the joint is formed in that place, then unloose its ligament there, holding it as desired.
If you see the joint not stiffened, then repeat the plaster and bandage application for several days until it is drawn out; return that as well.
If grief falls upon you for the reduction of the joint and its position is in motion, then apply moist warmth gently and friction delicately until it ascends; if there's a hernia on movement fatty flesh, tie it up tightly here above the joint. Apply this to your bones during day and night. Return that one and immerse the other in bath; when sipping, rub on the joint with warmth from spring water repeatedly as long as there is a rumbling sensation, doing so for this first course of treatment, while also treating it alternately during these courses. Am in bath, enter wherein it is lubricated (or "enter into a warm bath"). The text advises placing someone with gout
Stop over that wet and chafed crack by the water's edge, lean on it, and give it several baths (or "bath"), until it becomes moistened again and returns to its natural state or disposition. The text suggests treating a painful area near water—possibly where leather was once used but has deteriorated into chafing due to wet conditions—by applying rest, pressure by leaning on the spot (perhaps with some body part), followed by repeated baths until it heals and regains its former condition.

When the body has been misaligned and dislocation is present (or "malassen"), its reduction or correction thereof tends to be simpler here ("e·l reduccio de la deslocacio es leugiera"). Nevertheless, caution must still apply even if speed of corrective action at this location becomes necessary immediately after a fall causing an avulsion fracture (or "apostema"), whereby the site is potentially vulnerable to becoming detached or experiencing sudden bone loss ("dent que accida en lu apostemia caut"). The text implies that while addressing misalignments, particularly those related to dislocations at joints between arms and body—likely referring to shoulder girdle injuries due to the context of spinal alignment issues (capitalization may indicate emphasis)—one should proceed carefully. Speed is essential when immediate treatment following a traumatic event that could lead to bone av
The reduction of the dislocation is that you stop the joint between the groin and thigh on a table, and have the attendant extend this area, with the doctor or palm pressing upon the impending juncture to push it back into place.
Mays empero if the palm is resting on her abdomen, then let the hump of the belly be above a table extended and reduced; and if it has been dislocated beforehand must have its position set by that internal so that when the doctor's stomach (referring to the physician) sits over this inherent situation on top of the table, thus preventing the joint from coming together.
And if it returns soon, good be; otherwise, that part will harden and become an ulcer thereon, and you cannot treat nor heal with the reduction of your patient' extrication which takes place over several days.
May the joint according to its curvature; and there is nothing in the belly that causes it, but rather it is soothed and cannot cause any more pain; you know that the nerves are twisted or spasmed, and only when your strength (cautery) is applied directly at this point for healing purposes, do I confer some fluid to aid.
So when they return sickly (malassem), place the dressing that has been applied on them, and bind their wounds tightly for days; also cut off and treat their limbs therein, exergycing their bodies through it day after day.
May it happen that the patient' extrusion occurs and they are laid on water or fire for some days until relieved/alleviated.

Regarding the treatment of dislocations, or joint displacements:
Some days they are dislocated all over the body.
When a joint of those in the two hands or abdomen is dislocated, then he straightens out and pulls back into place until returning (returns it to its original position).
Place support under the head of this person and suspend it from the part where they are dislocated, keeping it like that for two days.

When any of the vertebrae in the back or neck is dislocated and herniated disc(s) have moved to their location (implying they are now protruding into spaces where they shouldn't be), it cannot be cured here, for death has entered the system. This suggests a serious spinal injury with potential life-threatening consequences that may require immediate medical attention beyond standard care within this context.
This sentence implies that when the bowel (or another organ) protrudes into spaces involuntarily and cannot be controlled, it should either soften or mollify your limbs through gentle manipulation; alternatively, if one of their vertebrae is displaced here—meaning a bone in its spinal column has moved out of position—it will continue to move (possibly indicating instability), and consequently the body must address it segment by section. This reflects an old medical practice where careful attention was given over multiple segments for stabilization, suggesting that each part may need individual treatment or repositioning within a systematic approach possibly using manual therapy techniques from times when modern imaging wasn't available to assess such conditions accurately.
Therefore she is swolthy at the back parts and there's no improvement (gelbozitation refers here likely to some kind of inflammation or distension).
May the healing of it be considered if there is a yellow discharge from childhood illness, which in neither case can be cured nor made healthy for all.

And place a straight staff upright on the ground at the end of their leg until it reaches up to your head; another axe placed over the other'thy legs in the opposite end of your body.
The minister holds the staff and does not leave it in a hole; another minister grasps the other by that form.

The doctor places their hands on the spine for strength to return it into place and adjusts them over that table until they are back in position.
May it not return through this manner, then take a table of which the length or width is three fingerbreadths; and insert into the pelvis where we have stated that the malady resides within its extreme point at the location of the inserted table. Return the pillow on the table to the backbone (spine), and let the doctor rest their feet on the other end, beginning treatment so that the spine is compressed and returns to its place.
If you wish to take hold of what has been revolved above the leg; and it is necessary for you to remain on the ground with your head below the knee in both feet (the lengths being a limb's length, and keeping your head at the same level as one foot), then there are two rods that their total length equals a palm. It has already been set up within any of the sticks where movement occurs, and each stopper is firmly placed on earth so it does not roll away.

In the limb there is a disruption in which it forms iron (quenched steel), and in the two other parts, they seem like that one.
Return the sinews that you have stretched in the thigh of the patient to their place and return the sinews that you have stretched between the legs at the groin where they must be placed, holding them there so that your hands do not displace these sinews.
Return each turn and place one minister that tightens the turn around its position, and have the physician manipulate the spine as we've discussed.
Here I have placed the vertebra back in position and bound it together with wax from a honeycomb album; over this mixture of beeswax we've added stitching material—three or four threads to hold everything tightly, allowing just enough movement for the area affected by spondylosis (a condition affecting the vertebrae). We also cover it all with cloth fabric from a chestboard that is three inches wide and as long as needed so that we can compress this space which suffers from degeneration.
Return its ligaments as we have mentioned, and place the malady'supremely inside where it will heal.
If there is any likelihood in the location at the time of healing, then it is recommended that medicines be administered to moisten and cleanse for a long period as advised; and already such treatment has been applied here, where lead lathing (a type of medical instrument) has been placed.
And some signs of impending danger appear at the lower back vertebrae of the spine, and it is due to that dislocation; this one from which you already notice, lest no remedy should come for your use today, before long death will find me here.
The given text appears to be a blend of Latin phrases with some elements
Curación del hueso deslizado de la cadera." Translation: Treatment
Know that the hip joint and the muscle connection can only be dislocated so much, without worsening it to where you hurt other smaller body parts with curvature or concave shape." Translation: It's essential understanding that a hinge-like structure such as the knee has limited mobility before becoming completely misaligned. Beyond this threshold of movement, attempting further displacement can lead not only to discomfort but also potential damage at other bodily sites characterized by curvature or concavity—areas where structures naturally curve inward like an arched doorway when closed and a bow for flexibility
The hip joint is displaced according to four movements: upwards or forward from the hips, downward towards them (inferiorly), backward away from there (posteriorly), and behind toward those below." Translation: The dislocation of a person's pelvis can occur in several ways based on directional movement. These are four possible patterns by which an individual’s hip joint might become displaced, involving movements upwards or forward at the hips area (superiorly), downward towards them (inferiorly),
Most often it is displaced forward from the hips or backward towards them (posteriorly), and rarely to behind." Translation: The majority of hip dislocations happen when moving away from one's own body axis, specifically in a direction toward oneself. It happens less frequently if someone
The sign of the displaced hip is that when you adjust your pillow on which it's unwell and press down slowly—and then lift with caution not to exceed its natural flexibility, as one cannot bend their knee beyond where they place their tongue (for speaking or breathing), reaching a point below. Here the touch of cauterization is applied precisely at this spot for healing." Translation: A telltale sign of hip dislocation can be identified by placing pressure on an affected pillow and feeling downward movement—bear in mind, one should not force beyond what's naturally flexible as you would with your knee when speaking or breathing. The indication where the tongue touches for cauterization (used to promote healing) is noted below this sensitive area on a person’s body.
The translation of this medieval medical text line by line into English would be as follows:
Even the one to whom dislocation occurs immediately after placing on the cushion below should not be twisted further in that direction where pain is felt; if it protrudes and cannot return back therein, urine retention happens, and an ulcer forms at its location. Walk with them using their toes only.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
May reduction of these spices for this dislocation is what you consider, and as long as the dislocation is old and ancient, already administered by you at your disposal in accordance with its arrangement; hence there will be no further action needed herein. And so it's not necessary to perform any more procedures on this condition.
In that where the dislocation is recent and one of the four species of dislocation, then take up what has come out (the joint), restore it to its place in both upper and lower parts, first on the right side and then on the left, until it returns firmly without needing treatment from other remedies.
May it be so in this treatment methodology:
When it extends from this area or the division of the chest down to the division of the breastbone, or from the division behind up to the division above:
And when their extension is complete within that period, until the hump (the swelling caused by gout) rises on its own and hangs from above.
This particular type of distension is common throughout all four (of these areas).
And if the dislocation returns with water that we have mentioned, be silent (sic); but otherwise, it is necessary for all special waters needed to speak of one'thy own cure.
In the reduction of themselves, when dislocated, and displacement occurs in their parts, so that the abdomen lies above its backbone; and pause the ligaments at the joint between the top of the thigh and where it joins with the chest bone, holding them there.
And appoint another minister with strong pulse to the patient'thy arms and extend forcefully over the limbs for violent extension; whereupon that one returns to its own place.

When the dislocation is at the joints ahead, then it must be extended slowly with the hand of one'dictor and held by another dictator’s palm over their leg, pausing to adjust where necessary until restored in place before continuing upwards towards the thigh. (Here we have a description from an ancient medical text on how to manage dislocation at joint areas.)
If the dislocation is at the joints behind, do not cover so that the thigh spreads out to the joint areas and stands on the ground; they have covers over hard causes when their wide part (hips) are dislocated from the joints ahead, according to what we said about it above. They should be extended along with ligaments as mentioned earlier—there is no need for further coverings.
When compression is applied using a pillow over the location where the joint movement occurs,
So that the reduction is completed as instructed, and it should not be your burden to do so—extend cushions from underneath (the reduced area), then when you tighten those cushions again, push outwards until each of these areas expands its excusatory space.

When it is necessary for him (the patient) that his cushion attaches at the thighs, not exerting labor or effort.

And do not use the malady of walking for more than a few days until it is healed and comforted.
If your reduction of it is excused from you, then apply force externally on the ligaments mentioned in its previous treatment for the knee joint.
Given that "Capitol" is not part of an understandable context
The phrase provided, "Curacio di la dislocacio del talo," translates to English as:
The heel occasionally gets inflamed due to minor injury, and it sometimes becomes dislocated either in the joints or below them; such pain is felt at the parts of the digits or around there.
The translation of the medieval medical treatise line by line into English is as follows:
May the cure for the patient' extrication be of light relief, and it is that they should expand freely as much as possible until returning to normalcy.
When it comes to the healing process as they dislocate a second time, ensure you straighten out their thigh and hold that limb firmly with someone competent from behind of where they are lying in place (the bed).
Return yourself to the belly of your body and place your left hand on the upper part of the abdomen below where the navel is located in the hollow (cavity).
Return the leg to your left arm'thy fourfold, and press it with your left hand for two steps, then extend the limb further using your right hand; push on the chest of the leg as per its lever mechanism in accordance with the weight applied by both hands.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
Returns the chest to its comfortable position and you are at the navel (cavity).
So you return the body to a comfortable position in one or two attempts during this procedure, and if the patient cries out (indicating pain), they are fine; otherwise, repeat until there is relief as that person returns into place. This translation interprets medieval medical instructions for treating certain conditions with applied pressure at specific points of the body, likely referring to practices such as acupressure or massage therapy aimed at restoring balance and alleviating pain by manipulating bodily humors (as was believed in these times).
If you are not allowed to return the body as previously recommended during this time (possibly referring to a specific point in treatment when certain actions might be contraindicated), then shout over it, placing hands on its two sides firmly upon earth and laying out an awl deeply into solid ground; keep your hand within their hollows while you wrap the patient with cloth so that no ill humors escape. This directive appears to suggest alternative methods for containing or redirecting internal imbalances (represented as 'ill humors') when direct treatment is not permitted, likely pointing towards containment of excess bodily fluids and prevention from spreading further within the body's cavities using a combination of vocalization directed at patient’thy hollow areas ('coysses'), physical touch through hand placement over those same regions (possibly for therapeutic massage or pressure
Returns the minister of his tongue to its hollow spaces in and around those areas where it typically rests (likely referring to mouth or throat), while another official extends either their hand on top, overlapping with what is placed underneath them ("lie sobre el col del pe" – possibly meaning "lying across the neck"), as well as along his spine. They extend each of these officials against extension and maintain a pincet between the hollows where ill humors are retained in this patient, so that their body cannot be pulled away from its proper position afterward ("no sia atirat"). This passage implies an approach to physiotherapy or manual manipulation aimed at preventing patients who have been stretched (possibly indicating a severe posture adjustment) and those suffering dehydration of bodily fluids, ensuring they remain stabilized in their correct position afterward. The specific medical practices here suggest an era where balance among humors was considered key to health, requiring skilled practitioners ("ministeres") for proper body alignment maintenance during
Here the doctor applies pressure to the displaced joints and another minister holds the healthy hernia in place until it returns to its proper position.
So when the dislocation is returned and it'supra-declared to you as health restored by its reduction, then apply strong plaster or bandage on that joint, and bind the limb with these bands firmly attached to each other at the groin area; this way maintaining stability of the body part.
When you fear or protect the nerves located behind the ankle to prevent that ligament from being violent and leading it strongly.
Return it within two or three days if the bandage softens, extend that out further.
Return that particular in the day or at night for forty days. Prohibit the moon from entering through the urinary passage for forty days. May it not be said that if the patient is unable to proceed further in this space, they will experience displacement and their condition may become decayed without treatment care?
If you apply a poultice on him and administer the fluid in which we have previously described (in this treatment narrative), do so until he is revitalized.

When it comes to the treatment of foot joint displacement: Have that which is dislocated be quickly immobilized by a splint (indicating immediate rest and potentially some form of external support or fixation); if this proves manageable, then gently manipulate back into place. In medieval medical practice, such intervention would align with the understanding at the time to stabilize an injury through mechanical means rather than surgical ones as we know
When the dislocation occurs in a part of the foot not previously mentioned (implying other areas that might also be affected), cover it with one's own flesh or perhaps some cloth provided by oneself; have it positioned underfoot on either ground soil ("loc engual de la terra") or another flat surface like "taula"—maintain its place as if the person were still lying there. This would indicate a method of temporary immobilization consistent with medieval medical understanding, where body parts are used to substitute for modern splints and limb positioning is manually maintained until proper care can be provided or
Position your own weight on the foot in question and place it over whatever you find to support at body junctures (e.g., bed or other furniture), elevating the injured area; apply cold—likely ice, given contextual clues—to that portion of the skin where swelling has occurred as soon as possible after injury detection while making sure not to move it into a prominent position above its usual level ("le loc eminencia"). This advice would be in line with medieval medical theory which often suggested elevation and cold application for reducing inflammation. These instructions demonstrate an approach attempting to manage injuries before the arrival of modern emergency care techniques, reflecting practices common at that time where home remedies
And apply pressure to the abdomen of your patient with a board that presses completely on their body; attach two caps for strength and firmness for three days, then take off those caps and allow rest from walking for some days until he/she is fully recovered and his/her finances are secure.
