The fourth chapter on the treatment of the constant flow of hot tears to the eyes.
If the tears are constant and their flow is from the veins that are on the skull from the outside, and there is no benefit from any medical treatment with medicines
and you see that the patient's face has become red, and he feels a crawling in his forehead like the crawling of ants, and his eyes are sunken, moist, their lashes eroded, and their eyelids cracked from the sharpness of the tears
then the ancients were compelled in its treatment to this procedure, and they call it treatment with the sword
which is that you order the patient to shave the hair that is on his forehead, then you make three parallel incisions in the forehead along the length of the forehead, and the length of the incision should be about two fingers
one incision parallel to the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, the second a little distance from the movement of the muscle that is in the temple, and the third on the other side
and beware of cutting the two arteries that are on the sides, and keep your hand away from the joining of the jaws
and let the distance between each incision be the width of three fingers joined together
and let there be with you prepared pieces of sponge or many dry rags with which you dry the blood
then you insert the double-edged scalpel, which is this image of it
From the incision that follows the temple to the middle incision, and you skin with it all the skin that is between the two incisions with the periosteum that is on the bone.
Then you do that also from the middle incision to the third incision.
Then you take out this scalpel and insert into the first incision also another instrument called a scalpel, sharp on one side and smooth, not sharp, on the other side.
And this is its picture:
And its sharp side is placed upwards towards the flesh attached to the skin, and its smooth side towards the bone.
And you push it until it reaches the middle incision, and you cut with it all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes without the cut reaching the surface of the skin.
Then you do the same in the middle incision to the other incision.
And after a moderate amount of blood has flowed, you squeeze the areas of the solidified blood clots.
Then you put a wick of cotton dipped in wine and oil or vinegar and oil in each incision.
So that a hot swelling does not occur.
And on the third day you loosen the bandage and use frequent washing with lukewarm water.
Then you treat it with basilicon ointment with rose oil and all other things with which you treat wounds until it heals, God willing.
