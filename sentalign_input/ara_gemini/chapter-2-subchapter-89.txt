Chapter eighty-nine on the treatment of felon, bruised nail, and amputation.
The extra finger and the incision of the adhesion of the fingers
The felon is a lot of flesh that grows under the nail of the thumb of the hand or foot, and perhaps it grows in the rest of the fingers. If it is prolonged and its treatment is neglected, it swells with a hot swelling, or it becomes badly corrupted until it eats the root of the nail, and perhaps it spoils it all. Perhaps the corruption reaches the bone until it has a foul odor, and the tip of the finger becomes wide, and its color becomes livid. So if you treat it with what we mentioned in the division and your treatment does not succeed, then you should cut with iron all the excess that grows from the nail, then cauterize the wound after that, for cauterization in this is very beneficial.
But if the bone is healthy, and the nail is also healthy, and the containing corner of the nail has pressed the flesh inwards and made it sting and hurt it, then you should put a thin probe under the corner of the nail that stings the flesh and lift it up and cut that flesh gently and put on what remains of the flesh of the burning corrosive medicines until it all goes away, then treat it with ointments until it heals.
But if the corruption has affected the bone, then you should cut that bone and remove it, for it will not heal as long as there is corrupt bone in it at all.
If you see the erosion and corruption running in the finger, then cut it in one of the phalanges as mentioned previously, then treat it until it heals.
If the nail is struck or bruised and there is severe pain in it, then it is necessary to phlebotomize the patient first, then incise the nail with a sharp scalpel, an oblique incision from top to bottom, and be careful not to reach the flesh under the nail with the incision, for you will cause severe pain to the patient and it will be a reason for the growth of excess flesh in the place, then treat the place with something that soothes the pains.
As for the extra finger that is generated in some people's hands, perhaps it is all fleshy, and perhaps some of it has bones, and perhaps it has a nail, and some of it grows at the base of the joint of some fingers, or it grows in some of the phalanges of the finger. The one that grows in some of the phalanges of the finger does not move, and the one that grows at the joint of the finger may move. So what is fleshy, cutting it is easy, and that is to cut it at its root with a wide scalpel. But the one that grows at the base of the joint, its treatment is difficult, so avoid cutting it.
As for the one that grows in the finger at one of the phalanges, it should first be cut flesh, a circular cut to the bone, then saw the bone with one of those saws suitable for that, then treat it until it heals.
As for the adhesion that occurs to the fingers with each other, this often happens, and this is something that a person is born with, and it happens when a wound heals, or a burn from fire, and so on. It is necessary to incise that adhesion until the fingers return to their natural form, then put between them wicks or rags soaked in rose oil so that they do not adhere quickly, and separate them, or put between them a thin sheet of lead until the place heals as it should.
Likewise, if the adhesion occurs to some of the fingers with the palm, then incise that adhesion according to what is feasible and what corrects the shape of the member.
