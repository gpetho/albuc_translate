On the reduction of the clavicle and tip of the shoulder.	On the reduction of a dislocation of the clavicle and of the head of the humerus.	0.82864183
As for the clavicle, it is not dislocated from the inner side because of its connection to the chest, but it may be dislocated outward, and that is apparent to the touch.  Its treatment is that the patient lies on his back and extends his arms.	The clavicle is never dislocated inwards because of its continuity with the breast-bone; but sometimes it is dislocated outwards, and then it is detected by palpation. The replacement is thus: the patient is to lie on his back and stretch out both arms; then with the palm of your hand press heavily upon the place and it will go back.	0.7192215
Then you press the area firmly with your palm, and it will return. Then you apply a bandage and supports and tighten them. As for the end that is next to and connected to the shoulder, it is rarely dislocated. If it is ever dislocated, it should be reduced and straightened as we have described, and as you are able.	Then apply to it the plaster and pads, and bandage it up. As to the extremity of the clavicle, which is close to the shoulder and joined to it, it is only rarely dislocated; but if ever it is dislocated you must reduce it and set it straight as we have mentioned, by any convenient means.	0.8202282
Then you put on it the bandage, supports, and tightening, and order the patient to remain still and at rest until he recovers.  With this same treatment, you reduce the tip of the shoulder if it also shifts from its place.	Then apply the plaster, pads, and bandages, and bid the patient keep quiet and still until it is healed. By this same treatment you may also reduce the head of the humerus when it is displaced.	0.8517086
