The fortieth chapter: in it is made of the discussion about lancing tumors and incising them.	CHAPTER FORTY. A general dissertation on the perforation and incision of tumours.	0.63874865
Tumors are of many various types, as will be mentioned one by one in this book, and they differ in their lancing and incising in two aspects: one is the type of tumor itself and the humors it contains.	The kinds of tumour are many and various, as will be mentioned in order in this book. They differ in the way they are to be perforated or incised, according to two criteria. One is the kind of tumour it is in itself and the humidities it contains.	0.85092425
The second aspect is the location in the body where they occur, because a tumor occurring in the head is different from a tumor occurring in the anus, and a tumor occurring in a fleshy area is different from a tumor occurring in a joint, each one having its own treatment rule.	The other is the part of the body where it occurs. For the tumour occurring in the head is different from the tumour occurring on the posterior, and a tumour occurring in a fleshy part differs from one on the joints; each having its separate category of operation.	0.8273898
It is necessary to lance the fresh, not fully matured tumor that is near the anus so that the depth does not putrefy and penetrate into the anus, becoming a fistula and becoming incurable.	The reason why you must open an abscess near the anus while still unripe, before it is brought to a head, is to prevent it from putrefying the cleft and penetrating to the inner part of the anus and becoming a fistula, and incurable.	0.7635367
You should know the time to lance tumors that have fully matured, which is when the pain of the tumor subsides, the fever disappears, the redness and throbbing decrease, the head of the tumor softens, and other signs.	It is necessary too to know the time to open fully mature swellings: it is when the pain of the swelling is lessened, the fever departs, the redness and the throbbing are reduced, and the head of the abscess becomes wrinkled, with other signs.	0.79474235
The lancing should be performed at the lowest point of the tumor if possible, so that it is easier for the fluid to flow downwards, or at the thinnest and most protruding point of the tumor.	The perforation should be made in the lower part of the swelling if possible, so that the pus may more easily drain downwards; or else in the thinnest and most swollen part of the swelling.	0.8642404
The lancing should be lengthwise along the body if the tumors are in areas such as the hands and feet, muscles, tendons, nerves, arteries, and in general in all flat areas without bending.	Your incision should be longitudinal if the swellings are in such places as hands or feet or in the site of joints, tendons, nerves, or arteries; and, in short, in all flat places where there is no curvature.	0.85251653
As for those that bend, the lancing should be done according to that area. If the tumor is in fleshy areas, it is best to leave it until it is fully matured, as we have said, because if you lance it before that, the flow of pus from it will be prolonged and it will be very harmful and dirty, and perhaps its edges and depth will harden.	In curved places let the perforation proceed according to the place. But when the swelling is in the fleshy parts it is best to leave the perforation, as we have said, until it is fully matured. For if you perforate it prematurely the sanious discharge will go on longer and will be excessively foul; and often both the edges and the depths of the opening will become indurated.	0.79795647
Some tumors may be lanced across the body when necessary or according to the needs of the limb.	Some swellings are perforated latitudinally if necessary, or having regard to the requirement of the part.	0.7256963
You should use a single lancing for small tumors and a wide lancing or multiple incisions for large tumors, according to the size of the tumor.	In small swellings you should use a single perforation; while in large ones you should use wide or multiple perforations according to the size of the swelling.	0.83324695
Some tumors may require the skin to be scraped and cut if it has become like a rag and is dead, such as what occurs in many boils and abscesses.	There are also some swellings that need a circular incision of the skin, and should be cut when they have become like a rag, and necrosed â€”which actually happens often in abscesses and sinuses.	0.6820829
Some are incised with a three-cornered incision, some are cut in the shape of a myrtle leaf, like inguinal tumors, and some use a circular or crescent-shaped incision, and so on.	And there are some that should be incised triangularly; and others with an incision of myrtle-leaf form; e.g. a tumour on the groin. There are others again to which should be applied circular and lunate and similar incisions.	0.8092632
Those that do not have a head, such as smooth, flat tumors, should only be lanced simply.	Those that have no head, such as the smooth and flat ones, should be incised with only a simple perforation.	0.8949654
If the tumor is large and has accumulated a lot of fluid and you lance it, you should not rush to remove all the pus at that time, but rather remove some of it, then bandage the tumor until the next day, then remove some more pus, doing this gradually until you remove all of it, especially if the patient is weak, a pregnant woman, a small child, or an elderly person, because the vital spirit often dissolves with the sudden removal of pus, so the patient may die without you realizing it, so be very careful about this.	When a swelling is large and has collected a large quantity of pus, and you perforate it, do not be in a hurry to get it all out at once; but get some of it out and then bandage it till another day; then again remove part of the pus; and so do, again and again, gradually, till it is all got out. This particularly applies if the patient be in a weak state, or a pregnant woman, or a baby, or a decrepit old man; for the animal spirit is very often dissolved with the sudden evacuation of the pus, and the patient dies unexpectedly. Be very careful therefore, with this sort.	0.85597765
After lancing these tumors, you should wipe the wound and examine it. If the wound of the tumor is small or the incision is single and simple, use linen or worn cotton thread. If the tumor is large and the incisions are numerous, you should insert a wick into each incision until they reach each other.	Then, after you have opened the tumour, you should cleanse the wound and consider: if the tumour has only a small opening, or it is one simple incision, employ swabs of lint or cotton wool; but if it is a large tumour with multiple incisions, introduce a swab into each incision so that they meet.	0.88247156
If some of the skin of the tumor has been cut or scraped, you should fill it with worn cotton or linen lint without moisture and bandage it until the third day, then remove it and treat it with appropriate ointments until it heals.	And if the tumour was such that you cut away a part of the skin, or sliced the tumour, you will need to pack it with cotton wool or plucked linen, dry; and bandage until the third day. Then remove it and treat with the needful ointments until healed.	0.872302
If bleeding occurs during your work, use cold water and vinegar after soaking a linen cloth in them and applying it to the bleeding area several times.	If a haemorrhage occurs while you are operating, use cold water and vinegar, soaking a lint rag in both and frequently applying it to the place.	0.8221693
If the bleeding continues, you should use the management, treatment, and peaks that we have described in many places in this book and in the division.	And if the bleeding still persists then it is necessary to employ the method and the treatment and the powders that we have prescribed in many parts of this book and in their own sections.	0.7578493
If you are in the winter season and the location of the tumor is rich in nerves, you should moisten the pads with hot wine and oil and place them on the area.	Now if this should be in winter and the site of the tumour abound in nerves, you should have some pads soaked in hot wine and oil and then apply to the place.	0.8709254
If you are in the summer and the areas are fleshy, you should apply pads soaked in cold water and oil or cold wine and oil, until the third day, as we have said, then you should untie the tumor, wipe it, and use similar treatment until it heals.	But if it be in summer and the parts be fleshy, apply the pads soaked in water and oil, or wine and oil, all being cold, till the third day, as we have said. Then unbandage the tumour and wipe it and give it the treatment suitable to it, until cured.	0.88587004
This is what you need to know about the treatment of tumors in general. As for the detailed method, I have mentioned each tumor and how to treat it, categorized and summarized.	This is the information you need about the treatment of tumours in general. As for the particulars, I now review the way to treat each tumour, by chapters, in detail.	0.86099166
