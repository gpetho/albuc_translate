After completing this book for you, my children, which is the final part of the science in medicine with its supplement, and having reached the end of it from his explanations and own declarations, I consider it necessary to complete it for you together with this Treatise which is a part of operations, that is, surgery with practice.
Since the operation with practice is located in our region and time, entirely separated from us: until perhaps knowledge of it disappears and its investigation ceases. There remained nothing from that except small descriptions in ancient books which were changed by hands: they are thus prone to error and hesitation until their intentions are closed and their strength elongated. I consider it necessary to revive this by organizing this Treatise according to the path of position, declaration, and abbreviation: And to provide it with forms of Cauter's tools and other surgical instruments. As an addition from declarations and as a clarification of what is necessary.
The reason why it is not found a good craftsman of this skill with his own hand in our times is: because the art of medicine requires one to be proficient beforehand in the science of anatomy as described by Galen, so that he may understand the functions of organs, their forms, and connections, and know about bones, nerves, blood vessels, their numbers, and exit locations. And also pulsating veins and quiet ones, and the places from where they exit.
And because of this, said Hippocrates, the name with its name is much and the work with its work is little, particularly in the art of hands.
We have already spoken about this in the introduction to this book.
For someone who does not understand what we said about anatomy will fall into error, which kills people: as I have seen many of them being formed in this knowledge and boasting about it without understanding, and without experience.
What happened was that I saw a foolish physician remove a scrophularia boil from a woman's neck, and he cut into some arteries in the neck. Thus, the woman's blood flowed until she died in his hands.
And I saw another doctor who supposed he would extract a stone from the urine of an old person, and the stone was large.
So he approached him and extracted the bladder with the stone intact.
Therefore, the man died on the third day.
And indeed, I had already been summoned to extract it: and I saw from the size of the stone, and the condition of the sick person, that he would die.
And I saw another doctor who was receiving a dowry from one of our land's Dukes due to his medical skills: and an affair occurred involving a black eunuch who was with him, suffering from a fracture near the heel: and the doctor acted without knowledge, tightening the fracture over the wound with tongs and nails, using a strong constriction, without allowing the wound to breathe.
Then he completed what was desired by him according to his wishes.
Then he released him after a few days and commanded him not to untie the bandage. And he stood like that until the boil burst on his leg and foot, and he thus came to ruin.
I was therefore summoned to him: and I approached to untie the bandage: and there followed calmness, and he was relieved of his pains.
But the corruption had already been confirmed in the member: and I could not cure it.
Therefore, the corruption then began to roam around within the member until it perished.
And I saw another physician who had perforated a cancerous pustule: and it became inflamed for days until the malignancy of him towards his lord was magnified.
This means, that when there is a pure cancer caused by black bile, then it should not be punctured with iron at all, unless it is located on a limb that can tolerate it, in which case the entire thing must be removed.
And for this reason, dear children, you must know that an operation with the hand is divided into two parts. Namely, an operation associated with health and one involving danger in various dispositions. And I have already highlighted throughout this book wherever an operation occurs that involves fear and dread.
Therefore, you must guard against this and dismiss it: so that fools do not find a way to speak and disgrace themselves.
Therefore, take care with your diligence and protection, and treat your patients with ease and strength, using the better path to heal them through God's grace for health and a commendable succession. And dismiss terrible illnesses that are hard to cure. And remove your souls from what makes you fear, so that hesitation in faith and convenience does not come upon you. For it is indeed more lasting for your glory and more elevated in this world, and finally for your quantities.
Galen had indeed said this in some of his own instructions. Do not treat the bad illness: do not call yourself the doctor of evil.

Part I.
On the Healing and Harmfulness of the Cautery: which types it is appropriate for, and at what time, and whether with iron or gold.
Head I.
But before we recall the operation with it, it is necessary to say about the quality of its healing and harmful effects, and how they are exhibited in what type.
I say then that the discussion about the quality of healing by the cautery and its harm is a lengthy and subtle topic, requiring knowledge and hidden secrets.
Many wise people have spoken on this topic and they have had differing views. As for me, I am content with little from their discussions to avoid unnecessary lengthening of the text.
I say that the cautery applies universally to all compositions, whether with material or without material substance, except for two compositions. These are a hot composition without material substance and a dry composition without material substance.
In terms of composition, when hot and dry substances opposed matter.
Some have said that the cauterizing tool is beneficial in such cases.
Others have said the opposite, namely that the cauterizing tool is not suitable in dryness which results from heat and dryness. For the nature of fire is heat, and it would be counterproductive to heal from a condition caused by heat and dryness with heat and dryness itself.
And he who says the opposite of that one said: that the application of the cauterizing tool provides relief in every dryness caused by heat which happens within human bodies. For when you compare a human body and its humidity to the composition of fire, you find the human body to be cold.
And indeed, I would say through his speech: because I have often discovered that by experience.
However, it is not necessary for someone to apply the cauterizing tool on this unless they have already been proven and trained in the last chapter of the Cauterization procedure. They should be aware of the diversity of human compositions, the nature of illnesses within themselves, their causes, occurrences, duration times, etc.
As for the other compositions, there is no fear towards you and especially in cold and moist illnesses. Indeed, all the doctors have agreed on these matters and there is no disagreement about their benefit when using the cauterizing tool with them.
And know my children that from the secret of healing through the cauterizing tool with fire and its goodness compared to a burning medicine is: for fire is simple, whose action reaches only to the member being cauterized, and it does not harm another member connected to it, unless in a minor injury.
The effect of medicine that heals by burning arrives at what extends from the limbs: and perhaps it causes an illness of difficulty in healing to occur within the member, and perhaps it can be fatal.
However, because of the subtlety and goodness of its nature, fire does not do this unless there is excess.
Now we have learned this through experience, due to the length of service and study with art, and position above truth in matters, and due to that excuse from the length of discourse.
And children, know that they disagree during the time when it is appropriate for a cauterization to happen and put off to better times of truth.
And I say that a cauterization is appropriate at all times: therefore, harm caused by time is submerged in healing which is drawn towards the cauterization.
And especially if a cauterization is for pains due to necessary, strong, urgent ones which do not tolerate delay: therefore because of fear that something worse, which is more harmful than the small harm caused by time, might happen from them.
And do not let this thought take root in your minds, children, that they do not consider unless the common and foolish doctors say so: namely, that sicknesses which are being healed by cauterization always return. And they put forth this following consequence, making things seem as if they were not what people think: for a cauterization is only used when medicine fails, which alters complexion and dries out the moisture that causes pains.
However, the cautery is useful over medicine due to the swiftness of his health and the effectiveness of his treatment, and the intensity of his control: it may happen that a period of weakness returns for some time according to the constitution of the sick person, and the location of his illness, and its effectiveness; and what is prepared in his body from the aggregation of excesses within him: and whatever arrives at him in acquisition through food, and similar things through causes, unless sickness occurs where the cautery is administered. Subtle sickness in a part of few excesses and moisture, like the cautery for teeth due to pain, and similar things for him, it is possible that this pain does not return in him.
But that happens in few cases.
But the discussion goes further, stating that cautery is the last of medicines, which is a correct statement: not about what they aim for in it; because they believe that there is no cure that comes with medicine, nor after the opportunity of cautery.
However, this is contrary to that and the intention; that cautery is the last of medicines is not true, unless when we administered methods of treatment in any illness, and those medicines did not bring relief. Then, we administer the cautery at the end of things, and it does bring relief: then it follows that cautery is the last of medicine, not according to the intention which the common people and many doctors understand.
Ancient people said that the cautery with gold is better than the one made of iron. And they did not say this just because of the equality of gold and the quality of its substance but also because it doesn't create pus at the site of the cautery. However, this is not absolutely true: because I have already tried it and found that it doesn't do that in some bodies without others.
And a cautery with it is good and better than with iron, as they said.
However, when you heat the cautery in fire made from gold, it is not revealed to you how much heat according to your wish it needs due to the color of the gold: and as it approaches the coldness, and if you add heat above it, it melts in the fire and turns into sheets.
Therefore, the craftsman falls into employment from this: and because of this, we use a cautery with iron rather than gold, it is faster and closer to accuracy in operations.
And indeed, I have arranged this Chapter on the cautery according to its sections, and organized it from head to foot so that anyone seeking something can find what they want. Chapter 1: On the method of applying a cautery to the forehead.
Chapter II.
This application of the cautery involves balancing moisture and coldness on the brain: these are the two causes that lead to excessive discharge of bodily fluids from the head to the eye and ear areas, as well as many other symptoms like dreams, tooth pain, throat pain, and all sorts of illnesses resulting from coldness such as paralysis, sodae (a type of epilepsy), epilepsy, apoplexy, and similar ailments.
The method of cautery application is to treat the sick: initially, cleanse their head with a purifying solution for three nights or four, according to what the strength of the patient requires, and their age, and their habits.
Then instruct him to wash his head with new water.
Then have him sit between your hands in a square position, so that his hands are already on his chest.
Then place the root of your palm over the root of his nose between his eyes. Therefore, whenever your middle finger goes into it, mark that place with an unburned brand. Then apply oil to the cauterizer: this is its form. Then place it on the marked spot with an unburned brand, applying pressure, gradually tighten your hand and then rotate it.
Then quickly lift your hand and you will see the spot.
If you see already exposed from the bone, a quantity of alkali's head, or a quantity of zew herb, then lift your hand.
And if not, apply your hand with the iron itself, or use another that has been cooled down until you see the bones as I told you.
Then take some salt and dissolve it in water, then apply it to the affected area, and place it over the spot: and remove it after three days.
Then place the soaked buttered substance over it, and remove it when the scab is destroyed by fire. Then treat that with the fourfold ointment until it is healed.
They have said that the more of the wound remains open, pus is emitted from it; therefore, it is better and more beneficial.
And some of them said that the skin should be cauterized up to the bone: and hold the cautery until some thickness of the bone is burned.
Then it is sutured after that which has been prepared from the bone, and then treated.
And others say that it should be done with the cautery until one reaches the end, until an imprint of a tooth is made in the mouth, so that the mouth falls as if it were a form of a kirate: or an instrument that women place infused in miniature alphabet: and they think that vapors from the head escape from this point, and the wound should be left open for a long time.
Then it is cured until it has hardened.
To me, these two kinds of cautery are not entirely distinguishable except in some people according to the way of fear.
And to let it heal itself, for me it is better with the health of oneself.
Indeed, the head weakens from the solution of its natural continuity: as we have testified with other body parts, and especially when the head is naturally weak: and indeed the first kind of cautery seems to be more beneficial and better for me, and I rely on that method, therefore acting upon it with regard to health.
Section 1: On the manner of applying cautery to the head when suffering from pain throughout the head.
Head Chapter III
When a chronic headache occurs throughout the head: and if this lasts in an afflicted individual, they make use of herbs, baths, purgatives, oils, and enemas.
And especially if it has already been treated with one cautery, as we have described, and nothing from that applies to him; then consider.
For if the head is of strong natural creation and is not weak, and finds a sudden coldness: then apply cautery with another cautery underneath to that point slightly.
Then apply cautery over all the horns of their head with a cautery, so that it does not pass through the skin, and uncover the quantity from the bone as we described.
And he cauterizes himself with a single cautery at the top of his head, at the place called the peak. This is the spot where suction is placed and your hand should be raised above it; you will not touch the mouth.
Indeed, he found relief from severe pain and a different kind of more intense head pain among all other types.
And I shall speak of this as a cautery at its place: it must be a cautery used for cauterizing the horns of the head and the back of his head with a finer cautery that cauterizes the middle part of the head.
And this is its form.
¶ On the method of cauterization for one-sided headaches, both with heated medicine and with iron.
Head IV.
When pain and swelling occur on the head or the pain extends to the eye, and relief is sought with purging medicines for the head, and other treatments are administered as previously described in the divisions of complaints, without encompassing it entirely; then cauterization occurs in this way according to two methods: either by applying a cautery with a burning hot medicine: or with iron. And the cautery with a burning hot medicine is as follows: you take one tooth or similar object, remove its outer layer, and cut off its extremities from both sides.
Then divide the pain area while using a large bloodletting tool until you create a spot under the skin where the tooth is extracted.
Therefore, insert it into him beneath the skin until it disappears: then tighten it over it with a constriction fitting enough, and let it remain for fifteen hours. Then release it, apply butter to it until pus forms at the spot: afterwards treat it with ointment until it is fully healed.
And if you wish to perform this with some physicians who burn like I wrote in the twelfth treatise on those who are medicated with medieval remedies.
However, the cauterization with iron is according to this manner.
Igneous Cauterization, whose form is as follows.
And it is called the Claw: because its head's shape resembles that of a claw, where there is some curvature, and in the middle of it is a small prominence.
Then place it on the site and hold your hand. And you should move the iron gradually with speed: and the amount to be burned from the thickness of the skin should be like half of it.
And raise your hand so that the artery below is not burned and there is no flow of blood.
Then soak the wick in salt water and place it over the area, then remove it for three days. Then place the wick with butter; after that take care with ointment until fully healed. And if you wish, perform this partial head cauterization with the second surgical instrument of the cautery.
And be careful not to make an old mistake near the cut area on this partial head.
### On the method of cauterization for the old partial head.
Head V.
When you are treating a partial head, follow the treatment that we have discussed from the previous healing process, and consider what was said about divisions of illnesses. Do not compare this treatment to others. Observe the illness itself; if it is insufficient according to the first cauterization with medicine or with cauterization by fire, then you must use the second surgical instrument of cautery until the area turns white after the signs of pain appear as a line whose length is half of a finger, or somewhat like this. Hold your hand in one place, and press it until you touch the artery, and continue until you reach the mouth. However, you must beware of the continuity of the jaw bone which moves during chewing, lest it scorch the side or the nerve that moves it, thus causing a cramp.
And be mindful of the safeguard and precaution against blood flow in the artery which has been severed.
Indeed, there is a fear when it comes to its removal, especially for the one who does not understand what he is doing and lacks diligence as well as experience: and he performs the operation with him initially.
And I will be lenient with the recall of the regulation of blood flow occurrences from the artery according to its manner, and within the place of this book.
If you see the discomfort that does not suffice him with this cautery treatment, and if you see an infirm body enduring the cautery in the middle of its head, as we have told, take care of the wound until it heals.
And if you see fit, administer the cautery, as we said in chapter on extracting an artery while holding the cautery with two knives.
Indeed, this form of cauterization is better and more effective. ¶ The method of cauterizing in ear pain.
Chapter VI. When ear pain occurs due to cold and it is treated with the use of hot substances, and all other treatments as we have mentioned in division, and if the pain does not cease, then use fire for cauterization: this thing that is called 'Punctum' has this form.
Then after the ignition of it with him, make punctures around the entire circumference of the ear as it is described: or around both sides if pain occurs in both.
And lengthen thee with the cautery from the root of the ear to some extent after you have marked the places with a heated stick: and let the amount of the cautery be ten points in every ear, and somewhat more.
Then take care of those places until they heal.
¶ On the method of cauterization during torture.
Chapter VII.
Torture that heals with cauterization is nothing other than the cases which occur from inflammation, as we said in the divisions of diseases. And the appropriate cauterization for the case that occurs from drying out and muscle spasm.
When you treat this kind of torture with bleeding and purges and gargling and if your treatment does not yield results, then it is necessary for you to cauterize the patient three times with the cautery: one at the root of the ear, and the second slightly below its usual position, and the third at the junction of the two lips.
And place your cautery on the opposite side of the patient's weakness.
For healing does not occur, unless in the part which appears healthy.
And the shape of the cauterization is, to cauterize that part with the cautery directly under the upper end of the external ear up to a bit below the skull bone: and another one at this time; whose length should be according to the length of a thumb.
And keep your hand with the cautery until the area of medium thickness of the skin is burned.
And this is the form of the cautery, and it's a type from the knife-like tool, as described before: but it should not be much thinner than what you see. And it needs to have a knife within it that has slightly more thickness than necessary. Then care for the area, until it is healed, following what preceded.
¶ On the method of cauterization in ancient apoplexy.
Title VIII.
When apoplexy hardens, and you treat it with the methods we have discussed, and your treatment does not coincide with it, and the patient does not have a fever, then perform four cauterizations on his entire scalp, and a cauterization in the middle of the head as we said, and a cauterization at the back of the head, according to what has preceded. And the degree of cauterization should be according to what has preceded.
And also, the stomach is cauterized with a cauterizing agent over its mouth: and this is more toward the end.
Then it is cured in accordance with what has preceded.
¶ On the method of cauterization in Omission.
Title IX.
It is necessary that for the person who drinks in the mouth at first, they give him large doses of laudanum and brain purifying pills.
Then shave the entire head of the patient, and place the described plaster of saffron on his forehead: and apply it periodically. Indeed, that is the method of cauterization: and do this according to the same order I said there. If then it is healed through this, it is good.
If not: then do three cauterizations on the posterior part of his head, which descend from the upper part of the head down to the lower part of the eye: and place between each cauterization the thickness of a finger.
Then attention to the cautery, together with what precedes it.
If however you're adding [something] and the sick person is able to endure that: then do the cautery for him in the middle.
If you're adding [something]: then apply the cautery over both horns.
Then care for him until he is healed: and apply the cautery with oil according to the manner that was previously stated.
Section 4: On the method of applying the cautery in Palsy and softening.
Title X.
You must proceed with the cleansing of the head when you have an itch, and with what we have said.
Next, shave the sick person's head: afterwards apply the cautery on the middle of the head, and apply it over all the horns of the head, and apply it over the back part of his head, and three times over the cervical vertebrae.
If however you're lacking in bodily softening for many of these [conditions], and the sick person is able to endure it, and the illness is strong: then apply the cautery four times over the cervical vertebrae, and the last one with a cautery until much of his skin burns, and raise your hand.
Then care for him until he is healed: and apply the cautery with oil in this manner.
Section 6: On the method of applying the cautery in epilepsy.
Title XI.
An epileptic is not cauterized unless it is from phlegm-induced epilepsy. Therefore, you must cleanse his brain first when you have an itch, and with the rest of the treatments we mentioned in the division: when the sick person is great, or is able to endure the intake of medicines.
If it is a child who cannot bear medicines, then gargling and brain-enlivening mastications are administered, prior to many days with the improvement of foods.
Then cut his head, afterwards cauterize him with a cautery at the center of the head, according to what has been stated beforehand. And use another cautery on the back of his neck and apply a cauterization over all parts of his skull.
And if he is sick yet strong, and tolerates treatments well, then cauterize him with the cauterizing instruments I described for paralysis, and apply softening to his cervical vertebrae and vertebral column. And use an olive oil-coated cautery as was instructed beforehand. If it is instead the case that he is sick and it is a child, then place a fine cautery according to this method.
### Method for Cauterization in Melancholy.
Head Chapter XII.
When the causes of melancholy are corrupted humors and thick phlegm, then use cauterizing instruments as we have described for someone with paralysis.
And if the cause of melancholy is excess descending towards melancholy and makes the body overly moist, then give him a drink that enlivens his brain as was described previously in division. Then cut the head of the sick person, and make a centrally formed tourniquet from linen like a circle afterwards.
Then place her in the middle of the head, and let the sick person sit with his back straight from all sides.
Then present the liniment. And it is preferable to be made from old bee wax.
And heat him with the warmth of the fire that can be tolerated by his finger when it is being introduced into him.
Then evacuate him in the middle of his head in a circle, and release him until he cools down.
Do this for the sick person once every week, while maintaining their good routine, until they recover.
Or if it's an eye, cauterize him by making many small punctures, and when you hold the cautery you should smell its scent.
For this reason, the appearance of the cautery moistens the brain with quality.
Then place on him a cloth soaked in butter or chicken fat.
¶ On the method of cauterization as it descends into water for the eye.
Chapter XIII.
When you are told the beginning of water in the eye through the signs I mentioned in division, then begin to treat the sick person with whatever will purify his head.
And keep him away from all humidity, and make him sit in a bath, fasting for several days.
Then instruct him to shave his head, and cauterize himself in the middle of his own head. Then, if the beginning of water is simultaneous in both eyes, cauterize him twice on each eye with two cauterizations: or from one side if it's only one eye. Remove all veins and arteries under the skin, making sure the cauterization spans long width across the areas, taking care to avoid bleeding.
If you see anything from it, remove it immediately with whatever medicine is possible: and I perform the incisions with wisdom, which is in the extraction of veins and removal of them, and caution against bleeding.
And sometimes it is cauterized in the neck, between two bones, with two final applications of the cautery.
Regarding the method of cauterization in ancient lacrimas (tear ducts).
Chapter XIV.
When the tears of the eyes are old and constant: they are on the veins and arteries which are manifestly situated outside the head. It is understood that this comes from excesses of coldness and phlegm. Then, cauterize with a cauterizing method as I described in the beginning of the descent of water, i.e., cauterization in the middle of the head, and two cauterizations at two intervals, and two cauterizations in the neck below two bones.
And if you lack additional treatment, then cauterize it completely around the edge of the eye with a small cautery on the end of the eyebrow.
Regarding the method of cauterization in nasal discharges.
Chapter XV.
When you are treating this, according to what we have said about its division, and if the treatment does not match: then hasten, and give him three nights of an infusion made from a decoction of bitter onions. Then shave his head, and cauterize it with a medium cauterizer, using an oily one as well.
Then cauterize it with a pinch-bone cauterizer twice, above two eyebrows under the hair slightly.
And watch out for the artery, do not hit it.
This is the form of the Clavli cauterizer.
Regarding the method of cauterization for softening of the eyelid.
Chapter XVI.
When the eyelid of the eye softens due to illness or moisture, then use one cauterizing iron with this lunar cauterizing iron.
And if it's a case of an eye, apply ironing over the two upper eyebrows with slightly more than two ironings in every part: and let these last for two periods: and make the length of all the ironings according to the lengths of the eyebrows: do not use your hands directly with the ironing tool, but instead follow the quantity that burns the third eyelid.
This is the form of the cauterizing iron according to this lunar cauterization method.
¶ On the manner of cauterizing the eyelid when the hair is turned and stings the eye. Chapter XVII.
The cauterizing iron is according to two methods: either the cauterizing iron with fire: or the cauterizing iron with burning medicine.
In the cauterizing iron with fire, you should instruct the patient beforehand to remove his hairs, if there are any among them that cleanse him, until they extend and align. If they sting him near his dawn (referring to the time when the cauterization is performed): then bind his eyes with a towel so that they don't move until they are born.
When they are born and have aligned themselves, then place the patient's head on your bosom: next mark his eyelids with an iron, a mark that should resemble the shape of a myrtle leaf: and let the start of the mark be near the hair.
Then place the wick soaked in egg white: or on the eye with psyllium mucus.
Next apply the fire from the cauterizing iron, which is as follows in shape.
Then apply cautery to the figure, which you marked gradually on many subjects until the surface of the skin is burned, which appears like the shape of a leaf of myrtle.
And the sign of health for your work is: if you notice that the eyelid has already contracted and the hairs lifted above the eye incision.
So raise your hand then: and let it go for three days.
Then place butter with Cotum over it until the scab is eradicated.
Then take care of it with ointment until it heals.
And if any hair returns after an hour and the eyelid softens: then reapply cautery to that place as you did at first.
And if the hairs are in the lower part: then apply cautery to it until they rise to their natural place; and adjust them so that they do not irritate the eye.
¶ Concerning the method of applying cautery with burning medicine in this situation.
Chapter XVIII.
Just as you would instruct the sick person to remove hairs until they extend and align.
Make from a piece of linen the shape of a leaf of myrtle.
Then take from known soap and from the ash of unsoaked dung one ounce each or roughly this much. Next grind these together finely with a good mortar, making sure not to cool them.
Then spread some of it over the piece of paper you made like the shape of a leaf of myrtle, and place this over one or both eyelids.
And place under the eye butter that has been soaked in egg white: and let the head of the sick person lie on your chest.
And place your index finger upon the medicine and press it slightly.
And you move your finger as often as you feel the medicine bite: for he has found its bite, like a fire.
So when he persists with that bite which he himself has found, then you release the medicine and move it with your finger.
And when the bite stops, then remove the medicine and wash the eye with water.
And then observe, if you see the eyelid lift up, as it does with contraction from heat or incision, this is well: and if not, then apply again over it with medicine to the place where the medicine does not adhere, until your operation is equalized and the eye contracts.
Then put on it Cuth (a type of wool or cloth) with butter until the burned skin is eradicated.
Then attend to it with the clarifying balm or another suitable substance, until it heals.
And for your operation, you must observe the final care to ensure nothing of the medicine falls into the eye.
If the eyelid softens after a day and some hair fights within the eye, then apply medicine to that place which is softening from the eyelid itself, as you did initially.
Then attend to it until it heals.
And this is the form of the leaf of the myrtle.
And you will know that men's eyes vary in size and clarity.
Therefore, there should be this consideration for you: and do not hide the way of the straight path to him who has a desire to learn this art.
On the method of cauterization in a weeping fistula.
Title XIX.
When you are treating a Fistula, if your treatment according to what we have discussed about alleviating ailments does not yield the desired results, then it is necessary that you cauterize it in accordance with this method.
Command the patient to place his head on your chest, and have him hold his head with his attendant's hands like this: so that it does not move or shift with his own head.
Then apply the infused Catu (a type of paste) onto his eyelid or over the mucus of eggs: then take the cautering instrument with this shape.
Sit in a bowl like the shape of a goose feather quill from one end to another, as is done for the cautering instrument: and if you wish it to penetrate up to the other end, or if you wish it to go upwards, try this.
However, this bowl is better suited for your task.
Then place the cautering instrument on it, which is made to burn greatly.
And hold your hand close to the cautering instrument at the eye, up to the nostril area, so that your hand does not stray or disturb the patient, and place the cautering instrument into the fatty part of the eye, and burn it.
If you reach at the beginning to the tip of your cautering instrument up to the mouth, it will be good.
And if not: then use the cautering instrument once, or twice if you need it, and let that pass for three days.
Then place Catgut with butter, and take care of it with drying ointment until it is healed. If forty days pass and it is not healed, then apply over it a sharp corrosive medicine until the mouth is revealed. And cut it according to how it has grown in its chapter.
And there is another mode of cautery for a fistula, which some have said was first mentioned.
Proceed to the site of the fistula and close it. Then place a fine camel's wool (or tube) into the opening, that is, a thin cannula whose form is as follows.
And pour into it the weight of a drachm of melted lead, and hold your hand with the good retaining cannula, so that the patient does not move at all, lest it flow or the melted lead come to his eye.
And you must place catgut that has been immersed in egg white or water over the patient's eye.
For lead burns the site of the fistula and heals it with a wonderful cure.
If the fistula is healed, along with what we have described from cautery and treatment, it is good.
And if not, then it is necessary to administer a hole in the nose and bring the fistula back to the course of the nose according to how it will be suitable for itself in its own place.
¶ On the method of cauterization in the wounds of the lips.
Chapter XX.
Many times there occur wounds in the lips called hairs, and especially in the lips of children.
So when you care for these wounds, with what we have said about the division of ailments, and if there is no treatment, then use a small surgical knife to cauterize with fire according to this shape.
And let its curvature be according to the fineness of the knife.
Next, take care of it with the ointment until it is healed.
Section on the method of cauterization for a fistula in the mouth.
Title XXI.
When an abscess occurs at the root of a gum or on the palate or roots of teeth: pus is formed and bursts out; afterwards it becomes inflamed and pus runs, forming a fistula. Then take care of that area without imposing too much treatment there. At this point, use fire to cauterize according to what quantity it fills in the fistula.
Next, insert the burning object into the hole of the fistula, and hold your hand until the heated iron reaches the depth and end of it. Do this either once or in two stages.
Then take care of it afterward, according to what we said about care until it heals.
If it is removed when it's healthy and it heals, that will be good.
And if not, then it will be necessary to uncover the place and remove the infected bone according to what comes out at its head.
Section on the method of cauterization for softened gums and teeth.
Title XXII.
When the gum becomes softened due to moisture and teeth become loose, take care of it with medicines without imposing too much treatment. Then place the head of the sick person in your armpit.
Then apply the fire cauterization, whose form will emerge after this, so that you place a cannula on the tooth: and insert the ignited cauterizing instrument into it quickly; and hold your hand for a moment until the sick person feels the heat of the fire already reaching the root of the tooth.
And raise your hand: then apply the cautery several times, according to what you like.
Then the sick person should fill their mouth with salty water and hold it for an hour: and then spit it out.
For the tooth becomes stronger due to motion, and the gums become softened and tightened, and dried up any dampness that has gone bad.
Chapter XXIII.
When tooth pain is due to coldness, or there is coldness within it, or a worm, and medical treatment does not alleviate the condition: then apply the cautery inside according to two methods: either with butter and cautery: or with oil and cautery.
The method of applying the cautery with butter is such that you take the solidified butter and apply it to the bulla, within a ferric earthenware pot or within a vessel.
Then take a thread and wrap it around the tip of the tongue.
Then immerse it in heated butter and place it gently over the painful tooth, hold it until the heat of the flame reaches the root of the tooth; then repeat this several times until the power of the fire reaches the root of the teeth.
And if you like, immerse wool or a thread into cold butter and place it over the painful tooth. And put an ignited iron over it until the heat reaches deep within the tooth cavity.
The cautery method with fire is to aim for an air tube or iron tube. And there should be some thickness within the body of the instrument so that the sharpness of the fire does not reach the sick person's mouth.
Then apply the fire cautery, which takes the form of a tool. Place it upon that tooth and hold your hand until the cautery cools down.
Do this several times, for pain is relieved, either on the same day or on another.
And it should be that the patient fills their mouth with the good substance of the application of this cautery, holds it for an hour and then spits it out.
This is how the cautery should be applied.
Apply the cautery with any extremity as is possible: and this is the form of the cannula.
Section 1: On the method of applying the cautery to Strophuli.
Chapter XXIV.
When Strophuli are affected by phlegm and cold moisture and do not respond to medication or speed up their digestion with remedies; then apply a concave fire cautery of this form.
Having two open ends, so that the smoke leaves at one end of the cautery from the other end: place it ignited over a blister once and if you need to do it again twice, until it reaches the depth of the blister.
If the blister is small: then apply the cautery according to the size of the blisters.
Then release it for three days, and place over it an infusion mixed with butter until what was burned by the fire is relieved.
Then treat it with the salve of teeth until the form of the cannula is healed.
Section: On the method of applying the cautery to hoarseness and constriction of breathing.
Chapter XXV.
When moist substances lie over the pulmonary canal, especially when it concerns a constitution characterized by coldness, then the sick person should be relieved of medicines first.
Then apply cautery to him at no time near the root of the throat at a depressed location: and be careful not to extend with the cauterizer to the throat or skin, except for some part of it.
Then apply the cauterizer to him at another location on the neck, at the end of his cervical vertebrae while finishing it. And let the cauterizer be like a second one that preceded this method.
Then continue to care for him with what has preceded until he is healed.
¶ Concerning the method of applying cautery in pulmonary disorders and coughing.
Chapter XXVI.
When coughing and lung discomfort are due to cold moisture, and the patient does not have fever or tuberculosis, nor is this discomfort new: then apply two applications of cautery above the gullet at depressed areas, gently, and thoroughly.
And apply another cauterizer in the middle of the chest between the two breasts: and let the cauterizer be like the one that has preceded in shape.
And if you wish for a cautery puncturing with the cauterizer which is called Punctum, whose shape has preceded in ear pain puncture: and let there be punctures from thirty points up to almost as far as others.
Then continue to care for him with what has preceded until he is healed. And now let there be a cauterizer having three branches: according to this shape.
Where the cautery is applied with it, when you do it instead of one threefold cautery.
Regarding the method of applying the cautery for setting the elbow in dislocation.
Head 27.
When the head of the assistant is dislocated due to dampness and does not settle at the time of his return from its dislocation until that becomes a habit for him, then when it gets dislocated by a slight movement, as we have already testified to you, such as this, then it is necessary that you should reduce the dislocation in the first place.
Then the patient is made to lie down on his back, or on the healthy side.
Next, lift the skin which is inside the elbow on top of your left hand with fingers touching the upper part: and if the dislocation concerns the inner side.
Then, holding the cautery lit for two truly. The form of which is as follows.
Next, apply the cautery to the skin until it penetrates through to the other side, and you will obtain the figure of the cautery with four applications.
And sometimes the cautery is applied with a tool having three parts, for which reason then the figure of the cautery results into six more. And there are parts according to the subtlety of the probe.
This is the form of the tool that has three parts for applying the cautery.
And sometimes one adds this method above this manner, which makes eight cauterizations in total.
Then place over the cautery bits of ground herbs mixed with salt.
Then ensure the patient remains at rest, so that they do not move any part of their body while this continues, until they are comforted.
And if the dislocation is towards the upper part, and it rarely occurs like this, then you should burn him above the shoulder with an incising blade or by burning him multiple times in various spots.
And the joint becomes stable and the moisture is removed; and the sick person gets healed.
¶ On the method of burning the Stomach.
Chapter XXVIII.
When cold and multiple dampness occur in the Stomach until it is removed from its composition, and continuous coughs are directed to it, and intensive methods of treatment do not yield results: then it becomes necessary for the sick person to be laid on his back, and extend his legs, and raise his hands.
Then apply the treatment with three burnings; using one unit digit-sized incising blade for the cauterization under the earlobe of the chest, and using an incising blade like a key for the central area. And perform two more burnings below from both sides of the single-blade incision until the figure of the deeper burn appears in a triangular shape.
And stretch it between the two so that they do not join together when pus is being produced. And let the depth of the burn be as thick as two-thirds of the thickness of the skin.
And let the shape of the deeper burn be as follows without addition: and if you wish to apply a large incising blade in the middle of the stomach according to this shape: and let this incision be made by a cauterizing tool according to the figure of a circle according to this shape.
And the stomach is burned by making a mark with this burning tool: and it should be like marks on the stomach that match the size you desire when using a hot tool: then burn him with a puncturing tool: then treat him with the treatment that preceded until he is healed.
On the method of applying cautery To an icy cold subject.
Head 29.
When a pain occurs in the neck due to coldness and moisture, or from dense winds, until he leaves his natural composition of excess discharge, and the patient is treated as we said, but does not benefit in that case: then it should be applied to the sick person over his neck, and three applications of cauterization according to this figure, and the same quantity below the abdomen where a man's arm arrives: and there should be space between each application of cauterization according to the thickness of your finger: and let there be a straight cauterization according to the length of the body: and do not press your hand with the cauterizer for too long.
And let there be the quantity that burns from the thickness of the skin, the medium quantity not added: and let the patient stand on his own feet.
If however he is not standing, then lie down, who now extends his legs and has raised his arms. This is the form of the cauterization.
And indeed it is possible for you to apply these cauterizations with a surgical instrument when you have skill and prudence in the art.
And protect yourself so that you do not proceed too far in cauterization and burn the thickness of the skin throughout, causing the entire body to be burned, and it reaches the intestines: for there is thinness there, therefore know this.
On the method of applying cautery to the neck region.
Head 30.
When there is an eruption, and you need to know if that pustule is within the skin of the neck or on its clothes: then, if it is in the skin of the neck, the patient experiences pain and heaviness without sharpness. And if it's on the clothes of the neck, there is a sudden sharp pain with the pain. You will now see that their treatment has already tired out their doctors.
Therefore, it is necessary that the patient should support themselves on their neck.
Then draw the position for applying the hot needle: then use the cautery, which is likened to a rod.
And this is how it should be done.
And while doing this, apply one cautery until the whole skin is burned out, and go up to the siphon, until all pus comes out. Then care for the healing of the exits, until it is healed.
And it is not necessary for me to use this type of cautery, except for someone whose study in the art of medicine has been prolonged: and for whom illnesses come with experience often enough. Then he may dare upon such operations.
But rather to dispense with it, as far as I am concerned, is better.
Section: On the method of cauterization for pleurisy.
Title XXXI.
The ancients said that for cold pleurisy, the cautery should be used with the roots of the plant Aristolochia in this way.
And it is such that you take a long root from the dry roots of Aristolochia, one longer root which can be found there, and it should be like the thickness of a finger.
Then immerse it in oil: and then ignite it with fire.
Then apply a single cautery where there is the connection between the breastbone and the neck, and with two smaller cauterizations somewhat declining to the lower part, towards the area under the beard.
And also with two cauterizations in the area between the fifth and sixth ribs, downwards slightly: and another cautery in the middle of the chest, and one above the stomach.
And three incisions for the burners: one where there are between two spoons: and two incisions for both sides of the chest, lower burner which is between two spoons.
And it is not necessary to press your hand with the burner, rather there should be a clear smell of skin when it is burning. And some of the old ones have said that there are people who use a burner made from iron similar to a compass. They ignite it and then insert it inside where is between the ribs, until they reach with it to the pustule, and come out healed: just as we explained in the case of the Epa's pustules.
But with this incision using the burner there is a concern that either the patient will die immediately, or a窦 opens up at the site, which does not heal.
¶ On the method of burning the spleen Chapter 32.
When you treat spleen illness, as we discussed from the treatment of illnesses divided by time, and if your cure does not succeed, then for burning there are three methods for it, all of which are correct.
One of these is to make three or four burns, laid out in a row according to the length of the spleen, like the figure of Epa's burners that preceded it.
And let there be between each burn the width of a finger, or more or less.
And let the intensity of the burn, as we said about the burn at Epa's place, be equal.
And do not press your hand with the burner: and let the patient be in a raised position on his back.
Another method for burning is: having two actual burners as we explained in the chapter on dislocation of the shoulder blade. And lift the skin which is directly over the spleen, where the patient's left elbow reaches to. And make your lifting action for lifting skin according to the width of the body, so that the burns fall longitudinally according to the length of the body.
Then insert two heated needles until you penetrate the skin from the other side; then remove the cautery: thus four cauterizations are made. And if you wish to cauterize with another cautery having three needles.
Then after you let the cautery out for it to emit pus for many days, as it is more purifying than all that went before from the treatment.
Section: On the method of cauterization in Hydrocele.
Title XXXIII.
The cautery does not fall into hydrocele unless it is properly asclitic.
When you treat Hydrocele with the methods of treatment we have discussed in division, and if the treatment does not sufficiently heal, then it is necessary to apply four cauterizations around the umbilicus, a single cautery over the stomach, another over the epar, one over the spleen, and two cauterizations behind along the vertebras, and one directly on the breast, and another directly on the stomach. And let the depth of the cauterization be about as thick as the skin.
Then let the open cautery emit pus over a prolonged period of time.
And do not discharge the invalid from treatment after cauterization with him: it is necessary that two intentions should unite in this: and he will hasten towards his own healing with God's help.
The shape of the cautery with which the stomach is cauterized should be a crescent: according to its previous shape. And the one used for cauterizing the back should be an oval, according to its previous shape.
Section: On the method of cauterization for Feet and Legs. Title XXXIV.
When blisters appear due to dropsy and they become filled with yellowish water: you must cauterize on the top of the foot at the point known as 'nocrati', which is situated between the auricular part and the annular part. Then raise your hand with the cauterizer, do not twist it. Next, raise your hand again, don't go too far with it entirely.
Indeed, the yellow water will reappear, and perform the cauterization according to this shape.
Then, make two cauterizations on each of the two legs across the entire leg, and perform a cauterization at the tip of the knife-shaped cauterizer. Perform a cauterization according to the length of the leg, one under the knee and the other somewhat lower, roughly midway down the leg. Then do two cauterizations over every hip joint: and allow the open cauterizer to heal without prolonged care until some water is able to resurface from it: then take care of it along with what we have said previously.
Regarding the method of cauterization in the solution of the belly. Title XXXV.
When the belly becomes dissolved due to cold and moisture until it weakens the retained and digesting strengths which are in the stomach and intestines: then heal this according to the methods of healing, and do not cure. You will see a weakened being able to tolerate the cauterization of excessive strength, then cauterize him with a large cauterizer on his stomach as he did when cauterizing the stomach with a circular cauterizer, and four small cauterizations around the navel with a narrow triangular cauterizer: then perform a large cauterization over the inguinal region above the pubis, or use two cauterizers.
And if you see excessive moisture and a weakened person tolerating this, then cauterize him with a cauterizer on the ribcage, and another on every part of his body. And perhaps you might add two small cauterizations near the large stomach.
For indeed, the treatment is successful, which help does not fail.
¶ On the method of cauterizing hemorrhoids.
Head 36.
When there are many old hemorrhoids or one, and they are caused by thick, cold, or damp humors that persist even after treatment as described in division [referring to a previous section], and if the usual cure does not work: then cauterize with three applications of cautery over the lower part of the vertebral spine beneath the navel, in an area roughly shaped like a triangle. Apply the cautery under the navel as if it were two fingers wide.
And if you consider that their stomach is cooled down and their food does not digest properly, and if you see their face reddening due to this condition, then cauterize them with a large cautery over the stomach according to what precedes: and apply it on its Epar [a term possibly referring to a specific organ or region], and use another application on its Splen (possibly referring to a type of organ) using an iron-shaped cautery. Allow the open cautery to rest at some point in time, then continue tending to them until they are healed.
¶ On the method of cauterizing adenoids after their removal.
Head 37.
When you remove the adenoids, then use a cautery that resembles a rod.
Then insert the ignited one into the removed adenoids: and hold your hand until the cautery reaches the vein's opening from which blood flows: do this once or twice. If therefore the adenoids are many, then cauterize each one with a cautery according to what we have described.
Then care for them as you apply the means that are agreeable to the ointments until they heal.
And if you cauterize it with a large cauterizer on bone wax, it is more beneficial for healing.
On the method of cauterizing an anal fistula.
Chapter XXXVIII.
When the patient does not respond to the section and operation that we have described in its appropriate place, and is frightened by it, perhaps healing occurs with cauterization.
And when an Anal Fistula occurs and sets in, pus flows from it, and corrupted moisture escapes.
Therefore, what is more suitable is to probe it with a delicate instrument.
Then, determine the depth of its depth using a probe.
Then apply a cauterizer that resembles a rod.
Then, insert yourself, lit up, into the Anal Fistula and determine the depth to which the probe has gone. And apply the cauterizer repeatedly to that area until all corrupted bodies are burned, once, or twice, or three times, according to your need's amount.
And protect yourself from the irritation of the nerve, if there is one there or in a large vein. Or if the Fistula drains to the Bladder Body, or to the Intestine Body, then protect yourself from all these areas.
And do not perform that, unless when the Fistula is in a fleshy area: and you think, because it is not penetrating.
Then attend to the area until it has been healed.
If the area is sealed and materials are removed from it, and there remains such a long time: then you will know that he has been healed completely.
And if they do not remove from it any substance, then you will know that there is a penetrating thing, or the mouth of him is corrupted deeply within, or as one of these comes from among them: and this reminiscence will come to its place.
How to perform cautery on the kidneys.
Title Thirty-Nine.
When pain occurs in the kidneys due to coldness or from thick winds and it is diminished by this, then you must apply cautery over the umbilicus on their own kidneys, with a cylindrical cautery on the entire kidney, following which there will be a reminiscence.
And perhaps we apply cautery again within its abdominal cavity.
Therefore, three lines will be present.
Therefore, they are more effective in healing.
How to perform cautery on the bladder.
Title Forty. When weakness and dullness occur in the bladder due to cold and moisture until the patient no longer retains urine, then you should apply cautery on the lower part of the suminis over the bladder where hair begins. Start from the right side of suminis and from the left side of this: let the length of that cautery be equal to the width of a finger's breadth. And apply cautery in the inferior part of the back, or with two applications of cautery if you need it: and let its width be as described by the previous cautery using the thumb. And apply cautery again at the inferior edge or with two applications if necessary: and make it as described by a cylindrical cautery beforehand.
How to perform cautery on the uterus. Title Forty-One.
When there is coldness and moisture in the womb, which prevents pregnancy from occurring and corrupts her periods, causing delay in their occurrence, and when she experiences pain during their arrival, then it is necessary to apply three cauterizations around the umbilicus, as we have said about cauterization of the bladder, and a cylindrical cautery on the lower abdomen. Let this be a cylindrical cautery.
On the method of cauterizing the thumb in dislocation.
Title XLII.
When the moist substances spread towards the base of the thumb and cause its departure from its place: and the sign of this is that when they are compared against each other, the crus extends over the other one. And the location of the dislocation is found to be in it as a vacuum.
Therefore, you must cauterize the tender spot above the base of the thumb with a similar circular cautery. After marking it with an iron around the area of the base, as it rotates; and let the tip of the base fall into the middle of the circle.
And let the shape of the cautery precede in the cauterization of the stomach.
And if this cautery is not available to you, then cauterize it with three cauterizations, using a large oil-filled cautery. And let the depth of the cautery be according to the thickness of the entire skin.
Then take care of it until it is healed.
On the method of cauterization for Sciatica. Title XLIII.
When pain occurs in the base of the thumb and it is caused by cold and moisture; and if the sick person remains with this as we said in division, and there is no cure, and it persists: then you must relieve the sick from the thick fluids with stinking pills, or with artificial pills, and similar remedies.
Then cauterize him.
And the method of cauterization for this is according to two methods: either a cautery with aromatic medicines or a cautery with fire.
The cautery with fire, according to many methods.
One method is, to cauterize over the point of the hook using three triangular cauteries, according to this form.
And make them have a good depth, or a bad one.
And let there be space that exists between each and every cautery, equal to the thickness of a finger's width: make it an oil-coated cautery.
However, sometimes the cautery is made in the middle over the tip of the hook itself.
Therefore there are four cauteries.
And if you cauterize with a circle, whose form precedes the cauterization of the dislocation of the hook, do it once: so that there be a circle containing the entire hook.
And burn through the thickness of all the skin.
This is the method of cauterization for Sciatica, when the pain adheres to the hook itself and does not extend down to the thigh and calf.
But if it extends down to the thigh and calf, then cauterize him with two cauteries over the thigh, over the place where the patient is bent there, wherever pain exists, and your cautery on the nodule of four fingers slightly downwards: let it be a surgical knife cautery. And let the depth of the cauterization be according to the thickness of the skin.
And if the patient bends that the pain extends almost to the toes, then cauterize him there where he bent with a point cautery, three times, or four times, or as many times as it needs for him.
And if he bends the pain to be below the knee towards the calf, then cauterize him there with a single surgical knife cautery.
And remember in all your applications of cautery that you do not burn with the cautery to the point of damaging nerves or great arteries, and thereby inflict harm upon the sickly either through scarring or constriction.
And indeed I have seen one and another from those who burned above the stone, and ended in their application of cautery. The leg swelled until a tumor formed below it, and the entire foot was punctured and then rotted away. Afterwards there is a rupture of the abdomen, and death follows that.
If pain occurs in both parts simultaneously, apply cautery to both according to this method.
And some wise men said about the application of cautery to the ankle, regarding this method of cautery.
Make a similar one from iron, whose diameter is half of a palm: and have it at its opening according to the thickness of the core of a finger, or slightly less precisely. And within this iron piece, place a third piece of iron inside.
And let the space between each piece of iron be by the size of a joint of a thumb: and have all pieces of iron open from both parts. And let their height be like a knot, or two knots. And make handles for them out of iron that are centrally fitting in relation to the pieces of iron.
And this is its form.
Then heat it over the fire until it turns red and expels sparks. Then place it on a poultice over the ankle of the sick person lying down on their healthy side.
So apply three round applications of cautery to it once.
Then let him rest for three days.
Then dress the wound with butter, and leave the open wound to heal over many days.
Then care it together with the ointment until it is healed.
Albucasis said, regarding this form of cauterization or its offspring, we have not used it much due to the fear of its appearance: therefore, because we find few who wait for it.
However, it is from among the good cauterizations that he who endures it, and finds its place with him.
The cauterization with those who endure medicines is such that you make two samia (a type of reed used for medical purposes) with a perforated bracelet through which the hinge of his door descends from the air or iron, having the same length as the walls: their heights have two knots, or rather they themselves.
And let the space that is between the two be as much as the width of a finger, and let them be open at the bottom and top: and they should contain themselves to each other according to this shape.
Then place it over the sand bath, with the sick person lying on the healthy side.
And press your hand onto the sand bath of the anchor many times.
Then pour between two circles made from hot water, which has been heated with a fire for a while, and keep it for the amount of time that makes up an hour: and the sick person will endure his biting and the heating of it himself, as he finds out the biting like a flame, until the biting subsides.
Then raise your hand with the tool and wipe off the hot water from the anchor entirely with sweet water: then let that be done for three days.
And put butter on it until the heated blackness is removed: and let that be for several days, and pus comes out from it.
For it is the last thing in healing.
Then care for that with ointments until it is healed.
If the pain extends to the hip or thigh, make him lie on that which contains water as you did before when the wound was of equal length.
And this is the method for using warm water: and I have already written about it in my treatise on correcting medical practices.
Take alum and ashes that have not been completely burnt together, split one part of them. Rub both parts thoroughly, put them into a new jar whose bottom is pierced with a small hole, according to the quantity it can contain, its radius: and place another treated jar under the base of the jar; let the water mix with the alum and ashes come out on top of them that submerges each by an inch: after which you compress them with your hand in good compression: and pour off the jar until the sharper water comes out from the bottom part of the treated jar.
Then collect all that water and pour it over another ashes: and heat it until it is renewed.
Indeed, it will then be very sharp and corrosive, which is administered in many medical operations, and for cauterizing other body parts.
Because it produces the effect of fire itself.
And among medical preparations used for cauterization of ointments, just like with resins and cardon fruit, and lime with soap, so that both are mixed together.
And indeed, Galen recounted in his writings about a man from the old times who was treated for pain and vein inflammation of the sciatic nerve, and he praised the effect greatly.
And he said, because no other treatment is necessary, and because he was cured by the use of one thing, until he returned, because perhaps he went into the bath that had been prepared, and came out from it already healed. And it must be taken from the root of the green herb: and if green is not found, take the dry, fresh one: and much should be ground with a little fat, and put over where there is pain, or on the leg, or in the thigh: and it should be tied up, and removed after three hours, or to whatever degree the patient feels the heat of the application.
Then immerse him in the bath.
And when his body becomes moist, immerse him in the stool.
For the pain goes away and he is healed.
And know that no one should use any cautery with these remedies unless after the body's evacuation.
And as Dioscorides said, that the dung of goats, when used with cautery on a sciatic vein, cools it down: and the cautery is done according to this manner.
Wool is taken and soaked in old oil, and placed on the deep spot which is between the big toe and the instep, being closer to the instep.
Then take dry dung of goats and ignite him in fire until it becomes charcoal.
And then put the charred dung over the wool, and remove it when it is extinguished.
Then repeat this procedure.
Therefore do not stop doing that until the sensation reaches up to the ankle through the application, and then let the pain rest.
This method of cauterization is named the Vaccinal Cauterizm.
On the treatment of back pain through cautery.
Title 42.
Sometimes pain occurs in the back for various reasons, either due to chance, impact, over-excretion, or similar conditions, resulting from the infusion of cold and moist substances. Indeed, cautery does not fall except in this single species alone, which results from the infusion of cold matter.
Therefore, after evacuating the patient with stinking pills and similar remedies, they should be applied where there is pain on the back. Three lines are made according to the width of half a finger in that place. After that, the marks are made with an iron stick in every line for five times, or more depending on the quantity that comes out from the patient's tolerance, and this action is performed while applying cautery points.
And if it is necessary, apply the cautery three times, or four, using a median claw-like cautery according to this shape.
On the method of applying cautery for an early gibbosity.
Title 45.
This affliction occurs frequently among young, full-term infants.
And the sign of its beginning in children is: a constriction that occurs during his intake and movement when he is breathing heavily on him. You find at the last cervical vertebra and nodes of it, which has already begun to protrude above the other vertebrae.
And when you see this and wish to do it, then apply the cautery with a circular cautery according to this shape.
And let the cautery be applied evenly over all parts to the spondylus. If you intend to cauterize around the spondylus with a point of the cautery, then two or three lines, and make points close to each other.
Then care for the wound until it heals together with what we have said.
And beware, do not apply the cautery to the hump that forms due to nerve spasm.
In regards to the manner of cauterization for gout and joint pains. Chapter 46.
When joint pains are caused by cold moisture spreading to any part of the body, and when pains occur in the feet, according to the customs of physicians, they would name this condition properly as gout.
So when the treatment for cold-caused gout does not alleviate the pains despite following cure methods, then they apply the cautery to remove them.
And it is that you should apply the cautery around the area of the foot after bowel evacuation, using multiple applications of the cautery: and use oil-based cautery.
This is how it is done.
And if you need to make points on the face of the foot, then do so with a point from the cautery.
If the pains rise to the knees or other joints and often happen like this, then apply the cautery evenly over all parts of each knee with three or four applications, using the same method as for treatment with a knife (Clauili). If however you need more of this cautery, then apply it again. And do not immerse your hand in the cautery, rather let its application be about the thickness of the skin only.
If pains then rise up to the knees and back, then administer what we have said about the cautery in his own chapter.
If pains are only in the hands, then make incisions around the wrist area, as they say two lines should be drawn.
If, however, there remains from the pains in the fingers, then prick them, over every joint point, and over the palm of the hand.
If pains rise up after days to the elbows or shoulders, then apply the cautery to each from all sides.
And do not let the sick person be relieved by good management, by the reception of medicines.
For if good treatment is done, and phlegm is expelled, it will be cured with the help of God using this cautery.
¶ On the method of applying the cautery in Wounds.
Chapter 47.
When a rupture occurs in the groin and the intestines or spermatic cord descends to the testicle, and this starts close by: then it is necessary that you command the sick person to relieve themselves on their usual day.
And use those remedies which cause the feces to come down from their own belly.
Then let him sit between your hands on his back: and command him to hold his breath until he exhales, or until the spermatic cord or intestine appears.
Then guide him back with your fingers, and apply the mark with the cautery under the rupture on the palm of his hand, using a mark that resembles half the diameter of a circle at the top part of the body.
Then apply the cautery fire, which has this form, until white comes out and urine flows.
Then return the intestine or the sponge to its own concavity.
Then let the attendant place his hand on the spot so that the intestine does not escape: and you have now opened between the thighs of the sick person, and placed a pillow underneath, and someone else is serving above his thighs, and another one above his chest who holds the hands.
Then place the cautery on him at the mark, with your hand holding the cautery straight above it.
And hold him until you follow his mouth with it: or turn him alternately on other sides if you have not followed him from the first up to the mouth.
And carefully observe the exit of the intestine during your cautery, so as not to burn it, and may it not escape over the sick person causing death or great harm.
And know that when you do not follow with your cautery during the operation, your action is incomplete.
And it must be that the children's cautery is subtle, according to their measure.
Then take care with the remaining ointments until they have healed.
And let the sick person lie on his back for forty days until the wound is sealed.
And it is necessary to provide for his sustenance during the time of his healing in a way that soothes his stomach: so as not to allow the intestine to escape at the point and after eating.
Then, when he wishes to rise after forty days, then administer a ligature made centrally and let him be held by others for another forty days.
For when this regimen is used, then complete healing occurs.
When however wounds happen in the rest of the body, and are beginning, and one wishes not to allow them to add, then burn the wound with a round cauterizing tool according to its quantity: and let that which is burned be from then on like a third of it.
Then care for it, with what we said: and do not let it increase.
And some of the first said: that the wound should be burned with a triangular cauterizing tool, according to this shape.
After it is marked with a hot iron, and a line is made which is across the width at the upper side of the wound, and another line downwards. And place your hand in the middle with the triangular cauterizing tool.
But the first cauterizing is easier and better. § On the method of cauterization for pains due to case or impact.
Chapter 48.
When it happens in certain limbs due to an accident or impact, and that pain persists for a long time without receiving treatment from the physicians: then it must be burned with a punctum cauterizing tool.
And the cauterizing for any limb should be according to its size, shape, weakness and strength of that limb, as well as the position of twisting, and pain from it.
If therefore it is healed by the first cauterizing, it is good.
If not: then apply another cauterization on top of it.
Because regarding these pains, they tend to shift from one part of the body to that which is close to it.
Therefore, you must continue with the application of the cautery until the patient has healed.
Regarding the method of applying cauterization for Leprosy.
Title 49.
However, leprosy sometimes benefits from a more intense application of the cautery.
And particularly the species of leprosy which arises from phlegm and melancholy putrefaction: therefore, consider how vigorously to apply the cautery against it.
If then leprosy is spreading, and you have treated it as we said in the division, and it does not descend, nor remain stationary: and you judge that corruption has spread over his entire body. Then cauterize him over the head with five applications of the cautery: one in the middle of the head which is known, and the second below this towards the forehead at the end of the hairline, and two above two horns, and one after on the cervical bones.
And with the last touch of your cautery, gently continue until it prints a small impression in the mouth and the layers start to separate from this: so that the heavy fumes' expiration is relieved from there, and cauterize also with the cautery on the spleen itself according to what precedes.
And if leprosy has already spread over the patient and is clearly visible then you should apply these treatments as we said in the head and use cautery on the end of the nose, and two applications of the cautery on the cheeks, and two applications of the cautery on the cervical vertebrae, and six applications of the large cautery on the tailbone and one above it on the belly: and two on each hip; namely one over the entire hip bone, and two over the knees: one over every knee, and two over the shoulders, and two over the biceps, and two over the pectoral tendernesses: and cauterize him across all the joints, from the joints of his fingers' hands and feet: and cauterize also over the entire heel of each foot and the knuckles of his hands.
And take care of the nerves that are above the very last part of the heel, so as not to burn them. And sometimes the cautery is applied over the gum, and with another one over the mouth of the stomach, and with yet another over the anus.
And know that the more you apply the cautery, the more beneficial it is, and the more it heals.
And know that the sick do not find pain in cautery as the healthy do; for their body is already numbed.
And it must be that the cautery is of size and quality according to limbs and joints: as they precede from types of tools.
Head L.
When a certain member becomes numb and is treated with medicines, oils, and plasters but does not heal, then apply the cautery to that numb member according to the size or quality of its parts.
And make your cautery shallow enough to go only through the thickness of the skin.
Then care for it with a balm until it heals.
And sometimes the person is made numb by a cautery applied to certain parts where numbness occurs, such as hands and feet. This happens at the spine's exit points of nerves that move this part of the body: and this removes the numbness.
However, do not apply it blindly unless one is knowledgeable about the anatomy of the limbs and the egress of moving nerves.
On the method of cauterization in Albaras.
Head 51.
When Albucasis is old, and there is nothing from the inventions of medicine: then cauterize on it with a deep cauterization moderately, according to the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness is removed, and its color changes.
Then care for it with the herb flour, and lentils with rose oil, and leaves of arnoglossa, and pigeon blood, and rabbit's blood: take a portion of each. Mix all these together and spread them on a cloth, and apply to the affected area until healed.
On the method of cauterization in Cancer.
Head 52.
When Cancer begins, and you stand it: then cauterize it with a circular cauterization around its circumference, as if it was being revolved.
Wise ones said that it should be cauterized with the last cauterization in the middle.
But to me, that doesn't seem right: because I fear it will become infected; and I have seen that happen many times. And the right way is to cauterize it with a circle around it, as we said, or with multiple cauterizations. On the method of cauterization in Adubelati.
Head 53.
When someone has Adubelati, and its maturation is delayed, or due to overabundance causing it, or due to the age being weak with little blood, or due to the time pressing for the maturation of Adubelati, then cauterize around it with many small-pointed multiple cauterizations.
Then remove it.
And it will hasten with ripening.
If however you pierce its bladder with a cautery, then apply the cautery, which is thus shaped.
And place it in the middle of the Adubei, until the skin penetrates: and let the cautery be from what follows diseased, so that the flow of pure things may be assisted.
And then care for it until it is healed.
Section on the method of applying cautery to a corroding sore. Title 44.
A corroding sore is nothing other than corruption traveling within the limb, and it eats away at it: just as fire devours dry wood.
If therefore you see a corroding sore in a place that can bear the cautery with fire, then apply many small and large cauterizing tools according to the need of the place where the corroding is present.
And then apply the cautery to every part until you eradicate all the corruption, and let nothing of it remain completely. And then let it heal for three days, and place on the areas that have been cauterized powdered sulfur mixed with oil, until all the scabs and all corruption are eradicated.
And then care for it using ointments that generate flesh.
And if after three days you see that new healthy flesh has been born, which contains no corruption, it is good.
And if not: then apply the cautery again over what has remained from diseased areas.
And sometimes, when there is a corroding sore, it is treated with an acute medicine.
For indeed, it rises from the site of the cauterization.
Indeed, however, the cauterizing with fire is faster in assistance: and I have already said that its cauterization with acute medicine was divided into sections. Therefore, take it there when you need it.
On the method of cauterizing in Clauis and Verucis. Title LV.
This illness happens many times in the lower parts of the feet; and it is a thick, filtered substance that injures the foot. And indeed, there is cauterization in them according to two methods: cauterization with fire, and cauterization with hot water.
As for the cauterization with fire, it should be like a conical firebrand similar to a goose's bill made of iron, according to its capacity to contain a clavus from all sides: and let there be fine edges.
Then place the ignited one upon the clavus. Then move the hand with the cauterizer around the clavus, until the cauterization reaches the depth of the clavus. Let it be for three days, until pus begins to discharge. Then apply the plaster with rue plants, crushed with salt, and let the plaster be applied over it at night. For it will be eradicated from its roots.
Then take care of the site with a regenerating ointment until it heals.
If they do not heal and it happens frequently on the surface of the body, especially in hands and feet, then administer cauterization with hot water. And it is such that you take a tube made from air, or iron, or from a goose's bill: and place it over the clavus, or elsewhere affected by the issue.
Then place a small quantity of warm water in the tube. Keep your hand while you move it with pressure, gently turning it to mark the margin of the tube at the base of the knife-like object. Let the warm water find its way deep down, reaching the base of the knife-like object: and let the patient lie for an hour slightly above the site treated by warm water.
Then release him, for the knife-like object is removed with its roots.
Do this to them one by one until you have treated all that belongs to them in the body.
Then take care of them after they are removed, with what grows from the substance of the ointment.
¶ On the method of cauterization in Tremonia.
Head 56.
When tremor happens to someone due to cold on the nerve, or from quartan fever, or otherwise: then it is necessary that you burn them with four burns, or five over the spinous processes of the spine, and between every spinous process by a burn, and in their chest by a burn, and over their stomach by a burn.
For tremor stops with an olive oil burn, and hastens the recovery from cold illness. ¶ On the method of cauterization for Albaithir.
Head 57.
At times, there are expelled from the body Albaithir's impurities, that is, pus sores which occur due to rotten materials.
Therefore, it should be done initially when they first appear, by burning over every head of a pus sore with a fine burn using the end of a piece of myrtle wood that has been lit with fire.
And when the long root of the Aristolochia plant.
And with a lens-shaped cautery. And sometimes the small penises are burned at the beginning of their expulsion according to this method: and they do not increase; and excess is broken off making them, and they are healed from there.
However, it must happen this after the bloodletting.
On the method of burning during the flow of blood from an artery at the wound.
Chapter LXXXVIII. It often happens that there is a flow of blood from an artery which has been cut at the wound; it occurs externally or at the incision made by animal teeth or a member's cautery and similar things. And it becomes difficult to remove it.
So when such a thing happens to someone, then hurry with your hand to the opening of the artery, and place your index finger on it: and squeeze it much until the blood is confined under your finger and nothing escapes from it. Then place a small olive oil cautery in the fire and many of them: and blow over it until they burn strongly.
Then take one from them, or a little, or much, according to the wound and place where the artery was cut, and place the cautery over the vein after you quickly remove your finger: and hold the cautery until the blood is removed.
And if the blood is expelled when you raise your finger from the artery's opening and extinguish the cautery, then take another cautery quickly, among those which are prepared in the fire. Do not cease to do that until one thing follows another and blood is discharged.
And beware, do not burn the nerve which is there, lest some other mischief happen to the sick person. And know that when blood flows from an artery, it is not possible to cut it; especially if the artery is large, except with one or four methods.
Or with cautery, as we said.
Or by extraction when it cannot be extracted. For when it is extracted, its extremities contract and blood is discharged.
For when it is extracted, its extremities contract and blood is discharged. Or it can be tied with thread using strong ligature.
Or apply medicinal substances of which the property is to discharge blood, and bind them with a suitable constrictive bandage.
Those who administer the removal of its action with a bandage and constriction with cloth, or by the positioning of things that are being burned or similar, do not completely cut it off, except rarely.
If it happens to someone else and there is no present physician nor medicine: then begin with the positioning of the index finger over the opening of that vein as we told you before, and with its constriction greatly until blood is forced from the upper part of the wound and above the artery.
And the finger is not removed, instead it is applied with cold water from above always in a burst of coldness until the blood congeals and thickens, then it can be cut. And meanwhile he should consider what needs to be done from cautery or from medicine.
¶ The Conclusion of the First Part.
Book of Surgery by Albucasis Part II. On Incision, Piercing, and Phlebotomy in Wounds, and similar conditions.
We have discussed in the first chapter, every illness where it is appropriate to combine fire for cauterization and medicine that burns, and its occasions, causes of its occurrence, and its instruments, as well as forms of cauterization. And I placed the headings from the head down to the feet there.
And I will proceed in this chapter with that same method: to provide the sought-after information for those who are seeking it. And before I begin this, you must learn, O sons, what is found in this chapter from the fear that was present in the first chapter about cauterization.
And because of this, there needs to be a greater caution in it, as the operation which is performed in this chapter often leads to blood loss, and the maintenance of life stands at an opening of a vein, or a incision over a boil, or an opening of urine flow, or healing of wounds, or extraction of arrows, or incisions over stones, and similar issues; from all these there comes trembling and fear, and death occurs in many of them.
And I advise you not to fall into the trap of what causes hesitation, for sometimes people with various illnesses will come to you in this art.
For there are those who become angry with their illness, and death is gentle to him: due to the severity of what he finds from his sickness and the length of his wickedness.
And when illness is from fear that signifies death.
And from them is he who gives his doctor to you and grows with him in hope of health, but his sickness is harmful. Therefore, it does not mean you should agree with him who comes to you from them, whose measure is such.
And let your caution be more intense than your greed and your self-interest.
And do not presume about anything from it, unless after certain knowledge, which confirms that which leads to a commendable succession at your place.
And use it in the care of all your patients, for prediction and indication towards what is beneficially suitable for health.
Therein indeed serves as an aid to you in the attainment of fame and glory, and memory and praise.
May God inspire you, my children, to understand His will, and not take away your guidance and inspiration from Him, for that is within His control.
And indeed, I have arranged this chapter by sections, following the order that came before in the chapter on cautery, from neck to feet: so that you can find what you wish from it and what you need.
¶ On the treatment of water which is combined in children's heads.
Head I.
Know that this sickness happens many times to children around birth: or when the midwife tightens the head of a child without lifting it.
And sometimes it also happens for an unknown cause which is not known.
And indeed, I did not observe this sickness in others but only in children; and death threatened every one of them from it: therefore, it seemed to me fitting for me to abandon the operation on such matters.
And indeed I saw among them a boy, whose head was filled with water, and the size of his head increased every day until he could not sit upon himself due to the size of his own head: and the moisture increased until he died.
And this moisture indeed, either accumulates between the skin and mouth; or accumulates under the bone above the sinuses.
And the operation in such a case, if moisture is between the skin and mouth, and there is little abscess, then it must have a groove in the middle of the head one in width: and let the length of the groove be as long as two knuckles until the moisture has drained.
And this is the form of the spatillum.
If therefore the moisture is more increased, and the abscess is larger, then place these two grooves according to this form.
And if the moisture is under the bone, and its sign is that you see the openings of the skull from all sides: and water is compressed when you press it with your hand to the interior, and what happens does not hide from you: then it must have three grooves in the middle of the head, according to this manner.
And after making the cut, extract all the moisture.
Then, wash that over it with wine and oil until the fifth day.
Then remove the bandage, and take care of the wound with wadding and ointments.
And do not let the head be bound with equal tightness.
And feed the sick person with all dry food with little moisture until the member is comforted and healed.
And another method for the incision is, that you observe where the size of the abscess becomes visible, and the collection of water.
For sometimes there is more in the back of the head, or at the forehead part, or on the right side, or on the left.
So ascend with your incision where you see the abscess and the filling of water: and divide that according to what is possible for you.
And observe, do not cut into the artery and let a flow of blood happen, and the sick person may die from that flow with the evacuation of moisture.
¶ Concerning incisions in arteries which occur behind the ears.
Head II.
When someone experiences a cough reaching their eyes or chest, and the usual medical treatments do not improve the condition; then, at this point, the last resort treatment is through an incision of these two arteries.
So when you wish to incise them, the sick person must shave their head.
Then scrape the area with a rough cloth so that the arteries become visible.
Then, let the sick person tighten their neck with any of their own cloth.
Then observe, where the pulse beats.
And the locations of each one are those that are below the ears and depressed: they rarely remain hidden, except in some individuals.
Then mark both places with a hot wax or burnish: and make the cuts on both sides with sharp blades so that they reach up to the opening of each artery; and do this horizontally across the width of the head.
And if you wish, insert the blades under the artery and make the cut upwards with your incision.
And let the length of the cut be about two fingers joined together.
And when the vein is incised, blood flows out in a pulsatile discharge, which jumps within the internals with frequent leaps.
And if the artery is not perceived by touch, then it is necessary to measure from the ear the length of space corresponding to three fingers.
Then mark with a hot iron and extend until you reach the mouth.
And what must be released from the blood is six uncia (an old unit of measurement) and perhaps you might release more or less than that. Do the whole thing according to the quantity which appears to you from the patient's illness and the filling of his artery.
Then direct your attention to the wound.
And then, if there remains near the mouth anything from the nostril, then cut that way, so as not to create a hot abscess: then bind the wound with linens sown together.
And afterwards care for it with ointment until it heals.
¶ Concerning the removal of arteries which are located near joints.
Chapter III.
When it happens to a man with an old hemicrania, or acute congestion due to acrimonious moisture and heat at the joints of his limbs, or with age-old soda and similar conditions: when he is treated according to methods of medical treatment, and does not bring about this result; then we are accustomed to these illnesses involving the removal of arteries from the joints, or cauterization of them, as we have described.
And the method of action in removing them is, that the patient shaves the hairs which are on the joints, and reaches to the visible artery in the joint.
Indeed, it is shown to you by its own pulse, and it is rarely hidden unless in few people, or in the confusion of cold.
If it is hidden from you, then the sick person should hold their head with any of their cloth: afterwards rub the area with a rough cloth.
Or soak the place with hot water, until you see a clear manifestation of it. Then take the spatula, which I formed earlier. Next, scrape off the skin with it until you reach the artery.
Then insert a hook into it and pull it up to the higher areas until you remove it from the skin, making sure that it comes out from all sides of the layers beneath it.
If the artery is thin, then encircle it with the tip of the hook.
Then cut out from that part according to the amount by which its ends extend and are pulled together, and do not allow any blood flow.
For if you do not cut and if you do not remove it completely, the blood does not rise fully. Next, drain out of the blood up to 6 ounces, until you reach 3 ounces.
If the artery is large, then you must tie it in two places with a strong, doubled thread of silk or from animal gut so that it does not reach the place before healing has occurred and blood flow happens.
Then cut off the surplus which is between the two ligatures.
Do that at that hour or after another hour. And if need be, cauterize it with a cauterizing tool until the ends of it are reached and it remains in place.
And it is better if the patient has a fever, or if their complexion has been made hot.
Since cautery consists of those things which help to terminate moisture.
Therefore it is better for the aid.
And after removing the arteries, it is necessary to fill the cavity with an old cloth: and they should place over it small bundles of centrally made reeds.
And after the discharge is treated with dry medicines which cause flesh to be born and with licains, until it is healed.
If during the operation a blood flow occurs from an artery, then quickly cut it off with cautery or fill the place with wax: and hold your hand until the blood is cut off.
If nothing of these is present for you, then place your finger on the spot until the blood congeals.
And immerse the area with water of extreme coldness until the pain subsides, and tie it according to what is needed.
And because that which is lighter and easier for the removal of an artery exists, it is to be done by applying this cautery with two knives: let the sharpness of both knives be similar to amalgam.
However, they have much less sharpness than two knives.
For if they are as sharp as two knives, each of them tends to cause coldness: and flesh does not come into contact with speed.
And since there is a small amount of thickness in them, heat from the fire remains within them, and flesh is cut quickly: for this reason it is better with all operations, and lighter, and easier.
And let the space that is between two knives be the thickness of a finger, after you mark two places with the hot iron: and leave both burning strongly, until they reach the mouth, and penetrate the vein in both places: so that what is between its ends may extend.
And they do not become entirely hardened with this cautery.
This is the form of the cautery.
Section on the care of frequent and persistent weeping from the eyes.
Title IV.
When there are frequent tears, and a flow of them from the eyes, which are on the scalp outside the head: and nothing of medical treatment is applied with medicines when they do this, you see the face of the sick already turning red, and feels a movement in his forehead, like the movement of ants: and his eyes are weakened, moist, so that his hairs are corroded by moisture: and his eyelids are heated by the sharpness of tears: then the old relied on this treatment for them, and called it 'curing with Ense'.
And it is to shave off the hairs that are on his forehead.
Then make three cuts across the forehead, spaced evenly according to the length of the forehead: and let the length of each cut be roughly two fingers, with one cut equidistant from the nose's length in the middle of the forehead, the second cut according to the length slightly to either side of where tears would flow, and the third cut on the other side. Make sure not to touch the incisions made for arteries located at both sides: extend your hand away from the continuation of the two mandibles, so that all cuts span an area equivalent to three connected fingers: prepare a sponge or multiple dried cloths for you, with which you can soak up blood.
Then insert the spatula of the two sharp ends, whose following form is described.
From the incision which is on the part of the temporal region, up to the second incision: and scrape off with it all the skin which lies between the two incisions, together with what is above the mouth. Then do this also from the middle incision up to the second incision.
Then remove this with the spatula, and reinsert another tool, which is named the surgical sharp one, into the first incision. Insert it gently from one part, not sharply from the other part.
And this is its form.
And place its sharp side towards the flesh added with the skin, and its flat side gently towards the mouth: and push it until it reaches the central fissure: and remove everything that descends from the head to the eyes: but this continues incision until what is visible from the skin.
Then do this up to the other fissure from the central fissure.
And after blood flows out to an equal amount, press the places from the clots of blood on the wads. Then place in every fissure lint made from old cloth, and place on them wads soaked in wine, oil, or vinegar.
And see that an abscess does not form due to heat.
And on the third day, release the bandage, and administer large amounts of water-based infusion.
Then use that which heals from the balsam ointment, and other things used for healing wounds, until it is fully healed.
On the care of acute tears and catarrhs that occur in the eyes from within the head.
Head V.
When such a thing happens to someone with an acute catarrh, care should be continuous and diligent. Their eyes are exhausted, reddened, and their appearance has become weakened. The eyelids are inflamed, and hair falls out of them, and there is an intense pain deep within the head that hurts and causes sneezing as a consequence: then take these occurrences into account; for unless it comes from many veins, no such material or catarrh will arise.
And the better treatment for them is this.
And it consists of using a hot iron to shave the sick person's forehead.
Then make an incision in the forehead in the middle or near one of the temples, approximately half way across, and begin with the incision from the left side to the right: and extend the cut until you reach the mouth. Keep your hand away from the moving temporal muscles during this process, until you expose the mouth. Then dry all the blood off using a sponge.
Then separate the two incision flaps with moistened fingers or linen threads.
Then, above the incision, tie with powders: and soak the powders in wine and oil so that no hot abscess forms.
And when you release that, and see that the hot abscess is already diminishing: then it must be necessary to rub against the mouth until flesh begins to grow in it.
Then care for it with an astringent regimen that promotes the growth of flesh: like if you take two parts of ground barley and four parts of colophony; prepare this as a paste, and apply it at the time when flesh is born in these wounds.
On how to care for what falls into the Ear. Title VI. Every object that falls into the ear is of one of four kinds: it may be a mineral stone, like iron or tin; it could be similar to a stone from a plant, such as chickpeas and beans; it might be a malleable substance, like water, vinegar, and others like them; or it could be some kind of animal.
So when a stone or any of those things that are not added and do not grow in the ear falls into the ear, expose the ear to the sun: if you then see the stone, then distill something from balsam oil or flaxseed into the ear.
Then administer the removal of it and have him sneeze while you're preparing, and pinch his nostrils at the onset of the sneeze; after that, place small pieces of cloth or wool in the vicinity of the ear, and then stretch the ear upwards.
For this reason, it is performed many times.
But if it does not come out, then administer its removal with the use of gestures, that is, with small needles called pizzigarioli. The shape of this tool is as follows.
So if it comes out with the use of gestures, it is good.
And if not, then administer its removal with an eyeless small and few-folded hook. So if it does not come out through that tool, then make a tube of air, and insert the tip of the tube into the ear opening very much, and apply what is in the surrounding area of the tube with softened wax mixed with oil, so that nothing goes except the tube by wind: then remove it with your strong suction force. Indeed, it is performed many times in this manner as what we have described.
If this method does not work: then take from the snail's shell or from a fish, that is, a small amount of prepared glue with which birds are caught, and place it at the end of the radius after you have placed it centrally on the cheek: then insert it into the ear hole with ease, after you remove the wax from moisture.
If it fails with all that we have narrated, then hasten to incision before a hot pustule occurs or a cramp happens.
And the measure of the incision is that the bloodletting tool should be applied primarily on the head: and remove it from its blood according to the strength of the individual.
Then make the patient sit between your hands, and turn their ear upwards, and create a small incision at the base of the ear at the depressed spot for them: and let the incision be in the shape of a crescent until you reach the stone; then remove it along with what is possible for you from the instruments.
Then continue to heal that incision according to your time, speed, and care until it is healed.
If the substance falling into the ear is like one grain that grows and inflates: then administer its extraction.
If it does not yield to you for an outcome, then take the spatula thin, subtle, according to this shape.
And administer it along with this from those grains of the same species that fall into the ear, and do not do this when you think that that grain has already been moistened by the steam of the ear until you place a large amount of it: then remove them with hooks, or with a delicate tool, or with suction as we said, for its extraction is facilitated.
In water that enters the ear, the sick person should use a sneeze while being in the position first: and now fills his ear with a little warm water. And he is lying on that ear in which there is water.
If it then goes out through that (method), it is good.
And if not: then take many stones, according to the length of a finger, thin, soft ones, and heat them with fire slightly, and let the sick person insert one of these into his ear opening. And he washes underfoot one from that part, and strikes with another stone on the stone which is in the ear.
So do not stop doing this with stones and stones until all the water has gone out.
And the water then comes out like this, that you take one from a papyrus or an reed and insert one of its ends into the ear. And you heat the other end with fire until it burns for quite some time.
Then use another reed, and do this several times until all the water has gone out. And then remove it with a cannula as was instructed with the stone.
In the removal of an animal entering into it, if it is a small body, like a louse and similar to it, treat it as I said in the division.
But if it is a large body that appears by sense: then administer its removal with hands and tongs. And his thing is easier than all which are held in the ear.
In the removal of worms generated in the ear, when you care for it with what we said in division and in the treatise on distillations, and your care does not apply: then you should look at the ear in the sun.
If it appears there that something is from the worms, then remove that with the hand or with fine hooks.
If however nothing is apparent there, then take a cannula, of which this is the form, narrow at the bottom, wide at the top; and insert its subtle end into the ear according to the capacity that the patient can tolerate. Then suck with that forceful suction.
Do this many times until all the worms have come out.
If they do not obey you for an exit, then fill around the end of the cannula with caeru (a substance), as I said about the stone.
If they do not come out with what we said: then administer the distillations that were known to the ancients for worm infections, and you will find this in the treatise on distillations.
And let your pouring be when you pour oil and medicines into the ear with this tool, whose form is depicted here.
Just as you see, make it out of silver or tin, with the bottom being narrow and having several small holes, while the top is wide.
So it should be that which pushes inside and is within the hollow of the cannula, it should be made evenly from tin.
And if you like, take a reed and wrap its end neatly according to the size of your ear canal. Then pour oil or juice or whatever medicine you prefer into the cannula and let it be inside the ear. Wait until the oil is pushed in by listening for it and feeling it internally within yourself. The substance being poured into the ear should have been gently warmed over a fire beforehand, and do not use anything that has been excessively cold during distillation as medicines cannot tolerate that.
On the care of complications arising from ear operations.
Head VII.
Sometimes, some infants emerge from their mothers' wombs without being punctured.
And similarly, it happens to some people where an operation on the ear through a wound or from tissue that has formed there, occurs.
And this operation sometimes happens deep within the ear canal, where it doesn't follow the use of force: and sometimes it affects only slightly outside the canal and follows that direction due to force.
Therefore, what happens deep within the ear, and which cannot be comprehended by appearance, is in many dispositions difficult to heal.
And for the one that follows force, you must place the diseased ear in sunlight and observe it. Then, if you see a visible lump, open it with a fine probe whose shape is as follows: its tip has some small width, and part of it is sharp; and the rest of the probe consists of two soft sides so that it does not injure the ear.
Therefore, if the operation is from tissue that has formed within the ear canal, then hold it with a fine hook and cut it with strong force until all the flesh is removed.
And if the operation is deep within the ear: then take a soft, fine rod and heat it slightly with fire. Then insert it into the ear canal.
And if you feel the lump with what the patient feels as a heaviness in hearing, try to open it with ease: and beware not to pierce the ear's nerves.
Then place in the ear a piece of lead according to the size of the canal you have enclosed with the Egyptian ointment. Do this for several days until you are sure about the healing of the wounds.
Take the licorice, and steep it in rose water, then grind over it ground cumin, and use it.
If you see the pustule starting to dry: then you must extract the licorice, and mix it with another licorice that you will immerse in fat made from rose oil until the pustule becomes warm. Then take care of it until it is fully healed.
If a blood flow occurs: then immerse a sponge or cloths in cold water, and place the pustule over it: and use the remaining treatment which stops blood flow as described in the book on distillations.
¶ On the care of Althea's eyelids.
Chapter VIII. These Althelil that happen to the eyelids of the eye, sometimes they become wet, and then they dry out.
Therefore, you should hold them with your fingers: or with a tool, and insert them with tweezers from their roots.
Then place ground cumin on the affected area.
If blood does flow from them, then cauterize them with a fine, lens-shaped cautery.
And the cauterization of them is better after cutting (incision).
Indeed, they often return when something remains from their roots.
And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
¶ On the treatment of Eyeball granulomas.
Chapter IX.
Often, something occurs on the eyelids that resembles Crandini in terms of its strength and firmness, and because of this, it is called a granuloma. It is an aggregation of coarse moisture on the upper eyelid and lower eyelid.
Therefore, an operation exists in them, you should then consider if there is a process of growth going within it, which appears from the eyelid, and they move to all parts, and its result is easy.
Therefore, find above that crack across its width.
Then scrape it from every side with ease until it opens.
Next, suspend it with a hook, and cut it off.
If however you do not prepare for its removal, unless after you penetrate the eyelid with a small incision, then it will harm the patient in some way.
If the crack is large: then stitch that up with stitches: and care for it until it heals.
And if it's small, no harm will come to you from it.
For the ointment restores it and makes it flesh again.
And if the growth is descending towards the inner ear surface, then turn the eyelid down, and hang the lump with a hook: beyond that you need an incision, and press it from every side.
And if the eyelid is stretched by an incision, it will not harm anything.
Then wash the eye after the incision with a saline solution: and care for the area with what promotes flesh formation until the patient heals.
¶ On the care of eyelashes.
Head X.
Axirnath is a grease that is produced in the upper eyelid covering: and it happens quite often to children: and this greases their eyes, and they suffer from morning discharges (possibly meant by 'catarri'), and they cannot see the sun's light, because tears tend towards them, and because of this you see them lying down on their faces always, and on them do they sleep, and their eyelids are wet under their eyebrows, as if inflated already: and Axirnath seems to stick out in your eye when you press that area with your fingers.
The method of performing it is such that the patient places his head on your breast.
Then take a linen cloth and prepare it with licorice. Make a circular piece of licorice according to the amount that Axhr Nath contains from all sides.
Then place it over her, and press it with your fingers from all sides, so that the Axirnath aggregates in the center of the circle.
Then find the center of that moisture and with the tip of a spatula make incisions across its width, and let it not be an opening larger than the one made in bloodletting at depth.
Or it may be necessary to remove the whole skin until you reach Axirnath, for Axirnath proceeds from the incision according to the shape of a piece of white grease in various configurations.
Therefore extract it together with the cloth you had soaked between your fingers towards the outside. And move your hand to the right and left until everything is spread out: and beware not to add anything in the incision so that you do not reach the spatula near the eye and harm it.
However, if Axirnath does not appear to you at the beginning of the incision, you should add a little with ease into the incision until Axirnath proceeds.
Then extract it as we said.
Then immerse the cloths in vinegar and water, and place them over the area, then bind it with powders.
And among people there are those who heat salt and put it into the hollow of the incision, so that what remains from that moisture will melt.
Then take care of it until it is healed.
If a pus pocket occurs in a warm area, then care should be taken with soothing plasters until it heals.
关于减少眼睛疲劳的方法，即当眼皮变得柔软时，会发生类似于不应有的声音的情况。
Title XI.
When additional hair growth occurs in the eyelids beyond the natural cycle, and prematurely, they then harm the eye and cause discomfort phenomena such as excessive tearing, eyelid softening, puffiness, until this becomes the reason for eye damage.
And Ataxmir indeed treats the eye according to four methods. Or by using a cautery with fire.
Or with an acute medicine, as stated in the preceding chapter on the subject of the cautery.
Or, Ataxmir treats it through incision and suture.
Or through canals, as I will explain.
It is necessary that you place the head of the sick person in your embrace.
Then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand.
If it is then turned, it is good.
And if it doesn't, introduce the tip of a tool into that area, where there is a thread from the lower part of the eyelid. Have the tool go through with the thread above, and make sure this area is near to the hairs, in other words, close to the edge of the eyelid, where the hairs grow out: pull the thread towards the upper part together with the eyelid, and turn it over using your finger.
Then find within the part of the eyelid under the additional hairs, from the larger lacrimal to the smaller lacrimal.
Then extract the thread and place a small amount of moistened cloth or cotton under the eyelid. Then mark the area above the eyelid with an iron tool to form a shape like that of a laurel leaf.
But it must happen that the figure is made according to the quantity and elevation of the eyelid: because this already varies among humans.
For there are those who need it that the part of the eyelid where it is applied should be large in quantity, according to the amount which softens from the eyelid. Then, when you have filled the gap above the two lines you marked, start from the larger lacrimal point to the smaller one and make a single slit near the natural hairs, just like the thickness of a radius.
Then insert a hook into one of the two corners of the skin. Then scrape off the whole thing. Then stitch the two lips together with needle and fine thread using suturing techniques: clean off any excess blood, and ensure that whatever extends beyond the ends of the two eyebrows is adhered to them; if you want to incorporate certain substances for this purpose, do so. If not, there's no need to worry about it.
Then let the suture and thread remain for three days or four: afterwards attend to that matter. And if you wish, remove the wound without the suture, and take care of it as it dries and contracts.
For the eyelid is raised through the puncturing of wounds and their coagulation: but the future will be better.
This method of treatment was taught by the ancients for Ataxmir.
However, there is concern for the sick person within it, and this comes from a good operation, and not from fear.
And another method is applicable even to Ataxmir: and it consists in the creation of signs above the eyelid which would resemble the shape of a myrtle leaf as we have described.
Then lift the eyelid with three separate or combined claws, according to this following shape. Then cut away what is surplus together with the stubs of scissors, according to this shape, having equality in the incisions.
But if it is not possible for you to hold the claw and they do not match; then take an edge with a string in which there is thread and introduce it into the middle of the shape. And introduce another thread near the lacrimal larger, and the other thread near the smaller lacrimal: and combine threads between your fingers having equality.
Then lift your hand with equal elevation: and elevate the skin over which is marked the fold, as we have described.
Then combine the two lips with stitches to the wound: and take care of it until it heals.
But if an abscess should occur at your incision or crack, then drain that abscess along with the pus and use remedies of this kind, from ointments that heal.
And it sometimes happens to eyelashes as well, that they turn and become horizontal.
¶ On caring for Ataxmir with canes.
And it is to convert the eyelid and divide the crack which I described, as narrated.
Then, by skill, make two canes or two fine pieces of wood; their length should be according to the length of the eyelid, and their width less than the width of the hair. And you have already cut in both ends at each side where you hold the thread.
Then gather both with subtlety on that which is superfluous from the eyelid, and tie two threads from each side tightly, and let it go a few days. The skin when tightened will die, become discolored, and decay until it falls off by itself.
If therefore the process is slow, then cut it with forceps.
Then care for it until it heals.
When it hardens, lift the eyelid: and no hairs will prick.
And this is the form of two threads which you should make according to this figure, and the amount in length and width.
¶ Concerning the removal of prickly hairs in the eye with a needle.
Chapter XII.
The operation is as follows: you should take a fine needle and gently insert a thin silk thread into it. Then gather the ends together and tie each end with a knot made from thin string; and let the length of the threads be as long as one hand.
Then, take another thin thread and weave it under the first one in a short space, and tie knots at its ends if you wish.
Then let the patient lay his head on your chest, and place it close to the sun so that you can see the operation clearly; because this is a delicate surgery, possibly minute in nature.
Then insert the needle with Alinxotatis inside the root of the eyelid and make it penetrate into the eyelid as quickly as possible until you remove the natural hair above.
Then pull the hair up above Alinxotatis: and insert that hair into Alinxotatis: if there is one, or two, or three hairs, no more.
Then pull your hand with it until a hair comes out with an eyelash together with the natural hair.
If however the eyelash is pulled and does not allow a hair to come out with it: pull the eyelash downwards until it comes out through the upper hole. You will see it by the eye: then you are pulling down the eyelash along with the thread that you have made in it, until the eyelash exits through the upper opening; then close your eye: for you are pulling down both at once, and the thread as well. Take them out together and close the eye; and let him keep his eye closed for two days or three, until the hair adheres to its place and grows over it with flesh.
If the hair is short, then either associate it with a long hair from the natural ones, and pull it out with it: or let him go until he extends by space, and then pull it.
¶ On the care of Alxatrati which happens in the upper eyelid.
Chapter XIII.
When this happens to the eye with Alxatrati, it is called the Leporina.
And this Alxatrati can either be natural or accidental.
Therefore, the accidental Alxatrati arises from the concretion of wounds, or sections, or cauterizations, and similar actions.
And the method of performing an action on it is to find that concretion and to separate its edges, and to place into it a piece of linen which is located between them, and you bind it until it heals.
And it should not be that you use things which dry and constrict in its treatment; for if you do this, the Alxatrati returns worse than it was. Instead, use soothing substances such as Greek fennel: mix it with water that has been boiled down with aloe and flaxseed: and apply a balm of some oil that is melted together: and wrap linen around it, and take care of it.
And your collection of remedies is, that you strive with all your ingenuity, so that it does not harden, according to the shape which was at first.
And indeed, the operation that we have mentioned is nothing else but a correction of Alzargari's technique, such that it does not revert to its original form. The care according to Alzargari for the lower eyelid, which results in a groove or contraction upwards to the right and left.
Chapter XIV.
This is what Alzargari does below, which is truly called Alzargari's technique.
And it is natural, and it can also happen by accident.
And an accidental one occurs due to a wound, or a crack, or cautery, and similar conditions.
And the method of operation for this is to take a needle with two strands of thread, and insert it into the flesh, so that it penetrates from the left lacrimal point to the right lacrimal point, until the thread reaches both ends of the flesh.
Then extend the skin upwards with the needle, and cut it using a wide scalpel.
If therefore the shape of the eyelid returns as it should be, then it is good.
And if it doesn't return to the proper shape, take a needle and place it in the crack, and turn the eyelid with it. And make two cracks on the inner side of the eyelid, and let the ends of both cracks be from the two corners of the incision until they meet, forming an angle; until they are joined together will form this shape of them, and is the letter praise in Greek.
Then remove that part of flesh for the length which is at its sharp lower edge, from what follows the eyelid.
Then unite the separated parts: hold it with a thread of wool.
Then take care of them using what we have said about softening medicines and remedies until they heal.
And if Alxatrati happens to occur from a crack, suture, or cautery: then it is necessary that you make the incision flat under the eyelashes hairline, even according to how much has preceded.
Then separate between the two lips with a remedy, as we said.
And the main point about caring for Alxatrati, whether it is above or below, is that one should treat it in that operation according to how it is prepared from the shape of Alxatrati.
Indeed, it is the diversity of forms that she is: and the careful artisan prepares his skill with whatever mode is possible to him, until he restores the figure to its natural form or close enough, and the patient himself, according to what suits him from operation and tools in many positions.
¶ Concerning the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva, or cornea.
Chapter XV.
Sometimes this consolidation happens to many people in such a way that the upper eyelid becomes consolidated with the white of the eye, and prevents it from performing its natural operations.
Therefore, you should insert the end of the rod under the eyelid and lift it up. Or extend it with a hook. Then cut through the adhesion with a thin spatula so that it is not at the edge of the incision sharpness, but obtuse slightly. So the patient will not be disturbed during surgery, remove the spatula and damage his eye with its sharpness; and make your cut as if you were removing that adhesion smoothly until when returns the eyelid according to its natural shape, and heals completely the whole adhesion.
Apply then salt water into the eye, when washing it with water: or distil it upon itself from a sieve made, from zinc dissolved in water.
Then separate between the eyelid and eye with linseed: and place over the eye wool dipped in urine: and use the sieve on the third day, and with the residues, until it is healed.
¶ On cutting the hoof and elevation of flesh tear ducts.
Title XVI.
You know that the hoof is according to two ways. Or it is nervous: and it is similar to a hard sieve, fine.
Or it is not nervous, similar to the consistency of frozen egg white: which when touched by a metal tool, or you try to grasp it with an awl, it gets detached and the awl does not get stuck in it.
Neither of these types start unless from the larger tear duct, until they gradually reach it, until they cover vision and prevent eye movement.
And the method of operation for cutting it is: let the sick place his head on your breast.
Then open his eyes, and lift the eyelid with your hand.
Next, collect the hoof using an awl of a few doublings, and extend it upwards.
Next, take the tip of a needle from horse hairs, cow's hair or rabbit hair. And let it be strong thread and double the end of the needle near by, then fix that in the middle of hoof and penetrate with its point and tie it to the thread and extend it upwards. And scrape off the side of the hoof following the pupil as if you were squeezing it together with the hair up to his hind foot.
Then make a cut in the remainder at the root of the lacrimal gland with a sharp blade or with blunt forceps: and remove the natural lacrimal tissue, so that there is no risk of excessive flow of tears from it.
And sometimes the claw is extended with only an awl: or with a wire, as we said.
Then it should be scraped using a soft spatula, which has this shape.
And beware not to let the spatula touch the cornea membrane, and cause a rupture in it, leading to perforation of the pupil.
Then, after the cut, some powdered salt or something sifted from zinc should be poured into the eye, and it should be removed up to another day.
Then take care of it with what is necessary until it is healed. If the claw is not nerve-rich, and you cannot insert an edge into it, nor can a hook be inserted into it, then this type of claw needs to be treated repeatedly with medicine. It heals as I have described in the division.
If you want to cut it, then open the eye of the patient and take a soft, mild-edged, finely sharp spatula according to this shape.
And shave the claw from above with reason and subtlety.
If you see that it is becoming thinner and breaking down, and the reason imprints itself into it, then distill from your own hour into the eye from a sifted product of zinc, or from a red sifted product, or powdered salt: and saturate the eye up to another day.
Then repeat the operation over it until everything of it is removed.
Unless there is a contrary condition in your eye for pus to be hot: then you should remove it yourself, and care for the pus until it heals. Then, continue the operation upon it with reason until it heals.
The prominence of the eyelid tissue, if it causes great damage to the eye, should be suspended with a hook and the affected part is cut from it: do not make the final incision in order to prevent the flow of tears.
Then, after a while, apply red drops from a tear duct sieve or made from zinc until it heals. ¶ On the incision of the Alguardo and the natural flesh in the eye.
Chapter XVII.
A red flesh sometimes occurs in some people's eyes, either composed or overlaid until it covers the pupil, or approaches, or tightens over the eyelids, and perhaps turns the lids outward: and it is likened to the balsamic rose.
And there is an operation for this as well, so that the sick person can place their head in your lap.
Then open their eyes and gather that whole flesh with the corresponding hooks to this: and hold it with one forceps or in your hand.
Then cut into the flesh until you finish the entire thing with a saw.
And be cautious not to harm the eye during surgery: and make your cut at the point where you are cutting it, or with a small spatula as we described in the section on the incision of the hoof nail: or with large pincers which collect the alsebel, according to how its form will appear after this chapter.
Once your incision is complete and the entire Alguardo has been removed, then fill the eye with ground salt or a red powder from medicinal corrosives. Place over the eye a piece of wool soaked in urine to protect it against hot pus.
If there is any remainder of the alquadarini and if your blood is warm, and you feel a warm pus formation: then remove the eye and take care of it along with whatever stops the pus.
Then continue to treat it together with the operation until it is healed.
And do likewise for flesh that comes into the eye from this kind of case.
However, it is necessary that the treatment of any weak eye from its natural disease or from an accidental cause be done with iron: and do not insert your hand into any of these operations until you find out what part of the body can bear this operation.
Section 1: The removal of Sclera from the eye.
Title Eighteen. Sclera are the reddened membranes that cover the eye and prevent its own action: and weaken the eye over time.
It is necessary for you to first determine if the eye with Sclera is strong and there is no other ailment in it apart from Sclera. If so, then remove Sclera from it.
And you should advise the sick person to place their head on your chest.
Then suspend those veins with one or two hooks according to your judgment: and let the hook be thin from doubling, following this shape, or have two hooks graduated in one body, following this shape.
Then collect those veins with fine forks and in terms of fineness, and cleanse the blood hour by hour until you find those veins being removed from the eye, and they resolve. And beware not to harm the eye with the ends of the forceps.
And let your operation be in midday before the sun, and be firm in your operation very much: so that you do not cut except those veins.
And when you have completed it, then distill into the eye something green or red: so that its sharpness may season what remains from itself.
And if however you are not able to collect all of this in that hour, then plaster the eye with that which relieves eye pain: and leave it for a few days until its pain subsides: and protect it from hot drafts. Then apply it again according to the same method, until it is healed.
And this is the form of the forceps.
¶ Concerning the reduction to the nose of Arissatus.
Chapter XVII.
Medicians name the Fistula of Arissatus which is treated with cautery or with an acutely burning medicine, as was described previously.
And if it is not healed, then there is no skill in that: unless you find above the pustule at its birth and extract all of the moisture which is within it and pus, until the mouth is revealed.
And when the mouth is revealed, and you see corruption or darkness within it, then shave it with an instrument whose form is like this.
And it is called Roughness of the head.
Let it be made of hot iron, and let its head be round like an azir, which should have a puncture by the file, or a fine puncture from the aliskilfer. Place it above the corrupted part of the bone. Then roll it between your fingers, and press your hand moderately until you know that that corruption is now smooth. And do this several times.
Then roll it between your fingers, and press your hand moderately until you know that that corruption is now smooth. And do this several times. Then restore the place with medicinal dried astringent substances.
If therefore the site is stabilized, and flesh begins to grow there, and treatment administration is discontinued: and forty days pass, and there is no renewal, and it does not heal, and no incidents occur there: then you will know that it has been fully healed.
And if not, then there is no natural talent present other than to reduce the sinus back to the nasal opening, according to this method.
And it is as follows: when you remove the bone secondly with iron or with sharp medicine; and upon detecting the opening of the bone, then take a drill according to this method, let its end be made of iron in a triangular shape. And make that piece of wood pyramidal, tapering down until reaching the tip, as you see.
Then place that over the bone itself: and let it be close to the tear ducts: and extend your hand from the eye a little.
Then rotate your hand with the drill until it penetrates the bone and the patient feels it. Through this, when the patient finds the wind to come out of him/her when holding his/her hand over their own nose.
Therefore, then restore the site with medicinal dried astringent substances, as I have taught you.
And when flesh begins to grow and the site hardens, then the substance that was flowing outward returns to the nose. Therefore, it becomes lighter for the patient above the affected area.
### On reducing the prominence of the eye. Chapter XX.
When the eye bulges completely and there is no harm or diminution in vision, then it's necessary to relax the patient. Afterwards, perform bloodletting on him/her: subsequently place suction devices at the neck without incision, but with suction.
Then place over the eye a lotion made from acacia, aloe, nard, and gall.
Then, above the ointment with many powders, bind the eye again.
And the quantity of powders is as follows: take soft cloths, many, and each cloth should be doubled up four times. Cut them into multiple pieces. Then place one piece on top of another according to the amount that the eye requires. Next, bind them firmly with a hard cloth using a strong binding.
And repeat in ventilations with suction without incision.
Then remove the ventilation tubes, and let the eye be bound tightly day and night.
If the bandage again becomes soft, then it should be tightened much: afterwards remove the bandage each day and night, as we said.
If you see the eye already return to its usual condition, it is good: and if not, then repeat the ointment, powders, binding, and ventilation tubes until it is healed.
¶ On making an incision in the tunica (or membrane).
Title XXI.
When there is a break in the tunica Vuea, then it rises and extends outside the eyelid like a grain ofVuea, because of this shape and to allow the vision to occur. In that case, an operation should be performed as I describe, and you should insert the tip of a needle from below to above in the base of theVuea.
Then insert another needle that has a double thread at the lacrimal part, and make it penetrate: and remove the first needle according to its position.
Then cut twice into the site, and bind together with it a portion of the vagina by the edge of the needle; and pull it tightly.
Then pull out the needle, and place over the eye a band dipped in almond juice: and let him go until the string with the vagina falls.
Then care for the eye with it, which strengthens itself, until the wound is healed.
And sometimes the vagina is tightened with a band around a circle of cloth, until the eye attains great prominence.
Then a fine needle is passed through with a slender forceps, so that it reaches the depth of the eye, and maintains the humidity of almond juice, causing the eye to descend and enter immediately; then tighten it until it is healed.
¶ Instructions for the Care of Albinet.
Title XXII.
This condition known as Alcomnati is not really a disease that accumulates in the eye, similar to descending water, and it is not itself.
And for how to proceed with this, you should make the patient sit on a prepared seat or directly if necessary.
Then take the head with your hands from both sides and move it until you can feel the disease reaching down to the inner parts of your eyes.
Then apply (the treatment), and make sure it doesn't go down, and the passage is cleared up: and the patient will see as they did before. And if it didn't go down below, know that there's water.
If however, the preparation for the descent of the disease as we have said is not made, then make the patient sit between your hands. Then take a fine forceps and apply it above the cornual membrane slightly near its continuous part with the cornea up to the rim, until the disease emerges.
When therefore it exits, then drip in the eye warm water that you mixed with honey: or the water in which you already boiled the Greek fennel and honey: afterwards treat with the rest of the treatment until healed.
Regarding the care for water that descends into the eye or cataract.
Title XXIII.
Now we have discussed the nature of water and what is suitable for perforation through a spoken explanation and demonstration. Then take this same thing according to health afterwards.
So then you must make the patient sit between your hands as a square, facing away from the light, close to the sun: and tie the healthy eye, and tightly hold it. Then with your right hand, if the eye that has water is the left eye, or with your left hand if the eye is on the right side, press down the eyelid of the patient's eye with your hand.
Then take with your right hand if the eye is on the left side, or with your left hand if the eye is on the right side.
Then place the tip of the needle near the corona along the width of the radius in the apparent white of the eye on the side of the lesser tear duct. Then push the needle with force and move your hand together with it, until it penetrates into the whiteness of the eye, and you feel that the needle has already reached the hollow place.
And it must be that the measurement of the needle's journey to depth is equal to the distance from the pupil to the end of the darkened area, which is the crown of the eye.
Indeed, you will see those things inside the pupil with the vision of the eye, due to the clarity of the cornea.
Then place the needle until it reaches the spot where the water is.
Then press it downwards, one after another.
If the water therefore descends immediately, then the patient perceives that which he opens with his hand immediately, and the powder is in his eye.
Then rest for a while.
If the water therefore descends, then place it down secondly, excepting where the powder will come out.
When therefore it cures, and does not rise: then remove the powder with ease: and you turn your hand gradually. Then dissolve some of clear gemstone salt in water, and wash your eye with it.
Then place the whole lump of fat or rose oil-soaked wool, or garlic, on the eye, and bind the healthy eye to it.
And we, as well as those of our time, place on it ground coriander with egg whites.
And if the powder does not obey you at entering the eye because of its hardness, as it comes from humans whose eye is very hard, then you must take a spatula which is called Alberid, having this shape.
Pierce it with it only the jointed part, and do not insert your hand into the hole: and there should be nothing but to make a subtle passage where the powder can go.
Then introduce the powder as we have said.
And at the completion of your work, prepare for the patient an appropriately arranged bed on which to lie facing down in a dark room. Let him sleep on his back and be prevented from all movements and coughing. Provide food as nature finds fit for him. Do not move his head with either hand at all.
And let the band be according to its place until the third day. Next, release that in that dark house and test its purpose; and make him see this.
Then reduce the bandage until the seventh day.
And it is not necessary for him to do that during the healing time or immediately after cutting: indeed, he should avoid doing so; because water rises quickly through strong exposure.
But if an abscess becomes hot: then you should release the eye before the seventh day: and correct that which is done with it to eliminate the abscess, until the process stops. Then fully test its purpose, and place over his face a mouth opening through which his use can be regulated for several days while he remains in that dark house.
And then gradually leave the house and converse as usual.
Know that in zalle (a state of health), the disciple should not be prevented from seeing occasionally; for then he dares to take part in operations.
And indeed, some of those who were from Alayrach have reached us, who said that an operation was performed on a hole in Alayrach through which water is sucked.
But indeed, I have not seen anyone on your land who performs this: nor did I read of it in any ancient books: and it's possible that this is new.
And these are the forms of species from the hole, so they can stand above those who do not know them.
Let them be made from the air properly: and let their ends with this have the same subtlety of triangular shape, and an acute end.
Forms of Magda.
On the care of the newly born flesh in the nose.
Title XXIV
Sometimes in the nose various added flesh is born, from which there is something that resembles a scorpion with many feet: and from this is the cancerous flesh, stone-like, of yellowish color. And from this is what it is soft flesh, not of yellowish color.
In the part that from these flesh elements is soft, not deceitful, nor cancerous, you should place an afflicted individual to sit between your hands opposing the sun, and open their nostrils, and remove a hook into those flesh parts. Then draw them out towards the exterior, and with a sharp, fine probing tool from one side, until you know that all of the flesh has been completely removed.
And if there remains something from that of which removal is not possible: then shave off that with one of delicate instruments with ease, until nothing remains from it.
And if blood is dominating you, or a hot boil occurs: then place it against what is required: or if it is from malignant boils, then approach by cauterizing it, until the blood has been removed and all flesh has been taken away.
Then after cutting into the nose, expel with vinegar, and water, or wine.
And if the nose opens up, and moisture proceeds from it until to the palate, then you will know that he is already healed.
And if moisture does not penetrate as it should, then you will know that flesh has been born inside of him in the upper bones of the nose, to which penetration did not come with an incision tool.
Then it is necessary to introduce a piece of linen string which has some thickness, and within the string many knots. Place between each knot an amount equal to or less than that of a finger. The skilled person should then guide one end of the thread into his nose with a tool or as much as he can manage after doing so himself with another similar object: and they pull out their scent until it reaches the nostrils, and comes out over their throat.
Indeed, many times they do something similar to this with young boys at school, and it's an easy thing for the one who wants to do so.
Then place the two ends of the string, one end that extends over the nose and the other end which remains in the nose.
Next, perform the incision into the flesh with knots located along the string. Do that until you know that the flesh and knots on the string have now been affected.
Then extract the string: and after bleeding out, place in the nose a lint that you have soaked with Egyptian ointment. Do this for three days or more until the ointment has treated all that remains from the flesh.
Then place a lead pipe at the end of the procedure in the nose for several days until it is healed.
If however there needs to be a kind of treatment that dries out, use that one.
For the procedure of washing the head with distilled oils and other medicines for use up the nose, make this like a lamp of pyxide shape, with its opening like that of a shell: and let its aperture be made similarly.
And if you want to make a closed pipe, like a reed.
And the shell of the instrument for making a nose-purge, when found complete, should have its handle at the end, with which you hold it. When you warm it in oil or wish to extract from its residues and other liquid contents.
And this is the form of the instrument. Section: On the care of Thelul's nose.
Chapter XXV.
It often occurs at the tip of Thelul's nose, and grows bigger and increases with days, until it forms a characteristic appearance.
And for that reason, it is necessary to act upon this when it first appears and remove the whole of it from the beginning.
Then place over that spot, or apply a cautery, or a burning medicine which occupies the place where it was.
If therefore the cutting of it does not occur until it grows large, then observe if it is stony, hard, yellowish in color, with few senses: at that point do not touch it with iron because it is cancerous.
Indeed, I have often seen that if someone incites an enemy to create a boil against the one who possesses it, great harm befalls him.
And if the boil has a soft touch, is not yellow in color, and you see that it can be cut all over, then treat the sick person, and cut into it fearlessly, without fear: and care for the place with what dries and tightens it until it heals.
Section: On sewing of the nose, lips, and ears.
Chapter XXVI.
Know that when the continuity fails in one of these cartilages, there is little to be done about it, except in some people.
Therefore, when such an event happens to someone from that, you should consider whether it is a recent wound with its own blood: and then bind the wounds together with stitches; afterwards take care of them until they heal.
And if the lips of continuity of the solution have already been separated and each part is now healthy, then it must be that all parts are scraped off from the apparent skin until bleeding occurs.
Then bind the two lips together with stitches and tighten them, and sprinkle over him dragon's blood and ground myrrh. Place above these scraps of powder on a piece of plaster of galen, and another piece made by mixing various plasters. And release him from bandages for two or three days.
Then release the person and change the medicine, and let him go until the stitches fall out on their own. Then take care of the individual with ointment until they are healed.
As for the method of suturing, you bind the continuity of the solution together, or with needles, as we explained in abdominal sutures. Or you bind the solution with a thread, as I have shown you.
¶ On the removal of lumps from the lips.
Chapter XXVII. To many people, it happens that small and quite hard lumps similar to seeds of herbs occur within their lips. And some are smaller, others larger.
Therefore, it is necessary to turn the lip and strike over every lump of it, and hang it with a hook, and pierce it from every side.
Then fill the place after the cut with a powder until bleeding occurs.
Then it is rubbed with vinegar and the area where there is an application is treated with it until the wounds heal.
¶ Concerning the incision of birth scars on the gum.
Title XXVIII. Birth scars often appear on the gum, which the ancients called 'abuluss'.
Therefore, you should hang it with a hook: or hold it with forceps and make an incision at its root, allowing pus to drain out or blood.
Then place over the area some dried powder, or other止血powders.
If that flesh recurs after healing, as it often does, then make a second incision and cauterize it: for it will not recur after cauterization.
¶ Concerning the reason for using iron with teeth.
Title XXIX.
Sometimes, aggregations form on the surfaces of teeth both from inside and outside, extending to the gums, with rough, unpleasant layers that sometimes degrade further, turning yellowish-green until corruption reaches the gum, resulting in foul-smelling teeth due to this.
Therefore, you should have the sick person sit between your hands, and place their head in your bosom, then scrape the gum and tooth where you see layers, or a resemblance to sand: until nothing remains from them. Do similarly for blackness, greenness, yellowing, and other discolorations, until they are cleansed.
If therefore the reason that exists within them from the beginning is removed, it is good; and if not, then repeatedly apply this reason on them each day, secondly, thirdly, until diligent study reaches what you desire.
And you will know that the tooth requires razors of various shapes, figures of many forms: according to how your operation is prepared. This is because the razor used for extracting a tooth from its lower part is different from the one used for teeth between the teeth, according to other forms.
And these forms of razors have been prepared for you, which you see.
Section: On the Extraction of Tooth Pain.
Head 30.
It is necessary that you treat the tooth with all your skill for its own pain, and do not hesitate in its extraction.
Indeed, there is nothing that can substitute for it when it is removed: because it is a high substance; until then, when there is no excuse for removing it, then it must be forced by the sick to remove itself, so that it stabilizes and confirms with you the painful tooth.
Indeed, the sick person often deceives himself with pain and thinks there is a problem inside the tooth and removes it. Then the pain does not subside until the sick tooth is extracted.
We have indeed observed that before in procedures related to bloodletting.
And when the painful tooth has been confirmed to you by itself, then you should incise around the tooth with a small instrument where there is some virtue until the gum releases from every part: then move it with your fingers, or with thin forceps first gradually, until you dislodge it.
Then place large forceps on the area of that tooth and have the sick person's head between your knees: you should hold this well enough so that it does not move. Then pull out the tooth according to its straightness, so as not to break it.
If therefore it does not protrude, then take one of those instruments and insert it under him from every part with ease, and try the movement of it, as you did at first.
If the tooth is pierced or corroded, then you must fill that hole with a cloth: and tie it with the end of a thin rod so that it does not break when you bind it with your forceps.
And you must carefully perform the incision around the gum from every part much.
And keep your strength, so you do not break it and let part of him remain, which will heal over the vulnerable from that illness with greater pain initially.
And be cautious not to do what the ignorant ones do among phlebotomists during their practice and with boldness over his extraction, beyond which they administer what we have described.
Indeed, many times they result in causing great illnesses upon men which are more difficult to break, and let his roots remain all, or some of them; or they extract him with some of the bones of the jaw: as we have testified several times this. Then he is rinsed after his extraction with wine, or with vinegar and salt. If a bleeding occurs from the places (this happens many times), then rub something with ash and fill it in that place: and if not, cauterize it if ash does not provide you relief.
The forceps of fine size by which a tooth is moved at first, let them have long ends, short handles, thick so that they do not fold when pressed upon the tooth with them: let them be as you see of thick handles, until when you tighten them against it, neither do they bite themselves, nor do they fold. Let them have short ends and let them be made out of steel or out of hardened metal, with straight ends: and in their ends let there be teeth, some entering into each other and being held by the appropriate tightening, strongly.
And sometimes, ends are made like the shape of a bird's mouth which is called the stork, and there is a strong constriction.
On the removal of teeth and extraction of fractured jaw bones.
Title XXXI.
When there remains during the process of removing a fractured tooth, then you must place tallow over the site for one or two days until the area softens. Then insert an instrument, either by the gnat or forceps: their ends are similar to the mouth of a bird which is called the stork.
This form is that of the forceps.
Their ends are made in the shape of an engraving chisel: or like the tool called aliskilfegi.
If however it does not comply with you for extraction using these forceps, then you should cut over the root and remove all the flesh, and insert a tool called a small lever whose shape is as follows.
Let its end be short and thick for some distance, and do not let it become wet so that it does not break.
If the root comes out through that, it is good; and if not, one should try with other tools whose shapes are like these.
The shape of the first triangular end, in which there is some thickness.
The shape of the triangular end is fine.
And even with this tool having two branches, which has this shape. And with other tools and instruments that precede them in the proportion of teeth.
And even with this tool that is similar to a large hook, of which the shape has a triangular end twisted together, where there is some thickness so that it does not break: and let it not be wet.
And you will know that dental instruments are many: and similarly other tools are not counted, and the skilled craftsman, subtle in his art, finds for himself an instrument according to which he indicates the operation and discomforts themselves.
And because there are instruments from varieties on which the ancients did not provide tools, due to the diversity of their species.
And if the mouth is fractured from the jawbone or any other bones of the mouth, or it decays: then examine him at his own place with what fits into the situation among the instruments and forceps that I mentioned in extraction procedures, and assist him with gestures, whose form is this.
Let some hardness grow gradually in it, so that it may bind or hold the mouth with it, and does not escape and bleed, until the mouth comes out: and restore the place with suitable medicines for this.
And if there is a small decay in the bone, then shave it off from its own decay and care for it until it heals.
On the prominent closure of teeth over others.
Title XXXII.
When teeth grow out of their natural course, it becomes foul due to this form: and especially when this happens in women and girls, that is, during menstruation.
Therefore, if a tooth is born after another tooth and is not situated, or there is a possibility for its closure without needing to grind it, but it cannot be done with that tool: then extract the tooth. And if it is attached to another tooth, then use this instrument on it, whose form is as follows.
It is similar to a thin needle and is made of hard iron, with its tip extremely sharp.
And let your cut be such that you are cutting into it for many days, and because of the hardness of teeth, and so as not to disturb another tooth.
And if there is an exposed ridge from the file: then the file itself with the file of the first kind, whose shape is like this.
Let it be entirely of the first kind, and make its handle with many small prongs, like a file when making needles. Then the tooth will be filed gradually over many days with ease, so that the tooth is not disturbed and falls off: then soften it at the end, and sharpen it further using some razors.
If there is a tooth from which part breaks and injures the tongue, then one must use a burr on it until all roughness of that break has been removed and it's even: and it should be flattened so as not to injure the tongue or corrupt speech.
¶ On the treatment of teeth with golden wires.
Title 33.
When there is shaking and disturbance of the front teeth due to impact or accident, and it's not possible for them to be tightened around what he eats so that they don't fall off: then treat them with astringent medicines, and if treatment doesn't help; in such cases, one must use golden wires on them. This is because silver turns green and decays after days, but gold never changes.
And let the wire be of moderate thickness and size according to what it can fit between the teeth.
The form of treatment is as follows: you would take the wire and introduce its two parts between two healthy teeth. Then weave it with the two ends of the thread through the moving teeth, whether one or more, until you reach the weaving up to a healthy tooth from the other part.
Then repeat the incision until you reach the place where you started: and hold your hand with subtlety and wisdom until it doesn't move completely: and let your constriction when you tie the thread be at the roots of teeth, so that it won't grow.
Then cut off the excess threads with forceps: and gather them together, then turn them as you do gestures, and hide them between a healthy tooth and a moving tooth so that they don't hurt the tongue: then let this tightness be released when it remains.
If they should break or require further cuts, tie them with another thread and it will stand firm in this manner for the entire time.
And this is the shape of teeth and the form of securing two healthy teeth and two moving teeth as you can see.
And sometimes it happens that one or two teeth return after the event of the eruption and are held just as we have described, remaining unchanged. And this is done only by a skilled and experienced artisan.
And sometimes it is adapted from the bones of the alveoli: and it becomes like the form of a tooth and placed in its place, thus securing the tooth and tying it as we said, remaining and serving with it for a long time.
Section on incision of ligaments that occur under the tongue, which prevents speech.
Title: 34
If there be any hardness or nodule within it and that arises from the healing of wounds, then insert a hook into it, and divide it across its width until you reach the ligament, and resolve the nodule.
If however there is a flow of blood, then place on the site salted meal. If the blood has dried on you, then cauterize the site with a small and suitable cauterizer: then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals. ¶ On removing the Ranula, which forms under the tongue.
Chapter XXXV.
Sometimes an abscess forms under the tongue that resembles a toad, hindering the tongue's natural operation: and it may grow so much as to fill the mouth.
If however you see it is of yellow or black color, or hard, and the sick person does not feel anything from it: then do not touch it, because it is a tumor.
And if it declines to a whiteness with moisture, then insert a hook into it and cut it down with a thin lancet, and free it from all sides.
If blood overcomes you during your time of operation, then place onto it ground zeger until the blood is drained off: afterwards return to your operation until you have taken him/her out with its completion.
Then it is mixed with vinegar and salt: and care for the rest of its treatment until it fits to that, until it is healed.
¶ On the treatment of two tonsils.
Chapter XXXVI.
And then either you will pierce it: or it will be ruptured by itself.
And if it is white in color, round, and the root of it is subtle: then you must pierce it.
And the operation within it is what you should consider before her own operation, if it has completed a warm quiet fullness of the lump, or if it has diminished to some reduction: then therefore let him/her sit for the sick person in front of the sun, and their head be in your chest: and open her/his mouth, and she/he receives by serving herself/himself between his/her hands, and presses her/his tongue below with an instrument, which this is its form. Let it be made of silver, or copper, which should be subtle like a knife.
When therefore you press upon it with your tongue, and show to you the pustule, and let it fall over him by your use: then take a hook, and fasten it in the tonsil, and pull it out as far as you can from within, leaving some of it in the membrane.
Then cut it with the tool whose shape follows.
It is made to be adapted by forking: however, let the ends of it be rounded, so that each ear's hole is acutely in line with another. Therefore, make sure it is made of hard iron or dipped in ale for oiling.
If this tool is not present, then cut it with a spatula whose form follows.
Let it be sharp on one side, not sharp on the other side.
And after you cut one tonsil, cut the other in the same manner.
Then after cutting, gargle the patient with cold water, or with vinegar and water.
If however bleeding occurs, gargle with water in which the peels of pomegranates have been boiled: or leaves of myrtle and similar substances from astringents, until the bleeding stops. Then attend to it until it is healed.
Sometimes, other pustules appear in the throat besides the two tonsils.
So cut these (other pustules) according to what I said about cutting the two tonsils evenly.
And indeed, I have treated a woman for a pustule that was born in her throat, which was turning black, with few sensations, which had almost completely narrowed her throat: and the woman breathed from the constrained passage, and she could no longer drink water or eat; and she would already have succumbed to death if she had survived one more day, or two days.
And the abscess rose to the point where it sent out two branches until they reached over two nasal apertures.
So I proceeded with great haste and attached one of them to a hook of one of them.
Then I pulled it, and a large portion came out from it.
Then cut it off where you can grasp it by the nasal aperture.
Then I did to it what had proceeded from the nasal aperture on the other side.
Then I opened his mouth and pressed his tongue; then I attached a hook to it. Afterwards, I cut off part of him where he had proceeded from the nasal aperture on the other side, and it did not spread except for a little blood. Therefore, the throat of the woman was freed, and she immediately started drinking water, and then she took food.
So I did not stop piercing that abscess repeatedly over a long period of time. And an abscess would occur in the place where I had pierced it until it was prolonged excessively and with that.
So I worked on it and burned the abscess between her throat.
She stood after her operation: then I walked away from the part, and I did not know what God had done to her after me.
### Section on Incisions of Wombs
Chapter XXXVII.
When the catarrh descends into the womb and becomes inflamed, and is long: then it is called a perpendicular womb. And if there is a large, round part at the lower part, then it is called an upside-down womb.
When it is treated with what we said in division, and the treatment does not take effect: then you will see that the abscess has calmed down from her, and it is subtle: at that point, you must pierce her.
And what is derived from that which is round and does not have length, and is blood-colored or of a yellowish-brown shade, or black, and lacks sensation: then it must be the appropriate excision of it.
And there is fear upon the sick.
Therefore, when you see it according to the method I described - white and with length - you should have the sick person sit facing the sun. And press their tongue with a tool as instructed beforehand. Then fix a hook into the uvula, and pull it downwards: and cut it with one of two tools that were mentioned in the operation for removing both tonsils.
And it must be that you do not cut from her unless what is added above the natural termination without addition.
For if you cut more than necessary from her, you harm the voice and speech.
And after the cutting, use what we instructed for the removal of both tonsils. And take care of her until she has healed.
And if the sick person is frightened by the cutting: then it must be that you use skill in the operation of cauterization without fear and anxiety.
And the method of cauterization on her is not proper unless with sharp water: and it involves placing the sick person's head in your bosom.
And then press their tongue with the tool that we said.
And then take the water that I told you about in the chapter on cauterization and apply it to a non-extinct heel using this tool, making sure not to use too thick or too thin water, filling its conformation with this tool's shape.
Let the end where you place the medicine be conformed, just like the conformation of the cochlear radius.
And place the instrument with the medicine upon one of them: and let the patient lie on his side, so that the saliva from his mouth due to the internal medicine does not descend into his throat, and harms himself.
And then hold your hand with the medicine.
And you should apply the first part of it on one quarter of the hourly dose, until you notice that it has become discolored and stopped the action of the medicine.
And if you need to drink it, cover the end of the radius and pour the compound with medicine into the tube. Then insert the rod and knife into the tube from above until the tip of the rod adheres to some part. Perform this many times until you achieve what you desire for the application of heat.
Then release it: because after three or four days, it will detach itself and fall off.
If you need to reapply the medicine, apply it again: and after cauterization cleanse the area around the wound with a mixture of the fat and medicine that is in its surroundings, then wash it with cold water.
And it is cured externally with ointments, and rinsed internally with gargles, until it is healed.
Therefore, this method of treatment is more beneficial than an incision and lasts longer in terms of concern or worry.
And sometimes it heals even with something finer than heat or an incision; it is treated by means of a fumigation, according to this method.
Take a reed, hyssop, sage, rue, sweet marjoram, chamomile and spinach, and similar plants from herbs. Gather all of these together or some of them in a pot, and immerse it with vinegar, then boil it. The pot should be well scraped inside to remove excess. Place an opening in the middle of the pot, over which place a concave instrument according to this method.
Make it from silver or copper: and insert the end, on which is the pearl, into the mouth of the patient until the steam ascends to somewhere above the tube, until much of the steam obscures it.
Then iterate over it many times, until healing occurs.
And beware, do not perform this treatment at the beginning of the onset of leprosy.
However, it is added in leprosy: and this should not be done unless at the decline of its heat.
But if this tool is not present for you, then take a reed and prepare its peel at the end of it, so that the mouth of the patient does not burn: because the peel of the date prevents the steam from burning the mouth; and this is part of good treatment with safety.
¶ For the removal of thorns and bones from the throat.
Chapter XXXVIII.
Often it adheres in the throat, either to fish bone or to some other thing.
Therefore, you should extract what is protruding above what falls when you press the tongue with a tool against the sun. Then it will be shown to you what is in the throat.
And if you cannot see what is hidden in the throat, you should make the patient eat before food is broken down in the stomach.
Perhaps then, something attached might come out through the vomit.
Or the patient might swallow a fragment of snail, or a lettuce stem, or swallow a crumb of dry bread. Or they might take a fragment of desiccated marine sponge that is soft; then tie it up in thread and swallow it.
When therefore he arrives at the place where the needles are, or the mouth, and extracts it, then he exits. If therefore you do not extract with what we said: then use this tool of lead according to this shape.
Let it be thicker than the radius somewhat, and at its end let there be a curvature, which insert into its mouth with ease: and let it have its head raised upwards.
And let him beware of contact with his epiglottis, so as not to cause him hiccoughs, and push it along with the mouth, or needle, or let the doctor himself thrust it in with his hand.
But what the sick person inserts is better; because of his knowledge about the place for the insertion. And he should push from below, or while raising his hand with the tool, all of this according to the amount which has been prepared for him, until it exits.
¶ On the removal of the Sanguinea.
Chapter XXXIX.
When treating a sanguinea with what I have said about the division of treatment compared to the treatment by doctors, and if it does not congeal, then consider in the patient's throat in front of the sun or after being under the sun, when you press their tongue with the tool that I told you about.
If therefore your instrument falls onto the sanguinea, extract it with a small hook, or with tongs that are slightly curved.
If it is not possible with them: then take a bulbous cannula, and insert it into the throat of the patient up to near the throat: then insert the heated iron of the cannula with fire.
Do this many times, and let the patient abstain from water for the whole day.
Then let the treated take in cold water, and open his mouth with it. And let him drink his mouth with it, and do not swallow anything from it; and let him move the water with his hand one hour after another.
Indeed, when the leech senses water, it falls off.
If however it does not occur with what we have described, then fumigate the sick person with bedbugs, or with a wing using the tool we described for fumigating a fly.
Do this many times, because it falls by itself.
And the method of operation during fumigation is to take a pot containing live coals with it: and the pot should be covered with a cover, having a hole in its middle: and the end of the tool should be composed within that hole.
Then release the fumigation, and let the patient place his mouth at the end of the tube, and close his mouth so that the fumigation does not escape, until you know that the fumigation has already reached the leech.
For the leech will fall immediately.
If however it does not fall, then repeat the fumigation many times.
And the patient will endure thirst, and eat salty things, and herbs, and does not drink water. So it is necessary that it (the treatment) should take effect with this regimen.
And this is the form of the tool used to extract a leech from the throat when it falls upon itself.
It is similar to tongs, as you see: but because there is this curvature in it that enters the throat.
And its end is similar to the beak of a bird which is named ciconia, in which there is the roughness of a file: when it grasps something, it does not release itself entirely.
Chapter on the incision of boils, and their sectioning, and care generally.
Chapter 40.
The species of boils are many, according to the memory of various ways, namely one and one in this book: and they differ in their puncturing and sectioning from two methods.
The first method is of the boil itself species, and that which it contains due to humidity.
And the second manner is due to the places where it occurs from within the body.
For since boils can occur on the head, it is a different thing from a boil occurring near the anus: and a boil that occurs in fatty areas is different from a boil occurring between joints. Each one of them has its own judgment based on their actions.
And among boils are those that should not be pierced until after the healing substance has matured in them and completed its process. And from these are those that need to be pierced while they are raw and have not yet matured according to their completion.
Such as boils that are close to joints.
For when a boil occurs near the joint and extends until it decays whatever is around it, perhaps it may corrupt the ligaments or nerves of that joint. This is why it becomes a cause for closer contraction of that member.
Or is the boil near the main member: for if you delay its incision until it matures, it will either harm him or through that main member.
It is near the anus, therefore puncture it in the immature: and there should not be need to puncture until it becomes a pus pocket that has not completed digestion, unless it is near the anus so as not for it to become deeply putrefied and extend into the interior of the anus, and thereby create a fistula, or it happens in the end part thereof which does not heal. It is necessary for you to know the time of puncturing a pus pocket which has reached maturation according to the full term: and this occurs at the reduction of pain, decrease in fever, diminishment of redness, and reduction of pulse, and acuteness of the pus pocket headache: and other signs. And it is necessary for you to make the same puncturing at the lower part of the pus pocket and at more pronounced elevation: and the puncture should run longitudinally through the body if the pus pockets are in hand parts, foot parts, places of cuts, strings, nerves, arteries, and up until the last uniform places where there is no reflection.
In those that reflect, puncture with the hole according to that member.
But when the pus pocket is in fatty areas: then it is better to let the puncturing of it continue until its digestion is confirmed, as we said according to the full term.
For if you puncture it before that, the course of the poison from it is prolonged, and there are much pus and inflammation, and perhaps the lips become hardened, and its depth.
And some pus pockets are punctured longitudinally across the body according to necessity: or according to where that member needs.
It is necessary for you to administer a small puncture in small pus pockets and a large puncture in large pus pockets: or multiple sections in similarity to the size of the pus pockets.
And they are from the apscesses, in which it is necessary that the skin should be hollowed out. And it penetrates when already formed like a patch, and reaches to the point, which is already dead: as happens in many cases, such as boils, and swellings.
And from these there are those that are cut by a section having three angles.
And from them is derived, from which penetration occurs like the shape of a myrtle leaf figure.
As for the inguinal abscess.
And from them are those in which a round section and a lunar (crescent-shaped) section are administered: and similar ones to these by sections.
And this one that does not have a head, such as are the small superficial apscesses, needs to pierce it with a superficial or merely flat perforation.
And it is necessary when the apscess is large and has already accumulated much pus, to pierce it, so that you do not press too hard and remove all the pus at once: indeed, extract some of it from itself.
Then let the apscess drain until another day.
Then again, extract some more from the pus.
Do that repeatedly according to the stages until all of it comes out: especially if the patient is weak in strength, or a pregnant woman, or an emaciated child, or an old and decrepit man: for the animal spirit is often released with the ejection of pus. And perhaps the sick person dies, and you do not notice.
So be cautious on this chapter, it requires great care.
And after your perforation of the apscesses, you must clean the wound: and inspect it.
If therefore there is a wound due to scythe cuts being scarce or is a flat cut, then administer linseed oil or old copper.
And if there is a large abscess and many puncturing cracks exist, then you must introduce linseed oil into all the cracks until the inner part comes out.
And if you have cut a part of the skin in an abscess or hollowed out that area in circumcision: then it must be filled with old copper, or like when weaving fabric, or removing wool from linen without moisture: and tighten it until the third day.
Then remove it, and take care of that along with what needs to be from the balm, until it heals.
And if a blood flow occurs during your operation time, then administer cold water and vinegar, after immersing the cloth in them: and place it over the bleeding spot multiple times.
And if the blood flow persists, then it must be that you administer treatment and care, as well as powders which I have described in many places of this our book, and from division.
And if it is during winter and the wound involves many nerves, then you should pour in powders mixed with wine, and warm oil, and place them over the areas.
And if it is during summer and the areas are fatty, then you should place powders soaked in water, and oil, or mix them with wine and oil, and present the entire thing cold.
Until then, when it is the third day as we said, you should remove the blister, clean it, and administer what suits its care until it heals.
This is therefore what is necessary from knowledge of the treatment of hernias universally.
According to the division of the topic however, I have already spoken about all hernias, in what manner is the way to treat them separately chapter by chapter.
Chapter 1: On the sections of hernias that occur in the head skin.
Head Chapter XXXI.
In the head skin, small hernias occur, and they are of types called Nodums, which contain sac-like tunics: as if they were swollen chickens.
And their kinds are numerous.
Among them are fatty ones: and among them are those that contain moisture like mud: and among them are those that contain moisture like grease and mousse: and similar to these, and among them are those that are hard like stones.
And in the section of all, and during their removal there is no fear, since at their section, an artery does not oppose itself.
The procedure for the operation on them is such that you would experience it with the tool whose shape comes after this, which is named the Intromissum, until you know what it contains.
For if there is that which contains moisture, then cut it along its length in a superficial manner: according to this form.
And begin with the cut from line b to line g. As the moisture is evacuated, then scratch away the lump that contains this moisture, and do not remove anything entirely from it.
Indeed, if there remains something from it, it will recur many times. Next immerse the head in Egyptian ointment if it is present; and if not, in water and salt. And fill him with this up to a wound, and release it until another day.
Indeed, it eats away what remains of the stump. Then cut it with the Egyptian knife over what remains of the stump for the second and third time. If you need to do so, until you are sure that nothing remains from the stump. Then take care of the wound with ointment until it heals.
If it contains a large whitish lump: then cut it according to this form, with a section having the shape of a cross. And remove the tips between the sections and scrape it from every side. And try your skill in extracting the membrane that contains it.
If however, an artery opposes you, then do what I will instruct you to do next.
And similarly handle it if there is an abscess with stones, from the section and care of which are the same as what we have said. And cutting through an abscess with stones is easier because there is little blood and moisture.
And sometimes there are some of these abscesses which occur at the head in certain people, where there is no moisture at all.
Or rather, always make a puncture from the lower part of them, so that the course of healing may go downwards.
Then, care must be taken in accordance with what is suitable for their treatment.
Regarding the dissection of Strobilus in the neck.
Chapter 42.
These hernias often occur in the neck, under the armpits, and in the groin: and sometimes they occur in other parts of the body.
And among those that occur in the neck are one kind and many kinds; they generate from each other: and every Strobilus is within its own proper membrane, just like it is in the knots and hernias of the head, as we have told.
The forms of these Strobilus (Strophula) are many.
And from them there are stony ones: and from them are those that contain moisture: and from them are malevolent ones, which do not comply with treatment.
Therefore, for the one among them that you see with good disposition to touch, whose evident color is close to that of skin, and moves throughout every part, and it is not attached to neck nerves, neither to guideg (ligaments), nor to artery, nor it is deep: you must make a superficial section in her from the upper part down to the lower body part along line b. to line g., and scrape her off from all sides: and extend two skin flaps with an incision tool, or with multiple incisions if needed as we said about hernias of the head and elsewhere, and extract her gradually.
And caution must be taken so that an artery or nerve is not hit.
And let the cut not be too sharp: so that you do not hurt your own hand with the cut or disturb the patient and accidentally hit something unnecessary.
If you do hit an artery or vein, or if the operation is hindered by this, then place in wound Z some powder that coagulates blood, and bind the wound, and let it go until the pain of hernia subsides and the wound heals: or it may begin to putrefy if desired.
For blood is removed by division, therefore proceed with your operation until completion.
Then attend to it yourself.
If the Strophula is cut completely, then it is necessary to join the lips at two wounds: and its own action should immediately be observed after you see that there is no excess.
But if you see that the excess remains because of the size of the Strophula, then it is necessary to extend to cutting its root and extracting it: and administer the stitch we said.
And which from the Strophilae contains moisture, puncture it with a superficial incision: so that you may see its maturation place: and make the puncture below where the body follows, as we said.
Then after the puncture, apply licorine with ointment and similar remedies, so that it may heal what remains from the corruption, until you see that the wound is already cleansed: then attend to it with the generation ointment of flesh until it heals.
¶ On cutting the epiglottis in an accidental injury within the throat.
Title: Chapter 43
The ancients said that this incision is made on the epiglottis, and no one from our land has been seen who would perform it: and here is the writing of their speech.
When they have a double swelling (synanche), it is necessary that an incision be made on the epiglottis. If this does not produce improvement through that method; therefore, because all the veins and lungs are weak.
In those who have a hot abscess in the mouth, or throat, or in both tonsils, when there is no sickness in the canals, it must use an incision on the epiglottis, to avoid the destruction that comes from pre-irritation. Therefore, when we are performing that operation, it is necessary to make the incision on the epiglottis under three circles of the epiglottis, or four, a small cut across its width, at the point where there are two circles, with the amount being an incision in sifacum (or possibly the soft tissue), not through the cartilage: and this particular location is suitable for the incision because it is shielded from the skin and blood vessels are far away from it.
And if the surgeon is timid, then it must be that he stretches the throat skin with a hook.
Then cut the skin until he reaches the canal: if he sees anything from them, cut the blood vessels.
Then cut the sifac (or possibly a specific tissue) as we described: and it indicates on the canal's section from the phlegm that comes out of there, together with what is broken, and the removal of voice.
And let the wound be open for some time.
And when the hour comes that is feared for pre-irritation, join together the two lips over the wound of the skin, and its own thing alone without the cartilage.
Then administer the medicines that cause flesh to be born, until it is healed.
Albucasis said.
The summary of this speech that we have narrated is not an exposition unless one notices that a patient has already drunk some of these remedies; and the sick person rises above death and wants to be cut open. They go up to the second epiglottis so that the sick person can breathe over the wound in a certain way, and they are saved from death: for this reason, they command to let the wound remain open until the sickness's malice is consumed, and it takes three days for its malice to become as good as cured: then they instruct to heal the wound, taking care of it until it heals.
And the thing that I have seen by myself is this: a maid took a knife and sent it to her throat, and with it she incised a part of the bronchial canal.
And I was called to treat him, and I found her moaning, like the groan of the dying.
I then examined at the wound, and found that a small amount of blood had flowed out from the wound.
I concluded that she did not draw the blood away or apply any bandage, and that air was escaping from the wound.
I therefore proceeded to treat her wound and care for it until it healed: and nothing happens to the maid except a harshness of voice: and she returns after days to better conditions.
Thus I say: there is no fear in cutting the epiglottis.
¶ On the section of the throat hernia.
Title XLIV.
This is called Hernia Gutturis, which is large pus pocket according to the color of the body, and it occurs frequently in women.
And there are two ways for this: either it is natural, or it happens by chance. In the natural case, certainly there is no design.
By chance, it occurs in two ways: one way is similar to large lumps.
And the other way is similar to a pus pocket that forms from a lymph node.
And there is fear in it. It is not necessary to make an assumption about it with iron, except in the case where it is scarce; you should test it and investigate it with an introduction (instrument).
If you find it similar to a large lump, and it is not suspended by any veins: then cut it as they would cut lumps. And extract it with whatever is contained within it if there's something inside the lump; if not, then thoroughly examine all of it.
Then take care of the wound with whatever needs to be taken from treatment until it heals.
¶ About the sectioning of nodules of this kind.
Title XLV. There are many kinds of nodules and I have already described all kinds of them in division. And it should be that here I describe the difference between a Nodule, and an Ejection: when there is confusion causing doubt. I say then that when Ejection is warmth and fever and severe pains until the overflow of excess subsides and the putrefaction is completed: then indeed the fever and heat cease.
When the knot does not have warmth, nor fever, nor pains, and contains them in bags like that which is their own proper sack, and is according to the color of the body: and it begins as a chick, and grows as a pea, and can be larger or smaller.
And they are according to two kinds: either fatty or containing moisture.
And the colors of moisture are many, as I said in the division. Therefore, when you come to treat the Knot, it is necessary for you to experience it and inquire about it first with the tool called the Intromissum, according to how its form will appear in the chapter that comes after this.
And the method of investigation for all Knots is that you take this tool and introduce it into the moist area found in the apostema. Then, move your fingers with it gradually until you know that the tool has penetrated the skin.
Then place the last part of your hand according to the size of the apostema.
Then remove the Intromissum, and examine what comes out during its investigation.
If moisture flows out, regardless of what color it is: then dry it by cutting superficially, as I said about other apostemas.
And if moisture does not come out during the investigation of the Intromissum, then you will know that it is fatty. Dry it by cutting over it in a cross-shaped area, according to this shape as I taught you: and suspend it with clips, and scrape off the skin from every part easily: and keep the sack if you can above it, so you can extract the healthy one along with the Knot.
If however the sack is broken during the operation and it's not possible to extract the healthy one, this happens quite often, then remove that (Knot) hastily until nothing remains from it.
For if there remains from it somewhat little or much, the second knot returns according to most.
If it defeats you and something remains from it: then fill the wound at your completion with some ground and corrosive sharp powders: and tighten the wound, and place above it what sits a hot pustule, and care for it along with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
If therefore it is a large Knot, then cut its two lips, and care for it with what creates flesh with it. If however it is a contrary pulsating vein, or not pulsating: then press it, and fill the place that I told you to grind, and release it tightly for two days, or three, until the wound rots and the blood ebullition ceases: then return to applying what remains from the Knot.
¶ Concerning the tools for cutting and piercing.
Chapter 46.
These include the forms of introducers, and there are three types of them.
Among these, there is the large one, among these is the medium one, and among these is the small one.
Let them be made from iron with square ends that taper inwardly, so they facilitate the introduction into the pustule.
And these are the forms of the probes and needles: namely, those that pierce. And one of them is named 'beris', meaning 'piercing': and there are three types of them.
Among these, there is the large one, and the medium one, and the small one.
It is necessary that they investigate through these pustules, discharges, and fistulas, and swellings, from what is between them in the bones.
And others are made round, smooth, soft, like large needles on which sewing thread is stored, from lemon wood, or from air, or iron, or silver. And the better ones are those that are made from lemon wood.
And experience is also done with black lead, which are used to understand the output ducts of which the curvature is reflections, so that they should be reflected together with their reflections with their smoothness.
And there are again three types. For from them there are the long ones, and the medium ones, and the short ones, according to the size of the curvature and tightness of the output duct. The form of hooks, and there are many types of it. For from them there are simple ones, that is, those that have one curvature. And there are three types of it as you see; Large, Medium, and Small.
And from them there are Blind Hooks: and they come in three varieties.
And from them there are hooks with two curvatures, and they come in three varieties: and from them there are hooks with three curvatures, and they also come in three varieties: and all these are necessary in their place.
And these are the forms of Scalpels, which cut and scrape Nodes, and eruptions: and they come in three varieties: for from them is great, medium, and small.
The ends of them by which the section is made are sharp, other ends are not sharp: they are not placed like this, unless so that through them a benefit may be achieved in scraping Nodes at the fear of incision of veins or nerves, and through them the sick is healed and finds tranquility to some extent from the heat he finds during scraping eruptions.
These are the Magdas, and they are of three species.
They are made from air and resemble the device used to create alcohol, with a broad tip hidden under what appears like a spatula. And in its extremity, there's a hole that flows into both inner and outer parts when needed, just as you see.
The form of the spatula which is hidden between fingers at the puncture for piercing wounds: and those who are ill do not feel them; and they come in three species, large, medium, and small.
The forms of the Ventricle tools used to stop blood flow, and they come in three species, large, medium, and small.
Let them be made from air or lemon, spherical, somewhat according to their length as you see, and let them be for subtlety.
And you must have these varieties of Ventricle tools as large and small ones for you, so that you can stop the blood flow with them at speed when necessary, and then when there is no medicine present to you.
However, you do not use them for stopping blood flow in every part of the body and only use them in fatty areas: like at thighs, hips, and arms, breasts, belly, groin, and similar places from fatty, moist areas.
And sometimes tools are made from them that are small and resemble finger blades according to their shape. With these, blood is removed when it flows from the phlebotomy site or upon incision of a vein or artery: and sometimes they are made round according to this form.
Chapter on the care of human breasts which resemble those of women.
Title: 47th Chapter
When certain people's breasts become inflamed at the completion of a dream (that is, when they start discharging during sleep) until they resemble women's breasts; and they remain as disgusting as they were before.
Therefore, whoever avoids this, must cut across the breasts at the lunar section according to this shape from line b. to line g. Then scrape off all the fatty substance.
Then fill the wound with ointment from cooked medicine.
Then stitch together the two lips around the wound and take care of it until it heals.
If the nipple, however, droops downwards and softens due to its size, as happens with women: then it must be cut in two upper sides by two similar sections of a lunar shape, each kept together with the other at both ends until there is a line that contains smaller one. After that, scrape off the skin which is between two lips, remove the fatty substance, and apply what we have said about stitching and powders as needed for treatment until it heals.
If you do not apply the incision required because of the patient's anxiety or bleeding: then you must fill the wound with a submerged cut in ointment corrosive and let it out until it corrodes what remains from the fatty substance.
Then take care of it until it heals.
For the perforation of scabs, which happens under the penis.
Chapter 48. These scabs that occur under the penis are from the hard species of Strophularia containing seeds, and among them are those that contain moisture.
What then are those among them that contain moisture, they must be cut sectionally at the lunar line, according to this form, from line b. to line g. Hence, when everything that is in the apse is evacuated by the sponge, then fill it with new coagulant and release it until another day.
Then the scab is removed, and it is treated with a suitable ointment until it heals.
And if there is an abscess of the type of nodes from the Strobilus (a genus of plant), then cut above it as we said in the division above for the Strobalis, equally.
And if the wound extends to such an extent that pus is emitted from it, then apply a cautery to it, as we said in what was previously addressed.
Regarding the division of abscesses which occur due to an artery and vein.
Chapter 49.
When an artery is ruptured and the skin above it becomes hardened, it often results in an abscess. Similarly, with veins as well; an abscess may occur within them and lead to inflation.
And the signs by which one can recognize that an abscess and inflation are due to an artery and vein are as follows: because when it is an abscess due to the artery, it is long in length, aggregated deeply within the body: and when you push on the abscess with your fingers, you feel as if there were a scraping sound.
And that which is due to the vein is round and visible on the surface of the body.
And cutting above this abscess is a mistake, especially if it's below the armpits, groin areas, neck and many other parts of the body: it is a large operation.
Therefore, it should be ensured that its care is provided with iron, and what is also present among them, whether at the ends or on top, should be treated accordingly.
Beyond this, concerning what is from them, originating from the expansion of the artery opening, find it in the skin layer in the longitudinal direction.
Then open the section with pincers, afterwards the artery: and free it from the tunics until it is exposed.
Next insert an incision beneath it, and make it penetrate to the other side, and tie the artery with a double thread at two places according to what I taught you in removing two arteries that are located inside.
Next pierce the place which is between the two ligaments with fat, until all the blood within it comes out, and dissolve the abscess.
Next provide the treatment that generates pus until the ligaments fall off: then care with suitable ointments is applied until it heals.
If the abscess is due to the cutting of the vein, then you should hold your hand against the skin with the part of the abscess that allows it from the abscess together with the skin.
Next insert a needle under the place you held with your hand, and make it penetrate: and have a double thread inside until you extract it from the other side.
Then tie it with the good abscess bandage: as I told you in the bandage of the womb, with two parts and two ends of thread. If however you fear that the thread will be extracted, then insert another needle with a different thread under the abscess altogether at the point of the needle incision: press and tie your threads in four places.
Then drain the abscess at its center, until what is inside comes out: then remove excess skin and release what is tied from it.
Then place on him the poultice that you have prepared in wine, and oil.
Then apply the treatment which is performed with ointments and unguents until he/she is healed.
¶ The abscess that occurs from the twist of nerves.
Head L.
Just as an abscess may occur in an artery or vein, similarly, it can also occur in nerves. This happens due to a blow or results from excess effort, and similar factors. It occurs very often in the areas of supports, heels, or any part where joints move. And it becomes a serious abscess. Its color is similar to that of the rest of the body, and it appears in various positions without causing pain. And when it is squeezed with unease, one feels a kind of weakness or dizziness within it.
And it is not an aggregated abscess within the depth of the body, rather, it lies beneath the skin, and can move to every part of the body. It does not affect things in front or before, nor behind it.
Therefore, whatever there is at joints should not be poked with iron.
Perhaps a contraction will occur, though.
In that which is from them, whether in the head or on the forehead, take off the skin with a small incision.
If it is a small abscess, then hold it with forceps and cut it off from the root.
And if it is large, then suspend it with a hook and scrape it off. Afterwards, remove it, leaving an ulcer, and treat it until it heals.
On the surgical division of scabs, which occurs in the abdomen.
Title LI. There occur among some people many times within their abdomens and in other parts of their bodies, what are called 'Thelil', which resemble fungi.
Whose root is subtle, and their head is large, and the lips of them are reversed.
And it is little from them: and there is much that magnifies greatly from them.
And indeed, I have seen a man and within his abdomen were two 'thelil', which resembled fungi more than other things. There was no difference between them, they had a white, fine root, and their lips would be reversed, they could be found, and moisture always flowed from them.
So I dealt with them and found that one weighed almost X and VIII ounces, and the other was almost VI ounces. The operation during their cutting is as you might consider it at this time: if a sick person is moist, and the color of 'thelil' is white, moist, with a fine root, then cut him along with his broad spatula, and have the cauterization present for you in fire.
Indeed, much blood is expelled during its division; therefore, if you are overcome by his blood, then cauterize him.
If you see the sick person frightened and timid during the incision with iron, then take a plumb line made to be twisted, and twist it with it: its method is as we said, and let him have it for two days.
Then add in the twisting of the plumb line.
Therefore, do not stop twisting the lead until it imprints on the 'thelil', then cut it off and let it fall by itself without effort.
If the root of the large thistle is thick, then there is some concern and weakness in its incision: primarily that which is in the abdomen.
However, it is possible to hit its midpoint during the operation.
Then cauterize it, so that it does not recur.
Next, take care of it until the wound is healed.
And be careful not to assume that you have hit a thistle of a yellowish color, which is insensible and has a foul appearance; for it is a cancerous boil: and I will cure it with reference to the remedy after this.
### On the Care of the Navel Wound.
Head 52.
The navel prominence (eminentia Vumbilici) arises from various causes.
Or it may arise from slits, which are above the belly: and it exits through it either an almond, or of the intestines, according to what happens in other ruptures.
Or it may come from blood that flows from the vein or artery, as previously stated.
Or it may be due to constriction of the abdominal area.
If it arises because of a slit and the exit is that of a boil: then its color resembles that of pus: and it is soft, without pain: and it appears to have various locations.
And if it arises due to the protrusion of the intestine, then its location is more diverse as we have narrated.
So when you press it with your fingers, it will disappear: then it returns, and perhaps there is a sound with it: and it is greatly manifested inside the bathhouse, and a severe discomfort.
If it is due to humidity, it is tender, then it does not hide when pressed by your hand, neither squeezing nor addition.
If it is due to blood, then with these signs an eruption appears turning black at the edge.
If it is due to living flesh: then the pustule is heavy, large, hard, and discharges according to a single quantity.
If it is due to wind, then its touch is tender. And the operation in that is to be considered, then if it's due to blood from an artery, or a vein, or wind, causing the prominence of the navel: then you should refrain from treating it.
For there is fear and terror in that, as I taught you in the chapter where I said pustules due to an artery and vein.
If the prominence of the navel is due to an intestine or hay fever, then you must advise the sick person so that they may hold their breath and stand stretched out.
Then signs with hot branding iron around the entire circumference of the navel.
Then advise him to be fanned between your hands on his back.
Then apply with broad applicator around the circumference of the navel over the spot you marked with the branding iron.
Then extend several pustules upwards, with a large curved implement.
Then bind him tightly around the waist with a strong thread or with a firm silk ligature string: and let the knot of the ligament be two fingers wide.
Then open up the extended pustule above the ligament.
If you cannot find the already captured thing from the ligament: then pull out the gut that has been prepared beforehand, and insert a finger into it, and push the intestines towards the abdomen's inner parts: and if you find a string, then take it with a hook, and cut off its surplus.
If however the contrary is to you an artery, or a vein: then encircle it much.
Then return to your operation.
And take two needles, and insert two strong threads into them: and insert two needles into the band you made around the pustule like a cross, making those penetrate.
And stitch the pustule in four places on the needle: and if you wish, remove the needle, and let the place be until the flesh has decomposed when stretched out: and it falls off by itself: or cut it when it becomes thin and decomposes.
And then take care of it with what is needed from the ointment until it heals.
If the elevation of the navel is from the nostril of flesh in it, or from dampness: then you should create a pustule as we said.
And extract the blood, or moisture, which you find inside it.
And then take care of it with what strengthens the place.
¶ On the care of Cancer. Chapter LIII.
For I could not heal anyone from this; nor did I see anyone before me who has succeeded in achieving this.
And the operation for that, as we said when it is localized like this, consists of leading (it), and discharging the patient from black fever occasionally.
And then if you find the bloodletting method with obvious fullness (of humor).
Then prepare the patient for preparation which will include the description of the operation.
And then produce in the Canthus uncus that agrees with it.
And then hollow it out from all sides with the skin, according to examination, until nothing remains from its roots: and let blood flow out and do not cut it quickly. Instead press on the area, and remove all the thick blood with your hand or whatever is possible using instruments there.
However, if the thick blood flow causes you difficulty from the cut of an artery or vein, then cauterize the vein until the blood stops.
And then care for it with all other treatments until it is healed.
¶ On the Care of Water Distention.
Chapter 44.
We have already discussed the division of types of Water Distention, and how water aggregation occurs: and the signs for all types, as well as the treatment thereof with medicines.
And that which is cured with iron is only the asclitis type alone: and it should not be brought near to the iron of the tympanic species, or the hypo-sacral species; for that is deadly.
When you have already treated thus, if there remains a type of hydro-pneumonia that does not respond to medicine: then reflect.
Indeed, if weakness has already followed him, or another ailment accompanies him besides hydro-pneumonia: just as if a cough is with him, or an abdominal loosening, and similar to those: then beware not to treat him with iron: for that is fear.
Indeed, if you see a weak person overflowing with strength, and there is no other illness besides hydro-pneumonia: and he is not young or old. Then the way of treatment in him is that you lift the sick one standing between your hands, and the attendant pushes his stomach with their hand forcing water downwards towards the lower parts using the ribs.
Then take the thorny spatula, according to this shape.
It should have two sharp parts, be long, with an acute end like a spatula.
But there should be somewhat of shortness gradually in it, so that you do not pass through to the point of operation until you reach the intestines and injure him.
Then reflect.
Indeed, if hydro-pneumonia originates from the part of the intestines, then it is necessary for you to extend with your cut from the navel by three fingers' length, downwards directly above the ribs.
Indeed, if hydro-pneumonia is due to an ailment in the stomach: then your cut should be on the left side from the navel three fingers' length.
And if its origin is due to the spleen, then the cut should be on the right side: and it also need not be a cut on the side under where the sick person wants to lie, so that no excesses flow to that vulnerable place.
Then puncture with a tool all the skin.
Then introduce into that section and raise your hand with the Spatula between the skin, and do it as if you were scraping it off: and let the amount to be scraped be equal to the thickness of a nail or roughly so.
Then puncture and continue until the Spatula reaches the empty space: and there will be a place for water to flow.
Then extract it, and introduce an instrument into the opening, which has this form.
And it is similar to a cannula: made of silver, or copper, or brass, smoothly polished; at the lower part of it there is a small hole and on both sides of it are three holes, two from one side and one from the other: and its end is cut like the incision of a reed, as you see; at the upper end of it there is a loop.
For when the tool reaches the water, then it immediately descends over the tool itself, thus evacuating from the water a quantity of half.
Because if you evacuate more than necessary from it, then perhaps the patient may die through the escape of his soul's body fluid: or it happens to him apoplexies which approach death.
But evacuate from it according to the strength of its virtue, and according to what is indicated to you by the patient's condition based on their pulse strength and health.
Then extract the tool, and retain the water.
That is because it gets retained immediately due to the skin that retains the opening which is above the Spatula: about which I have spoken, that you should puncture it according to that manner.
Then use the tool on another day if you see that the patient can bear this: and also extract a small amount from the water. Perform that for a few days without fear, and guard yourself against error: until there remains in the water nothing but a little bit.
If you are afraid for the weak one, and let out from water much of it: then care for it with the burial under hot sand, and abundant sweating in a bath and sunlight, and wait until there is a reaction: and care for it with dried medicines until it heals: and cauterize over the stomach, gallbladder, and spleen, after the removal of the water: according to what I have described in that which preceded.
¶ On the care for infants born where their bladders were not punctured.
Chapter LV. When anyone of the infants emerges from their mother's womb, and if the head of its mother is not punctured, or there is a narrow opening, or it is in an incorrect location.
Therefore, assistance must be given immediately with the puncturing of its mother's head when it is born using a thin and sharp tool, according to this form.
Then place a small, thin metal key into the opening and bind it in place. Keep this bound for three days or four.
Therefore, when the desire to urinate arises, remove the key and let her pass urine.
Then put it back in place.
And if you do not place the lead (plumbum), it is possible that the urine which goes over the spot will prevent it from closing.
That is why if there is a narrow opening (foramen), it is treated with lead as we have said, over many days, until it widens.
Those among them who have an opening (foramen) in the wrong place get hurt.
What is that, because among those who are born, there is an opening at the tip of the dart (or projectile): therefore it cannot penetrate forward until he raises the dart with his hand to the upper positions. There is no generation for him, therefore, because the sperm cannot reach the womb in a straight line: and it causes very harmful nausea.
And the method of operation in this case is to have the sick person lie on their back.
Then extend the end of the dart with your left hand to a considerable length, and cut off the head of the dart from its base, using either the point or an acute tool: like a cut made by a knife, or as if you were cutting something like a root, so that the middle part becomes similar to the head of the dart; and let the opening fall in the middle exactly where it should.
And beware of blood flow during your operation.
Indeed, this happens many times.
So oppose him with the one who removes blood, and take care of the wound until it heals.
### About Albucasis: Issues that occur in the prepuce and head of the dart, as well as corruption, blackening, and sticking.
Title 56: Head.
These Albucasis issues often occur in the dart and result in the prominence of harmful flesh.
And from that, there is one which is evil and another which is not evil.
Therefore, the non-evil one should be hung with a fine hook and cut until you cleanse it entirely.
Then place its head submerged in Egyptian oil for treatment. Then continue with care following that with dyaffinic oil until it heals.
If Albaether is malevolent and of a foul color, then it is necessary to apply the cautery to it after its cutting and its reason.
If indeed Albaether is confined within the foreskin of a man who has not been circumcised and it is part of Albaether between the foreskin and its part outside: then you must remove the Albaether which is inside in the first instance, until when it heals. Then care for the external part: because when you care for her at the same time, it will not heal the foreskin that it tears.
And it happens as well in the testicles and in the blackened and corrupted prepuce.
Therefore, you should cleanse the entire area that has already been discolored and what intends to spoil or is already spoiled.
Then apply on it afterwards with honey that has already been cooked with flour from miller's grain and ground herbs sifted through a sieve.
Then care for this in conjunction with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
If bleeding occurs, then apply the cautery with the lunar cautery according to this manner.
Indeed, the cautery is useful for two dispositions simultaneously, namely to stem bleeding and to heal a wound when it is spoiled.
If the head of the staff is corroding and everything is destroyed at that time: then you must insert a leaden tube into the prostrate cavity so that the sick person lies on it.
In adhesion of the prepuce with the head of the staff, and these adhesions do not happen unless in him whose prepuce is healthy, and circumcision is not required over it. Sometimes adhesion happens due to a wound or abscess: therefore, you must remove that with a blunt spatula until the ligament dissolves and the head of the staff is freed from all parts.
If it is difficult to distinguish them precisely, then it becomes necessary to scrape out something from the tip of the rod, and from the prepuce.
That is because the prepuce, when it's delicate, might be pierced due to its delicacy and quickly.
Then separate between the prepuce and the rod's head with a thin linen cloth that has already been made wet with cold water, so they don't stick together again.
Then it is treated with a止血 wine until it hardens. ¶ On the cleanliness of infants and care in dealing with mistakes that happen to them.
Chapter 57.
Circumcision is not a solution to continence like other wounds: however, since it is an outcome of our action, by our choice, and its usage suits infants specifically, it becomes necessary for us to signify in this operation a better one, and a less burdensome path leading to health.
I say then, that the ancients did not say to perform circumcision on any of their books, because they do not use it in their laws, and it is only what we have acquired through experience.
That is because I have found that a larger part of surgeons and bloodletters use cleanliness by circumcision, when performing with new knives, and using pincers. They also bathe in herbal decoctions, bind with thread, and make incisions with the hoof.
And indeed, I have tested all these methods and found no better form of cleanliness using pincers and binding with thread.
Because in cleanliness performed with new knives, the skin tends to peel off multiple times.
Because the prepuce has two layers of skin: thus perhaps the upper layer of skin is affected and leaves behind the lower layer. One must then be prompted towards making an incision for the second layer and expecting pain in the future.
And when the operation that is done through the anus, that is, with the finger, which surgeons use, does not secure the cut of the end of the male member: because perhaps it enters into its aperture.
In the case of reduction however, perhaps a knife is used and it might ruin your operation: and indeed the nature of a child's skin is short-lived, and many times such children are born that they do not require reduction: and I have seen this.
As for reduction using forceps and a ligature with thread, I have found good experience in it: because the forceps are proportionate to the incision: therefore, the sharpness above is like the sharpness below.
Therefore, when you press your hand, the two sharpnesses are proportionate, and they intersect at one time during the operation: and there is compression similar to a figure, containing the skin of the rod from every side, with which no error falls entirely.
The proper method of the operation is to make it understood, particularly with children, if there are those who understand a little more than you do, that you do not do this unless you tie the thread only in his rod and then release him until another day.
Then make him rejoice and be merry to the extent that you can give this back to his understanding.
Then insert your hand to the rod of him, and blow into the skin, and draw it upwards until the tip of the rod goes out.
Then cleanse it from that which is mixed with it in dirt.
Then bind the marked place with double thread.
Next, bind below it similarly to that part according to. Then hold with your index finger and thumb the place of the lower ligament's retention well, and cut between two ligaments.
Then lift the skin upwards either gradually or quickly, and pull out the head of the rod.
Then let the blood flow gradually (it is better thus), and place a poultice above; and on top of the poultice put a piece of cloth where the yolk has been spread, cooked in pink water, mixed with oil. Recently well: and let him rest upon it until another day: and take care of him with the remaining treatment until he is healed.
The form for using this tool for cleansing is as follows.
There should be two equal parts for the ends and they should fit together: so that the rod does not escape from them: and let their length be as twice the length of two fingers equally.
But an error occurs in the process of cleansing: because possibly the entire skin or a part of it escapes at the incision point. Therefore, you should extend it from the time of your appointment with your fingernail before the dissection point: and cut it according to equality.
If you cannot hold it with your fingernail, then pull it out with the hook and cut it.
If it passes three days and what is under the rod remains swollen, dissect it: then let that which has formed remain warm until you can gently scrape off the scab, and cut it according to preparation for you: and take care from above the rod.
For that will not harm him.
Therefore, attend to that, along with what hardens the wound as described in our treatise on powders. And if it goes beyond the skin reaching upwards and affects higher areas, that too will not harm him.
Therefore, take care of that along with what we said, until he is healed.
¶ On the removal of Retained Vagina in the bladder.
Head 58.
Retention of urine in the bladder is caused by an obstruction made from a stone, or frozen blood, or pus, or newly born flesh, and similar things from what we said about methods of treatment in division.
And if the urine does not resolve, and you identify its retention to be due to a stone that is already in the neck of the bladder: then it should have a patient placed on his knees.
Then have his feet placed on his back and let him extend his abdomen from the upper part of his back. And have the patient hold his breath as much as possible for himself.
Thus it is forced towards the neck of the bladder for the expulsion of the stone, whereby urine is relieved.
If it does not resolve with what we said, and if there are difficulties for the patient to overcome: then you must administer his removal with a tool called a syringe, which has this form. It should be made of silver, and should be fine, smooth, conical like a quill feather in thinness as thin as a ray's width, long in similarity to the length of one and two hands: there should be a thin cannula at its tip.
And the method of urine's exit through it is as follows: take a doubled thread and bind good yarn or wool at its end: then insert that end of the thread into the lower part of the syringe: and cut with scissors if there is excess from the wool, but insert in the cannula with breath just like that.
Then immerse the sponge in oil, or with butter, and with albugine: and have the patient sit on a seat, and soak the blister, and his staff with moist oils, and oil of olive, and warm water.
Then insert the syringe into the staff until it reaches the end of the staff.
Then double the part above from the navel. Then push the syringe into that part until it reaches the blister, and the patient should feel that it has reached its intended location; this is not done according to this order unless the opening through which it travels is in the place where there is a twist.
Then extend the string with wool gradually.
Indeed, the wax follows the wool.
Then remove her (the patient), and make the urine flow through the passage of urine with the wax: and repeat the syringe procedure, and do not cease this practice until the bladder is emptied, and the patient will find relief. ¶ Regarding the quality of the bladder enema with Clepshydra.
Chapter LI.
It is indeed blind or, in other words, closed.
And it has three openings: two on one side and one on the other, as you will see.
And the concave place where that which pushes is located should be of such a size that it can push itself without addition until something is drawn out with it from the wetness. And when it is pushed, whatever is pushed out goes far away: as Clepshydra does, which expels naphtha, that is, Greek fire in the sieges of war.
When then you wish to evacuate the moisture into the bladder, insert the end of the hydropistis into the moisture and draw out with it whatever is being pushed upwards. The moisture is drawn into the concavity of the hydropistis. Then insert its end into the rod, as we have described it in the syringe.
Next, push the moisture along with what is being pushed by that, for the moisture immediately reaches the bladder, so much so that the patient feels it. The form of thin enemas through which the bladder is filled with enema liquids.
Then insert the thread strongly into those holes, as they are turned. Next, gather the circle like it is gathered for an ointment pot: after you place what you wish from the moisture, oils, and waters into it.
Then bind this also into an instrument and do with it as you did with the bladder while expressing it by your hand until moisture reaches the bladder.
¶ On the Extraction of Stones.
Head 60. Now we have discussed the division of the species of stones and their treatment with medicines. We have differentiated between the stone that forms within the kidneys and the bladder, as well as its signs throughout. We spoke about the operation when performed by hand and the cutting: The stone formed in the kidney is properly called a stone. That which is shaped like a rod is that one; and I will recount this with clear exposition and succinctly.
I say then, that the stone formed in the bladder occurs most frequently among children.
And by its signs, it is observed that urine comes out of the bladder like water in terms of its thinness: and there appears white sand in it; the sick man uses his rod to rub against it, he labors with it, and hangs down many times. Then it rises, and is expelled along with them (i.e., the stone or matter) in multiple instances.
And the healing of children is easy, up until they reach fourteen years old.
And it is difficult among the elderly.
Among adolescents, however, there is a middle ground, which lies between these conditions. And for him who has a larger stone, the treatment is easier: and if it is smaller, it is the reverse of that treatment.
So when we come to the treatment, it is necessary in the first place to cleanse the patient with a cathartic, which will expel all the feces that are in his intestines: for sometimes the detection of the stone hinders inquiry. Then let the patient take their feet and be handled, and be agitated towards below: so that the stone may descend to the depths of the bladder or flow from a high place several times.
Then make him sit between your hands prepared, and his hands be under his hips, so that the bladder becomes completely inclined downwards.
Then examine him and touch him externally.
If therefore you feel the Stone in its place, then quickly approach with your section above it.
But if it does not fall under your touch at all, then you must cleanse the index finger with oil of the left hand if the patient is a child. Or use the middle finger if the patient is a fully grown adult. And insert it into his anus and examine about the stone until it lies under your finger. And gradually turn him towards the neck of the bladder.
Then press upon it with your finger and push it outward against the place, where his strength lies: and instruct the attendant to press the bladder with his hand, and instruct another attendant to extend the scrotum with his right hand up towards above: and with other hand remove the skin which is under the testicles in the part where there is a section.
Then insert the entering spatula, which has this shape.
And find what is between the anus and testicles in him, not in the middle but on the left side as it is born: and let there be a cut above the stone, and your finger be inside the anus: and make a cut across, so that the external cut is broad and the internal narrow according to how much possible egress of the stone from there could be without being larger.
Perhaps indeed, if the finger that is inside the anus presses the stone at the cut, and it leaves without difficulty.
And you will know that from the stone which has corners and margins, it becomes difficult for its passage because of this.
And from that, it is soft, similar to a gland, and round: and its exit becomes easy.
Therefore, for him who has corners and margins, add to the wound.
And if it does not proceed in this way, then you must devise something over it: or tie something over it while making a movement opposite to the center, whose end will be like the Moon which ties over the stone and does not exit from there; or insert an instrument under it with a subtle tool having a curved end.
And if you cannot make something over, then widen the opening slightly.
And if anything is stuck to you by some blood, cut it off with your knife.
And if the stone is more than one, then push the largest towards the opening of the bladder first.
Then cut down onto it.
Then push the smaller one after that: and do similarly if there are more, two by two.
And if the large one is very big, then ignorance is to cut it off from above with a large section.
For it happens to the sick one of two things, either he dies or an event occurs that there is frequent distillation of urine: because the place does not completely consolidate.
But administer its expulsion until it exits: or devise something to break its fracture with picks, until you extract him out quickly.
And when you have completed your operation, fill the wound with thyme, aloe, and dragon's blood: then tie it up, and place over it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or in rose oil and cold water, so that the pus bed rests warm.
Then incline the patient upwards on their neck, and do not merely untie the bandage until the third day.
When then you have解开 it, wash the place with water and much oil.
Then take care of the patient with the salve of myrrh, and the basil salve, until they heal.
If it happens that pus forms in the wound when heated and corrosive substances are added, or similar remedies, as if blood were congealed in the bladder and urine is prevented from passing through it: then recognize this by the discharge of blood with urine.
So insert your finger into the wound and draw out the blood.
For if it remains, it will provoke decomposition of the bladder and its putrefaction.
Then cleanse the wound with vinegar, water, and salt; and apply all kinds of remedies that are suitable for its treatment until it heals.
And it is necessary to take care of the entire period of treatment by binding two thighs and bundles, because of the medicinal substances that are placed on the spot.
And if the stone is small and lies within the canal of the spear, and becomes stuck inside it, preventing urine passage; then take care of it with what I will instruct you before proceeding to surgery.
Indeed, after performing many sections through this treatment, I have already proven that it works. And it happens that you receive the perforator from iron armor, which has this form, its ends are triangular and sharp, fixed in wood.
Then take a thread and tie it with the spear under the stone so that it doesn't go back to the bladder.
Then insert the piercing iron into the rod with ease until the Perforator reaches the stone. Then rotate the Perforator with your hand within the stone gradually. And refine the puncture until you make it penetrate from another side.
Therefore, urination is immediately relieved.
Then press your hand onto what remains of the stone from the outside part of the rod.
For it breaks itself, and comes out with urine, and the sick person is healed.
But if this cure is not prepared for you, because of something that prevents it from him: then tie a string under the stone, and another string above the stone. Then cut across the stone in the rod between the two ties.
Then extract it.
Then dissolve the bandage and clean the frozen blood that forms in the wound.
And it is not necessary to tie a string under the stone unless you do not want it to return to the blister: and another string above, unless when the string dissolves after extraction of the stone, skin returns to its place, and cooperates with the wound. And for that reason, it is necessary for you to tie a string above when you are tying it up, so raise the skin upwards, so that it returns at your completion, and cooperates with the wound, as we said.
¶ Extraction of Stones in Women.
Title LXI.
A stone is formed [in women] only sparingly.
But if such a person has a stone, then the treatment is difficult and prevented due to many methods.
One of them is: that a woman perhaps may be a virgin. And the second is, because you do not find a woman who will show herself to the doctor when she is chaste, or from those married.
The third reason is, because you do not find a woman who knows this art well, particularly the operation with the hand.
The fourth reason is the distance from the stone's location: hence deep incision is required, and there is fear involved.
Which means that if necessity compels you to do this, then you must take a female doctor, well knowledgeable; and such is found only partially.
If you remove that, then seek out a chaste and subtle doctor, and present him with a well-educated female obstetrician in matters of women's issues, or a woman who has taken part in this art. Therefore make her come before him, and especially instruct her to do everything as commanded by the examination on the stone. Firstly, what is done, that she examines if the woman is a virgin: then it must be that she inserts her finger into her anus, and seeks out the stone.
If therefore she finds it, restrain him under her own finger, and then command the obstetrician to insert his finger into the weakening abdomen, and inquire about the stone after placing his left hand on the bladder, and compressing it with a good compression. If therefore she finds the stone, then it must be that she moves it gradually from the urethral opening to lower parts with all her strength until she reaches with him to the root of the thigh.
Then cut over him at the midpoint of the bladder near the root of the thigh, from whatever part it is prepared for him, and feels the stone in that part: and his finger does not move away from the stone, restraining under it: and let the incision be small first.
Then insert the rod upon that section.
If therefore it feels a stone, then he should add to the section according to the proportionate quantity that the stone comes out from it.
And know that the appearance of stones is many. For they come in various forms; some are slender and large, soft and rough, elongated or round, having branches.
And you should know their variety so that by this over the following point, you may be shown to them.
If therefore blood overcomes you, then add to the place where it was, ground substance, and keep it for an hour until the blood is removed.
And if the flow of blood overcomes you and you know that the expulsion of blood is from the artery which has been cut; then place the powder on the spot and bind it together with powders in accordance with what is suitable: and do not let this be. And remove the stone, but do not take it out.
Perhaps, indeed, the weak woman will die.
Then take care of the wound.
And when the sharpness of blood subsides after days and the place has decayed, then return to your operation until the stone comes out.
¶ On cutting through the aqueous hernia.
Head LXII.
A watery string is not present, unless it is an aggregation of moisture beneath the white sheath that contains the testicles, which is within the skin of the scrotum. This is called the sifac. And sometimes there is a specific pouch for itself within it which nature has prepared in the scrotum until we think that: which is something else, and it's the skin of the testicle between the whitish albumen as we said, and this does not happen except rarely.
And the generation of this happens due to weakness which occurs in the testicles: therefore, this substance flows towards them.
And sometimes it happens due to impact on the testicles.
This moisture has many colors. Or indeed its color tends towards yellowing, or it is red with a tinge of blood, or it is feculent, black, or it is watery and white, and that which is more abundant.
For if there is the whitish albumen as we said in the scrotal sac, then the blister is round to a length that matches somewhat the shape of the scrotum: and the testicle does not appear because the moisture contains it from every part.
And if the moisture is in its own scrotal sac, then the blister is round with a part of the scrotum's shape, and because of this, man judges there is something else besides the testicle.
And if moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the whitish albumen, then it falls under common perception.
So when you want to understand the color of moisture, then experience the color of moisture within the blister with an inserted square, whose shape precedes it.
Accordingly, judge about what is between that and the inserted exploration, as it emerges in investigation.
When we come to treatment with iron, then you must advise the sick person to undergo bloodletting if it is possible for him and you see that his body is full.
Then he is stitched up over his back above a somewhat high mound, and place many cloths under it.
Then sit on his left side, and instruct your attendant to sit at his right side, who will extend the stick of his towards one of the two sides of the scrotal skin, and towards a portion of the lower abdomen.
Then take a broad spatula and cut the scrotal skin from the middle longitudinally up to near the pubis: and make a cut according to the line which divides the scrotal skin into two equal parts, until you reach the white substance encompassing it. And remove or cause him to be removed as much as the amount that is possible with your removal, making sure the excision comes from the part hanging down more along with the testicle: and examine carefully with the excision according to what is possible for you.
Then puncture the white substance full of water with an enlarged puncture and extract all the water. Then divide the two parts of the section with scissors, and extend the white substance to the upper part, without touching the skin encompassing the testicles. And cut into it as much as you can cut it for yourself, or completely, especially the finer side.
For if you do not carefully examine it, there will be no safety that water does not reappear in its incision.
If however the sperm duct protrudes outside its skin during your operation: then when you have completed the section of it, bring it back.
Then stitch together the two folds of scrotal skin with sutures.
Then care for him as you would other wounds until he is healed.
If you find that the sperm duct is corrupted by another source of darkness, then it will be necessary to tie the threads which are used for support, fearing a flow of blood.
Then cut out the testicle with its suspension and pull out the penis: afterwards take care of it along with what we said.
If water is aggregated into two parts, then you will know there are two roots. Therefore, cut off the other part according to what you did in the other one equally.
And if it is equal to you, such that there is but one operation, then do so: afterwards remove the blood.
And insert into the sections wool submerged in oil or in rose-oil. Then place another piece of wool outside that you prepared in wine and oil. Lay it over the two testicles and cover with a pouch. Place above this doubled cloths, and they are the poultices. Secure them above with the ligament, which has six parts according to this form.
Then take two cloths and soak them, then fill them with dyed wool according to this likeness: and create ends where pressure is exerted from the crotch or wet wool. These should be bound together with the bandage in the loin area. One end will go over the anus up to the back, and the other goes up to the hip part. Two ends then go over the two lower thighs and the other two go over the two inguinal areas. The whole bandage is then tied together in the loin area.
And sometimes this root is treated artificially with a cautery instead of the cut section by iron. You should take a fine surgical knife and make the incision through which the testicle skin comes off. Then ignite it as we have described until the white part containing water is revealed. At that point, you should take the cautery in this manner.
The Greek letters are assimilated.
Then pierce that fimbria with it and heat until all moisture has come out.
Then extend it with hooks and scrape it with a fine-ignited cautery. Cut it as much as is possible to you until all of it has been removed.
And draw from the egg, let the fire not touch itself.
And know that this operation is beneficial, and lasts longer after blood flow, and is better than an operation with cutting.
But if it causes opposition to you during the time of cutting, or at the moment of applying a hot blister during cauterization, or blood flow, or anything else: then you must treat what causes opposition in accordance with the treatment that suits it, as was stated previously.
But if the patient is timid and does not anticipate this operation due to its horror: then apply a puncture according to what I describe: and it is done.
When you are informed by you through the thing we said about indications, that ramis is watery: then it is necessary that you make the patient sit on an elevated seat.
Then puncture the blister from the lower part with a broad spatula: and make the puncture according to the length of the body, and let it be an open wound until all water drains.
Then place the bolster over the site, and bind it, and let it drain until the rest of water flows out: then take care of it until the wound heals.
But if opposition is present during the ejection of water when you puncture it, and this happens not otherwise because a white piece of cloth causes opposition in wound openings, and prevents water's exit: then it is necessary that you insert a feather into the wound or a tool used to remove water from hydropsy patients, whose form has preceded. Or add something similar during the operation on wounds.
And you will know that urine returns and aggregates around six months, or roughly about that time.
And when it aggregates, then the sick will be cured in the same manner, and the patient will pass their diseased days.
¶ On the care of the fatty tumour (Ramicis).
Title LXIII.
And you will know that in the cutting of this fatty tumour, there is danger of losing more than necessary in various situations.
Therefore, it seems to me beneficial for its dismissal from that situation.
And I am recalling the procedure for that, and looking at the characteristics of the apophyses (protrusions).
I say that many apophyses occur in bodies which make up the testicles; and this happens for various reasons, namely. Or due to acute overabundance which spills into the testicles, or due to sharp ones that overflow them.
Or from a blow.
And the color of apophyses matches the color of the body, and no pain is felt: and it is heavy apophysis.
And perhaps it is a stone apophysis whose color is dark brown, and there is no sensation with it.
And sometimes it occurs from the knotting of arteries and their expansion; as was already recalled earlier: or from the expansion of veins.
And what is due to expansion of the arteries can be recognized by the arrangement of apophyses when you press it with your fingers.
And you should not touch it entirely.
However, that which occurs due to the expansion of veins does not scatter anything when compressed with fingers. And it is possible that a section can be made over this form, and over other meats: and there is one which cuts the skin of the testicles.
Next extend the scrotum upwards and pull out the testis with a piece of white string. Free the suspension from the vessels and tie off the blood vessels, then cut the suspension after you have released it completely from all parts of the scrotum.
If therefore the scrotum is consolidated with those born meats, then it must be drawn out and cut. And if there is adherence between something from the saphenous vein, or within what is between the vessels; then it must be that you free all of this adherence and cut it with a round incision.
And if there is a birth of flesh at the site of the adherence which is behind: then it must be that you cut out all of it, and remove the scrotum as we said. And when your operation is completed, then fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine; afterwards care for it along with other treatments until it heals.
¶ On the care of Ramicis which is with the Vine.
Title LXIV.
It refers to a pustule that has been rolled up in a similar way to a ball, with the softening of the testicles; and it makes walking difficult for the sick person due to movement and exercise.
And in the treatment of this illness, it's done with caution, considering what came before as a reminder.
However, we must say that the operation for this is according to how the first ones did it. I thus say that you should have the sick person sit on an elevated seat.
Then cut with a broad, sharp knife across the urethra in a straight line until the muscles are exposed.
Then remove from every side as we have instructed you on the removal of arteries which are found in the veins.
Then cut those things centrally with a straight cut according to the length of the body, and remove what is gathered from the decaying feculent moisture.
Next, take care of the wound as you would of other wounds where disease is likely to be produced, so that the nourishing arteries which supply one testicle may fall away.
For it is not bad through this.
But if it happens that the wires have all been affected by the threads, then they must remove the testicles with the wires because otherwise it would deprive them of their nourishment due to the incision and cause either healing or drying out which would not be beneficial for them.
¶ On caring for Intestinal Sticks. Title LXV.
Therefore, the intestines descend from that rupture to one testicle.
This rupture is either due to a cut (sifach), or by its stretching.
These two kinds of accidents happen from many causes. Or by being struck. Or by jumping. Or by loud noise. Or by lifting something heavy, and similar actions.
And the sign occurs when it's due to stretching or cutting.
What happens gradually over a long period and does not occur suddenly; it results in an equal depth pus pocket: because the cut compresses the intestine.
The sign for this when it's due to cutting a cut is that it causes sudden intense pain immediately: and there appears an unusual pus pocket beneath the skin nearby: and this occurs because of the passage of the intestine and the flow of its contents towards the external cut.
And sometimes it comes out with the intestine in grains: and this is called Intestinal Furuncle, and the grain. And sometimes it occurs with wind.
And sometimes it runs into the intestine with feces and gets retained there: and this is accompanied by weakness in the sick: because it causes an unpleasant pain to occur, especially when pressure is applied.
And in the treatment of sickness caused by these categories, there is fear with iron: therefore, it is necessary to be cautious about situations like this.
The method of operation is to guide the sick person, so that they can bring their intestine back into its inner concavity with their hand if it conforms to the return.
Then, it is wrapped up over his neck between your hands: and lift up his legs.
Then extend the skin which follows the skin towards the head and cut the skin of the testicles completely along the length.
Then fix at the two edges of the incision with hooks according to what you need for opening the incision with them: and let the cut be according to as much as is possible so that it may come out from there completely.
Next scrape the spermatic cord and what is under the skin of the testicles until when the white scrotal sac becomes visible, hard from all sides: then insert your index finger into that which follows the testicle, into that which is between the white scrotal sac, which is under the skin of the penis, and the white scrotal sac, and completely to the point where there adheres in the posterior part of the penis.
Next, move with your right hand towards the interior of the testicle skin: and as you do this, extend the white scrotal sac upwards with your left hand: and lift up the penis along with the white scrotal sac to the cutting area: and instruct your assistant to lift the penis upwards fully: and then resolve the adhesion completely in the posterior direction.
And search with your fingers so that there is nothing from the intestine involuted in the white and hard scrotal sac.
If you find anything from that, then push it downwards towards the abdomen.
Next, take a thread with a thick core, made of ten threads: and insert this at the very end of the spermatic cord, that is, the layer which follows the skin of the testicles towards the cutting area: then cut off the protruding ends from the thread until there are four threads.
Then compose some of them over some with a figure that is in the shape of a cross: and tie it to the white scrotal sac about which we spoke, for it is a strong ligament under the skin of the testicles, until no more discharge from them can send anything towards them: so as not to happen there an inflammatory heat.
And place again the banding after the first banding, making it longer from that by less than two fingers.
And after these two bandings, make a cut in the place that is under the scrotum skin, with the size of a finger; and cut the rest completely according to roundness, and remove everything from it.
Then cut in the lower part of the scrotal skin, from where blood flows, and heal it properly: as we have told you in what was presented beforehand.
Next, apply the fat that has been soaked in oil and place it in the wound: and apply the bandage as we have described.
And at times, what we called the white suture is cauterized after making an incision in it fearing blood flow.
Indeed, this happens many times.
And cut the bandage until it falls by itself.
If the situation continues though, then it is treated with warm water: and place upon it what we have said until it falls.
Then care the wound like any other wound, until it heals.
§ On Windy Willows.
Chapter LXVI.
In these Willows, I have not heard of anyone who was daring enough to use iron in treating its cure with it.
And at first they said that it behaves like what we have described for Willows growing with Vine, as follows:
Which is, that you bind the wound after cutting it above with ease below: then cut in the middle, and finally treat it with what opens it until the threads fall off: and care for the wound as we have said until it heals.
On the dissection that occurs in the inguinal region.
Chapter 67.
When a rupture occurs in the inguinal region, as we have said, and there is an elevation of the area, and nothing from the intestines descends to the testicles: and if it does descend, then this is insufficient, and returns at all times. But if it extends with that time, an opening is added into the sifach until the intestines descend into the sifach.
And this happens with the extension of the sifach which is located in the inguinal region as we have said.
This happens because the sifach is extended; then it softens, the area becomes loose and elevates.
And its treatment is with cautery, as was previously explained.
And sometimes it is treated with iron according to this method: and it should be that the patient lies on his back between your hands.
Then, cut the ruptured and elevated site of the ulcer through its width, according to the length of three fingers.
Then tighten the saphenous vein and, what is beneath the skin, until you reveal the white saphenous vein, which is beneath the skin that follows it.
Then take a thread and place it over the elevated area from the saphenous vein, and press it deep into the abdomen.
Then apply two points of elevation over the end of the thread from the saphenous vein, and connect one end with the other using stitches. Then pull out the end of the thread.
And do not cut the saphenous vein completely, nor tighten any other thread, as I have taught you in the treatment of bowel hernias. Then that is the care and treatment of wounds.
And when you fall upon a thread, cleanse that, and restore the wound until it has consolidated.
The sinew contracts, and does not increase in height, of the rupture.
And cauterization is better in this place: because it is closer to recovery.
¶ On softening of the skin of the testicles.
Chapter LXVIII.
The skin of the testicles becomes softened in some individuals, due to which the flesh between them softens as well, and it ruins their appearance.
Therefore, it is necessary for the one who is requested to treat him that he makes the sick lie on his back, and allows the entire softened skin to fall over the natural skin. Then gather the two lips with stitches: and if you wish, first remove the excess of the softened skin with three stitches or four, and secure it firmly.
And then continue with the treatment of the remaining wounds until they have healed, and remove the stitches when necessary.
¶ On Castration.
Chapter LXIX.
You should know that Castration is prohibited by our law and for that reason I would have preferred not to mention it in my book. And there is no need to recall this method unless for two reasons.
The first reason is so that this procedure might be known to the doctor when he is asked about it and so that he knows how to treat those who undergo it.
And another method is that we often require the castration of certain animals for purposes beneficial to us, such as sheep, horses, cats and similar ones from among animals.
I therefore say that castration occurs according to two methods. Or through wear and tear.
Or through cracking and severance.
In this method, which is performed through wear and tear, the procedure goes as follows: we make the animal sit in hot water until its testicles soften, become more relaxed, and hang down. Then, with your hand, you shave them off until they fully resolve and are no longer visible upon touch.
In the castration through cracking and severance, you need to hold the animal and press the skin of its testicles with your left hand.
And this method of castration is better than that which occurs through wear and tear: because wear may leave something from the testicles, for which the animal desires mating.
Then care for the wound until it heals.
### On the Care of Hermaphrodites (in Two Ways)
Chapter 70.
A hermaphrodite can be derived from females in two ways.
One of them is that there appears within it something akin to a space or an area on the skin where the testicles are located, with an image similar to that of a woman's pubic region including hair. Sometimes urine runs out from what is present on the skin of the testicles.
In women there is a single species, and it is the case that a woman's nose extends beyond her hairline like small testicles in men, protruding to the outside. Of which one resembles a prepuce of a man, and two resemble two testicles.
And the treatment for three species, two from men and one from women, is: because you must cut through the added flesh until the impression of them has escaped.
Then attend to the remaining wound treatment.
In the second species of men, from which urine emerges, which is within the skin of the testicles, there is no operation, and indeed its treatment is not entirely.
¶ On the incision of the Tentigine (a term used for certain parts of the female anatomy) and the protruding flesh in women's vulvas.
Chapter 71.
The Tentigine may be added over the natural part until it becomes disfigured and ugly. In some women, it sometimes becomes so large that it expands like in men, reaching up to intercourse.
Therefore, you should remove the excess of the Tentigine with your hand or using a hook, and cut it. And do not end the cut mainly in depth at the root, to prevent bleeding.
Then attend to that wound's treatment until it heals.
Flesh that arises is flesh which grows within the womb's opening until it fills it; and perhaps extends outward according to the likeness of a tail. And because of this, some label its discomfort as having a tail-like feature.
Therefore, you should cut it just like you would cut the Tentigine and treat it until it heals.
On the care of Ailritic, which is a non-punctured woman.
Head 72.
Ailritic is, whether it be a woman without a puncture, or there exists a small opening.
And it can either be natural, or accidental.
Accidental is due to an illness that preceded it: and indeed, it can either be added naturally to the flesh, or as something fine, or thick: and it occurs either deeply in the womb, or on its sides, or at its top, or at its bottom. And it prevents intercourse, fertilization, and childbirth, and perhaps also menstrual flow.
Knowledge of this is obtained through the examination of gynecologists, if it seems to be closely adjacent and observable.
But if it is not observable, then seek it with your fingers or using a tool like a rod.
If the obstruction is from something fine and thin, and it is closely adjacent to both lips: then gently approach it, and break it apart.
And you will place them over the two little lips.
Then place the tips of both your hands simultaneously, and let the woman lie on her back with her legs spread out.
Then extend the two lips with strength until you break that fine obstruction and allow the opening to open up.
Then take the thread, soak it in oil, and place it at that location. And let the woman use this every day so that the location does not harden instead of other treatments.
If it is thick and coarse, then you need to remove it with a broad spatula like the leaf of a myrtle.
If the surgical dressing is made of flesh naturally, then hang it with tongs and cut it. And have with you medicine that stops blood flow without piercing, such as Acacia and dragon's blood, and mix it together with albumen oil.
Then apply a large leaden cannula so that it does not harden or quickly close the wound. Keep it in place for several days. Then apply linseed oil and after this follow further treatment until the wound is healed.
And sometimes births occur in the womb of other kinds of flesh: Therefore, they must be treated according to this method: while there is no abscess, for a cancerous abscess would oppose iron entirely and not agree with it.
¶ On the treatment of hemorrhoids, Aethehil and Botor's method for blood loss in women's wounds.
Title 73.
Hemorrhoids indeed are the opening of venous channels, until much blood flows out continuously from them.
And when hemorrhoids occur, they become thylas. And I have already spoken about their types and signs and said what ones can be treated with them and which cannot.
I say then, that hemorrhoids which are within the womb's opening and do not show themselves to touch: for such ones there is no treatment with iron.
As for those among them that are within the womb's opening to which touch can extend, these are the ones that can be treated.
Therefore, you must have the woman enter a cold room.
Then apply Aethehil with needles or with rough cloth and cut them off from their roots.
Then powder them with substances at the time of blood flow from one type of cut without corruption: such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and turmeric, and similar to these.
Then push his feet against the wall one hour.
Next, place her in cold water.
If the blood flow persisted: then make her sit in a decoction of sumac, and lemon peel, and gall stones, and similar things.
Then take barley flour, mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a paste with it to apply on her back.
If therefore the blood flows with it, it is good: and if not, make suction cups stick to her back and breasts without incision.
Then take wool and immerse it in the extract of tarrah, or the extract of the tongue of a calf, or the extract of the branches of aloulath, that is, aglantur, Pontic wine, and make it stick with a goad.
When the abscess has ceased to form, then take care of the site with ointment until it heals.
Albarth is also red like headscarves, and has an uneven appearance.
Therefore you must cut what appears from it, according to what I said about the thylis equally: and take care of it until it heals.
¶ Concerning perforation that occurs during parturition.
Chapter 74.
Various types of abscess may occur in the womb, such as cancer, and abscesses of stones, and ulcers, and reddened spots, and blistery rashes, that is, herpes, erysipelas, and fistulas, and hemorrhoids, and thelilias, and hot abscess.
And indeed, I have already discussed all these illnesses and types of them, and their symptoms, and their treatments within this division. It is necessary to say about this treatment of a hot pus pocket that occurs in the matrix when it is from pus pockets that collect sickness, and one must know how its opening is done with iron.
Therefore, you must consider this.
Then if the pain in the pus pocket at its beginning is sharp upon hitting it, and there is a flame, and fever: and you see it turn red: if it falls onto it with sensation, then do not press it when perforating it: and treat it together with it whatever helps for maturation until when the intensity of events subsides.
Then it is necessary to make the woman sit on a seat which has two seats, and reclines her, or ties her up over her own back, and gathers her feet towards the lower part of the belly: and let her thighs be spread out, and places her arms under her knees, and ties each with accompanying ligaments to that.
Then the midwife sits from the right side, and administers the tool with which the opening of the matrix is made.
The form of which arrives in those who are behind.
And it is necessary when you wish to administer this tool, that you hold with the woman's deep radio: so that what comes out from the tool is not deeper than the depth of the matrix, and harms the sick.
If however the tool is more than deep, then it is necessary that you place needles over the layer of depth in the matrix: to prevent the entry of the entire tool into the depth of the matrix: and it is necessary that she puts a whirlwind which runs in the tool from above side: and hold the tool, and rotate the attendant whirlwind until the depth of the matrix opens.
When therefore the excision is evident, and felt with the hand, and is soft and spongy: then it must be cut off at its head with a broad knife.
When the incision is healed properly, then it must be placed into an immersed wound in rose oil: or in green oil, where there is some stictic acid: and place the dressing and extract the section deeply from the matrix.
And place externally over the matrix and over pure woolen thread immersed in water, into which the apples have been boiled.
Then cleanse with the appropriate ointment for two days, until it heals.
And sometimes the matrix and wound are washed, so that they are cleansed with water and honey: then with water in which the root of the lily or long artemisia has been boiled. Then return to the ointment.
If the wound is hidden internally within the matrix, then it must be treated with iron and rather treat itself according to what we said about division for its care over a long period.
The doctrine of the treatment of living embryos, how they are treated when they are born according to an unnatural figure.
Chapter 70.
It is necessary for the obstetrician to know first of all the natural figure of birth.
From these signs you can tell that when you see a woman press herself down towards the lower parts, and she desires to breathe in air, and she delights in what is on her regarding birth, and eagerly anticipates the exit of the embryo: then you know that this birth follows the natural figure, and its exit is above its head, and with it comes the afterbirth or placenta: or suspended, or hanging from the umbilicus. When you see these signs, then it is necessary to compress his abdomen, so that the embryo may descend quickly.
And the one who is other than this birth is unnatural, unpraiseworthy.
For sometimes the fetus emerges on its feet, and its body comes out before its head, and its feet, and one of its hands: or its head and one of its hands emerge: or its abdomen emerges: and perhaps it turns onto its own neck, and similar unnatural figures from such disgraceful illustrations.
Therefore, it is necessary for the Obstetrician to be prudent and subtle in all these matters, and to guard against error and deception: and I am showing every figure from them, and how cleverness exists in that, and it will be explained through this, and it stands upon him.
When the fetus emerges over its head in its natural birth process, and then this happens to the woman, making her delivery difficult, and you see her strength already weakened. Then make her sit on a chair, or women hold her: and let her breathe through steam with cooked fennel, and with moist oils.
Then the Obstetrician should introduce a small spatula between her fingers and find a thread with it, then clean it with her finger until she removes whatever is inside from the moisture: and press the woman's abdomen until the fetus descends.
If however it does not descend, then the woman should be treated with a suppository made from fennel mucus, mixed with safflower oil.
Then instruct her after the suppository to be compressed and make her sneeze with pepper, and keep her mouth and nose closed at the same time.
For the fetus would come forth immediately.
If two hands of the fetus come forth first, then it is necessary that you should gradually return them with ease.
If however it does not yield at the entrance, then place a woman on the seat and raise her feet upwards. Then strike the seat towards the ground; and let the woman be held so that she does not fall with the impact.
If the hands do not come forth and the fetus dies, then cut them, and extract the rest of the fetus. And bind its hand with cloth and pull it out with equal force, for he himself will come forth.
The exit of the embryo over its own feet.
When the fetus comes forth over its own feet, then it should push them upwards. Then gradually turn the fetus. Afterwards make it level.
Then take one of its feet and extend it gradually.
When they come forth up to the hips, then instruct her to squeeze and have her sneeze when she bends over. For she will come forth if God wills it.
And if it does not come forth as we have described, then gradually reduce the fetus until you place it according to its natural figure.
Then he will come forth then with an easy exit.
If it is opposed by everything we have described: then take from the aloes' mucus, and sesame oil, and gum dissolved: and crush all of it with good mortar beating. Then strike it up with a woman's voice and below her belly.
Then have her sit in warm water until the uterus sinks.
When therefore you see that his parts are already heated, then make him an ointment of myrrh: and suppose it yourself.
When therefore she has held the hour once, then make her sit on a seat.
Then make her sneeze: and pinch her mouth and nose: and press the lower part of the stomach with ease.
The fire will immediately come out.
The birth of the fetus is above the knees and hands.
When it emerges according to this shape, then introduce his hands gradually.
Then the woman is to be supinated on her neck, and her feet are to hang down below: and she herself is to lie on the bed, and join her hands together.
Then press gradually over his stomach.
Then extract what is under his feet from the uterus until it is prepared in the lower part.
If the fetus does not emerge, then take his feet and move them with a vigorous movement.
Then press what is above the lower part gradually, until the fetus ascends to the upper parts.
Then insert his hands and gradually equalize the fetus: and instruct the woman to compress until the fetus emerges.
The birth of the fetus hangs laterally from the hands.
The hand is to be introduced during reduction.
If however she cannot reduce it, then lift the woman up and make her walk.
If she cannot walk either, then have her lie down on the bed: and shake her legs with a strong shaking.
Then apply the lotion which you have prepared from mucus.
If it accepts the birth, then make her sit on a seat.
Then devote yourself to the reduction of the hands, and equalize the fetus according to its natural form: and make the woman sneeze, and instruct her to pinch herself until the child is born.
The birth of the fetus over its own neck, with its hands extended, and its face is turned towards the mother's back.
The midwife must hold the fetus' hand, then gradually rotate it, and equalize it with ease.
When she has equalized, then place on the oil-covered area as we have described it from oil and mucus.
Then instruct her to move gradually.
When you have done that, then make her sit on a seat, and instruct her to lean towards the right side.
Then instruct her to be squeezed: and make her sneeze while lying down.
The birth of the prepared fetus over the side.
When it descends through the mother's opening according to this manner with a thread, then divide the thread with your nail until it discharges by moisture.
If therefore it is hanging over the face of the fetus and its neck, then cut her from the navel: so that she does not be retained and die.
Then push the fetus into the insides until you place her according to what is necessary; and instruct the woman to pinch herself from time to time: for she will come out by a slight birth.
The Outcome of Twins, or Multiples.
You know that twins frequently are born: and sometimes three, and even four are born.
However, this is an exception and it rarely happens.
But there is a fifth case which is outside the natural order and they do not live completely: and includes them, even though they multiply, into a single twin: and they are separated by the cord, distinguishing each one of them by their umbilical tie.
And sometimes they emerge as an individual fetus would naturally and easily emerge, just like we have described. And there are cases where they emerge in a most difficult manner, as we have recounted. If some of them have difficulties during birth and proceed to the situation we described using unnatural diagrams, then treat them as we have instructed. Let there be a delicate scalpel, and let him perform the operation with ease and caution, adapting his approach according to every diagram, prepared for it with skill that leads to healing.
Sometimes within the womb, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and more than ten are formed. And indeed, it has been observed by me that a woman experiencing miscarriage expelled seven, and another fifteen, all of them formed.
That was accomplished through the measurement of the glorious wise one.
Therefore, it is necessary for everything to be known in the field of midwifery. Perhaps it will come to something like that: therefore, place it against what is needed with the former one.
The extraction of the dead fetus.
When you are treating a dead fetus with what I have said about division from the medicine, and it does not come out, and you are forced to use an operation with your hands, then you should consider this.
If therefore the woman is of sound virtue, and she is not mixed with any from the accidents by which there fears loss upon her: then it must be that the woman is laid on a bed, on her back, and her head is leaned downwards, and her legs are raised: and the attendant should hold her from two sides or bind her to the bed so that her body does not be pulled out when extracting the fetus.
Then moisten the maternal mouth with oily liquids along with mucus of high alder and fenugreek, and linseed seeds. Then, the midwife should lubricate her hand with these oils and mucus substances: then, she should introduce herself into the womb with ease.
Then she should search for the place where the hooks of the fetus are located, and find a suitable location for this purpose.
Therefore, consider this then, if the fetus is prepared to descend over its head: then fix the hooks into its eyes, or around its neck, or into its mouth, or onto the palate itself, or under its chin, or in the throat, or near the ribs, and under the pubis.
If the descent is over its feet, then into the metatarsal region and mid-back of it.
And it must be that she holds the hook with her right hand: and she will curve its position into what is between the left hand's fingers: and she should introduce herself with ease using this hand, and fix the hook in one of the locations we mentioned until she reaches the empty space.
Then extend it with equal length, and do not make the extension according to straightness only; rather move it in all directions so that the flow is relieved: as happens when teeth are extracted during their removal.
And it must be softening of the extension that lies between them.
If a portion is retained from it, then the midwife must anoint certain fingers with oil and introduce them in that part, so as to rotate along with them what is being retained.
So if the part of the fetus comes out, then swap the hooks to a higher place: do this until the whole fetus has come out.
So if the hand comes out before the rest and it's not possible to reduce it due to its constriction: then a cloth should be rotated over it.
Then extract it until when it comes out completely, cut it either at the heel joint or at the elbow: and thus you should do this in the other hand, and in both feet.
If the fetus's head is large, or if it experiences constriction during birth, or if there is water collected in its head: then one should insert between their fingers a prickly sponge and find its way with it to remove the head, and extract the water. Or break it with the tool called Almisdac: which has the same shape as the other tools mentioned in the chapter that follows.
Similarly, if the fetus has the nature of a large head, then you should take out the algengematu: or extract it with the misdach as we said.
Then grasp the bones with forceps.
If the head escapes and is constrained at the gullet, then it should be pulled until moisture begins to flow from the chest.
But if it is not complicated and does not yield to an exit: then cut the head off promptly, according to what is possible for you.
If it is below the belly and there is distension or water retention: then you must puncture it until moisture begins to flow from it.
But if the fetus is above its own feet, then pulling it becomes easy, and its direction towards the birth canal is gentle.
But if it is constrained at the belly or chest: then you must extract it with the cloth that you had wrapped around your hand: and pull the belly or chest until what is inside them begins to flow.
But if the rest of the limbs are removed and the head returns, then the midwife should insert her left hand. But if the opening of the birth canal is open, then she should insert her hand to a depth inside the womb and find it with that which is grasping the head, and pull it with her fingers up to the opening of the womb: then she should insert one hook or two hooks into it and pull it out with them.
But if the opening of the womb is constrained because of a hot distension that occurs to it: then one should not exert effort on it, rather it is necessary to administer the flow of wet substances, abundant ones: and apply ointments: and sit in waters which soften and moisten.
But if the fetus is above its own side, then it can be equalized: then administer what we said about a living fetus.
If it is not possible to do that, then proceed immediately with incision, and extract.
And you must ensure that nothing is left of the scab inside entirely.
So when you have completed your operation, then administer what we have said about hot discharges which occur during pregnancies.
If blood discharge occurs, then submerge it in止血 waters, and administer the remaining treatment.
And indeed, I have seen a woman whose womb contained a dead fetus; subsequently she became pregnant with another, and then even a second fetus died.
Thus, after a long time, she developed an abscess at her navel which swelled up until it opened, and then began to discharge pus.
I was therefore summoned to treat her, and I treated her for a long period of time; yet the wound did not heal.
So I placed over it some strong poultices for suction, and an opening emerged from the site.
Then several days passed, and another opening emerged from her.
I was therefore amazed at this, for there is no hole in the womb.
I wondered, because they were from the bones of dead fetuses.
I examined the wound, and extracted many bones from it while she was in better positions during labor: and had survived for such a long time, and now discharges only a small amount of pus.
And I did not include this extraordinary fact here, except because it contains knowledge, and serves as assistance for what the skilled surgeon doctor does with his hands during treatment.
On the forms of necessary instruments for the extraction of a fetus.
Chapter 77.
Below is the form of the Cephalus (a tool used for childbirth assistance), with which the bars are adjusted, having two spiral windings on both ends of two rods.
However, this Vortex (another tool used in childbirth) must be finer than the Cephalus: and for it to become such, either use ebony or wood from a wild olive tree.
And let the width of all the wood be like two fingers: and the rim of each is like one finger, and the length of each is a palm and half: and in the middle of the two rods are two additions of the same kind of wood, which have already been firmly attached on both sides; whose length is half a palm plus a little bit more: and the width of each is like two fingers, or slightly more.
And these two additions are inserted into the maternal opening, so that it opens when you turn both Vortices.
The form of the Vortex which opens the womb.
Another form similar to that one, but finer and lighter.
Let it be made of ebony wood or wild olive wood, according to the shape of pincers.
But nevertheless, at its end there should be two additions as you see above: and the length of all these additions is about a palm; and the width of both is like two fingers.
So when you want to open the womb with it, then have her sit on the bed with her legs hanging down, with what is between her thighs being open.
Then insert these two combined additions into the womb: and you are holding the lower end of the tool between her hips.
Then open your hand with the tool, as you do with scissors, evenly according to the amount of force from the opening of the uterine canal until the midwife does what she wants.
The form of vertigo, as the ancients described it, is the form that pushes, by which the fetus is pushed.
The form of Almisdac by which the small head is pressed. The form of someone holding one spine.
The form of someone holding two spines.
The form of the forceps which have teeth like saws, with which the head of the fetus is pressed.
The form of Spatumilis having two ends for removing the head.
The form of two Spatumilium, even those that are cumbersome.
All these instruments are used, and the more varieties of them exist, and those prepared by the craftsman, they either perform their tasks more quickly or appear more esteemed among people due to their quantity.
Therefore, do not overlook any of these instruments that have been prepared for you.
The need for them is undeniable.
Section on the Extraction of the Second Stage.
Head 78.
When retention of the Secondina occurs during labor, then it is necessary to quickly instruct the weak one so she retains her breathing.
Then make her sneeze while you're touching her: and place your hand over her mouth and nose.
If she then comes out through this, it is good.
If not: then take a pot and puncture in the cover an opening: and put inside it opening herbs of the mother's mouth, like a reed, rue, and nettle, and chamomile, and dittany, and cinnamon wood, and centaurium: take all these herbs, or some of them, and immerse them with water, and place them over fire.
Then place a bundle of rushes over the opening of the pot, and the other end in the mother's mouth: and let her hold it until the vapor reaches the cavity of the womb.
Then make her sneeze, as we have said.
Indeed, the Secondina will come out easily with facilitation.
If however it remains after this treatment and does not come out: then instruct the midwife to immerse her hand in safflower oil, or in elderberry juice. Then she should insert it into the uterus and seek for the Secondina with it.
When she then finds it, take it and extend it gradually.
If however it is attached deep within the womb, then insert her hand as we have described, until she finds the Secondina, and extract it gradually according to its direction, so as not to fall the womb due to intense suction. Indeed, it must be alternated with facilitation towards the right and left sides: then add in the amount of suction.
For then she obeys, and is served, and freed from adhering.
If the mouth of the womb is constricted, as we have already told you: care for it with a sneeze, and from the decoction of the pot along with herbs.
But if it does not come out as we have described, then beware that you do not tire yourself with repetition of the removal process.
However, it is necessary that what comes out from inside to the mouth of the womb, be tied to the woman's hip bone.
Then treat her with a tetrapharmaceutical ointment enema.
Indeed, it will cause her to decompose after a day, and dissolve, and come out.
However, when it decomposes, an unpleasant smell rises to the stomach and head, and this harms her.
Therefore, proper fumigations should be administered to counteract that.
Some of the old experts already knew how to perform fumigation with watercress and dried figs.
The shape of the device used for fumigating a woman during retention of Sanguineae and menses is as follows.
Make it like a small trumpet or from wood; and place the broad end over the fire: and let the fumigation be placed above the prunes: hold it until that fumigation is consumed: and repeat another one.
For the treatment of uninjured Ass (or an animal denoted as 'Ani' in this context).
Title 79.
Many children are born, and their asses (a term used metaphorically here referring to certain medical conditions of the newborn) are not injured, which have already been treated subtly by a needle.
Therefore, it is necessary that the midwife pierce this sack with her finger: and if not, she will pierce it together with a sharp awl. And let her beware of the cleft, so as not to touch it.
Then place wool that has been soaked in wine and oil on top of it.
Then attend to it with the application of ointment until it is healed.
If you fear that it will rupture, then place a long lead pipe in the hole for many days. And when the child wants to defecate, remove it.
And now, Ani's suppuration also occurs from the healing of wounds or by emollients.
Therefore, it must be cut that consolidation, then take care of it with what we said about treatment and lead. Section on the treatment of fistulas that occur in the lower part.
Title 80.
Fistulas that occur in the lower region are: Nodule, and Grossness happening near the anus of the defecation organ: or in a space of one part: and there is one fistula, or multiple.
When therefore that nodule shrivels up, it is opened, and moisture or thin pus runs out from it.
And sometimes these fistulas have penetrating ones.
And there are fistulas when they are in the space penetrating up to the bladder and up to the bowel.
And there are penetrating fistulas that go up to the joint of the thigh and even up to the tail's node.
From this point, how to recognize that a fistula penetrates up to the anus, even from one that doesn't penetrate, is as follows: insert your index finger into the anus. And introduce a delicate probe through air or iron into the fistula; when there's no curvature.
If there is curvature within it, then insert a delicate probe made of lead or a needle from the mane hairs until you feel the probe, or the needle inside your finger.
If you do not feel it completely, and nothing comes out of the hole from digestion, nor any wind or worm as I said: then you will know that it is not penetrating. Therefore, proceed with treatment.
And when the fistula is penetrating up to a blister or the bladder of urine, then its indication is that urine exits from there and obstruction of it should be stopped so that the place may heal with medicines.
If however it is penetrating up to the joint of the thigh or the mouth of the thigh, then its indication is that a probe will reach there if there's no curvature until the mouth and any pain can be felt around the part, and pus always comes out from there, and no medicine nor ointment can heal it.
And in all such penetrating fistulas there is no complete cure: and the treatment of them is labor and futility, to those foolish physicians, who are formed upon this. In this case however which is not penetrating and not old, there is a hope for healing with serro: according to what I am telling you, and I have already proven it. And it happens that the sick person lies on his back between your hands, and lifts his legs up to above his hips, and his thighs are bent towards his abdomen.
Then insert a lead or air pipe, if there is tortuosity in the fistula, until you know where the trial has gone.
If the patient feels it around the anus, then you should insert your index finger into the anus.
If therefore you feel that the tent has already been penetrated through itself which was detected, beyond what you feel between your finger and it, or flesh: then indeed you will know for certain, because it is penetrating. Do not labor in her, as we said, since there is no healing for it.
They however say that flesh and in those who are healed by medication which is expected to bring benefit, is to use a fine cautery according to the width of the fistula as previously described, and insert the burning instrument into the fistula until it reaches around the anus.
Then repeat this process two or three times until you know that all the added flesh, which is like bird feathers, has been sufficiently heated.
Then care for this with the wrapped licorice in butter until these heated flesh pieces come out: then care for this with ointments that generate flesh and strengthen it.
If therefore it is healed, it is good.
And if not, then it will never be cured with any other treatment.
And if the tent emerges and does not reach your finger which is in the anus, and there is a thick skin or flesh between it and the tent, or if you see a layer of flesh: then cut the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and when you cut along with the tent within the fistula until the cut reaches where the tent's tip has reached, then remove the tent and it falls.
Then cleanse those flesh tissues that resemble bird feathers, so that nothing remains from them.
If the blood prevails and separates between you and your operation, then remove those flesh tissues. Then it is better and swifter to cauterize that with fire, or with sharp medicine.
For the combination of cauterization with fire brings good effects, adding the searing of those flesh tissues, and the removal of blood, and drying out moisture.
Then take care of that with the enclosed lint in butter or ground waxes until the spot releases pus and those seared tissues come out in pus.
Then take care of the wound with gels that consolidate, promoting hard flesh. There are medicines which have coagulation and drying properties.
For when they heal, then it is truly healed: and you do not experience repetition. If however the fistula has already reached to the depth of the anus and stretches due to excess of body matter: then insert your finger into the anus, and probe with it.
If indeed you feel it penetrates, and there is a covering between you, and that object, whether skin or flesh, and it's close to penetration: then there is no operation within that space, unless according to the path of faith and hope.
This is because it receives one of the three methods: or you cauterize it, as we said; or you remove it until you find its concavity, so that it's possible for you to insert lint and achieve healing from nearness.
And do not proceed too much with the cut, so as to not enter into a channel containing the anus, and happen upon an unintended outcome of weakness in excretion without desire. Then proceed with that which we have said. Perhaps it will be healed: or you may lengthen the skin itself, and cleanse it after cutting it up to almost the anus, as we have said, or when tried, or with an instrument of another sharp end.
Then cleanse those dissected flesh parts which are found in the section as far as you can with examination.
Then try the restoration of all wounds with the entire section and at the top opening where it consolidates: and there will remain an open fistula within the anal part, and it will be easier on the sick person.
And sometimes the fistula is sewn according to this method: and it is when you insert the test in the fistula; and it is on the side of the anus around the body surface with skin and edge of the anus: then take the test perforated at its end, which is like a needle aleskef, that is, prepared strips, according to this shape.
And insert the yarn wound from five threads into it, and about that area.
Then insert the test with thread into the fistula until you reach its concavity.
If therefore it penetrates into the edge of the anus internally nearby, then withdraw the thread from that hole: so as to insert your finger in the anus and take out the end of the thread, and bring together both ends at once: and tie both tightly, and let them go on one or two days: and the more thread goes into the flesh, tie it well until those parts are between the two ends of the thread and fall down: then care for the wound until it consolidates and heals.
For indeed, it is not for you to do that for a lizard's sake, so as not to hit it.
And then proceed with her as we said until she is healed.
The shape of the needle-like spur through which a fistula flows, whose remedy is very acute on one part and the other part is not so, so as not to hit that which is not necessary, just as you see.
Section on Suturing Hemorrhoids from which blood flows out of the cut in them: and treatment of fissures.
Title 81.
There are two ways of having hemorrhoids.
Or indeed they exist within the anus, resembling blisters or pieces of coal, or like pebbles: or as if they were grains of sand.
And from these there are pairs and large ones: and blood flows out of them always, and it is one, and they are many.
And they exist outside the anus, and at its extremities.
However, those that are outside the anus are mostly of little moisture, from which a yellowish water or a slight continuous flow of blood comes out: and they are according to the color of the body.
And the treatment for those inside the anus is to advise the sick person to sit in water: and squeeze until you see your own stool coming out, and the wounds will appear to you.
Therefore, hang them with hooks therefore: or hold them with your finger.
Then cut them at their roots.
If however they are not held by them in them due to their moisture and softness themselves: then catch them with a coarse cloth or with the end of a double thread, and extract them with your fingers.
Then cut them, and after making certain cuts dust them with some warm powders so that they will stay in the place of the cauterization.
Or cauterize them according to what precedes in the chapter on cauterization.
Then care for them with the rest of the treatment until they recover.
And if the anus does not yield to expulsion, then treat the patient with a small-pored enema, such that it will carry away what is inside the anus and allow for quick expulsion when the patient starts expelling.
And if the athletes (referring to tumors or growths) are extrinsic to the anus, then their condition is easy and mild: it is possible for you to catch them with your finger, or with a hook, and cut them.
Then care for them as we have said until they recover.
And if someone is repulsed by the operation of cutting with iron, then you should treat them using their stitching method in this manner.
Take the thread that has been wound up, and insert it into the point.
Then pull the athlete outwards to a higher position, and make it penetrate with its tip at the base of the root from another part. And wind the two ends of the thread on the lower part of the needle, making them cross each other in a transverse manner: and tightly tie the athlete by this constriction.
Then make knots in the thread and pull out the point.
Do this with all the athletes and let out one from them: do not leave him as he is, in order to prevent excess bleeding.
Then place a piece of cloth soaked in rose oil or camphor over the anus, and put it over the anus. And instruct the patient to rest.
Then let him down until he falls.
And when the athletes fall, take care of them with ointments, and all other treatments, until they recover.
¶ On the Care of Fissures.
For it often happens due to the drying out of feces and the constriction of nature.
And when they are dried up, and no medicine is beneficial to them: then it is necessary to use blades with holes or your own nail until they become moist and the outer layer that prevents their consolidation is removed.
Then take care of them until they consolidate according to what is needed.
And if they do not consolidate: then treat them repeatedly with a more intense reason than the first, until they bleed much and are scraped off, then take care of them until they heal.
¶ On the Care of Almimir's inverted operations, and not inverted ones: and Athelil's dry operations, and Ants.
Then care for that: and if it is necessary to cauterize that according to what has preceded in its chapter.
From Athelil's dry ones, one is a small elevated spot, rough, filtered, round above the surface of the body.
And often happenings occur in children's hands.
And the treatment for this is to spread the thistle and cut it; or tie it with silk thread; or with hair, until it falls.
And if it's a thistle (Athelil), cauterize it according to what has been prescribed with fire or with an acute medicine; and now inverted thistles are eradicated both with the tool that I say, whether turned over or not. And the ant is also a small prominent entity that is filtered out, large in size, spread over the surface of the body, penetrating deeply. And when it finds coldness, it is felt like an ant bite within, throughout the body: and much of it occurs in hands.
The treatment for this is to take a tube from a goose feather or a strong turkey feather and place that tube over the ant until it contains a circle of parts of its body within the tube.
Then rotate your hand with the tube until you remove what is within the circle around the ant. Then place it deeply into the flesh and eradicate the ant from its root. And if need be, do this with an air or iron tube according to this shape.
Place the tube of the cannula upwards to its narrowest part, so that it rolls back over the finger and its own reversal.
And if you wish, cauterize the ant according to what has been prescribed for cauterizing thistles in the chapter on cautery.
Chapter: On the forms of instruments used for enemas in digestive ailments, and relief of the stomach, and colic.
Chapter 83.
When enema is made from silver, or from alloyed gold, or from blown or hammered air.
And at other times it is made from these tools in small and large amounts, according to those in which they are administered.
So that which is administered for the treatment of children with low weight, be it small: and whose anus are weak or painful, similarly, enemas of them.
Large enema.
Small enema.
The tip of it, that is, the upper part where the womb is tied, should be wide according to this manner: and there must be a distinction so that the womb can be tied as you see fit. And the lower end which enters the anus, should be closed, meaning not open, soft, very much, pulling towards thinness: and on one side of it are two holes, and on the other side another hole.
And let the size of the hole be according to the thickness of the tubes, slightly thicker and less, and let there be a womb in which medicines are placed from an animal's bladder: or from the page of the stomach, which should have the shape of one half of a pear: whose root is a single palm.
And when the womb is placed inside it, tighten it at the head of the enema with a strong constriction between two distinguishing contractions.
Then perform an enema with it.
And this is the form of a circle as depicted here, and of its holes. The quality of the enema to be used in this case is as follows: fill the basin or the bag with medicine, which should be heated according to the tolerance level of the patient. And beware not to make it excessively hot or excessively cold.
Then the patient is rolled onto his back, and his legs are raised to the upper side. And place under him an indenter, that is, skin where people lie down or a piece of cloth.
Then immerse the end of the enema with oil, or with tallow, or with mucus of fenugreek, or similar substances.
Next, insert it into the anus with ease.
Then have the attendant grasp the basin with both hands simultaneously, and express it until he evacuates all that is inside the enema in the intestine. Then remove the enema, and raise the patient's legs to the wall. If the medicine compels him towards evacuation, then hold as much as he can.
And if he sleeps with it for the whole night, it is more beneficial at the end of treatment.
If the enema is administered while he is suffering from stomach discomforts and it speeds up his evacuation: then administer multiple enemas until he is healed.
If there are hemorrhoids or injuries in the anus, then administer a subtle and gentle enema, using those enemas that are used for children.
And this is the form of the subtle enema over which tight skin is applied.
For the treatment of head wounds without bone fracture.
Head 84.
I have spoken about the division of wound care in the book and said what was appropriate there. And I will say here how to care for them with hands and medicines according to completion.
I therefore say that wounds are distinguished according to how they are formed and also according to the place upon which a wound falls.
So the causes of wounds are many, such as being struck by a stone: or cut with a sword, knife, or scalpel; or hit through with a spear, wood, or arrow, and so on from various things.
Wounds that occur according to the location of the body are such as a wound that falls on the head, or neck, or chest, or abdomen, and so on from those parts.
And I will be detailing the treatments for certain wounds, in order to establish this reasoning and guideline for the rest of the wounds.
And I will begin with simple head wounds: since the recall of their compositions comes at the beginning of the third chapter.
I therefore say.
When a simple wound occurs in the head and there is no fracture of the bone, then consider whether it was caused by being struck with a stone or something similar, and only the skin has been broken: this will result in a large wound and you should be wary of potentially serious outcomes using hot leeches. Then apply your attention, perform cephalic bloodletting immediately: and do not delay this step; extract from him according to the quantity of its effectiveness into the blood: if there is nothing preventing bleeding treatments, especially if only little blood is flowing out from the wound.
And let the bloodletting be performed opposite the wounded area.
And let the sick person beware of overfilling themselves, and of wine, and of large meals.
And if something prohibits reduction, then reduce from food, and do not approach meats, nor wines.
And if an abscess happens to him and there is pus, then place a hot poultice on it, made with an infusion in oil of roses or rose water, or with wine that has medicinal properties.
And if you are sure about the hot pus and it is recent with his own blood and has not changed into air, then apply the powder I will tell you after a little while: and if it has already changed into air, then apply some ointments until it heals.
And if the wound is large, or comes from a cut made by scissors or similar tools: and if his lips do not come together with poultices, then join them with stitches, according to what I will tell you about stitching wounds of the abdomen.
And if the wound has already been detected by bone and hangs down, and there is no retention of it, except in a small suspension: then cut it.
Next, treat the wound with medicines, and restore the tough flesh to its place of skin, and instruct the sick person to eat foods that are rich in fat, such as heads and cooked grain, until they feel sated, and similar foods.
If you find decomposition in the skin and it doesn't adhere to the bone, then cut out the decomposed part completely and remove it. Then treat that area.
And if there is an artery or vein in these wounds from which blood flows: and if it cannot be cut through medicines, then inquire about the artery.
If you find it not joined, then cut it with the lancet, or bind it.
If need prompts when what we said does not hold up, then cauterize it until blood is released.
The method of the poultice for flesh.
Recipe: take one part of olibanum, two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of ashes that have not been fully extinguished. Grind all together in much water and then sift it. Fill the wound with this mixture and apply a good bandage until it adheres well to the flesh and coagulates with the blood.
Then bind him from above with powders and release him, without breaking him as long as he remains, so that he does not loosen.
For the medicine will not be removed from him until he is healed.
Then care for the remaining treatment, until they are healed.
¶ On Wounds of the Neck.
Title 85: The Head
If indeed a wound occurs in the neck, then there is no difference in treatment between it and a head wound when it is simple.
If however the neck nerve or artery has already been incised: then if it is a nerve, there is no faculty in it, unless treatment of it is made with what makes strong compression, such as zinnias, and zygomatics, and similar ones.
Because they harm nerves and cause their contraction.
And do not place anything entirely cold on the wound: for the substance of nerves is cold and its continuation is with the brain, which is higher than the limbs: and let that be used in its treatment from gentle medicines, such as lotus root soaked occasionally in sweet water or oil, or mixed with rose oil, and turmeric, when even it is washed with sweet water: and other mineral stones, according to this manner, and moist ointments.
If the wound is large, then apply stitches: or compress its edges with powders.
Then care for it until it is healed.
If the depth of the wound is great, or if it happens to be in a sinus in its lower part where pus has already accumulated, then puncture it at a more depressed place in it.
If an artery has already been cut in the wound and there is a flow of its blood, then separate it, or dry it out, and tie that part. Or if necessity demands it, cauterize it.
If it has already reached the throat, or the entire windpipe, and it is salvaged: then gather skin flaps together with suture over the larynx canal, and do not touch the windpipe, indeed make it level (with the surrounding tissue), and place it back to its natural shape.
Then suture it with an appropriate tension, and let it rest for a few days.
Then care for it with ointments that have healing and drying properties until it is healed.
If the wound has already made an impression in bone, then probe it. Then, if there are fragments of bone within it, extract all of them or what you can from them; and leave that which cannot be prepared until the wound putrefies and its exit is separated and cleaned.
If the wound is fresh, then dust it with the powder I have described.
If it seems that there is an opening in the wound, and a fistula forms, then care for this as described in its respective chapter.
Title 86.
If then there is breath coming out of the wound when a sick person inhales from it, you will know that the wound is fatal.
But if there is no depth to it and it is fresh with its own blood: then do not put the powder in immediately at first hour, nor bind it, lest blood be retained within the depths of it and returns to the heart, and kills the sick person. Instead apply a drawing ointment into it and let him be relieved twice a day.
If the desired ointment is not available to you, then place a used cloth in the wound's opening, so that it will absorb what comes out of him from the moisture: and have done such that the sick person sleeps over the wound, so that what collects within it may heal.
If three days have passed or more since the wound and no illness, no bad heart tremor, and no constriction during breathing occur, and you see all other its conditions are good, then you know that the wound is healing.
Therefore, take care of it yourself and follow with medications, and all other treatments, until it heals.
If the wound's healing is delayed and constantly opens, then you will know that a fistula has already been formed.
Therefore, take care of it according to its chapter.
And if the wound is from a scalpincision, or of a knife, and it is simple on the surface of the chest or back: then take care of it with whatever preceded it in stitches, if it is large; or with powder, if it is small.
And if it has already made an impression in the bone and is coming out from there fragments: then examine the wound, and proceed to remove those fragments if they are separate.
If the fragments are not separated, then leave them until the wound decays, because their extraction is often harmful.
As for other accidents of wounds on the remaining limbs, judgment in treatment is as we have said about his judgment.
¶ On Wounds of the Abdomen, and the Egress of Intestines, and their Discharge.
Chapter 87.
The disruption that happens in the stomach is great, medium, and small.
Therefore, from the great ones, sometimes the intestines come out, or the number of intestines.
Thus, there is an intrusion and stitching of them, and their stitches are more severe and harder.
And even small disruption also happens to be difficult due to another method.
Therefore, it follows that their reduction becomes more difficult if you do not promptly reintroduce them to their place: because they inflate, open, and thicken; which is why their introduction becomes difficult.
Therefore, this leads to a better disruption of the medium type: because when this does not occur, there is an easier reduction of the intestine, unlike the more difficult situation in the other two types.
Know that sewing of veins follows four methods.
Two common stitches are applicable to the surgical closure of the abdomen and other body wounds; and two other specific stitches are meant for closure of other types of injuries.
However, they are more specifically suited for the surgical closure of the abdomen, and I will tell you each one with its description. Therefore, I say that when the wound is small and something of the intestine comes out from it, making its return difficult: then this corresponds to one of the two methods.
Or due to the severity of the surgery as we said, or because of inflation in the intestine due to cold air.
When that is the case, then you should warm it up so much that you immerse a sponge or damp cloth in warm water.
Or boil it in water with ginger, rue, and the root of garlic, and warm it up with that inside the intestine until the inflammation resolves.
At times he does this with one thing where there is a ligature: and it is better than water alone in the dissipation of inflammation.
So when you see that the inflammation has already dissipated, then moisten the intestines with water that has been boiled with dock or flax.
For through this, its entry is alleviated when something small is present.
If however there remains no return of its discharge after this treatment, then use a little in the dissection, using the tool with which the hemorrhoids are cut.
And the first treatment is better when prepared than cutting: and there is no forced action to cut after necessity and deficiency of the tool.
Let there be a part of it that is twisted, sharp, and another part of it not sharp, and the end should not be as thin as Spatumilis, rather it should be more obtuse somewhat: and this one that resembles a nail, as you see.
So when the ulcer expands and enters the intestine, then it must have a reduction according to its natural form at its own place if possible over that: for it is better.
But when the dissection is broad at the lower part of the belly: then it must have you make the patient lie on its back and place its legs higher than its head.
And if it is in the upper part of the belly, then place its head and the side of its body higher than its lower parts.
And similarly if the dissection is within one of the two parts of the belly, then place your intent and consideration always in this way, that part where the ulcer is be higher than the other part.
And thus it should be that you apply this to large wounds and medium-sized wounds.
In wounds that are clean, apply according to what you have prepared for yourself.
Then let there be a devout and trustworthy attendant between your hands, who holds the entire rupture with his hand: and unite his lips.
Then take from that, for the one following during suturing, something after something: and this is the common method of suturing for one.
And it is that you take the needle, or according to the number of needles according to the size of the wounds.
Then remove from the edge of the rupture the width of a finger, that is, the measure for doctors: and place one needle over the thread you are going to introduce into it in both ends of the skin, with two ends of the suture under the skin from inside, until you make it penetrate from another part. And now you have joined the two ends of the skin, and two ends of the suture: and there are four orders.
Then tie with double thread around the tip of the needle several times from both sides at once, until the two edges of the wound have been joined in an appropriate manner.
Then remove the thickness of a finger as well, and fasten another needle in them: then baste it with thread like you did with the first needle.
Therefore, do not stop doing that with each one from the needles until you complete the suturing of all the wounds.
And let the needle be medium between thickness and fineness: for fine needles very quickly puncture the flesh: and thick ones are difficult to introduce into the skin: it is necessary therefore that they should be of medium fineness and thickness.
And it is not necessary for the needle to be placed very close in both ends of neighboring skin parts: so as not to pierce the flesh too quickly and open the wound before its healing, and also not to stretch them even during suturing, so that the wound may not be prevented from healing.
Then cut off the ends of the knives so they do not hurt the patient during sleep. And place small pieces of cloth from all sides on them which hold the ends of the knives, and release them until you know that the wound has already healed.
And indeed, this kind of suture with needles is more suitable for small wounds.
Because in their suturing, one or two needles suffice, or roughly that many.
The second method of suturing is common, where you join together at four points: the ends of the skin, and two ends are sutured against each other with one needle, on which there is a thread wrapped when it was rolled out, equal in thickness and size.
Then when you have passed the four ends with the needle from where you started, pull the needle back to that part, so that the thread pulled from the upper part of the wound falls: it should be like a sewing stitch as when clothes are sewn together, and place throughout every suture a quantity of thickness equal to that of a smaller finger.
This kind of stitching is known by people.
And with this stitch, I treated the wound that happened to a man, which had been cut by a knife and there was a larger tear than one hand's width: and two hand's lengths came out from his intestines from the middle intestine, and it was a tear in the center of his abdomen.
So I returned that after twenty-four hours when his intestine was outside the wound.
The wound therefore healed over the space of about fifteen days: and I cared for him and he recovered: and after that he lived many years, changed in his ways.
And the doctors judged that it would not be healed.
And it was a miracle that I did not treat that with the ointment.
Because I was in a place where no ointment could be found, and I had nothing else from remedies.
So I put it on the wound with an old butter twice a day, and did thorough washing with honey water until it healed.
I will now describe two kinds of suture methods according to the language used.
And it is like this when you start with a sharp suture: and you insert the tip from the outside towards the inside.
So when the needle has penetrated into the skin and gone through the wound according to the length and width of the whole body: cut off the end of it, place it on the side where you inserted the needle, and make it penetrate from the inner part at one end to the outer part at the other end.
So when you have made it penetrate like this at the same end, then make it penetrate according to this from that side towards the inside: and cut off the other end which is on this side, and make it penetrate into the other end from the inside at the outer part: and make it penetrate with the penetration that you are making it penetrate at that end, which is in its part, until it penetrates all of it.
Then start again from this same side, and pull out the needle from the skin which it has penetrated.
Then guide her back into that skin, and pull out the other end which is on the other side from this end at the wound: and pull it out of the skin which comes from its part, and do it in reverse order with one thing first, then another: and do it like this in succession until you have pulled out all of them according to that example.
The essence of this sewing technique is to utilize the skin sheets as stitches which are akin to the skin sheets themselves. So arrange such that you fold one edge of the sheet opposite another edge from a single layer of skin and proceed in a manner where you alternate lifting each end from one side then the other, until completion.
The second type of proper suture method, as mentioned by Gale努s.
This method of speaking describes how to handle the technique according to its likeness, like certain doctors do. It involves assembling all parts in harmony with their natural fit and applying one end of it against another part's end and then applying from the other side against that same part.
And this is done according to what I am telling you.
You must place the needle at a point near your own end from the outer part and make it penetrate into the inner side only there. Then release both ends of it.
Then turn the needle and make it penetrate from the outer part into the inner side at both ends, that is, on each side.
Then turn both needles, and make each of them penetrate from the inner side to the outer one up until the opposite lateral sides, which are on the other side.
And this method of sewing is a better common suture and it is the suture that precedes the recall.
This, therefore, is the discourse of Galen as well.
And some people said.
The abdominal suture is corrected with two needles.
What you do is introduce one thread into each of them: and start when inserting the needle from what is with you, and make it penetrate up to the other side, according to their suture which are like leather.
And know that when the rupture is in the middle of the belly: then the suturing of it is more difficult than the rest of the belly areas.
The judgment of treatment for wounds is the judgment of the other wounds.
This is because when you apply a fresh wound with its own blood before it dries and you return the intestine to its place and everything else properly, then place it on top of the powdered flesh.
And if the air has already changed the wound: then put some ointments over it which are available to you until pus forms and the threads fall out and heal and improve.
Then care for it as you would for other wounds until it is healed.
And if no medicines are available to you, then immediately place on it a poultice until pus begins to come out, using an old one and change it twice a day as I taught you, until it is healed.
And if you fear that the wound communicates with the main limbs in injury, then it must be dipped in wool that has been tempered to a moderate heat or in rose oil and place it around the areas between the thighs and under the armpits.
And if it feels pain, or perforations, or putrefaction in its intestines (which happens frequently), then irrigate it with a wine that is stoptic, black and warm: especially if the putrefaction has already reached inside the intestine and made an incision penetrating to the cavity of it.
And know that which comes from the larger intestine is easier to heal, and what comes from it that is finer has a more difficult healing process.
However, as regards that part of the intestine which is called the jejunum, it does not receive healing from wounds that happen within it at all: and this is due to its multitude being veins, and the size of them, and because of its thinness, and proximity of itself to nerve nature.
However, if that which proceeds from the wound is hair, and you recognize it as fresh: apply the treatment in accordance with your method of treatment, by which you reduce the intestines equally.
But if the time has passed for it and it has already become green or black: then you must bind it with a thread at the place that was discolored by it, in order that no blood flow occurs.
For hair contains veins and arteries.
Then cut the ligament that follows beyond this one, and place two hanging ends of thread from the lower part of the wound outside it. So that when pulled upwards, it assists in the attraction above you, and extraction at the case of hair, and discharge from the wound.
Recollection of what happens to wounds that occur in the Intestine.
When there is a disruption in the Intestine, and it is small: then it is possible for some individuals to recover. Thus, I saw someone who was wounded in their abdomen with a lance strike, and there was a wound on the right side of the stomach, and it was an old wound: and a fistula was made, and excrement emerged from it along with flatulence.
So I provided treatment until I was satisfied with his recovery and did not cease to refine the treatment until he was healed and the wound site had consolidated.
After I saw the wound site had consolidated, I feared for the sick person, fearing that a bad incident might happen to them in their abdomen: and no bad incidents occurred from that.
And he remained in his better conditions, eating and drinking, defecating, and entered the bathhouse, and exercised himself in his diets.
And some of the experimenters have said that when a wound occurs in the intestine and it is small, then it should be tied according to this manner.
And there is one thing you might find interesting: antlers of great beasts.
Next, gather two lips of the wound and place one ant (formica) each from those that have an open mouth on the two lips of the wound.
And when it grasps them and tightens its mouth, cut off its head, for it adheres and does not come loose.
Then place another ant near the first one, and do not stop doing this with the ant after the ant according to the quantity of the wound.
And then return it (the limb or animal) back and allow its wound to heal.
For the heads remain attached in the intestine until it has been fed and healed within its intestines, and no harm will occur to the sick person entirely. And now it is possible to sew the intestine even with a fine thread: which is removed from the animal's intestine, attached to it after being inserted into the needle.
And you should take this end of the thread from the intestine and remove much flesh.
Then tie the fine, withdrawn linen thread at its end.
And then insert that thread into the needle, and sew it with the intestine.
And then return it to the disruption. And this method of suturing with ants and the intestine is nothing other than according to the path of trust and hope.
You should know that a wound which is large and broad, especially if it's located on one of the slender intestines: then there isn't any skill except for fine sewing, and its cure is not complete.
The Care of Zuchemen and Fistulas.
Head 88.
You should know that any wound, or pustule when it hardens and ages, and becomes a溃疡 (ulcer), and does not heal up solidly, and always emits pus, and cannot be separated: then it is called universally in any part of the body, a Fistula, and we call this particular one Zuchemen.
And indeed, a Fistula is according to truth a filtered formation, hard, white: when there is no pain with it, but it has the shape of a bird's feather. And because of that, some call it Risati, meaning the feather.
And there are times when they become wet and emit pus.
And perhaps the wetness splits at certain times.
And this moisture can be much or little, it can be thick and can also be fine.
And I have already hinted at this division previously, when I said that every wound which does not heal, and is not born within the flesh, is due to only one of nine causes.
Among these causes, one is due to the scarcity of blood in the body: or because of malice towards it: or because there is hard flesh between itself and its opening which impedes birth of tissue: or because of much dirt and disease: or because the ulcer itself is putrid, and what is sent to it is of bad quality: or because the medicine used for its cure is inconvenient: or because corruption falls as a kind of plague in certain areas, as happens in Caesaraugusta where digestion of maladies is difficult and healing of pustules is delayed by nature: or because there is one opening, or multiple bones.
And I have already shown you all these causes and signs of them, and the treatments for them with medicines, in division: it is necessary here that you should know the treatment of Fistula and Zukeen which happens through a way of operation with hand.
Therefore, you should know that Fistula occurs in all parts of the body.
Therefore, there are Fistulas which extend to the great veins and arteries, or nerves, or sinews: or to the intestines, or bladder, or any of them from the ribs: or from one of the back bones, or any compound joints composition: such as hand, and foot: and among these are those that lead to proximity to the main member, and similar ones.
Therefore, among these Fistulas follows this manner: they originate from illnesses that are difficult to treat and do not receive healing. When one tries to attend to them, it is a task of labor and ignorance.
If it is from any of the Fistulas whose depth does not reach the places that I said, and you hope and trust in its treatment, trying to know about it, then take something made of air or iron if the Fistula runs straight, and investigate with it along with yourself.
If there is a twistiness in the Fistula, then investigate it with a fine lead tool.
Since lead, due to its own body's softness, is softened and bent around the twistiness.
If the Fistula has many openings, it is not possible for you to describe it with the tool.
Therefore, cleanse from them by using a catheter through their openings.
For the moisture with which you cleanse it, directs itself towards other openings and flows out of them.
Then carefully inquire according to the way it is possible for you: so that you may know whether there is a mouth or a nerve there, and whether it is a long or close fistula; or is there one fistula with many openings that stays over all that area with your greatest effort. When questioning the patient and finding pain upon pressing your hand on the spot, and through similar symptoms and causes of accidents, you should assess it.
And when you stand on that true position, then go to the treatment according to confidence: and it is for you to consider at this point whether there appears a close fistula, or in a location save far from the connection, or near to a nerve, an artery, a vein, or one of those places which I told you about. Then cut off the fistula according to what was instructed from my description, and remove what is within it by filtration, and decomposed tissues that are born inside its mouth from flesh, or pus, and similar things: and take care of it until it heals.
And if the fistula is deep and according to the direction: then it must be cut out as deeply as possible for you.
Then cleanse that from all its decomposed flesh.
Next administer licorice that has been wrapped up in medicines for acute conditions: and insert it until you reach the concavity of the fistula that you comprehended with iron. Do this repeatedly with it, until the whole remaining in the concavity of the fistula from decomposition is corroded by the acute medicine.
Then restore that with ointments which generate healthy flesh, until it is healed.
And if it does not heal through this, then cauterize it as we have instructed.
And if the cause of the fistula is a mouth and it has been confirmed to you as such: then inquire about it and cut it according to what I have instructed you: if nothing prevents you from something in vein, or nerve, or main member, as we said.
If therefore you find an opening (in the wound), and there is some corruption, and blackness: then shave it until all of its corruption is removed.
Then take care of it together with that which grows back, until it heals.
And if it does not heal and continues to discharge pus as before: then you will know that you have not fully eradicated the corruption.
Therefore, shave over that second time, and carefully consider its condition, and the cleanliness of it with your final strength.
Then restore it.
If therefore it heals, that is good; and if not, then you will know that that corruption is deep within the body, which you have not reached.
Therefore, you do not have the skill in such matters, except for to remove what nature provides.
And if the infected mouth is small and it's possible for you, draw it with fine hooks that are suitable for this.
And if there are many bones, then carefully make the removal of all of them, and do not remove anything from them with your strength.
And if something disagrees with you from the humids, and there is no fear or mistake in the cuts, then cut those humids and flesh if they are there, and free the bones.
And if however you do not have preparation for removing bones at your time, then place on the wound what will rot it: and remove it until whatever has decomposed from around those bones from flesh and humids has decayed.
And watch over the wound so that it does not harden.
And tighten the section you cut during your operation.
Place it on top of it, if you can, the hand immersed in ground-sulfur mixed with oil: or the hand immersed in Egyptian ointment, or some green of ointments.
For when these moist substances decay and separate from them the bones, it facilitates their removal and the attraction of [the health] towards it.
But if there is a large mouth, as in the case of the leg hole or hip hole and similar structures, and what has decayed out of it is a large part; then shave it with logic until that blackness and corruption are removed.
Then heal the wound.
But if what is inside of it has decayed and become a large part, and decay has already reached the bone, then it becomes necessary to cut through it completely until the point where decay arrived. Then take care of it until it heals. And I will tell you about what happens to the leg during surgery: so that you can use this as an example and a guide for your own procedure.
There was a young man around thirty years old who experienced pain in his leg. The cause of this pain originated within him inside the body, that is from the internal parts, until the materials reached the knee and swelling occurred - and there was great swelling. There was no external cause for this.
So the time has been prolonged with their mistakes until the pustule is opened and a great amount of matter comes out.
And after the treatment until the ulcer heals and many openings are made in it; all these were emitting pus and bodily moisture.
He was treated by many doctors for about two years, and there was no wise man in the art of medicine until I was called upon and saw his knee and what flowed out from those large openings - even his whole body had shrunk and his skin was yellow.
Therefore, an attempt is made for an introduction within one of the places of the openings, and the probe has reached the mouth.
Then I thoroughly examined all openings, and found that they reach each other from all parts of the limb. So I proceeded, and followed along one of these openings until I found a part of the bone: and I discovered that it was decayed. It had become corroded, degraded, putrid, and perforated, until it reached the marrow.
So I sharpened what was found to me, and prepared from the decayed bone.
And I placed it, for that was not within the bone except that decay, which I had to scrape and sharpen.
And I have already removed that [decayed part].
Then, I placed the restoration with medicinal consolidating substances over the wounds for an extended period of time.
And it has not been consolidated.
Then, I attempted to restore it.
And it has not been restored.
Then I restored it with medicines, and it was quickly consolidated and healed. This repetition of the procedure during his operation and sectioning was not necessary, except due to the debilitation of the sick person, and their limited tolerance, and my fear for him regarding death: because he experienced sickness from over-inducement of evacuation at all times due to excess.
The treatment has resulted in a complete healing: and the thing that is born is flesh tough at the site of the bone, and good arrangement was made in its body, and returned his strength to him: and he was turned back into his positions: and it did not cause him any harm or injury during walking.
If indeed the projecting bone in the body is already broken: then it must be done as this method: and thus: take the ligament, and bind it at the end of the projecting bone: and command someone to extend it upwards: and place another thicker thread of wool for a second ligament. Then bind it over the flesh which is at this bone: and extend its end so that you can take flesh downwards: and you lay flesh over the place where you want to saw, making sure not to cut the flesh with the saw.
Place a piece of wood or a plank under the bone below: because when you do this, it does not prevent that rotten flesh will be cut.
And it must be that the saw is above the place of decayed flesh slightly, so as not to be in the hollow of the corrupted bone: and it should not appear in its appearance to the senses, and compel by means of her own sawing. If the bone is corrupted and it is not projecting, rather continue a part of it with its part: and the corruption is in the middle of it, or in part of it: then take flesh from all parts completely.
Then place wood below.
Then saw that from the first part where there is corruption, until you continue the sawing from the other part: and make the sawing according to the length near the corruption as we said.
If the corruption is in the joint, cut that corrupted joinery, and saw through the bone where it continues from the other side.
If corruption is within the continuity of two joints, then there is no ingenuity except abrasion.
If corruption is within the wrist or the ankle joint, then it's very difficult to resolve that issue.
However, you must inquire as to how the corruption appears to you.
And remove the abrasion, and cleanse it according to any possible arrangement for you, and correct it with whatever ingenuity you can muster: when it does not oppose your efforts, whether by vein or nerve.
And you will know that the incisive saw and the serrated tool are useful for these bones in many ways, depending on their location, preparation, thickness, fineness, size, quality, rarity of the bones themselves, and their hardness.
Hence, it is necessary to prepare the tool suitable for each type of operation for that task.
And you should know that these operations indicate to you the type of tool you need for them when your study extends to length.
And knowledge of the methods of this art is evidence of the severity of its methods. Then, you will find for yourself what suits it from tools to all ailments.
Shape of the saw.
Shape of the other saw.
Shape of the other (additional) saw.
The shape of the additional saw.
This depicted shape of the saw, let it be centered. Let its upper part be an arch, its sharpness made of iron: and its handle out of wood, and let it be pyramidal with a center of gravity off-center.
The form of the joint razor.
Let the head of this razor have the shape of a star-shaped clavus (a type of nail). And let its points be like those of an elishabet (a specific kind or style of point).
And it is not suitable unless they grind with it the heads of sutures when they are corrupted, or an extensive and large mouth, and a large size is needed.
The form of the larger razor.
The form of the medium-sized razor.
The form of the broad razor.
The form of the razor that has a concavity.
The form of another (type of) sharp razor.
The form of another razor with curved ends.
The form of the leaf-like razor, finely-pointed testa.
The form of the razor with which bones are cut.
Also, the form of the large razor.
This is similar to a saw, and its end is like a sawblade: it is exhibited in many places according to the reason of bones.
The form of the razor that suits the reason for its perforation from the bones.
Its end is triangular, and the ends are sharp.
It is made from India.
And similarly, it must be that all things which we have said about razors, cutters, and saws should be done.
On incisions of extremities and the fixing of bones.
Title LVIII.
The extremities decay, either due to an external cause, or an internal one.
So when you have treated that decay with medical remedies, and the treatment does not apply: and you see the decay affecting the limb without anything touching it, then it is necessary to make an incision into that limb up until where the decay follows, so that the sick may be saved through this way from death, or from a malady which surpasses the defect of the member.
And the sign when this happens is that the member deteriorates until we think it should be destroyed: like how fire burns itself or turns black before it rots. Until an incision reaches that rot up to what follows that limb and gnaws through the entire body.
So then, after making this incision and similarly if the cause of the decay is due to some venomous creatures: like the sea scorpion, snakes, adders, and similar.
So if the decay or impact is at the extremity of a finger, then you must cut off the finger and not leave space for the decay to spread until it reaches the rest of the hand.
And similarly if it happens to the hand, then you must cut it off from the root of the wrist bone and not leave space for the decay until it reaches the brachial part of the arm.
And if it invades there, then cut off the upper arm at the elbow joint. If however, the decay passes and you see it around the elbow: then there is death for the sick person.
And administering beyond this by way of treatment is the amount of strength.
And similarly for a foot, when corruption invades a finger, then it falls upon one node: and if it reaches to the heel of the foot, then the whole foot falls.
And if it ascends to the knee, then it falls upon the knee joint.
And if corruption has already reached above the knee, then there is no skill in it, except for dismissal, and leaving the afflicted to death.
And the method of applying or gripping the limb is to bind or tighten it, such that you pull on the ligament below where you wish to apply it: and then grip another ligament above that spot.
And let the attendant extend one ligament downwards: and let the attendant extend another ligament upwards.
And you separate the flesh that is between the two ligaments, with a broad spatula, until all the flesh is revealed.
Then apply or tighten it.
And you must place lint over all parts and do not let the scalpel touch the healthy area. A wound added to the injury should occur, and a warm pustule should form.
And if bleeding occurs internally while you are operating, then quickly cauterize the area: or place some blood-letting powders on it.
Then return to your treatment until it is completed.
And then bind the injured limb with a suitable ligament and care for it until it heals.
And I will tell you what happens to his foot, this is the same event that I am telling you about.
And what happens is that a blackness occurs on his foot, which resembles burning due to the heat of fire: and this corruption initially happens in his finger until it began to affect the entire foot.
So the man treated himself after he saw decay enter into his member with the weakening of it, that he found from his pain and its heat. And he comes to surgery, and he is healed.
And after a long time has passed for him, the same decay befalls his index finger of his own hand. So he came to me and I tried to restore that excess with what I had placed on his hand from medicines after his body's purification: the excess did not return and began spreading to another finger; until decay started affecting his hand.
So he called me to cut his hand: but I refused that, hoping for a reaction from me against the return of that excess: and I also feared death upon him at cutting into his hand.
Since the strength of the man was above the case.
So after he lost hope in me, he returned to his land: and news of him reached me, because it happened quickly, and he cut his entire hand: and he was healed.
And I did not omit this account, except as an aid to understand that which falls under the type of this illness: and as an explanation that is understood, and according to how it is handled.
¶ On the care for enemas, and the quality of enemas with medicines.
Head 90.
When an abscess occurs in some fatty tissues, and the space of the abscess extends until it collects pus: then it bursts or is pierced, and what's inside comes out with pus, leaving a vacuum spot: and the skin above it behaves like a tissue that has already thinned out. It does not reach its ultimate stage of corruption, nor does it spread to the mouth, nor to the nerve, nor to the ligament: it deserves to be called an Enema. It is not called Fistula. However, if the space extends until it spreads into one of these tissues, then it becomes a Fistula or zuken.
And its care is to penetrate that skin completely as it is unfolded: and especially when it has become thin like a cloth. And trust because it will not adhere to the place due to its decay.
And if you hope that it will adhere to the skin and does not follow that final decay: and if there is thickness in the skin from flesh, then take care with Clisteri: and it is for you to consider towards the Breast.
And if it is large and the pus that issues from it has an odour of corruption: then treat with Clisteri using Egyptian medicine, which is vinegar, oil, and zinnia, taking equal parts of them to mix into a pot. And they are cooked over fire until the medicine turns red. And it will thicken like honey.
Then take what you need from it: and dissolve it with water and honey, and treat the Breast with Clisteri using it. Tighten its opening, and pour the medicine into it to a quantity equivalent to two hours.
Then remove it with the discharge: do this for days until the Breast is cleansed and the smell is removed.
And sometimes it is treated with water from ashes instead of this medicine when it's not available to you. And you should take the ash from vine wood or oak wood and pour that water on top of it.
Then let her rest with it, treating with this mixture until you are confident that the Breast has been cleaned.
And if the weak cannot tolerate the Egyptian medicine or its water mixed with ashes, then treat it with water and honey that has already been mixed with some of crushed zinnia.
Or treat it with honey and wine mixed together, because of the properties of honey that cleanse and clean; and wine makes the Breast adhere, especially when there is excess of coagulating and drying qualities in the wine.
When you perform this procedure several times and believe that the sinus causing corruption has been removed, then after that irrigate him with whatever helps to create flesh within it.
And here is how you take it from the plaster of dyafinicon: dissolve it with rose oil and astringent wine, or irrigate it with various medicines and other ointments, about which I wrote their properties in the treatise on ointments.
If the sinus opening is narrow and does not allow the passage of a catheter during irrigation: then widen it with a small piece of iron. Or place a rolled licorice in an Egyptian ointment or a basil ointment inside it, until it widens.
And similarly, if the opening is even wider, then stitch together its edges with suture. And remove from it the amount that can be irrigated with a catheter without adding anything.
And similarly, if the opening from which pus flows is elevated above the surface: then cut him open to a lower place within it, so that pus can drain from there down below. Because pus, when restricted deeply in the sinus, prevents flesh from being generated in it.
And if it is not possible for you to cut the sinus close to below where you wish: then try to prepare the member with preparation that allows pus to drain out of it easily, according to how you are prepared.
Try so that nothing of the pus is retained within it at all. And take the consolidative medicines that are placed over the sign, suitable for what you wish.
And spread them over a linen cloth.
And let the cloth be of such quantity that it may facilitate communication throughout the entire sinus.
Then cut with forceps through the direct opening of the sinus hole, widening it slightly into the sinus.
Then extend from unguentary ointments another patch onto the cloth, according to the size of the hole: and place it upon it in a position far away from the sinus opening, so that the pus may be expelled through it: and do not remove the large patch unless after some days once.
That one who is over the sinus opening, that one you remove at all times, so that what accumulates in it from pus may go out. And to know whether that which flows out of it is much or little: or whether it has digested well or poorly.
And again, when this is done, consider the location of the sinus itself; does the owner feel pain there, or is there no pain within it, and is there a boil inside, or is there no boil.
So when your treatment is applied like this, and you see the material that emerges over the sinus opening, then you will know that the sinus has adhered, or is approaching adherence: therefore dissolve it in the morning, or on the third day: and when you open the wound, then change another bandage, and renew the ointment. If however pus emerges from the sinus over a long space subtly, then do not despair of its adherence, for its healing is approaching, since there are humans who delay the growth of flesh in their wounds, and among them are those who act contrary to him.
If however pus emerges from the sinus after many days that is undigested, then you will know that the sinus does not adhere.
If therefore the adherence of the sinus is delayed and its process extends, then add to drying remedies but have the physicians do it such that they make the remedies in their substance wet and dry at the same time: like the dyafinicon ointment when a superfluity of addition is added from zegi.
And from this final part of what he treats, it is to take the dyefinicon ointment and dissolve it with rose oil, then let the old wine soak into its substance.
Then mix it with this [material], and use it.
And similarly performs this action when the dyafinicon ointment is not at hand, using honey, when you decoct it until it thickens, and then uses it.
Or take myrrh, and frankincense, and spikenard: grind it all together, and spread that powder on honey while it is still over the fire.
Then pour it over this cloth, and tie it over the pot: and pour in the honey that you have decocted, until it has thickened: and spread the mixture on top of it, and put the cloth over it, then tie it.
And sometimes it is administered with the long aristolochia and roots of the celestial lily, and the lily itself: and herb flour, and centaurie.
Use them either simply or combined, grind these and sift them: and spread the powdered mixture over the honey that I have described, and use it.
If the condition persists and is not healed by this treatment, then you will know that there is a deep corruption within him. Or it has already made an impression in the bones, or in other hard parts, or ligaments: then treat it with the treatment for Fistular (conditions), as previously stated. Section 1: Treatment of Abscess and Ingrown Nails, and Incision of the Finger, and Section.
Title XCIX.
An abscess is an infection that occurs under the thumb nail of the hand or foot, and may also occur in other fingers.
When therefore its extension is prolonged, and its care is neglected, and it is treated with hot application: either it gets corrupted and discharges pus until the root of the nail rots away. And perhaps it corrupted all of it, and perhaps infection reached up to the mouth until there is a foul odor present. Then the end of the digit becomes broadened, and its color turns to dark brown.
When however you take care of it, when you have done what we said about division, and if you do not provide proper care: then it is necessary to use the iron completely on the remaining excess which was left from the nail.
Then cauterize the wound afterwards.
Indeed, the cautery is very beneficial.
If however the mouth is intact and there is still a nail even if it's somewhat damaged, and the empty spaces beneath the nail are already pressing into the flesh towards the insides, and they start piercing it, then you should place a delicate piece of iron under the angle of the nail that pierces the flesh. Push it upwards gently. Cut off the flesh with ease, and then cover what's left of the flesh with substances used for burning and corroding until it is all removed.
Then take care of that with ointments until it heals.
If corruption has already spread into the mouth, then you should cut that mouth and remove it out. The mouth cannot ever be healed while there is a corrupted one remaining.
If you see corrosion and corruption spreading into the finger, then cut it off at one of its joints, as was previously mentioned.
Then care for it until it is healed.
If it happens due to nail rubbing or impact and there is intermittent pain, then it should be treated with a weak bloodletting first.
Then cut the nail with a sharp Spatulimi across from top to bottom.
And be careful, so that the cut does not reach the flesh which is under the nail, for you will cause a severe pain to happen upon the patient, and it will be the cause of the creation of the addition of flesh at that place.
Then take care of the site with whatever soothes the pain.
But the added finger that is born in some human hands, perhaps it is entirely flesh. Perhaps there are bones in some of them, and perhaps there is a nail in it. And some of them are born at the junction's root or its birthplace may be in certain joints of the finger.
That one which is born at the joints of some fingers does not move: and that one which is born near the junction of the finger may perhaps move.
Therefore, the one among them that is flesh, its section is easy.
Which means, you will hit it at its root with the broad end of your spatulimi (a surgical tool).
The treatment for that one whose birthplace is at the junction's root is difficult.
Therefore, avoid making an incision on it.
But for that one born at the end of the fingers among the joints, then you must make an incision to reach the first flesh up until the mouth of the bone.
Then squeeze the bone with one of those surgical tools that fits and aligns to it.
And then take care of it until it heals.
Recovery that happens between fingers one by one, happens many times either due to the birth of a person, that is, it is born with it, or from the healing of wounds, or burning by fire, and similar things.
Therefore, it is necessary for one to detach that consolidation until the fingers return to their natural shape.
Then place between them a licia (type of fabric) or cloths soaked in rose oil: so that they do not adhere quickly, and separate them: or place between them a thin sheet of lead until the affected area consolidates as required.
And similarly, if there happens to be a consolidation between some fingers and the palm, then detach that consolidation according to how it is prepared and suits the shape of the limb.
¶ On Incisions.
Head 92.
Uterine veins are rolled, large, filled with superfluous melancholic matter which happens in many parts of the body. And most often their occurrences are in the legs, particularly in the walking and working legs, and those that bear weight.
Therefore, you should administer purges of the body from black bile, several times with strong purgation.
Then use a bloodletting tool on the patient's basilic vein.
However, the treatment for them with iron is according to two methods.
One of these methods involves drinking and extracting black blood.
And the other method is to remove the vein and extract it entirely.
The section of it, however, follows this manner.
First immerse the leg in warm water for quite some time until the thick and fatty blood dissolves.
Then, bind the leg of the sick at the upper part of its thigh bone, up to the lower part of the knee with an appliance.
Then cut one, or two, or three wide sections in the place.
Then cut the nail down to the bone until a quantity of blood comes out that you see is sufficient and that the strength of the patient can bear.
Then tie it up: and advise him to refrain from foods that generate bile black. And perform repeated evacuation and bloodletting when the veins are full, and this harms the patient.
The raising of such (a patient) is according to this manner.
Shave the leg of the patient if there are many hairs on it.
Then immerse him in the bath: or soak his leg with hot water into it until he becomes red and the veins become prominent: or exercise him with vigorous exercise if there is no present bath until the member warms.
Then cut the skin directly across the vein section along its length: or at the end of it near the knee, or at the lower part of it near the heel.
Then open the skin with hooks and remove the vein from all sides until it appears to the sense: and at its appearance, you see that it turns from red to black.
And when it flows out of the skin, you see it white as if it were a string.
Then insert the rod under it until when it rises and comes out of the skin: hang it with a blind hook, gently.
Then cut another section close to that section with three fingers.
Then scrape the skin from the upper part of the thigh until it becomes visible.
Then lift her up with the tongs as you did before, and hang her up with another hook as you did first.
Then cut another section, or more sections if needed for that purpose.
Then lift it up and cut the final section at the heel.
Then pull it out to the section that is above it.
And do that until you extract it from the upper section or with all higher sections until when she is completely released. Then cut her off.
But if she doesn't obey you to extract and lift her out, then insert the tip with a strong double thread and tie her. Then pull her out. Or insert the tongs underneath her and move your hand around until she comes out completely.
And be careful not to cut too deeply.
For if you do cut, it will greatly make it difficult for you to lift her out and she can cause harm to the vulnerable one from there.
So when you have extracted her completely, then place on the wound site a cloth immersed in wine and rose oil or just oil, and take care of it until it heals.
If it is contracted with a twist that makes it difficult to straighten out and it's not as we described according to the straightness: then you must find above her across all parts of its twistiness, and the places of its turning.
Then hang her up with hooks until you lift her completely. Be careful when your section is over her not to cut the vein or injure her; for it will be difficult for you to lift her or extract her afterwards.
Therefore, preserve your wisdom.
The form of the injury by which the vine is healed.
The form of the noose for the blind.
There is no such treatment for him as for others with nooses, nor does he have a sharp extremity to avoid piercing the vein; and it has a large bending, being soft. For if it were fine, it would pierce the blood vessel by its fineness. Indeed, there is an excess of thickness for him, just like we said.
On the extraction of the thigh vein. Chapter 93
This vein is formed in the thighs in hot lands, such as Alizay, and the land of the Arabs, and in dry, hot, little fertile lands, that is, in which no grass nor tree is born.
And perhaps it is formed in other parts of the body besides the thighs.
Indeed, its formation is from putrefaction that happens under the skin, just like snakes and roundworms happen inside bodies, and worms that are born between the skin and flesh.
And the sign of the onset of events related to this vein is that inflammation happens in the thighs periodically.
Then, a spot will blister.
Then the vein begins to emerge from that blistery spot, as if it were the root of a plant or an animal.
So when the end of it appears from there, then you should wrap some part of a lead weight over it, whose weight is equivalent to about half a shekel up to two shekels and mark that point. Then remove the suspended lead from the thigh.
Whenever therefore something issues out from it towards the external [body], envelop that with lead, and place a mark there.
If it extends for a long time, then cut off its portion, and envelop the rest.
And do not cut it to its root before it has entirely come out.
For if you cut it too deeply, it contracts and penetrates into the flesh: this causes pus to occur, and decay in the area, and a bad ulcer.
Therefore, it is necessary to handle it gently and extract it gradually until the very end of its root has come out, so that nothing remains from it within the body: through this vein, in some individuals there comes forth what is as long as five palms and ten.
And now it has reached me, because it emerged from twenty palms.
And if you happen to cut into it during your treatment time: then insert the root into its hole and make a long puncture through both parts of it, until all that is inside comes out from the substance: and apply decay to the area with medicines for several days. Then care for the treatment of the pus.
And this vein often has many branches, especially when it appears at the ankle joint or within the foot. And there are multiple openings for it, and a branch emerges from every opening.
So care for this thing as we have said in division and along with that which was previously mentioned.
Section of worms generated under the skin, and it is called Boil Sickness.
Chapter 94.
This sickness is called Boil Sickness in our land: because it often happens to cows, and there is a small worm that is born between the skin and the flesh.
And it travels throughout the body, ascending and descending: and it is perceived by sense during his walking from member to member, until wherever it breaks, it breaks through the skin's place, and emerges.
And its production is from the putrefaction of certain body fluids.
Like when worms and snakes, that is, roundworms and hookworms, occur in the stomach.
And it is feared due to its malevolence.
For when it travels within the body and rises to the head, and reaches a place there: then perhaps it opens within it, emerges, and destroys the eye: and this happens many times.
So when you then attend to the wound and remove it, this does not happen except during his walking and its appearance to the sense.
Therefore, it must be that you tie what is above him and what is below with the bandage in a strong constriction.
Then cut over it, and pull it out.
If it goes deep into the flesh and you do not find it: then place a cautery on the spot with fire until it dies.
And what is feared more, is its corruption which spoils the eye, as we said. And if you see that it has already penetrated to the head near the eye, then bind under it a good eyebrow constriction.
Then cut over it and pull it out.
And it is necessary for me to use his sick purification of his body with medicines that dissolve bad body fluids.
And beware of foods that cause putrefaction in oneself.
On Cutting for Sickness Relief by Nakir.
Head XCV.
This sickness is called Nakir in our land: it is pain that happens to some limbs; then it changes from limb to limb.
And indeed I have heard it myself, as I am telling you.
I was summoned to attend a woman who is ill in some respects.
And I extended her arm and saw a small swelling in the vein of the arm.
And after staying for an hour, I saw one swelling move along with rapidity, like a worm walking, ascending to her shoulder faster than it is possible: let it be as though silver is alive, when it runs from place to place.
So the pain withdrew from that place and fixed itself in the shoulder.
Then I sat for an hour, and it ran through the rest of her body until it reached another arm.
Then she told me that it was revolving throughout her entire body, as I had observed.
I was amazed by the speed of its transition from limb to limb.
And indeed, I had not seen this sickness in such manner with my eyes before in this way.
However, I have seen many cases where the pain is found to change from limb to limb. And I did not see it with my eyes as I saw it in this woman.
And I do not consider that to be the case unless it is due to this, that woman was from those who have dry body veins detected. Hence, that sensation of wind changing seems to appear through the senses.
And it is necessary that they not appear according to this manner in those who are delicate and have moist bodies, for hidden veins.
And therefore when you wish to treat him and the patient feels that pain: then if it appears to you visually, as we said, then grip above it, and beneath it quickly, and cut above it until that confined wind emerges: and cauterize the area.
But if you do not see it with your eyes: then attend to it along with the expulsion of the body, and what drives out the winds, and purge these with stinking pills, and pills from poppy, and similar ones.
¶ On the Extraction of Arrows.
Chapter 96. Arrows differ according to their types and the locations where they fall from the body.
But their variety is as follows: because among them there are those that have large and small points, and cupped ones, and round ones.
And among them are arrows that have three corners.
And among them are those with tongues.
And among them are those that have star-like shapes.
Those which fall according to the limbs they hit are considered under two modes.
Or if the limbs are from the main limbs that are cupped, such as brain, heart, liver, lungs, kidneys, intestines, bladder and similar organs.
So when it falls into one of these limbs and you see the signs of death that I'm telling you about later, then you should know how to perform the removal of that arrow from them, for death follows him where he is, in many dispositions.
And when you cannot see these signs of evil and the arrow is not hidden deeply within the body part, then extract it, and take care of the wound.
For when an arrow falls into the brain and penetrates through to the mouth, and a siphon is present above the head, this happens: for these conditions often result in headache, blindness, dizziness, redness in the eyes, swelling, redness of the tongue, cramps, confusion of mind, and vomiting.
And perhaps blood may come out through the nose or ears.
And perhaps speech is lost and the voice is destroyed.
And a white, paste-like wetness comes out from the wound location.
And it comes out of him like bodily fluid.
And if these signs appear to you, then refrain from treatment, and extract the arrow if it does not come out.
The signs of an arrow when it falls into the heart are: that it is near the left mammary gland; and one feels as if it is fixed in a hard thing, not in empty space.
And perhaps the movement of the arrow is similar to the movement of a pulse: and blood flows out from the wound black.
And this results in coldness at extremities, and cold sweating, and fainting fits.
You will know that death is likely to occur without much doubt.
The sign of an arrow when it pierces the lung is blood flowing out foamy from the wound: and the swells that follow the neck turn, and the color of the sick changes.
And he exhales a large, deep breath, seeking the attraction of cold air.
If the arrow falls into the pericardium, which is in the chest: then it's near thin ribs: and a great sighing occurs with intense pain, with heaving: and all shoulder limbs move.
And if the arrow falls into the stomach, then perhaps it will expel something undigested from the elbow with food.
And if the arrow falls into the belly and lodges there, it will expel some feces from the wound, or a hair, or an intestinal segment that has already been ruptured.
Therefore, there is no hope for his treatment, nor for the removal of the arrow.
If the arrow falls into the bladder and urine is discharged: and something proceeds from it to the external parts, and the pain becomes stronger over the weak: then you will know that it is fatal.
As for the other limbs, such as the face, neck, throat, tongue, trachea, ribs, sternum, thigh, and similar parts, they are cured according to various dispositions of the body when the arrow does not hit an artery or nerve: and there is no poisonous arrow.
And I am telling you what I have seen about these arrows, so that you can understand it in relation to your treatment.
That is why sometimes an arrow falls into the lacrimal apparatus of his eye, at the root of his nose.
So extract it yourself from the other side, under the fat of his ear: and he will be healed, and no harm will come to him in his eye.
And another arrow was extracted by a Jew, which fell into the fat of his eye under the lower eyelid: and the arrow was already hidden within him, I did not find it except for its thin tip, with which it adheres to his own stick: this was an arrow large among arrows from Turkish bows, made of soft iron, without ears.
The Jew has been healed therefore, and it does not happen that a bad event occurs in his eye. And another arrow was extracted from the throat of the Christian.
And it was an Arabic arrow, and that is for whom there are ears.
Therefore, follow it beyond the two guides: and now it was submerged in his throat.
I then worked skillfully with her until I extracted it, and the Christian was healed.
And I extracted another arrow which had pierced his belly: and we thought that he would die from it.
After which thirty days passed by him, and nothing changed in his situation despite his dispositions, I followed the arrow for him: and I devised a plan concerning it and extracted it: and he was healed and no bad event occurs to him.
And I saw a man who had an arrow fall into his back, and a wound had formed over it.
And after that, seven years later, the arrow came out at the root of his thigh.
And I saw a woman who had an arrow fall into her belly, and a wound formed over it, and the arrow remained inside her. And nothing changed despite her various dispositions, and the woman did not find any harm in herself from any of her natural operations.
And I saw another man who had an arrow fall into his face. And the wound became solid and remained there, not finding much pain from it. And similar things happened many times.
And I extracted the arrow from the King's principal, which had fallen into his middle of the nose, and it was now leaning towards the right side only slightly: and the entire arrow was concealed.
I was therefore called upon for his treatment following the case of the arrow up until three days.
Therefore, I find the wound from the arrow to be very tight.
Therefore, I examined it carefully with my hand and did not feel it; indeed, he himself was finding the puncture and pain inside his right ear.
I hoped that the puncture was at the tip of the arrow.
I therefore applied the place with a plaster containing magnetic and digestive properties, trusting that the area would heal and reveal to me the sign of the arrow so that I could cut above it: and it did not happen that an event occurred at the location indicating that the arrow has followed the site.
I diligently applied the plaster to it for many days: and no events occurred, and the wound hardened temporarily: and he remained unable to extract it for a period of time until one day he felt the arrow inside his nose.
And he told me this.
Therefore, I placed an abrasive medicine on it for many days until it opened up: and when I examined him with my hand, I felt the tip of the arrow which adheres to the wood.
Then I added to the opening with that abrasive medicine until we could clearly see the tip of the arrow: and it passed me about a period of time of around four months.
Then when the wound had grown larger and it was possible for me to insert forceps into it and move them around without success: then I did not stop trying with subtlety and inventing methods with tools, until one day I began extracting it using forceps of proper size, according to their shape at the end of the head, until I was able to remove it.
Then restore the wound.
And doctors indeed believe that the nasal cartilage does not get restored.
Therefore restore it again, and the wound was healed, and the sick person recovered completely with health intact: nothing harmed her in any way.
And I tell you the quality of the extraction of certain arrows: so place this rule and meaning above that which I did not say.
Because the parts of this art and their distinctions are not encompassed by its narrative: nor does this book understand it, and a skillful craftsman compares it with little to much. And when there is a surplus, he compares it with that which is lacking, and he discovers a new operation and a new instrument in this art when the decline of events occurs.
I say then, that arrows do not emerge from the parts in which they are fixed, unless according to two ways. Or through attraction from the place where it entered.
Or against the other side of the part.
And that which emerges from where it entered, or is an arrow proceeding into the fleshed area: and it attracts and emerges.
If it does not conform to the exit from the time at which it falls: then you must let it go for a few days until the flesh around it has decomposed. And its attraction will cease and its emergence will occur.
And similarly, if it gets stuck in bone and does not conform to you for an exit, then let it go as well for a few days. And repeat it with its pull and motion every day until it emerges.
If it does not conform to you for an exit after days, then you must bore into the area around the arrow in that bone from every side with a fine drill until the arrows expand.
Then draw it in, and pull out itself.
If the arrow is fixed in the head bone and has already penetrated into one of the cerebral cavities, and there appears some manifestation of those conditions that I mentioned: then abstain from drawing out the arrow, instead remove it until equilibrium comes to be after a day.
For if the arrow has reached the sifach [a part of the body], then death is not prolonged for him.
And if the arrow is not fixed, except within the body bone and does not penetrate up to the sifach: and he remains sick for a few days, and nothing happens to him from those incidents; then use your skills in drawing out and extracting the arrow.
If it is fixed strongly and does not yield to your attempt at drawing [the arrow]: then administer trepanning around the area of the arrow, as I have instructed you: afterwards attend to the wound until it heals.
If the arrow is already hidden inside the body location and concealed from perception: then seek it out with your attempts.
If you sense it, then draw her in with certain tools that suit its extraction.
If you cannot manage over it due to constriction of the wound and because of the length of the arrow deeply inside, and there is no opening, nor nerve, nor vein there: then wait upon it until the wound expands and becomes possible for extraction of the arrow.
If it is held by ears to which there are attachments, then release the fixed flesh around them from every side using all methods that you can. Use tools if they cannot be applied due to inability to manipulate the tissue in breaks of the ears and twisting of them until it resolves.
And you when you perform the extraction of the arrow, wherever it is located, then use the twisting motion of your hand with forceps to all parts until you make it come out: and apply delicate finesse so that the arrow is not broken, and that it becomes difficult for you to pull it, and also its removal.
If you cannot remove it at once, then allow it for several days until the surrounding tissues decompose.
Then remove it again. Indeed, the arrow should be extracted. But if the blood flow is against you, then administer what we said about treatment in its chapter: and guard your strength from cutting a vein, or a nerve, or a tendon.
And use every skillful method possible for the extraction of the arrow: and let it be with ease, tranquility, or perhaps slowly but firmly, as I have told you.
And you must make the patient sick according to the figure when you pull out the arrow, as it was with the case of the arrow in itself.
Because it is more beneficial.
If however, it is not possible for you to do that, then administer what is possible for you from the figures.
The arrow that emerges from the opposite side of the body, or has already begun to reach towards the exterior, or causes a lump at the tip of the arrow through sensation from the nearby upper part of the skin, making it visible. Therefore cut it above it and make the cut according to how many forceps can take in her.
Then pull it (the arrow): for it becomes easy for exit.
But if it is held in the bone, then twist your hand according to its roundness until the arrow presses into the bone and widens itself. Then pull it (the arrow).
And if not: dismiss it for a few days; then reapply it until it escapes.
And if the arrowwood is in it, then push it out with it.
And if the wood fell and there is a need to apply force: then insert that tool into it, so that its concavity enters into the arrow's tail: then push it out with it.
And if the Arrow is concave, then push it out with the tool inserted into it.
Indeed, an arrow moves through that.
And if the arrow is poisoned, then you must hollow out all the flesh where the poison is: if it is possible for you to do that.
And then care for it with what is suitable in relation to this.
And if the arrow has fallen in the chest, or in the abdomen, or in the bladder, or on the side: and it is close to what you touch with your finger, and it is possible for you to cut above it: then cut it, and dig away from the incision of a vein or nerve, and remove it.
And afterwards heal the wound if you see it, and care for it until it is healed.
And this is the form of Forcips, with which arrows are extracted.
Their ends are similar to the beak of a bird, which are made like iron: when they grasp over an arrow, they do not let it go.
And many types are made from them, large, small and medium, according to the size of the arrow and its shape, and the width of the wound and its conformation.
Shape of the Impeller concave.
And the shape of the impeller for the deaf.
This is like the extremity of the deaf person, such as the radius, so that its entry is directed into a concave bow and it is pushed along with it.
This is the concave end of the impeller, like a feather of a bird: so that the entry point of the arrow is directed into it and its impulse is applied.
On venous bloodletting.
Title 77. There are thirty veins for bloodletting, which run their course in the body.
Among these, sixteen are found in the head: two of the pulse veins, which are behind the ears and called 'two herbs'; and two arteries, which appear in both temples; and two veins that are in the two tear ducts of both eyes, which are called 'watching veins'; and a vein prepared in the middle of the forehead: and a vein that is at the end of the nose.
And two jugulars, which are in the neck.
And two veins that are in the upper lip.
And two veins that are in the lower lip.
These are the veins which are called Algecherich.
And two veins that are under the tongue.
The veins to be used for bloodletting in the arms are five veins in each arm.
One of them is the cephalic, and it comes from the side of the sleeve: and they call this vein the head vein commonly.
And Fuchsia.
And it is called Media Una, and it is composed from the branch of Basilica and the branch of Cephalica: and they name her common blood of the body.
And Basilica, it is placed inside the domestic side: and it is also called Titillicaris.
And they call her by the common name of abdominal blood.
And the vein of the arm, it is placed over the elbow: that is where phlebotomy occurs, and that is which appears above the thumb clearly.
And Salvatella: it is the vein that exists between the annular and the minimal [artery]: and there are two branches for her.
In the calf, and in the foot, there are three veins.
One of them is which is under the curvature of the thumb from the wild side.
And the second one is Saphena: its location is at the heel on the domestic side.
And vein Nesse: its location is at the heel on the wild side.
And in the calf, there are three other veins similar to these.
¶ On bloodletting with two veins after the ears.
For bloodletting with two veins which are after the ears, it is beneficial for old catarrhs, and headache, and ear discharge, and bad head ulcers.
And the quality of bloodletting is as I describe it.
And it is done by cutting the head of the sick person: and its scalp is rubbed at the site of the two veins with good friction using a coarse cloth.
Then let the patient stretch his neck with the arm, until two veins become visible.
And those places are behind the ears at two depressed spots on the head.
So, search for these with your finger, and where you feel the pulse under your finger, there mark the spots with a branding iron.
Then take a surgical scalpel for phlebotomy, and that one is called the Incidens.
Then insert it under the vein into the skin until the phlebotomy tool reaches the mouth of the vein.
Then raise your hand with the vein and skin towards above, and cut the vein along with the skin in a descending manner.
And let the length of the cut be as much as two joined fingers, or roughly that; and make it bleed as much as you can.
Then bind it with bandages, and remove them when the wound has healed.
And now, at the beginning of this book, there is mention of making cuts and their cauterization.
Section 1: On bloodletting using two arteries in the arm.
However, two arteries which are useful in the two places of bloodletting for benefit: it is the temporal artery and the superficial temporal artery, and the flow of excess secretions towards the eyes. And the quality of bloodletting for these is as I am going to tell you.
The patient should stretch their neck significantly until two veins become visibly apparent: and it must be demonstrated that the pulse of these is felt under your finger.
Then mark the spots with a branding iron.
Then lift the skin above the vein with your finger up to the upper part, and insert the phlebotomus coming downwards below it, then lift the vein upwards.
And cut it as you did in the other two veins: and let blood flow from the blood according to the amount needed. Then relieve the constriction of the patient, and place your finger on the vein for an hour.
Then place a cloth and strips over it, and bind the area strongly above the constriction: and remove it until the patient is healed.
And now recall that preparation, and its incision, and the extraction at the beginning of this book.
¶ Concerning frontal vein bloodletting after cephalic bloodletting.
However, the benefit of frontal vein bloodletting is after cephalic bloodletting, for old ailments of the face: and for migraine, and redness: and for foul sores.
And the quality of this bloodletting is as I will tell you.
Grip the patient's neck with your hand until the vein appears.
Then take the tool that is called the Fossorial Instrument.
And this is its form.
Place the prominent edge of the Fossorial Instrument's head over the vein and strike it with your thumbnail or with another tool in a similar manner. Allow the blood to flow according to how you desire.
Then relieve the puncture of the patient and bind it until they are healed.
And sometimes an opening is made with a broad bloodletting instrument.
However, it is not necessary that it be a phlebotomy for acute extremities, like the other phlebotomies, indeed it should be for broad extremities.
And for the phlebotomy, follow the deviation: because it is close by: and perhaps when the phlebotomy tool is fine, it might break within it.
¶ On Phlebotomy in two Lacrymal veins.
The treatment for the two veins that are located in the two lacrimal areas of both eyes is aimed at relieving symptoms caused by scabies and redness: and also the disturbances within the eye and the discomforts on the face.
And the quality of these phlebotomies is such that the sick person should tighten their neck with an outstretched hand.
Then perform the phlebotomy on them, and stand above his head.
And perform the phlebotomy according to the deviation to a length that is somewhat short, using a small phlebotomy tool, slightly broadened because there is no flesh in the location.
Indeed, if the phlebotomy tool is thin for an extremity, perhaps it might break.
Then make the bleeding run out as much as you need from the blood that is there.
And place your thumbs over them and tighten them at night once, then release them.
¶ On Phlebotomy of the Nasal Veins.
The phlebotomy of the Nasal Veins is performed for acute fevers and violent heat, as well as facial discomforts such as headaches and redness that occur on the face: particularly when it is chronic.
And what is the quality of this bloodletting, that it tightens the patient's neck.
Then hold his nose with your left hand, and take a delicate, long bloodletting tool. Fix it in the middle of the rabbit's body, between what distinguishes the nose according to its right orientation.
Since the vein is not perceptible by touch there, and because blood begins to flow immediately.
And it must be that your hand with the bloodletting tool is only slightly pressed: and you should make the flow from the blood according to your need.
Then tie that one overnight.
For it is restored quickly.
### Guidelines for Venous Bloodletting
Two forms of bloodletting with Guidegi are useful for constriction of breathing, and the onset of leprosy, and melancholic illnesses, and pustular eruptions and bad sores, and those that corrode, that is, herpes-like conditions.
And the quality of these bloodlettings is such that they tighten the patient under both on their neck when bound: and let the artisan stand over the patient's head, and the patient should sit on a chair.
Then direct the bloodletting tool along the vein to the width of the bloodletting, slightly pressing it.
Then extract from the blood a measured amount, or according to what you see as needed for that purpose.
Then do similarly with another vein.
Then release the bandage, and tie both veins together in the middle: so that the patient does not get overheated.
And let her rest until morning.
Indeed, the wound is healed.
On bloodletting using a syringe by Alhuberish.
However, Algeberich considers bloodletting with a syringe to be beneficial: because it facilitates the absorption of alcohol and the decay of gum tissue: and bad sores: and cracks in the lips, and bad sores, even those that are in the nose, and around its circumference.
And the quality of such bloodletting is to make the patient sit in front of you and hold their neck with your arm.
Then turn the patient's lips and look at two veins: one is from the right lip, and the other is from their left side: and the demonstration of each is by the darkening (or discoloration) of the armpit.
And this is true: because there are small, dark veins around them.
So make each cut in the direction of incidence. But if there is doubt about you, and you do not know which one it is: then direct yourself to the cut of the larger ones, and that one will be more obvious.
And similarly, do the same for the two veins in the upper lip: and there is quite a lot of custom with that: and make cuts for the two veins in the lower lip.
On bloodletting using the vein under the tongue after the cephalic bloodletting procedure.
Indeed, the two veins which are under the tongue for bloodletting are useful: because the cephalic bloodletting is aimed at ulcers in the throat, nausea of the stomach, and discomforts of the mouth.
And the quality of bloodletting is this, that the sick person should sit between your hands in front of the sun: and observe his breath, and look under his tongue from the side of him one vein, and from the other side of him another vein: and each color descends to blackness.
Therefore both for bloodletting: and guard yourself not to make the last your hands in the act of bloodletting.
For beneath him are arteries, and perhaps there may be a flow of blood from these arteries.
¶ Concerning the three veins in the elbow.
And indeed there are three veins that undergo bloodletting at the elbow, which in all people have a custom of flowing during bloodletting.
And their bloodletting is done according to two methods.
Or by pricking with a myrtle broad lancet: or by rubbing with oil for thinness of the descent: or by cutting with a surgical knife and it is called Alnesil.
And this is its form.
Thus Alnesil is suitable for cutting.
And from them there are types that are broad and fine according to the width and tightness of the veins. The form of the myrtle lancet for bloodletting is such that it is broad, as you see.
And it is suitable for opening shallow, full, advancing, visible, large veins, and those that contain thick, turbid blood.
And this lancet is smaller in width and more slender at the tip.
And it is suitable for bloodletting of thin veins that contain thin yellowish blood.
On Bloodletting in the Basilica.
The Basilica, which is one of these three types of bloodletting, proves to be beneficial. Because it extracts blood from the illnesses that are under the throat and neck, as it follows the chest and belly; and suits a bloodletting method for a blooddrawer, so they should be careful and avoid fear of it because there is an artery beneath it.
So if they go wrong and add to the point of bloodletting, it will hit that artery, and there will be a flow of blood.
Therefore, it is necessary that the blooddrawer use the Basilica with a prickling bloodletting tool: rather, she should use one that follows with Alnesil.
And if the appearance of the Basilica is not evident with a clear manifestation, then it should be replaced by another one and switched to another, or you should search for one of its branches. Or use the bloodletting tool called 'Funus Brachii' instead of that.
It is indeed evident and can be used along with the bloodletting tool Anesil, as we said.
If you use bloodletting of its own kind, then it is necessary to prepare before tightening the arm bandage until you can touch the site until you know the pulse location.
Then mark the site with hot wax, then place the arm, and cut the vein section in a concave manner using Alnesil's bloodletting tool, as we said.
And be careful not to strike the impact through the space from the site of the artery.
And when you see, with the tightening of the bandage, an increase at the site marked with wax, then that increase is the expansion of the artery: so she should do it properly.
If you observe blood flowing during phlebotomy in a manner similar to a child's urine, and the blood is fine, red, then you will know that it comes from arterial blood.
So then hurry up, and place your finger on it at the longer distance, then remove your finger.
So when blood is taken out (as it is taken multiple times), then grip the arm, and let it go: and beware of the patient's movement due to fear: and be over him/her.
And do not move him for a few days until he is healed.
But if blood is not being taken and it's overpowering you: and there isn't any medicine available to you at the moment, then cut the artery when you see it.
Because its extremities contract and blood is taken out.
Or take a piece of leather thong and make it into two. Take one half and hold it tightly over the spot where the vein is tightened up, with the bandage and small stones until another day.
Then if blood is taken out, that's good.
And if not: then take care of it with the person whose memory has returned from the place where small stones were removed and blood flowed. And stopping blood in many positions isn't difficult due to the lack of wounds and possibility of bandaging from the arm.
¶ Concerning phlebotomy for the vein Fossa.
The vein Fossa is useful for phlebotomy as it carries blood from the upper part of the head and lower parts of the body. This is because it is composed of a branch of the basilic vein and a branch of the cephalic vein, as we have said.
And it is necessary for the bloodletter that she be above his fear of bloodletting, because there is a nerve under her.
If therefore they add to the puncture for bloodletting, and he finds a nerve, it happens to her that she becomes unconscious, and healing becomes difficult for him, and perhaps she may not be completely healed.
And this nerve is often perceived by touch.
And in some people if it is hidden and subtle, not being shown: then you should use the bloodletting method that you know where to apply it, with a section like Alnesil's, and accurately find the nerve with your strength.
And if there is a vein between two nerves, then find the vein by its length.
¶ On the Cephalic Vein.
As for bloodletting of the Cephalic Vein, it is helpful because it draws blood from the head and relieves eye ailments.
And it is necessary to apply bloodletting specifically to this vein, if you wish, using an oily bloodletting tool or a myrrh bloodletting tool: for it is the healthiest of all veins because there is no artery nor nerve underneath. However, when performing bloodletting, it is advisable to apply the tool gently on top of the head only and search for a softer spot: it does not harm her if it is not found immediately with one strike, so that you can apply the bloodletting tool to that area several times. However, it may happen in some people that an abscess forms when bloodletting is not done with the first strike, but this apophasis does not harm her in any way.
On the utility of phlebotomy and precautions in practicing it.
The quality of phlebotomy, and its incidents, originate from the correction that one must consider in it.
Firstly, you must understand for what it is necessary that you know, namely that phlebotomy should not be administered except as part of maintaining health and persistence in its upkeep, and vigilance against the onset of illnesses.
And so that phlebotomy is done using three veins which are found on the arm, namely the Cephalic, and the Dark, and the Basilic.
And so that phlebotomy is performed at the beginning of April on an empty stomach, truly, and during summer: and autumn, and winter after congestion when signs of fullness are evident.
And phlebotomy is performed on the first or third day, after three hours have passed from that day.
However, phlebotomy which is administered during illnesses does not have a predetermined hour. Rather, when occasion and necessity call for it, it can be performed at night, day, or any hour, at any time.
And it is not necessary to perform phlebotomy on children until they reach fourteen years of age.
Nor is pregnancy during menstruation. However, it can be performed from the fourth to the seventh month of pregnancy.
And old men are not subjected to phlebotomy unless they have already passed sixty years of age.
When someone wishes to undergo phlebotomy for any manner, it is necessary that they cleanse their intestines before the phlebotomy with a mild enema if there is a large amount of retained feces in them. This way, to prevent potentially harmful, putrid excesses from intestines attracting to the main limbs during phlebotomy.
The patient is not bled with the pincers, that is, the nausea-inducing emetics: nor is he vomited at or made drunk until this is removed from them.
The sick man does not have hydrocele.
And let bloodletting be avoided after a bout of colic, vomiting, abdominal pain, increased sexual activity, labor, exercise, watchkeeping, fasting, and anything else that dissipates virtue from bodily or animal strength.
Next, in the subtlety of fluids before this, if blood is thick with food and drinks, and medicines: if it is possible for him to do that.
Next, if bathing doesn't forbid anything, the patient should bathe or engage in some exercise to refine the blood.
And apply bloodletting to his chest on the third day, as we said: and try so that his body is cleansed of all animal evils that might occur that day: such as distress, anger, fear, and similarly, all physical events like labor, punishment, overconsumption, and similar issues.
And let his seat be filled with the things of which human use flows by custom from their aromaticity, smell, flavor and similar qualities through the possibility of quantity.
Next, the bloodletting physician should sit on a stool that is higher than the height required for bloodletting. Afterward, he extends his arm and rubs it with his own hand twice or three times.
Next, tie the ligature with a thong, and wrap it around twice.
And let the constriction be moderate, for when an unequal or excessive constriction occurs in the constriction, it then prohibits the flow of blood. Or if there is a weakening of the constriction, even that prohibits the flow of blood.
Then, after the ligation, it should be that the one to perform the bloodletting rubs their hands together until the veins are filled and are perceptible to sensation.
Then, the bloodletter should cleanse the area with some old oil, in the proper manner.
Then, place his index finger of his left hand on the vein at the desired location for the bloodletting, a little bit: so that it does not escape the vein, and percussion is set.
For, within veins is what you find like a fleeing chord at bloodletting: and from them it is that which is full of windiness: and when the one to perform bloodletting places their hands on such, it contracts under the bloodletting, and it is diverted by the bloodletter, and the bloodletter does not open the vein: and if they do open it, it becomes constricted. Therefore, for this reason it should be that the bloodletter holds firmly, and is diligent in all these matters.
Then, place down the one to perform bloodletting.
And if not, then repeatedly do this at another place below that region or above it with pressure: if the location does not allow.
If it does not allow, or if the patient expands, then let him go for one day, or two days: and do not tighten the ligature.
Perhaps it might attract a warm pustule.
Nor should they enter the bath.
Then he may repeat the bloodletting, if desired.
If the opening is small or if the blood flows subtly: and you measure to ensure that no quantity of it escapes from the blood: then repeatedly perform bloodletting at the hole itself according to its direction, and add a little in each operation.
And do this with urgency before the site is sown, for the wound is usually small in many people during surgery.
And if you see it already sown up, then do not proceed over it completely, for there is nothing to excuse before you. And put on top of it something from the fat and oil mixture, because it expedites the flow of blood.
This method is better here than the actual oil itself, and than other types of oil as well.
And similarly administer the oil mixture in all of your bloodlettings, where blood flows out when you puncture veins under prohibition for blood flow. And they do this with a preparation from Tyrian purple and saffron, when it is placed over the spot from one of them.
Blood thickens and breaks up when it is coarse.
If there happens to be a large wound during bloodletting, which often occurs, especially for those who are not bled except through that method or have small openings in veins, then proceed and place on the spot a sponge soaked in water and salt, gently heated: and bind it once: because it dissolves.
And you should do that after the blood has flowed out of the same vein or another vein until its full amount is out.
Indeed, quite often it happens that there are pustules and prominences during bloodletting in the Basilica style.
Therefore place your hand on it, then if you find softness upon pressing it onto itself, then that prominence is bad.
Therefore, take care, as you place upon her (or him) something from what we said.
For perhaps blood flows from it of the artery.
But make a plaster with it where there is hardness, so that the place may harden.
Then take care of it along with the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
And you must take out from every person in their blood according to the strength of its qualities.
And what becomes apparent from the color that reddens over the blood.
For if the blood is black, then let it go until it turns red; and similarly if you see that it is thick: then let it go until it becomes finer; and similarly if it is sharp, until its sharpness is removed.
And it is necessary for the one who is full, strong, and requires blood extraction by means of a single method, so that bloodletting may be increased through the veins, and become transverse: and in the one who is weak, it should be opposite to this.
And it is necessary that he extracts it in various ways, and that there be a tight hole. And better than what is administered in bloodletting through veins is for it to be a crosscut section, not a puncture.
And this method of bloodletting is safe from bleeding and from cutting the nerve. And it is better and more advantageous than bloodletting along its width and length.
And for those who are accustomed to come through bloodletting with scorching (syncopis), it is necessary that before the bloodletting they eat a moderate piece of bread soaked in water with pomegranate juice: or secaniabin if it has been heated. And extract him from his blood in three ways, or four times.
And if the blood is cooled in nature, then before a bloodletting he should take bread infused in mule's milk syrup, or in a syrup sweetened with honey, seasoned with spices, or in an aromatic syrup.
And if there occurs syncope at bloodletting and the cause of his bleeding is many: then it must be that he drinks meat broth, and a subtle aromatic syrup; and uses aromatics with algae and linseeds for rubbing on his chest with this: and makes use of other things which we said in division in chapter syncope from evacuation.
And for those who wish to empty their arm and release their blood again: it must be that he who has bloodletting because of excessive evacuation, and his strength is weak, allows his blood to be released gradually through the amount of strength over consecutive days.
And those who wish to empty their arm and release their blood again, if their body is strong: then do this after seven hours, or nine from their first bloodletting.
And those who wish to draw blood from their body against the side towards which it inclines: it must happen to them on the second day, or on the third.
And in whose body there is already much blood that has been heated and is increasing, causing a fever to occur: it must be that the blood leaves him once through the mouth, and large quantities are extracted from him. And extend the opening until syncope occurs. After you have maintained all conditions of bloodletting, and place your hand on his pulse at the course of the blood so that death does not occur instead of syncope.
Indeed, it often happens like this when the bloodletter doesn't know and falls into negligence.
And it is not necessary when you are trying to relieve the arm and then relieve the blood flow in a second stage, when the vein's opening has already been sealed off, and makes the removal of blood difficult, to press upon it with pressure while in shock, and let the clamp be extended quickly either way.
And that is a great evil, indeed dismiss it, until the second bloodletting occurs.
Or remove with the sharpness of a bloodletting tool that which has coagulated from the blood at the opening of the vein, and place something dissolved in water over it.
And place something from tarragon oil or saffron over it, and put it under gentle compression until the blood comes out.
If indeed there is already an abscess in the vein, then release it, and do not hold it until the abscess subsides.
But if necessity prompts to relieve blood a second time, and there is no excuse, then either use the bloodletting tool over that place, or in the arm at another vein elsewhere.
But for the bloodletting of the arm's vein at the location of Fossa and Basilica, when they are not found and are hidden, because it is made up from them.
And the quality of this bloodletting is such that the sick person should immerse their hand in warm water until it turns red and the vein becomes clearly visible.
Then, when the procedure is carried out, apply pressure with a band not too tight but of moderate size.
Then, the bloodletting tool should be used gradually across (the area), not laterally, nor in the direction of length; and make the opening wide, and have your bloodletting operation so that you apply bloodletting slightly over the stitch on the hand.
And it is indeed placed that the flow of blood in water is numerous during winter time.
And this method of bloodletting is beneficial to all veins since there is no pulsating vein or nerve under it.
The phlebotomy of Saluatella uses the right hand and relieves ailments in the head.
And the quality of this method of phlebotomy is to grip the mahason hand with a ligament or with your own hand after you insert it into warm water until the vein inflates and its presence becomes very evident.
Then perform bloodletting by crossing over the (affected) area.
And if you hit it completely, that will not harm him in any way.
And preserve, do not withdraw your hand with the bloodletting instrument.
Underneath it, there are exposed nerves from the flesh of the fingers.
Then repeatedly put your hand into warm water and let the blood flow in that.
For if you do not repeat it in warm water, the blood will clot in the vein's opening and prevent its flow.
So when you have extracted the amount necessary from the blood, then place oil and salt over the vein: so that it does not harden quickly.
And similarly you should do with every tightly bound branch.
The reduction of the blood of his phlebotomy however from his left hand, is: because it is conveying to the spleen's discomforts: and similarly perform the phlebotomy of him, as you performed in the second equally.
The reduction of the blood of his phlebotomy related to the veins, is for the discomforts which are in the lower part of the body, such as the discomforts of the uterus, and retention of menstrual flow, and malfunctions of the kidneys, and old sores on the thighs and legs, and similar ailments.
And the quality of his bloodletting is that the ill man should immerse his foot in hot water: and he should perform a rubbing over it until the veins are abundant: and tie above the cut on the foot with lint.
Indeed, the site of the veins is at the heel, facing the big toe: and they branch out from it into the face of the foot many branches.
Therefore, bloodletting should be performed in the larger branch of it, or at the heel in its aggregation: because this is better and safer.
If bloodletting were performed on the face of the foot, then beware of the nerves that are beneath it on the surface of the foot.
And suppose your bloodletting in which you perform the bloodletting from obliquely, as if you are trying to hit it: and let the bloodletting be called Neshil.
If however the flow of blood is obstructed, then immerse his foot in warm water: and let the blood flow into that, until it is discharged.
If the bloodletter misses the vein in the first attempt, then he should proceed with the bloodletting to the upper part little by little, for there is safety, and you do not expect evil from it when you avoid the nerves as we said.
And similarly when the Saphenous vein of the other foot is equal.
The location of the Sciatic veins, as we have said, is at the heel from the inside of the leg.
The effectiveness of bloodletting in such cases is when there is pain in the heel, which occurs due to warm blood.
The quality of bloodletting in this case is to allow the sick person to enter into a bath and warm it up gradually. Then draw on his leg from the side of the heel up to above the ankle by four fingers, using a long thin needle; for it can only be seen because of that reason.
When it appears then according to any ability you can do it, or according to the reflux: it is better either if you make an incision at that point or cut through it.
Its location is helpful, and this vein is very hidden in many people.
If you do not find it and it does not appear at all to the touch, then use bloodletting on one of its branches. The one that appears is on the back of the foot and towards the ear region. Be careful around nerves and make the bleeding from the blood as much as you wish.
Then release the constriction and place leather over the site of bloodletting, and tighten the area.
Indeed, it heals quickly.
¶ On the operation of the wind and its quality for use.
Chapter 48.
Winds occur from the horns and from air, and from wind.
And indeed, Wind Action happens in two ways.
One method involves scarification and the extraction of blood: and there is wind action without scarification. This 'V通风' which is without incision, operates in two ways.
And indeed it is with fire.
Or it is without fire.
And the types of ventilation that involve incision and bloodletting occur at fourteen places on the body.
There are fourteen places on the body to which these types of ventilation can be applied: One is Ventosatio Alnocrati, which is at the very back of the head; one is Alkehel, which is in the middle of the neck; there are two Alhagdahim ventilations, each corresponding to a pair of cervical laminae simultaneously; one is Vientosae menti, located under the jawbone near the lower part of the mouth; there are two shoulder blade ventilations; one is Vientosae Alachosos at the end of the tail; there are two lung ventitations, each situated in the middle of both arms; there are two leg ventilations; and finally, there are two kidney ventilations.
And indeed, the process of ventilation does not draw out a little blood from minute punctures in your flesh. Because of this, its power does not escape from them as happens with bloodletting.
Nor is it necessary that ventilation, either with fire or without it, be administered when conditions arise due to fullness (diseases), until the entire body has been cleansed.
If necessity prompts us to apply ventilation due to illness or by custom, we administer it at all times during the beginning of the month, at its end, and in its middle, as well as at any other time that occurs.
This is because there are people who when the blood increases within them until it needs to be drained through ventilation, they find a heaviness and dizziness in their head.
And there are those who find fullness and redness on their face, head, and neck.
And there are those who find itching on their face and forehead, as well as darkness and confusion in their eyes.
And there are those who tremble at the place of their windpipe. And there is one whose laughter is multiplied.
And there are those who find the taste of blood in their mouth: or they may be troubled with their tongue and it might be that blood is expelled.
And there is one whose sleep is multiplied.
And there are those who see blood and redness, slain people and wounds, and things similar to these in their sleep. So when we see something from them, and particularly if it occurs on the third day of the month: we then predict that the windpipe will start to function again after passing through two or three hours. The discomfort of the windpipe at the back of the neck is as follows: it tends to increase in the head and what flows out reaches the eyes.
