O, my children, since I have completed this book for you, which is the final work on the science of medicine, achieving its goal at the end, and through its explanations and declarations, it seems to me that I should complement [it] with a treatise about manual practice, which is called surgery.
Because manual practice is neglected in our region and in our time, to the point where it barely exists, and its knowledge and remnants are suppressed; what remains of it can only be found as a few small descriptions in the books of the Ancients, which most people have distorted, leading them into error and uncertainty while their understanding is obscured and their skill and art degenerate.
It seems necessary to me that I should revive it through the method of explanation and clarification, as well as by describing its tools in detail; both those used for cauterization and other instruments required for such work - this is needed so that people may understand these implements' shapes and forms, as part of the preparatory process.
The reason why we lack good medical practitioners in our time is that the art of medicine demands a broad knowledge base: its practitioner must first be well-versed in anatomy, which encompasses an understanding of bodily structures and their functions; how various parts are connected or separated from one another; as well as an awareness about bones, nerves, tendons - their numbers and arrangements - along with veins (both pulsating and static), and the locations where they emerge.
And for this reason, Hippocrates says that it has a great name but small impact in practice, especially in the art of medicine.
We have already mentioned this in the introduction of this book; for whoever is not aware of what we have said about anatomy will not be relieved from falling into error, which has caused the deaths of many people, just as I have witnessed with those who are educated in this science but disregard both their knowledge and experience.
I saw a foolish and inexperienced doctor make an incision on the neck of a woman to drain a swollen abscess; he cut some arteries in her neck, causing great bleeding until she died from his hands.
I saw another doctor who was about to make an incision on the stomach of a man suffering from stones in his bladder; the stone was big, but he made the incision and extracted it with a piece of the bladder, causing that man's death three days later.
I was once called to extract one of those stones and I saw that due to the size of the stone and the condition of the patient, I knew he would die.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
And then you untie him according to his wishes, and then you rest, and after some days you let us untie the bandages; and he will be like this until the thigh and foot ulcers are cured, and he recovers.
And I was called to him, and I prepared to untie the bandages, and as a result, he experienced tranquility and relief from his pains.
However, the decay had already set in within the member, which I could not stop; and the decay kept spreading throughout the member until the patient was in danger.
I saw another physician who lanced a cancerous abscess; it became an ulcer after some days and increased the suffering of the patient's lord.
Which is due to the fact that a black cauterization is made of melancholic humor; so it's not surprising that it turns into something iron-like in its entirety but rather remains limited to the affected member.
And for this reason, my children, it is necessary for you to consider the operation in two ways: one which brings healing and health, and another that carries danger in its most important aspects.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
And therefore, take up your arms with solicitude and protection from God, and treat your patients with ease and steadfastness.
Use the best course of action with God's grace for their well-being and praiseworthy recovery; leave behind those terrible illnesses that are difficult to cure. Keep your arms away from what causes you fear, so that doubt does not diminish your faith or reputation: For it is more glorious to remain steadfast in your honor and integrity, both here on earth and in the eyes of your holiness.
A scholar had once said in his teachings: Do not treat dangerous illnesses, lest you be known as bad doctors.
And I have divided this book into three chapters.
The division of the book begins, and first in the first part: The first chapter is ordered according to the feet, their different instruments and tools for cauterization, as well as all that is required during surgery.
The division of the second chapter. The second chapter, about dryness and puncturing, cupping, wounds, and the extraction of arrows or similar objects, with everything well-ordered regarding the forms of instruments.
The third chapter, about restoration and dislocation, and the treatment of twists or similar injuries; this chapter is ordered regarding the head to feet, and the forms of instruments.
Cover that I describe the quality of the iron for this cautery and its accompanying instruments, and in which circumstances it is forbidden to use cauterization.
Therefore I say that the sermon on the quality of the iron for cauterization and its instruments is long and prolix, subtle in its science, and secretively hidden; great multitudes of wise men have spoken of it, and they are disagreed amongst themselves, so a small part of their sermons suffices for me, lest I prolong this too much.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
Here is the translation of each line:
And one should say that whoever says the opposite of this, that cauterization is beneficial for all chronic and dry illnesses that affect the body's humors, because when you compare the human body to fire, you find the body humid.
And I say this based on the words of that person, because I have already experienced it myself several times.
However, it is not appropriate for someone who has already been tried and tested in the chapter on cauterization through previous practice, and understands the variety of human constitutions and the location of diseases within their bodies, as well as the causes of those diseases, and the progression over time.
In other constitutions, you should not be afraid, especially in cases of cold and humid illnesses, as all doctors have agreed upon this and there is no disagreement among them about the benefits of using cauterization for such ailments.
Know, my sons, that the secret of healing through cauterization with fire and its effectiveness lies in the use of caustic medicine. This is because fire is a simple element, and its action only affects the part being cauterized without significantly harming any adjacent body parts.

Furthermore, the use of excessive cautery is justified by its speed in action, the strength of its therapeutic effect, and the greatness of its lord.
It is possible that the illness may return at some point in time depending on the constitution of the patient, the location and nature of their ailment, and their overall health, as well as any underlying conditions or excesses present within them, and the types of food and lifestyle factors they engage in; however, if the illness being treated with cauterization is a subtle one affecting a member that has few excesses and humidities, such as toothache and similar pains, it is likely that the pain will not return after cauterization, especially when done on a small scale.
The common saying is that cauterization is the last resort in medicine, and this is a true statement according to those who understand it; they believe it to be so because there are no other cures or remedies available besides medicine and cautery itself.
The reason for this is contrary to what one might think; the intention behind calling cauterization the last resort of medicine is not absolute, but rather it refers to specific cases where other methods of treatment and medicines have been tried first without success, and only at the end of this process does one administer cautery as a means to achieve cure. And here it is important to note that cauterization is the last resort of medicine, not according to the intention of those who are uneducated or foolish doctors.
The ancient practitioners said that cauterization with gold is better than that done with iron, and they said this due to the purity of gold and its sublime nature.
They also said that the place of cauterization does not weaken the arm, but this is not entirely true, as I have proven and found that it only has this effect on certain bodies and not others. Cauterization with gold is good and better than iron, just as they claimed; however, when you use gold for cautery, remember that it must be declared [to the authorities], as it can be stolen according to its quantity due to the value of gold, and because it prepares one to receive an illness. And if you put gold into a fire, it will melt due to the heat, and there may be some flakes in the fire which the artisan could collect for their own benefit.
And thus, for this reason, one must do the cauterization with iron in a lighter and more precise manner to ensure the accuracy of the operation.
I have already arranged this chapter on cauterization according to the chapters [preceding it], and I have placed those concerning the feet within the scope of this chapter so that the reader can easily find what they seek.
The first chapter.
This cauterization procedure provides relief from excessive moisture and coldness in the brain, which are two underlying causes of many traumatic conditions often referred to as *corissa*. These conditions can include head bleeding, discharge from the ears and eyes, frequent sleep disturbances, toothaches, and throat pain. Moreover, this treatment is universally applicable for all ailments caused by coldness, including paralysis, strokes, and similar illnesses.
The procedure for this cauterization is as follows: First, instruct the patient to take a laxative medicine that will empty their bowels three or four nights in advance. The specific time frame should be determined based on the patient's health condition, age, and usual habits.
Then, ask the patient to shave their head with a razor and have them sit on a chair or bench with their arms raised and resting on their own legs.
And then, place the edge of your palm gently on top of their nose between their eyes. However, once your middle finger has reached the desired spot, mark that area with a tent. Then, prepare the olive-shaped cautery, which should have this shape:" [Here, please describe or provide an image of the shape referenced.]
And then place that over the marked spot with caution, in such a way that it descends gradually, and your hand will be forced to move away from it little by little as you turn it.
And then gently lift your hand and look at the spot; if you see any part of the bone or skull already exposed to view along with some amount of gray matter, raise your hand and, without returning it to that same iron instrument, use another one that has been cooled while being seen by others what I have told you.
And then take some salt and dissolve it on the spot, leaving it for three days.
And then place on it some frozen cotton soaked in vinegar, leaving it until the burn scar is destroyed. Then treat the wound with tetrapharmakon ointment until it heals.
And it has been said that when the Roman plague breaks out, the arm gets better so quickly because it is more beneficial and healing.
And some of them say that the ulcer should be cauterized to the bone and that the cautery should be held in place until a part of the surface layer of the bone is burnt.
And then remove this which adheres to the bone, and it shall be cured.
Other doctors say that the cautery should be applied to the back part of the bone and it must press strongly against the bone until the bone gives way. This is the form of a small lancet: They believe that from this place, vapours escape from the head.
If the wound is left open for too long, it will be cured only after consolidation.
I have not seen these two types of cautery being used anywhere except in rare cases due to fear; however, I consider that, overall, it is better for health because the head becomes weakened by the solution of its continuity as we mentioned before regarding other body parts and especially when the patient's head has a hot nature.
The first type of cautery is safer and better in my opinion, and I use this method to promote health.
It seems that you are referencing the second chapter or section of your treatise. Please provide more context if you'd like me to continue translating! I am ready whenever you are.
Of the cautery for the head.
When severe and long-lasting head pain occurs in a patient and all methods of treatment are exhausted, such as wars, cocks, cataplasms, emplasters, poultices, baths, pigeons, chicken eggs, and similar remedies, especially if cauterization has already been performed with a cautery that did not benefit the patient nor alleviate any of those causes; then consider whether the patient's head is of strong constitution in its nature; it is not cold and presents great heat, then cauterize again with another cautery below the previous one. Then cauterize that spot above their ear with a divided (hot) iron. Incise the vein and expose the bone in the amount we have described; then cauterize it with a divided iron behind the head in the spot called the fossa, which is where the cupping glass is applied. And be careful with your hand in this procedure; do not expose the bone, as the patient will feel great pain different from that of other cauterizations on the head.
And I will place this cautery in its proper position, for the cautery with which you cauterize the horns of the head and the occiput is a more subtle cautery than that used to cauterize the middle part of the head; and this is its shape.
Chapter three.
On the cauterization of new hemorrhoids.
When pain starts at the base of the skull or extends behind the eyes, treat it with medicines that clear the head and administer other cures I have mentioned for various illnesses; if all is ineffective, then proceed to cauterization in two ways: either cauterize with sharp burning medicine, or with iron.
The first type of cautery using burning medicine is when you take a piece of garlic, peel it, and cut off the tips on both ends. Then make an incision in the pain site on the temple with a lancet inserted at a point where it is done below the hairline but hidden.
Then press down on it with a wad of cotton to stanch the flow and leave it there for three hours; then remove the garlic and apply the residue for two or three days, after which place on the site an oak gall soaked in vinegar until the wound closes.
And then treat him with ointment until he is healed.
And if you wish, make some caustic medicines for him, which I have written about in the second chapter of my treatise on caustic remedies.
The cauterization with iron should be performed in this manner: ignite the following type of cautery...
It is called the claw-hammer, as its head has the shape of a nail with some curvature, and in its middle part there is a small prominence.
Then place it over the painful area, hold your hand - so that the arch does not adhere below - and turn the iron slowly but swiftly.
And if the amount of it that sticks to the skin is as much as half a nut, raise your hand so that the artery below does not adhere and thus prevent any blood flow.
Then soak cotton in salt water and place it on the area for three days. After that, apply moistened cotton with ointment until he is healed.
And if you cauterize at the tip of the ulna nerve according to the [type] of cautery, and be careful not to cut the artery in this not-so old embolism.
Chapter four.
On the cauterization of old embolism.
When you treat an old embolism with what we have said about the previous treatment and what has been mentioned in the divisions of diseases, and if the treatment is not effective due to a disease that does not respond adequately to the first cauterization using medicine or fire cauterization, then it becomes necessary for you to ignite a cuticular [?] cautery until it becomes white, because this signifies the location of pain along the length of half a finger width, or whatever that is; and place your hand on it once and firmly press down while inserting the bowstring and preventing any movement.
However, it is necessary for you to be mindful of the continuation of the jaw, which is weakened by chewing, and that the lizard [?] muscle must not be adhered and the nerve that moves it, lest a spasm occurs.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
And I will come back to the recollection of the regimen for accidental blood flux from archery according to its way, in its place within this book.
And if you see that this disease is not yet ready for the cautery and observe that the patient's body can tolerate it, cauterize them on the top of their head as we have described earlier, and treat the wound until it is healed.
And if you want to apply the cautery we mentioned in the chapter on archery wounds with two irons (scissors), this is the better and more suitable method of cauterization.
Chapter 5: On Treating Wounds from Gunshots and Archery with Cautery and Medicines
On the cauterization of ear pain.
When there is pain in the ear due to moisture and it is treated with laxative substances and other remedies as mentioned in the previous chapter, but the pain persists, then apply the cautery known as 'puncta', which has this form:
Then make the 'puncta' on the affected area, and move the ignited iron around the entire ear as if you were drawing a circle, or focus on each individual part if the pain is localized. Along with you hold the cautery of the root of the ear little by little more than having marked the place with smoke.
And if all the points in the ear are cauterized, as well as those that have been pricked, then treat the places until they are healed.
It seems you are referring to chapter 6 of this medieval medical treatise. Can I assist with translating any further text?
On the cauterization of torture.
Turtura la cual es curada e am cauterizacio no es sino de las specias las cuales vienen per flecma, segun que havem dit en las divisios de las malautias.
Esquiva cauterizacio de la specia que endeve per siccacio o per spasme del nervi.
When you treat that type of torture with diuretics and purgatives and rinsings, and your treatment does not work, it is then necessary to cauterize the patient with three cauteries: The first should be at the root of their ear, the second just below their temple, and the third at the junction of two lips.
Place your cautery on the opposite side of the affected area, for relief will only come from the seemingly healthy part.
The way to perform the cauterization is as follows: With one cautery, burn the topmost point of the ear, just above the horn; with another, target an area on their temple, the length of which should be no longer than a finger's width. Hold your hand over the cautery until half a codenait of skin has been consumed by the flame.
The shape of this cautery is like that of the butcher's knife; its blade is flat. Yet it is more delicate than that, requiring only a small amount of flesh to be cut away in order for its superfluous thickness to diminish somewhat.
Then treat the wound with something that is freshly processed until it has healed.
Capitol .vii.: Chapter 7.
De cauterizacio de apoplextia antiqua: On cauterization for old stroke (or seizure).
When apoplexy is old and you have treated it with what we have mentioned before but the patient has no fever, then cauterize them with four cauteries: on all corners of their head; with a cautery in the middle of the head, as we said before; and another one at the nape. The way of using the cautery is done as previously described.
He has already been cauterized on the stomach area; this is done later; then treat him with what proceeds.
Chapter 8.
About the cauterization of forgetfulness done with flame.
Give the patient at the beginning big bowls and pills of fresh cheese.
Then shave the entire head of the patient and place on his nape a plaster as described in the treatise of plasters.
And leave it for some time; that is how the cauterization is done. Do this in the order previously mentioned by me.
So if it heals him well by doing this; and if not, then do three cauterizations on the back of their head, which will go from above to below. Place between each cauterization the thickness of a finger, and then take care to do the cautery with what has been provided.
If you notice an increase in the disease and the patient tolerates it well, then do the cauterization on their forehead; but if there is a more severe increase, cauterize over both temples.
Then take care of them until they heal; and let the cauterization be olive-shaped, as previously described.
It seems that you are referring to chapter 9 in this treatise. Would you like me to translate any other text?
On the cauterization of parasites, and on softening all the body.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
Under severe conditions of heart softening and associated diseases in which the patient is very ill, use four pointed cauteries on their vertebrae, then follow up with cautery through an incision made by a sharp object near the navel, and lift his other hand. Then treat them after they have healed with olive oil cautery.
Chapter 10.
On the cauterisation of epilepsy.
Do not cauterise an epileptic unless their epilepsy is caused by phlegm.
You must change the patient's brain from the beginning with years of herbs and other treatment, as we said in the section when the patient is severe and intolerant to medicines.
If the child does not tolerate medicines, then give them gargles and chews that change their brains, for several days beforehand, with beneficial food.
Then shave the patient's head and cauterise them with one cautery on the top of their head as previously described; another on their occipital bone, and others on each corner of their head. Here is the translation of the first sentence:
And it should be treated with olive oil cautery as previously described.
If the patient is a child, then use gentle cautery in this manner.
I can provide a translation for you if you provide me with the text from this chapter or its contents.
Concerning the cauterization of melancholy."
When the causes of melancholy are corrupted moisture and weakness in the body, then cauterize it with the cautery we mentioned earlier for paralysis.
And if the cause of melancholy is an excess that leads to this condition, and the patient's body is humid, then give them a drink to cleanse their brain according to the instructions given in the previous section.
Then shave the patient's head, and make a decently-sized pigeon tail above their circle of hair, then place it in the middle of their scalp.
If the patient is sixty years old and is suffering from all four types [of melancholy].
Then apply the ointment, and it is more worthy to use old sheep fat for this purpose. And heat it up over the fire to warm it up moderately, which is said to be tolerated by the patient when applied. Then place it in the middle of their head on the circle, leaving it there until it cools down.
Do this to the patient once a week until they are healed; or you can perform another treatment on them if you wish, using small punctures according to their needs, but make sure your hand holds an ordered cautery like this one: this is a type of cautery that moistens the brain equally.
And then place that swollen elbow in butter or goose grease.
The number XII in Roman numerals is 12, so this may refer to chapter twelve of the treatise. However, I cannot provide an accurate translation or interpretation without the corresponding text. Can you provide me with the relevant information for Chapter 12?
Regarding the cauterization of descending aqueous humor in the eye."
When you have identified the onset of water in the heel through the signs I mentioned earlier (in an earlier section), then start and give the patient to drink that which changes his head (presumably a liquid medication), and protect him from all humidity.
And let him sit in a warm bath for a few days.
Then instruct him to shave his head and cauterize that spot with a single cautery on the top of his head; or if there is an onset of water in both heels then use two cauteries on two temples, or one if it's just on one heel.
Lacerate with a cautery all the veins and arteries which are underneath the chain (of wounds); and let these cauterizations be made at that distance from the top of his head, towards where his temples would be.
And be careful of blood flows when you are cauterizing him; and if you see any blood flowing from the wounds, stop it with whatever medicine is available to you.
I will come with the knowledge of extracting arteries, as well as removing them and stopping blood flows.  I hope this text was of assistance!  Please let me know if you would like me to continue translating any more of these lines for you.
And sometimes it is cauterized at the neck below the jawbone with two newly made cauteries.
It seems you are referring to chapter 13 of this medieval medical text. Is there anything else I can help clarify or translate for you from this document? Feel free to provide additional context!
Concerning the cauterization of old tears."
When tears from the eyes are old and frequent, flowing through veins and arteries located in an apparent place on the head, it is verified that this is due to superfluous phlegmatic humors. Then cauterize this with a cautery, as we mentioned at the beginning of the chapter regarding hot water for the eyes, with one cautery in the middle of the head and two each below both temples and below both bones. And if there is a need for addition, then cauterize it in all places on the tail of the eye above the end of the eyebrow with a small cautery.
Chapter 14.
On the cauterization of bad smell from the nose.
When you treat it with what we have mentioned in the division and your treatment does not benefit the patient, then prepare and give them to drink the pills for three nights; then shave their head and cauterize them with a small olea-shaped cautery. Then cauterize it with two *clavus*-shaped cauteries, each slightly below the hairs of both eyebrows.
And be careful with the arrow so as not to break it.
As for the pointed cautery, this is its shape.
Chapter 15.
Regarding the softening cautery for the eyelids of owls.
When the owl's eyelid is softened due to illness or humidity, treat it with this lunar-shaped cautery; and this is its form:
And if you wish to treat it above the two eyebrows with a small one in multiple pieces, and they extend from the temples. And its length should be proportionate to the quantity of eyebrow.
And do not press your hand too hard on the cautery, but rather according to how much of the eyelid's skin is attached.
Chapter 16.
Regarding the eyelid of an owl when its feathers have turned into multiple parts within the fist of the owl.
When the scabs on the sore are separated from those underneath so that it can be touched, they are cauterized in two ways: either with fire or with caustic medicine.
If you use a cautery of fire to treat it, instruct the patient to clean their scabs just as those who wash them do, making sure they are prolonged and moist; if you have to apply this treatment to their nose, then you should bind his wounds with a bandage so that he is not bothered while the scabs form.
Once they are formed and moistened, place the patient's head on your knee, then mark their eyelids with a sign, which is shaped like the leaf of a myrtle tree, starting the mark near the scabs.
And then apply hot cotton soaked in owl's albumen or mothball extract on the wound.
Then ignite the following type of cautery.
Then cauterize over the figure you have marked, little by little, with small visible dots, making sure that the surface of the area resembling a myrtle leaf is completely burnt.
And a sign of healing from the wound is that you see the patient's eyelid contract and his hair stand up after the puncture.
Therefore, lift your hand and leave him like that for three days, then place a splint on his arm until the fracture is healed. Then treat her with ointment until she is cured.
If the hair grows back for any reason and the eyelid becomes soft, then perform cauterization on it again as you did initially.
If the hair is still on the eyelid, then cauterize it until it rises to its natural place and is level with the skin, ensuring that the hair does not hurt the eye.
If the cauterization with an absorbent medicine is what you want the patient to pluck out his hair until they are lengthened and leveled, then make a cloth bandage in the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Then take one ounce of known and living white gall, or what you call it, then mix these two ingredients well, and do this with haste so that it does not cool; then spread this over the cloth bandage which is shaped like a myrtle leaf, and place it on one or both eyes; then place the patient's head on a pillow stuffed with goose down, and let his head be in your lap.
And place your finger on the medicine and press it gently, being careful not to harm the patient before they feel the warmth of the medication, for this sensation is like fire burning within them.
So when you perceive that the patient has felt this burning sensation, then remove the medicine and wipe it away with your finger; once the burning sensation subsides, take out the medication and wash the area with water. Then, examine whether the eyelid is raised as if washed, and you must apply a compress of hot towels or make an incision - whichever you deem necessary for the treatment to be successful. If not, repeat the application of medicine on the same spot where you have not pressed it before, being mindful that your operation should not be discredited.
Then apply a bandage over the wound to ensure that any infection is eradicated from the adhesive surface; thereafter, treat it with an ointment or another medicine so that it may heal.
It is essential that you pay close attention to your operation and ensure that none of the medication falls into the eye; if after a few days the eyelid becomes softened and any hairs cause discomfort in the eye, then repeat the medicine on this area of the eyelid as you did initially, and then have them rest so it may heal.
E aquesta es la forma de fuelha de mirtra.
And know that men's bodies are diversified according to their size and smallness, and thus your treatment should be tailored accordingly.
And do not hide the way of learning from him who studies this art.
This is likely indicating that you have reached Chapter 17 in your translation process or indicating an upcoming chapter, depending on the context of the original text.
Regarding the cauterization of a fistula in the tear duct of the eye.
When you treat a fistula with the methods we have discussed in previous chapters and it does not respond to your treatment, then you must cauterize it using this method: instruct the patient to rest their head on your lap, and let one of your assistants hold their head gently between their hands so as to not cause discomfort or agitation.
Then place the cauterizing tool, either made of silver or hair, on their eye.
And now ignite the cautery which has this shape:" (Here it is likely that there would be an accompanying illustration or description of the tool's shape.)
Which is concave, like the shape of a cane or an eagle's feather, with the cauterizing tip at one end.
And if you go, penetrate into the other extremity. And if you want to get out, do so as quickly as possible.
However, that which is concave is better for this operation.
Then press on the open fistula and try to extract any unhealthy or moist matter from it. And if it is not open, then make an incision to remove the hardened matter.
Then place over it the well-lit cautery, and hold your hand near but not touching the cautery from below the nose, so as to avoid burning yourself or troubling the patient, then apply the cautery to the gray part of the wound and destroy that area.
And so if at the beginning of your cauterization process you perceive a hissing sound, it is good; and if not, then repeat the cauterization once or twice if necessary; leave it like that for three days, and then place cotton around it and cover with drying ointment until healed.
But if eleven days have passed and it is not healed, then apply a strong corrosive medicine to uncover the bone and scrape according to what is appropriate in this chapter.

And let the cavity of their body be according to the sharpness of the knife.
Then place this edge carefully into the cracks until the cautery reaches the bottom of them.
And then treat it with ointment until it is healed.

On the cauterization of teeth and the softening of veins.
When the veins are softened due to moisture and the teeth are decayed, and you treat them with medicines but it does not work, then place the patient's head in your lap, and prepare the cautery tool with its shape as will be described below, so that you can insert the rod into the tooth. Be sure to hold it slightly above until the patient feels the heat of the fire reach the root of the tooth.
Then lift your hand, and repeat the process with the cautery tool several times as you see fit.
Then the patient should rinse their mouth with salty water and keep it there for an hour, after which they should spit it out, as the decayed tooth is now sealed, the softened gum is tightened, and the corrupting moisture has been dried up.
Chapter 21.
De cauterisacio de dolor de dent."
When tooth pain is caused by coldness or when there is a chill or worm in it, and you cannot cure it with medicine, then cauterization can be done in two ways: either with cow's horn cautery or with fire.
Cow's horn cautery involves taking a piece of cow's horn and boring it with an iron rod. Then, take the heated horn and wrap it around the tip of the probe. Next, immerse the heated horn in water to cool it down quickly. Finally, place this cooled horn directly onto the painful tooth promptly until it is thoroughly chilled.
Repeat this process several times until the healing properties of fire reach the root of the tooth.
If you want, immerse wool or a cotton swab in the cow's horn cautery liquid and place it on the painful tooth. Then, apply a heated iron rod onto that until the iron reaches the inner cavity of the tooth.
However, when performing fire cauterization, be mindful of any boils or ulcers in the patient's body and ensure that the intensity of the fire does not reach their mouth.
Shape the cautery tool accordingly, place it on the tooth and hold your hand over it until the tool is thoroughly cooled. Perform this process multiple times, as the pain may return either that day or the next.
And now, the patient should fill their mouth with good saliva due to the impression of that cautery, and hold it there for an hour then spit it out; this is how the cauterization process works.
Cauterize any extremity that you observe, as is feasible for you to do so.
This is how the cannula should be shaped:
The Roman numeral XXII indicates that this is Chapter 22 of the treatise or medical text. Is there another line or sentence you would like me to translate?
On the cauterization of external hemorrhoids.
When hemorrhoids are caused by excess phlegm and cold humors, and they do not respond well to treatment with medicine but you observe a slight improvement in their digestion, then use this type of cautery which has two open ends so that the smoke can escape from one end while the other end is placed on the hemorrhoid. Apply it once and if necessary, repeat the process until you reach the root of the hemorrhoid.
If the hemorrhoid is small, adjust the size of the cautery accordingly and leave it for three days, placing a cotton wad soaked in saliva over it until it has healed from the fire's burn." Is there another portion of text you would like assistance with?
And then treat him with ointments, compresses, and clean beddings until he is healed.
This indicates that this is Chapter 23.
On the cauterization of vocal cords and the treatment of narrow airways.
When humidity affects the lungs, especially when it is caused by a cold complexion, it is necessary to evacuate the patient at the beginning with laxative medicines, and then cauterize that part which is affected near the throat.
Be careful not to bring the cautery too close to the throat or burn its membrane, only slightly.
Cauterize that part with another cautery tool near the joint of the neck in the back of his spine. Let the cauterization be clamped following the previous method.
And then treat him with what has been prescribed before he is healed.
Chapter 24."
De cauterizacion del malautia del pulmón y la tos. (On the cauterization for lung disease and cough.)
When cough and lung disease are caused by excess humidity, and the patient has no fever or sputum production, and it is an old illness, then cauterize with two cauteries on the furcula (collarbone) in the areas below the lions (clavicle) and bumps; and with another cautery in the middle of the foot between two mammilla. The cautery should be pointed as described before.
And if you wish, your cauterization can be done by puncturing with the cautery called "puncta," the shape of which was described earlier in the section on treating ear pain.
If you make punctures in those places, then treat the patient with what was mentioned earlier to be put inside for healing.
And once the cautery has three handles, you can make three cauterizations with it in this manner:
Chapter 25.
On the cauterization of titillic, which is the head of the humerus bone.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
Then ignite the cautery with two heads; this is its form:
Then cauterize the vein until it penetrates that (vein) on the other side; the figure of the cauterization will be with two heads.
And sometimes it is appropriate to do so according to this count, because there are eight cauteries."
And then place on the cautery some salt, and let the patient remain calm, ensuring that their limb is not disturbed for any length of time until it is healed.
If the dislocation is in their upper limbs and this has been done thus far, then cauterize over the muscle with a hooked cautery or several pointed cauteries, for the joint will be confirmed, the humidity expelled, and the patient cured.
This appears to indicate that this is the 26th chapter of the text. Is there another sentence you would like me to translate?
On the cauterization of the stomach.
When inflammation occurs in the stomach due to excess moisture that has penetrated and multiplied within it, and if you continue with the cure without confirming (its progress), then let the patient lie on their back, extending their arms and legs; now cauterize it with three cauteries: one under their feet for a finger's length using a hooked cautery, and two more on either side of this one, such that they form a triangular shape of cauteries; ensure there is enough space between them to allow the pus to drain.
And if the depth of the cauterization is equal to twice the thickness of a coin.
And let the shape of the cautery be in this additional form. If you wish, cauterize with a larger cautery on the middle part of the stomach according to this form; and this will be a cautery shaped as a circle based on this shape:
And the stomach is cauterized by applying this method to those who fear such a treatment: you should mark the stomach with pricking, as much as desired using a needle, and then cauterize those points with the cautery; afterwards, treat them with the cure that precedes until they are healed.
It seems like you may have provided an additional line or sentence from the medieval medical treatise. Could you please provide the full text or indicate where this line breaks off so I can accurately continue the translation?
On the cauterization of the liver in a cold constitution."
When the kidneys suffer pain due to coldness or moisture or excessive flatulence which has disturbed their normal condition by excess expulsion, and the patient is cured with what we have said above but does not recover, then it is appropriate that the patient be placed on his back, and you must apply three cauterizations according to this form and size [of the kidney] beneath the hypochondrium, as for the male.
And let the space between each cautery be equal to the width of a finger, and let the length of the cauterization correspond to the straight length of the body.
And do not press down on the cautery with too much force.
And if the size of what is adhered is half the size of a cow's udder or less and there is more to be done; and if the patient is standing on their feet; but if not, then have them sit down with legs outstretched and raise their arms.
And for you, it is possible to cauterize these wounds with a knife-like cautery when your skill and wisdom in the art are refined.
And be cautious not to overdo the cauterization process, ensuring that the cautery is adhered properly throughout the entire procedure so as not to harm any internal organs, for this method requires precision; understand this.
The Roman numeral "xxviii" represents the number 28 in our numerical system. It is commonly used to indicate chapters or sections within books, documents, or treatises like this medieval medical text.
De perforacio de apostema del fietge am cauteri." translates to "For the drainage of abscesses in the liver, use a pointed cautery.
Quan endeve excitura o apostema en le fietge e voles saber si aquel apostema es en le carn del fietge o en la tunica de lu, lahoras si es en la carn del fietge, le malaute atrobo gravitat e dolor ses acuitat." translates to "When an abscess occurs in the liver and you want to determine whether it is within the flesh of the liver or its membrane, if it's within the liver's flesh, the patient will suffer more severe pain and their condition will deteriorate.
E si es en la tunica del fietge, am la dolor es acuitat gran e vezes que ja afatiguatz les metges la cura de lu." translates to "And if it is in the membrane of the liver, there will also be great pain and sometimes doctors become fatigued trying to treat such cases.
Donc cove que·l malaute sia enversat sobre la sieua cervit; e aprop senha le loc de l’apostema am tenta; e aprop igneys le cauteri le quel es asemblat a rag, la forma del qual a precedit en l’autra pagina." translates to "So have the patient lie on their back and face up; then find the location of the abscess with your fingers; next apply the cautery which is shaped like a rake, its form was described in the previous page. E cauteriza am aquel i cauteri entro que tota la codena sia comborida, entro que pervengua al ciphac, entro qu’en yesca sania." translates to "Cauterize with this rake-like instrument until the entire area is cauterized, so that it reaches the depths of the abscess and fully heals.
And then treat him with cures for other skin diseases until he is healed.
You should not use this form of cautery unless you are well-versed in the art of medicine and have encountered various illnesses; although I have taken risks with this operation several times, nevertheless, we must make it gentler and more harmless.
Chapter 29.
On the cauterization of scabies.
The ancient doctors said that the cautery of the roots should be done for scabies in this way, and it is this that you take from the dry roots of wormwood: take a root as long as your finger, and let it be as thick as your finger.
Then immerse it in oil and harden it over the fire, and then cauterize with a single large cautery at that place which is between the end of the neck and the back; and with two small cauteries let there be one on each side near to where the beard begins, and two more cauteries below these, somewhat declining towards the rear; and another cautery in the middle of the chest; and another over the stomach, and three behind; and a single one in that place which is between both shoulders, and two cauteries on either side of the foot with the one between the shoulders.
And do not place your hand on the cautery, instead keep it steady while performing the procedure.
Some ancient scholars say that there are some men who use an iron cautery resembling a ray and ignite it; they place this in the area located between the ribs, so as to reach the abscess and draw out the pus, just like we mentioned for the abscess on the liver.
There is no need to fear this cautery perforation procedure as it does not cause harm; however, an accidental injury may occur if the cautery enters and creates a fistula in an area without proper healing.
Chapter 30.
On the cauterization of the forehead.
When you treat the patient's forehead disease using what we have mentioned about the division treatment and it does not improve, then use a cautery on them in three ways, all of which are correct: one way is to make three or four lines of cauterizations along the length of the forehead according to the shape of the liver cauterization that was described previously.
And each cautery should be the thickness of a finger or slightly more, and the shape of the cautery should be the same as we mentioned for the liver cautery.
Do not place your hand on the cautery; let the patient lie down on their back.
There is another way to cauterize, which is by igniting the cautery with two cords, as we have mentioned in the chapter on muscle dislocation. Raise the patient's arm, which is opposite the affected side.
Let your elevation when raising the arm be according to the length of the body, so that the cauterizations are done based on the latitude of the torso.
Then intertwine the two cords, ignite them quickly, as you insert the patient's other arm from the opposite side.
Then withdraw the cautery, thus four cauterizations have been done.
Now we will cauterize using a cautery with three cords.
And then you treat the cautery wounds that have been there for too many days because it is more beneficial than other preceding treatments in the healing process.
Chapter 31. (Assuming this refers to the chapter number)
On the cauterization of dropsy." (Dropsy is an archaic term for edema, which is characterized by swelling due to fluid accumulation in body tissues.)
Cauterization should not be applied directly on the dropsy itself, but rather on the surrounding tissues.
When you treat dropsy using the methods of cure mentioned earlier and it does not respond to your treatment, then you must apply four cauteries around the navel region, one cautery over the stomach, another over the liver, one on the spleen, two between the vertebrae of the back, one at the right side of the foot, and an additional cautery over the stomach. The depth of the cauterization should be proportional to the severity of the disease.
Then leave the cautery wound open for it to heal over an extended period of time.
And do not remove the patient from treatment with the cautery that covers them for two purposes to be added to it and the healing assistance will be hastened.
The shape of the cautery used to cauterize the abdomen should be a small roundel based on its preceding position, and this is the one that's used to cauterize the back in an olive-shaped form following the previous one.
It seems you are referring to chapter 32 of this medieval medical treatise. Can I assist you with any further translations or provide a summary of its contents? Feel free to ask!
On the cauterization of the feet and thighs."
When the feet are afflicted with edema and filled with yellowish water, it is necessary to cauterize the feet on the back of the foot, being careful not to cauterize what is between the auricular and annular bones, lift your hand holding the cautery and do not twist it; then raise your hand, but do not remove it completely, for the yellow water will flow out.
It is a cautery with this shape: Then make two cauteries on the two thighs, and on each thigh make a cautery with the cutting edge of the cautery. The length of the cautery should be according to the thigh: one below the knee, and another in the middle of the thigh; and on each thigh there are two cauteries.
Leave the wound open without treatment for a long time, allowing some of the water to drain from it.
Then treat him with those same treatments we have mentioned earlier.
Here ends chapter 33.
On the cauterization of abdominal hernias.
When an abdominal hernia is caused by cold and moist humors that weaken the retaining orifices, which are in the stomach and intestines, it should be treated with curing and non-irritating methods, but if the patient suffers from a hernia due to protrusion of the viscera, then cauterize him with a large cautery on his stomach as described previously for stomach problems, use circular cautery and four small cauteries around the navel, using a pointed cautery; or apply a cautery over the apron over fat, or two cauteries.
Here is my best translation of the provided text:
The text appears to be describing various medical treatments and procedures for different ailments. Here is my best attempt at translating it line by line into English:

Here is the translation of your source sentence:
Here is my best translation of your provided text into English:
De cauterizacio de atheyl aprop la abscizio de lor.
When you separate the arteries, then you apply the cautery which is assembled like rays. Then insert that ignited [tool] into the separated artery and finally place your hand on it so that the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which blood flows.
Do this once or twice, for if the arteries are too many, then cauterize each of them as we have described, and then treat them with ointments appropriate to their condition until they heal.
And if you cauterize with a large cautery on someone, it is more effective afterwards.
It seems that the number following the period refers to a chapter in a medical book or treatise, perhaps indicating that these instructions are part of a larger work on medieval medicine. Is there another sentence you would like translated?
Regarding the cauterization of fistulas that occur naturally in different parts of the body."
When nature fails to perform its function in the correct place and the patient is distressed by this, treat them with cauterization.
Therefore, when there is a fistula in someone's anus that is old and produces unhealthy discharge and moisture, it is most appropriate to treat it with gentle probing; then determine the depth of the fistula using the aforementioned subtle probe.
Now ignite the long, slender cautery. Then place this lit cautery into the fistula according to the depth you measured with the probe.
Repeat this cauterization of the corrupted flesh until you have burned through once or twice or three times according to your need.
Be careful not to burn the nerves or veins, and avoid areas where the fistula leads into the bladder or intestine. Do not perform this procedure unless the fistula is in fleshy tissue and you are certain it does not penetrate deeper structures.
Then treat the area until it has healed.
And if the wound is sealed, and there has been no discharge from it for a long time, then know that they are fully healed.
And if there is still discharge present, then it suggests that the wound has become infected or the tissue underneath has deteriorated, and this may be due to certain causes which will be discussed later.
This appears to indicate a chapter division in the text, with 'Chapter 37' being a possible translation if it were part of an English-language work. However, without further context I cannot provide an exact interpretation. It would be useful to know more about the structure and content of the treatise as a whole.
Concerning the cauterization of sores."
When pain arises in the stomach due to colic or excessive flatulence, causing distress to the patient, it is then necessary to cauterize that area on the abdomen with a pointed cautery for each ache, being careful to remember the exact location of the pain.
And surely we will then cauterize with the second one a little below, so that three linear cauteries will result, and thus they will be larger behind for reinforcement.
Chapter 38.
De cauterizacio de la vesica.
When there is weakening and softening of the bladder due to friction and moisture, resulting in the patient's inability to retain urine, then cauterize that area just above the bladder, where the pubic hair begins; cauterize with a cautery on the right side and another on their left.
The length of each cautery should be determined by the number of toes on the foot; cauterize that area with a cautery at the lowest part of the back, or with two cauteries if necessary.
The pointed cautery should be chosen according to the process being carried out.
Chapter 39. (This indicates the start of a new chapter in the medieval medical treatise.)
On the cauterization of measles. (Here, 'mayra' likely refers to measles, which is a disease that was often treated with cauterization in medieval medicine.)
When measles occur due to coldness and moisture, which are harmful during pregnancy and corrupt the menstrual flow of the patient, causing a delay in its onset and pain during it, then it is necessary to cauterize that area with three cauteries around the navel, as we have mentioned for bladder-related issues; also cauterize the lowest part of the back with one or two cauteries, and use pointed cautery. (Here, 'ombelic' refers to the navel, and 'le havent de lor' refers to the patient's menstrual flow.)
Capitol xl is most likely an indication that this is chapter 40 of some medical text in Latin or a language with similar roots (Spanish, Italian, French). I can continue translating your provided medieval medical treatise:
De cauterizacio de la dislocatione de l'anqua.
When mucous humidity infiltrates the region of the hip and causes its displacement from its position, it is a sign that one side of the patient's body is longer than the other when compared together. The location of the dislocation is found in their joints.
Therefore, you must cauterize the patient in the region of their hip with a circular cautery tool that has been heated, as you will have noticed by attempting to place it around the circumference of the region and finding that the region falls into the middle of the circle.
And it is this cautery tool, in terms of its shape, that precedes the one used for stomach cauterization.
And if this cautery tool is not available to you, then cauterize with three large olive-shaped cautery tools instead.
The amount of cauterization should be done according to the severity of the entire condition, and then treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 41.
De cauterizacio de la vena sciatica is translated into English as "On the cauterization of the sciatic vein." It appears this text describes medieval medical procedures and practices related to treating joint pain, gout, and other ailments using techniques such as cauterization and manual manipulation.
When pain occurs in the hip area and is caused by moisture and humidity, the patient can be treated with the methods mentioned above or with an ancient remedy: letting out excess humors using foul-smelling pills (possibly containing herbs) or artificial/synthetic pills; then you should cauterize that area.
The method of applying the cautery on that area is done in two ways: with burning medicines or with fire (directly).
According to the two known methods, one of them is to cauterize that area on the patient's waist with three triangular-shaped cauteries in this particular arrangement; make sure to create a significant depth with these tools. The space between each cautery should be the width of a finger, and the size of the cauteries can be that of an olive or larger.
In some cases, the cauteries may be placed over the middle part of the hip joint; in this case, there are four cauteries. It seems the placement and number of cauteries can vary depending on the specific area being treated.
And if you wish, cauterize with the circle preceding the form in the cautery of the dislocation of the ankle, and let it be a complete circle that burns away all the affected tissue.
This is the way of cauterizing with caustic substances when pain adheres to the ankle and does not extend towards the thigh.
But if the pain extends towards the thigh, then cauterize it with two cauteries on the thigh over the area where you have directed the patient's attention and with one cautery on the calf by four fingers slightly below the hairy part.
And if the cautery is done with a knife, let its depth be according to the amount of affected tissue.
And if the patient indicates that the pain extends towards the area near the toes of the feet, then cauterize it there with cauteries at three or four points or more if needed.
And if the patient indicates pain below the thigh, then cauterize it there with a knife-like cautery.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
And I have seen one or another of those who were cauterized on the ankle and eventually died during the cauterization process; the bed was filled with smoke while the tumor affected the foot, and it was perforated and completely destroyed. Then there is violent diarrhea from the intestines, and this often leads to death.
And if the pain is in two places, cauterize each one simultaneously according to this method.
The wise ones said that, regarding the cauterization of water, this is how the cautery should be: it should resemble a circle made of iron with a circumference equal to half a palm; and its hole should have the diameter of a date seed or slightly less.
And within that circle, there should be another smaller one; the space between them should be equivalent to the size of an adult's nail; these circles should be open at two ends; and the length of each handle should be equal to one or two nails; make sure to have iron rims adequately covering the circles. This is how it should look like:
Then it should be ignited in the fire until it glows red and emits sparks; then place it on the affected area while the patient lies on their side. And so cauterize it with three round cauterizations at once.
Then leave it for three days; apply an ointment and leave the wound open for too many days; and finally treat it with internal remedies until it is healed.
Now, my son, we have rarely used this type of cauterization due to the fear of its aftermath and because few have experienced it.
May God be with them [the patients] as they undergo these cauterizations, and may He restore their place.
May cauterization with adherent medicines be done by you, using two rings made of perforated brass in which the flame of a small iron door protrudes; let their size along the length of its nature be that of two nuts or such.
And if the space between each is equal to the thickness of your finger; whether they are open underneath and above or contain each other in this way:
Then place it on the patient's neck while they lie on their side and apply your hand to their neck; take warm water, pour it between the two rings, and let its quality be gradually heated by fire over one hour, enduring the patient's bite and burning of himself - for he bites like a fire- until the biting stops.
And then lift your hand towards the instrument and wipe away all the dirty water from the entire basin with clean water.
And then let it heal for three days and put on the wound some ointment until the blackness of the swelling recedes, and leave it [the ointment] on there for some more days, and its redness will disappear; this is a healing process.
And then treat it with ointments until it heals.
And if the pain extends towards the thigh or leg, make him sit in water containing herbs just like [you did] in the basin previously.
And this is the way of washing with water, and I have already written it in the treatise on medicine rectification. Take some soap and ashes, do not extinguish them completely but divide each of them into two parts; crush them both then put them in a new pot which has its bottom perforated with a small hole depending on the quantity you want to fit inside.
And put beneath the pot another pot inverted [upside down], and pour over those soap and ashes live [fresh] water which covers them by one finger, then when you press both of them with your hand firmly for good compression, let the fluid that comes out from fresh water settle in the part below into the other inverted pot.
Then adjust all that water, and pour it over another living cause and other new alkalines, because then it will become a very sharp tool, which is administered in many medical operations and in the cauterization of other members, since the operation creates fire.
And for the alkaline medicines which are widely cauterized, there is also tezezihic and melted anacrat and cause with a taste like this, so that they may be mixed.
Galia recounts the story of an ancient man's operation and cure for hip pain and sciatic vein pain, greatly praising it, and says that no other treatment is needed, and that once healed like this, one may recount, as the light of that thread entered a bath and came out of it.
This should be placed near green clay, and if you cannot find the green type, then take a fresh fig; it must be cut with a little vinegar and placed on the hip where the pain is located or in the thigh or leg, and it must be tied.
And it should be left for three hours or the amount of time that the patient experiences relief from inflammation.
And now immerse him in a bath and when his body is numb, put him on the ground for the pain ceases and he is cured.
And remember that one should not use the cautery with these treatments, but rather focus on evacuating the body.
Additionally, know that when using goat's horn to treat the strepticus vein, it should be cauterized in this way; take some wool, soak it in old oil, and place it between the toes of the patient and over the joint.
Then take a dry goat's horn, burn it to make charcoal and place this on the wool, leaving it until it becomes heated. Repeat this process until the sensation of biting reaches down to the ankles and the pain is relieved.
This method of cautery is called 'cow cautery'.
The number in Roman numerals for this chapter or section would be XLII, which represents the number 42. Is there another part of the text you'd like me to translate?
On the cauterization of back pain." Do you have any other sections or parts of the text that you'd like me to translate?
Here is the translation of the first source sentence:
And cauterization is only done in this specific case, which is performed due to an effusion of cold matter.
Therefore now, perform the evacuation of the patient using foul-smelling and similar pills, which are placed in a row over the area where there is pain, three lines across according to their width; then mark ten points on each line with cauterization irons or needles, depending on how much they can bear, taking into account their tolerance and virtue.
And the cauterization is performed using a pointed cautery iron.
And if you wish, you may cauterize using three or four medium-sized cautery irons in this manner:
The Latin numeral "xlliii" is 43. Is there another number or text that you would like me to translate?
On the subject of cauterization at the onset of jaundice.
This illness is often observed in young children, and the sign of its onset in them is that they experience stiffness in their limbs which causes elevation and movement.
And others in the lower back region, as well as their vertebrae which have started to protrude above the rest.
And so when you see this and want to prevent it, then cauterize that area with a cautery tool that is circular in shape according to this form: Take the cauterizing iron over each part of the spine, likewise.
And if you wish, cauterize along the spine's circumference with the pointed cautery in two or three lines. And ensure that the points are close to each other between them.
Then treat the area so that it heals with what we have mentioned above.
Make sure that the cautery is not applied to areas of numbness caused by nerve spasms.
It seems like you've provided part of an old medical text, but I'm unsure what "Capitol .xliv." refers to in this context. Could you provide more information or clarify its significance? Is it a chapter number or a specific reference within the treatise?
On the cauterization for gout and joint pain."
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that affect each part of the body, and when pain occurs in the feet, it is commonly referred to as gout by physicians.
And therefore, when gout is treated with cold application but the pain persists, one must use hot cauterization instead.
It is you who cauterizes that area, near the joint of the foot, with a small cautery tool.
And the shape of this particular cauterization tool is as follows: [describe the shape or provide an image if available] (Please note, I am unable to generate images).
And if it is necessary to make punctures on the surface of the foot, then use a pointed cautery tool for this purpose. If the pain spreads to the toes or other joints, and this happens often, then one should cauterize each toe with three or four applications of this olive-shaped cautery tool.
If you find that these small cautery tools are required, then proceed with the cauterization and do not press your hand too firmly on the tool beforehand; only apply a gentle pressure around the size of a coin.
And if the pain extends towards the loins and back, then apply the cautery as mentioned in our previous chapter.
If the pain is only in the hands and it is called gout, then make incisions around the veins as they revolve, piercing these two lines.
And if the pain remains in the said areas, then make incisions around the veins over each knuckle and on the palm of the hand.
If the pain moves towards the knees or muscles after some days, then cauterize each part of the joints.
And do not release the patient from their regimen and medication intake, for if it is done well and the phlegm is evacuated by this cauterization, God willing, they will be healed.
It appears that you are referring to chapter 45 of the medieval medical treatise. Is there anything else I can help you with regarding this text? Feel free to ask any specific questions or request further translations!
On the cauterization of ruptures.
When there is a rupture in the groin area and the intestines come out before the hernia, which has just begun to form, it is advised that you instruct the patient to skip their meal on that day and use soothing remedies so that the hernia descends from their abdomen.
Then support the patient between your two hands on their back and instruct them to keep their leg elevated so that neither the hernia nor the intestines come out through the opening.
Then return the aforementioned to its place and show them how to feel for the rupture over the pubic bone, indicating that the end of it resembles half a circle at the divided edges of the abdomen.
And now use a cautery of this shape: [Insert description or image of the shape here].
Which is round, with sharp edges. Then return the intestine or hernia to its cavity, and place your hand over the area to prevent the intestine from coming out.
You have already opened the space between the patient's thighs, placed a cushion under them, another servant on their legs, and another on their chest, holding their hands.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
And wisely observe the placement of the intestine during your cauterization process, ensuring you do not burn the intestine lest it brings upon the patient death or other great harm.
And remember that when you use the cautery, do not touch any bones; failure to adhere to this may compromise your operation.
Note that the children's cautery should be subtle, according to their size and build.
Then care for the cauterized area for three days, ensuring you keep it covered so that the scar of the fire is healed.
Then take care of those other wounds until they are fully healed.
Have the patient lie on their back for forty days, ensuring the wound is sealed and clean.
Ensure you provide nourishment for the patient in accordance with the length of their recovery time; this will ease the strain on their stomach and prevent the intestine from coming out during the healing process.
Then, when it has been forty days and you wish to get up, do so gently and appropriately; keep that up for another forty days.
And he should be reduced in work and intake of food and drink, and refrains from loud voices, for when one follows this entire regimen of treatment they will surely be healed.
For the treatment of ruptures in other parts of the abdomen, if it is fresh and you want to prevent its removal, then cauterize the rupture with a round cautery according to its size, as if the third part of it were protruding from the wound; then treat it with what we have said before, but do not fit it back into place.
I have already mentioned that some ruptures should be cauterized with a triangular cautery according to this shape, as it is marked with a diagram:
A line is placed across the width on top of the rupture and another above it; then place your hand with a pointed cautery, but the first cautery is lighter and better.
Chapter XLVI" or "Chapter 46". It appears that this text is divided into chapters, with each chapter likely discussing different medical topics or treatments. Is there another passage you would like me to translate?
On the cauterization of a twisted limb." This seems to be the title for the next chapter or section in the medieval medical treatise, indicating that it will discuss the treatment of twisted or injured limbs through cauterization. Do you have any further text from this chapter that requires translation?
When pain arises in any body part due to a fall or impact and persists for a long time without responding to medicinal treatment, it is appropriate to proceed with cauterization using a pointed cautery.
The choice of the type of cautery for each body part should be determined by considering its size and delicacy, as well as the nature of the injury or pain and its location.
If the patient is cured by the first application of cauterization, it is sufficient; but if not, repeat the cautery on it; as it is customary for these types of pains that they are punctured from one body part to another nearby, so you should ensure that you achieve healing through cauterization.
Chapter 47. (This indicates the end of the text.)
On cauterization for leprosy.
Les lebros alcunas veguadas am cauteri per mot gran juvament:
Here is my translation of the provided text:
And finally, place your hand on the cautery and press it gently onto the bone to create a small indentation, ensuring that the scabs are displaced so that the expulsion of thick vapors is relieved from him; then cauterize over the swelling as needed.
If leprosy has already spread over the patient and appears evidentially, then you must cauterize that area with those cauteries which I have mentioned previously in this chapter; use a cautery on the tip of the nose, two cauteries on both cheeks, two cauteries on the vertebrae of the neck, six cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, one large cautery on the vertebrae near the hips, one on the hip bone, two on each hip joint, and one on each knoll; then use two cauteries over the knees, two over the muscles, and two on the tender parts of their feet. Cauterize them on all joints mentioned in the hands and feet, on each heel of their feet, and on the hollows of both arms.
And be cautious not to burn those nerves that pass over the ankle, as they may be damaged by the cautery.
Some patients are treated with a cautery on the bone of their scrotum and another on the mouth of their stomach, while one is applied to the liver.
And know that the larger you make the cautery [wound], the more beneficial and effective it is; and know that the patient will not feel any pain from the cautery, just as he does not with his own limbs, because his body is already stunned.
The size of the cauteries should be determined by the body part and joints, as previously mentioned in relation to the type of instrument used.
Then treat the cautery with a poultice of cow dung mixed with honey, and use another treatment until it is healed.
I'm happy to assist you! Please provide me with the relevant text so I can translate it for you accurately.
Thank you for providing that information!
When a limb is paralyzed or numb and has been treated with medicines, oils, and poultices but hasn't healed, you then cauterize that paralyzed limb using a cautery according to the size of the limb or its smallness.
And if your cautery slightly pierces the skin, Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
Some disorders are cauterized due to the numbness in the hands and feet, which originates from the spine's vertebrae and affects the nerves that move those limbs, and the disorder is cured.
One should not assume anything about this unless they are wise in the anatomy of the limbs and the emergence of nerves throughout the body.
Chapter 49.
On the cauterization of white spots, which is morphea.
When white spots are old and do not benefit from any of the ointments of medicine, you then cauterize them with a pointed cautery slightly according to the amount of skin piercing that is needed until their whiteness fades and its colour changes.
And then treat him with a mixture of ground beans and lentils, rose oil, arnica leaves, and pigeon or heron blood, taking equal parts of each ingredient. Mix them all together and wrap the area in a linen cloth until it is healed.
It seems you have provided a chapter number or a heading. Could you clarify if there's any specific text or information within this chapter that you'd like me to translate or explain?
Here is my translation of the provided medieval medical treatise:
When cancer begins and you want to treat it, cauterize it with a circular cautery around its circumference as if it were rolled up.
The wise men said that it should be cauterized with the last cautery in its middle place; but I have not seen this done, as I fear it will become ulcerated, and I have witnessed this happen on some occasions.
It is more effective to cauterize it around its circumference with a circular cautery, as we have mentioned before, or by using multiple small cauteries.
Chapter 1.
On the cauterization of scrofulous swellings.
When a scrofulous swelling is delayed in its maturation, which could be due to an excess of humour causing it or the condition of the patient, who might be old and decrepit, with little blood, or because of the time of year; if you want to hasten the maturation of this swelling, cauterize around it using several small pointed cauteries, and then let it alone as it will quickly mature.
But if you want to pierce it with a cautery, then heat the following type of cautery: and place it in the middle of the swelling until the chain penetrates.
And if a cauterization is done in that spot which is lower down, so that the body of the arm may be relieved; then treat the inside so that it can heal.
This appears to be a reference or chapter number in the medieval medical treatise you provided. Is there any specific text within this chapter that you'd like me to translate or provide an interpretation for?
Regarding the cauterization of corrosive substances."
Corrodent es corrupcio ambulant en le membre, la qual corrodeys aquel ayssi cum a foc comedent lenha secca.
Therefore, if you see the ulcerated wound in a place where it suffers from the cauterization with fire, then you ignite slightly cut cautery points that are large enough to be suitable for that specific location of the ulcer.
Then cauterize it thoroughly throughout, removing all the ulceration without leaving any of its cause behind.
Then leave it alone for three days and apply on the cauterized areas thrice-ground oil until all scars are eradicated, and there is no corruption.
Then cure it with flesh-generating ointments.
My advice is to wait three days and see if healthy flesh grows in the area that was not corrupted before attempting anything else, but if it does not, then repeat the cauterization over what remains of the ulcerated places.
Ulcerations may be treated occasionally with sharp medicine because it is applied in the place of a cauterization. However, using fire to cauterize is still generally more effective.
I have already mentioned the cure of it using sharp medicine in the division, so take that when you are in need of it.
Capitol .liii.: Chapter 53.
De cauterizacio de claus e dels autres semblants.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
Moreover, there is the red-hot cautery which sets fire to the concave cautery resembling an eagle's beak, which shall be made of iron according to the quantity as much as contains the entire key, and let it be made of fine steel.
Then place that ignited [object] on the key, and then move your hand with the cautery in the circle of the key until the cautery reaches the depth of the key. Leave it like that for three days before beginning to move your arm. Then plaster that with wild mallows chopped up with salt, and leave the plaster on it overnight, for this will eradicate its roots.
Then cure the area with ointment made of newly generated flesh until it is healed.
And if they are not converted and this accident happens on the surface of the body, mainly in the hands and feet, then it is necessary that you administer to them cauterization with water, and take a little tube made of horn or iron or eagle's beak and place it over the key; then put into the tube a small quantity of boiling water, hold your hand, and turn [the tube] with compression from your whole hand, and let the rim of the tube be against the root of the key, and the hot water will go right down to the root of the key; wait for the patient one little moment until he experiences the sting of the boiling water for an hour, then remove it, for the key along with its roots will have been eradicated.
And thus they made me do it for one of them and another came over all those parts of their body.
Then take care to ensure that the roots of the nails are removed with this in order to eradicate any resulting inflammation and infection.
This indicates that it is Chapter 5, often denoted as 'Capitöl llll' or similar.
Regarding the cauterization of tremors."
When there is any trembling due to cold in the nerves or because of a cold fever, or for some other similar reason, you should cauterize that person with four cauteries or five on the vertebrae of the back, placing one cautery between each vertebra; and apply cauteries to their feet, and an olive-oil cautery on their stomach.
And if the patient's trembling subsides, it hastens the recovery of this cold illness.
Chapter 5.
On the cauterization of white sores on the body.
When there are white sores on the body that have turned into pustules containing gross corrupted matter, therefore at the beginning of their appearance, they should be cauterized over each head of the fistula with a fine myrtle-stick cautery, whose end is extended by fire; or with long horsehair roots; or with a lenticular cautery.
And sometimes it is necessary to use a leaden cautery at the beginning of its expulsion according to this method; and they are not consumed, but rather the superfluity is expelled by doing so, and they heal from them.
However, take care that this is done properly through evacuation via bloodletting.
The text you provided does not include "Capitol lvi". Could you provide me with the full sentence or paragraph?
Regarding cauterization of accidental blood flow due to an archery wound.
When there is blood flow from an archery wound that has been cut open, or due to the incision of abscesses or cauterization of a limb, and it resembles this, and it is difficult to stop the bleeding.
So when this happens to someone, you must cover the archery wound with your hand, and place your finger into the orifice, pressing it against the bleeding site until the blood flow stops, without letting go.
Then place the small and large olive-shaped cauteries on the fire for a short while, in great numbers, and blow on them until they are well heated.
Then take one of those, small or large depending on the location and severity of the wound where the artery is broken, over that vein quickly after you have removed your finger, and apply the cautery so that it seals and stops the blood flow.
Here is the translation of the provided text:
And be careful not to burn the nerves that are here, and that other ailments do not come upon the patient.
Know that when blood flows from an artery, it is not possible to stop the bleeding in those cases unless done with one of four methods: either using a cautery as mentioned before, or by extraction if it hasn't been extracted already (as the ends of the vein are burnt and it constricts the blood), or binding it with gall or ligature with strong tightness, or placing medications on it that have the virtue of restricting the blood; they should be tightly bound with a compress with decent compression.
Those who administer proper compression with bandages and tight bindings using compresses or by positioning cauterizing causes and similar items should not do so immediately.
But if this happens to someone and the doctor or medicine is not present, then place your index finger over the opening of that vein as we have said, applying great pressure so that the blood can be stopped from the upper part of the wound, but do not squeeze on the pulse; instead, sprinkle cold water with a very chilling effect until the blood becomes congealed and thickened. Then consider what is needed: cautery or medicine.
De incisio e perforacio e ventozas e de fleubotomia e de plaudits e de lor semblants."
Here is the translation of the provided text:
And I will proceed in this chapter in the same manner so that the sufferer may find relief for what he has asked for.
And before I begin this, know, my sons, that what you will learn in this chapter is by way of extension of what was explained in the first chapter on cauterization.
And for this reason, it is necessary to be very cautious, as in the operation described in this chapter, many evacuations of blood are required and the life of the patient depends on the correct application of these: the sprinkling of the vein or incision over an abscess, excision or cleaning of a wound, extraction of arrows, incision for stone removal, and similar procedures. All these operations should be accompanied by fear and trembling, and most of all for the latter ones (extraction of arrows, incision for stone removal), which can result in death.
I warn you that this responsibility should not fall on your shoulders, as sometimes one must act according to the ways of men rather than those dictated by medical knowledge. And there are those who will die from their illness and it will be a light death for them because of the vehemence with which they experience their disease, due to its long duration, as well as the fear that this sickness inspires in others, which signifies imminent death.
And of those who give you wealth and say that they desire health for you, while their disease is harmful to themselves.
Therefore, do not consent to him who comes to you in this manner; let your caution be greater than your covetousness and rapacity; and presume no cause about it other than appropriate certain knowledge that you must verify for yourself, and to whom praiseable succession should pertain.
Use the art of prognosis and indication in curing all your patients, for by it health is restored to them; in this you have assistance for acquiring fame and memory, praise, and glory.
O, my sons, may God breathe His understanding into you and not take away your direction and protection, for this is in His hands.
And I have arranged this chapter by dividing it into separate chapters as was done in the previous chapter on cauterization, from head to toe, so that you may find what you seek more easily and meet your needs.
Chapter One.
On the treatment of water on the head of children.
Sapias que aquesta malautia motas veguadas endeve als enfantz deves le enfantament e quan la noyrissa estrenh le cap del enfant ses livitat.
And sometimes it happens for hidden reasons which are not known.
I have only seen this illness in children; for all those whom I saw met with death, and thus it appears to me as a wasted effort.
And I have seen a child whose head was filled with water; their head always remained so engorged that they could not sit upright due to the size of their head, and as the moisture increased, death soon followed.
This moisture either collects between the membranes and the bones or it accumulates beneath the bone on the brain.
For the operation on such a child if the moisture is between the membranes and bones and the abscess is small, then it is necessary to make an incision in the middle of the skull with a cut along its length that runs through two knots until the fluid flows out. The shape of the instrument used for this procedure is called a spat.
And so if the moisture is greatly increased and the abscess is larger, then there should be two incisions made in this manner:
Here is my translation of the provided text: Make an incision in the middle of the head with three cuts according to this method:
Then extract all the moisture from the incision; subsequently, secure the cuts with bandages and soft cloths; after that, on the fifth day, irrigate it with wine and oil; then untie the binding and treat the wound with sponges and ointments; finally, bind the head firmly. Feed the patient dry food with minimal moisture until the limb is strengthened and healed.
There is another method of incision, which you should consider depending on the size of the abscess and the accumulation of fluid; sometimes it occurs at the back of the head, or in front, on the right side, or on the left. Therefore, pay attention to where the abscess and fluid collection appear and perform the incision accordingly, doing so as gently as possible.
Take note not to sever the artery, which would lead to bleeding and cause the patient's demise due to the loss of blood and moisture.
Sure! Here is my translation of your medieval medical text into English:
When there is a chronic catarrh or wound in the eye or foot and it does not respond to medical treatments, the final cure for this lies in ligation of those two arteries.
Therefore, if you intend to cut open the patient's skull, first rub the area with rough cloth until the blood vessels appear; then secure their neck with some cloth; next consider where to ligate the vein and the spots that are just in front of the ears but hidden from view except for certain individuals.
Then place a needle over the blood vessel and cut it with each part of the sharp bone-cutter until you reach the skull in as wide an incision as possible.
If you wish, insert the bone-cutter below the artery and sever it at those points above where they divide.
And make the length of your incision two fingers' width; for when any vein is cut, blood will be seen to issue forth in a pulsating manner as it leaps out with frequent bound.
But if the vessel does not appear on probing then measure from the ear three fingers' length and place your needle there; insert it into bone.
Here is the translation of the first sentence you provided:
Under consideration is the plague and if there remains above the bone some cause of fracture then cut away that which may become a deadly abscess.
Strengthen the wound with feathers and soft cloth bandages, then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
Chapter 3:
On the extraction of arrows which are in the temples (of the head).
When an old headache or quartan fever occurs due to excess moisture and qualities in the sinuses of the temples, or if it is an old violent pain similar to these, and it does not respond to medicinal treatments, we propose, for such illnesses, the extraction of arrows from the temples, or their cauterization as we have shown.
The way of operating and extracting them is for the patient to shave the hair from the temples; and understand that the arrow is visible in the temple as it is shown by its trail on the skin, except in very few men where it may be hidden due to the violence of the impact.
Here is the translation of the provided text: And then you take the spatula which has this shape: Then you remove the scab with ease until you reach the artery; and then immerse it in an ointment and extract the uppermost parts by removing them from the scab and uncovering those areas that have been exposed.
However, if the artery is delicate, then you wrap it with a piece of ointment at its tip; and then cut off one part according to the length that extends beyond the incision, ensuring it is not too tight, as this could prevent blood flow if left uncut.
Then you evacuate one to three ounces of blood.
If the artery is large, ensure you tie it in two places with strong double flaxen thread or cords that are long enough; be careful not to cut off circulation before the wound has healed and the blood flow stops.
Then you cut the excess that lies between the two ligatures, doing so either now or at another time.
And if you wish, cauterize it with a hot iron or with a knife-shaped cautery after the extremities have been cut; this will serve the same purpose as the previous step.
Here is the translation of your provided text:
Here is my translation of the text:
And if while working there is another occurrence of blood flux from the wound, then you should attempt to stop that blood flow by either using a cauterizing method or filling the wound with cotton and squeezing your hand tightly around it until the bleeding ceases. And if none of those methods are available to you at the moment, then place your finger over the wound so that the blood coagulates, and pour water with intense coldness into the wound until the sharpness subsides, and it is tightly sealed as required.
What is even lighter in terms of wound extraction is that you cauterize the vein with this two-pronged cautery instrument because you have previously marked both spots with thread and placed each one there, having been lit from fire until they reach the bone and divide the vein into two locations so as to elongate what is between its extremities since these are not fully consolidated by this cauterization.
And this is the form of the cautery:"
And let the sharpness of the two knives be examined. However, if the sharpness is less than that of two knives, it is better; for if they are as sharp as two knives on each side, and do not cut the flesh quickly.
Therefore, in cases where there is some thickness, the heat of the fire should be applied to them, and the flesh should be cut off lightly.
And this procedure is better than all other procedures and more light-handed.
And let the space between the two knives be equal to the thickness of your finger.
It seems that "Capitol quart." may be a section title or heading, rather than a sentence to translate.  Is there another line from the text you would like me to translate?
On treating acute and acidic wounds of the head.
When it is an acidic wound, and the wound is on those veins which are above the temples of the head, and you do not find any cause for treating it with medicine, and sometimes the face of the patient becomes red, and one sees on their forehead a movement like that of ants, and their ears become exhausted, moist so that even their hair is known to be wet, and their eyelids are worn away by the sharpness of the tears, these old remedies in curing them of this operation I will not number here.
And you instruct the patient to scratch their hair on his forehead, then make three evenly spaced incisions of equal length across the forehead. And if the length of each incision is about two digits: one incision should be equally distant to the length of the nose at the middle of the forehead, and the second according to the length of a small movement from the corners of the eyes which are in the tear duct area, and the third from there onwards.
Take heed of the beginning of the arches which are on both sides, and extend your hand from the continuation of both jaws. And if the space between each incision is about three digits wide.
And if you have a piece of sponge equipped with dry, shredded cloth which absorbs the blood.
Then insert the spatula with two sharp ends into it, which has this form of the incision: Which is from the temples to the second incision. Scrape out with that the entire line which is between two incisions to the middle of the bone, and then do this from the middle incision to the second incision. And then place this area in such a space and insert another instrument, called the *cutellar*, sharp on one side and not sharp on the other.
Place the side of the sharp edge against the attached flesh and the other side towards the bone; use this to reach the middle crack, and cut all vessels that descend from the head to the hole.
Make sure the incision continues past what appears to be bone, then do this in the middle crack towards another.
And because blood flows in equal quantities, squeeze the places of the solid pieces of blood.
Then place on each crack a piece of old cloth, and put over these some powder mixed in wine and oil and sour wine, ensuring that no open wound gets infected.
On the third day, untie the binding and administer a large infusion of warm water or weak broth; then treat this with basilicum ointment mixed with rose oil and others until the wounds are healed.
It appears that this is Chapter 5 of the treatise, although it's unclear what the title may be without further context or information. Is there any other text you would like me to translate?
From the treatment of eye diseases using cathartics and the various remedies derived from within the head.
When someone experiences persistent and sharp cathartic effects, and their body is exhausted due to excessive purging, with weakened vision and loss of eyelashes, along with a severe headache and intense exhaustion, know that these symptoms indicate that the purgative substances are acting upon delicate veins within the head.
And the best course of treatment in such cases is this: instruct the patient to part their hair, then make an incision along the middle of their forehead, slightly off-center (beginning at the left temple and ending at the right); let the cut run along the bone; extend your hand across the muscles of the temples which are connected to chewing), so that the bone is exposed.
Dry all the blood with a sponge or cloth, then fill the space between the two lips of the incision with old cotton wool or linen. Then bind it tightly with powder, steeped in vinegar and oil, to prevent the formation of an abscess.
Certainly, let's continue translating the text:
Certainly! Here is my best attempt at translating each line of your provided text into English:
De la cura de aquo que catz en las aurelhas."
Here is my translation of the provided text:
Here is my best translation attempt: And then place some pieces of cloth or wool in the vicinity of the ear, extending the ear to its limits, for it often happens that this condition is forgotten due to these causes.
And if it is not relieved, then proceed with the extraction using an instrument called the delicate surgical spoon, which has this shape:" (At this point, a description or illustration of the instrument could be provided for clarity.)
If the extraction with the spoon is unsuccessful, then it is as follows; if not, proceed with the removal using a thin pair of forceps with minimal teeth.
And if it is still not relieved, make a cannula out of metal wire and insert the end of the cannula into the perforation of the ear, then seal around the cannula with wax and softened oil to ensure that nothing else enters but the cannula. Then extract it with your breath using strong suction, as often happens with the method we have described.
But if it is not removed in this way, take a bright-colored cord or an old rope instrument that is used to capture birds, attach a small amount of it to the end of a rod, and then wrap the other end securely around your arm. And then insert it into the hole of the ear easily, and then remove any moisture from the ear.
And so if you do not forget any of the causes that have been recounted, then proceed to cut before it develops into an abscess or spasm.
The way to cut it is that you first bleed the patient from the jugular vein and draw out blood according to their virtue, then make them stop between your hands and turn the ear into its lobes, ending with a small fissure at the root of the ear behind what has been pressed. And let the fissure be of lunar shape until it reaches the bone, and when the bone is exposed, cut away what you can with appropriate instruments; then sew the fissure quickly, and treat it until it is healed.
And if the cause lies in the ear due to a growth that has become swollen and inflated, then administer treatment and its removal; but if it does not obey your extraction, then take thin soft wax of this form: And administer to him the removal of that growth which has fallen into the ear.
And do not attempt this when you think that it is already moistened by the vapor of the ear, and place it in small pieces, then extract them with tweezers or with gentle movements, or with incision as we have said, for the extraction is eased.
If water has entered the ear, at first the patient will sneeze frequently, fill their ear with an old cotton cloth, and blow on that ear where the water is. If this fails to help, then take thin sticks as long as your finger, harden them in the fire a little, and the patient should place one of those in the opening of his/her ear and jump onto one foot from that side and strike with a stone against the stone which is inside the ear. Therefore, do not cease this until all the water has been drained.
Therefore, do not cease this until all the water has been drained. And once the water is drained in this way that you take paper or straw and put one end of it into the ear, extending the other end towards the fire until most of it has burned.
And then put another sponge and do this multiple times until all the water is expelled, and extract it with a cannula as mentioned above regarding the extracting stone.
When it comes to extracting an animal that has entered through the ear canal, if it is a small creature, push and extract it similarly like we mentioned in the previous section; but if it is a larger object causing obstruction within the canal, then employ extraction techniques using movements and twists, and this cause is less severe compared to other causes leading to blockage in the ear.
In the case of extracting worms bred within the ear, when you treat it using the methods mentioned in the previous section and in the treatise on distillation processes, but your treatment is not effective, then you must observe the ear under sunlight.
And so, if any cause or sign of worms is present here, then extract them using gentle movements or twists; but if no cause is apparent, take a cannula with this form: a narrow end and an expanded upper part. Insert the narrow end of the cannula into the ear according to the extent that the patient can bear it; then apply strong suction with the instrument and do this several times until all worms are expelled.
Here is my translation of the first source sentence:
And let your emission be with which you pour medicinal oils into the ear with this instrument, of which this is its form: Make it out of silver or brass, narrow in width, with a small hole, and flat on top.
And so it should be filled with what is necessary to fit into the cavity of the cannula that contains it. If you wish, take the rod and wrap it appropriately with thread at its end, then pour oil into the cavity of the cannula or juice from any herb, or any such medicine that you desire; this is placed in the ear. Then insert the threaded rod and squeeze it gently with your hand as to expel the oil into the cavity of the eardrum, and let the patient feel the oil within.
What is inserted into the ear should be lightly scorched with fire. Be careful that the cause for which you are distilling into the ear is not too cold, as ear medicines cannot bear this.

Here is my translation of the provided text:
E aquella que accideys en le preon de lu, la qual no comprehen le vezement, es en las majors disposicios de dificil sanacio.
And in that one where you manage to reach the wound, it is necessary that you place the patient's ear towards the sun and look at it. And so if you see any swelling present, open it with a fine-pointed scalpel which has this shape:
If the end of it is small in width, where one side is sharp and the other blunt; and the scalpel is double-edged to avoid injury to the ear.
And if the swelling is due to flesh growing in the ear or its tissue, then take it with fine scissors and cut it open easily so that all the flesh is exposed.
If the swelling is located in the earlobe, then take a thin, pointed instrument and heat it over fire for a short while, then place that inside the ear.
And so if you have felt the swelling with something that the patient hears easily due to its weight, try easing the pressure of it effortlessly; and be careful not to harm the nerves of the ear.
Then place on the ear a cloth of linen according to the size of the wound which you have wrapped in Egyptian ointment; and do this for several days until you are certain that the wound has consolidated, or take any herb and dip it in water then sprinkle over it finely ground salt; and if you see the ear already forming pus, then it is necessary that you drain the pus and replace it with another herb which you will wrap in a cerate made of rose oil so that the swelling softens little by little; and then treat it until it is healed.
Here is my translation of the provided text:

Therefore, take these iron splints or irons and separate them from their base with a chisel; then place them over the affected areas which have been sawn.
If the pain is caused by an excess of blood flow, then you must cauterize with a fine, flat-tipped cautery.
And the best cauterization is when those incisions and cuts that remain visible return as a result of their roots being left intact; but if they are cauterized with fire, these roots are burnt away and will not reappear.

Treatment for severe inflammation of the eyelids.
Visible marks found on the eyelids are caused by a condition that is similar in strength and hardness to stone, hence it is called 'gout'.
And this accumulation of dense moisture on both sides of the eyelid.
Therefore, the operation on them is as follows: if the gout originates within the eyelid and is confined to that area; and if its cause is mild.
Therefore, make an incision along that side of the wound and then remove any foreign matter with ease before you close it, and then lift up the edges and carefully cut them off.
And if the wound is large, then you must adjust it with stitches; cure it until it is healed.
And if the wound is small, it will not cause any harm as the patient's ointment restores it to flesh.
And if the stye is descending towards the inside of the eyelid, you must turn back the inner surface; then lift up the stye with forceps, other than those used for incision, and press it on all sides; and if the eyelid, by being cut open, becomes elongated, this will not cause any harm.
Then cleanse the wound with salt water; treat the site until it is healed by becoming flesh again.

Axcirnath is a severe condition that develops in the eyelids' membranes, mainly affecting children. It worsens their eyes and often leads to strong cataracts; they cannot bear the brightness of sunlight due to this, causing tears to flow continuously.
And so you see them rubbing their faces constantly and even while sleeping; the eyelids below their eyebrows are wet, already covered in inflammation, with an apparent threat of discharge present in the eye; and when you press the area with your fingers, you feel a discharge within it.
One method of operation involves the patient placing their head on your lap; you then cover them with a cloth and make a circle around it according to the size that can contain arachnoid fluid from all sides. Then, place this over the area and press with your fingers to gather discharge in the middle of the circle before making an incision into the middle of the humidity using a spatula with a split along its length; ensure that the fissure is not wider than that made during a flebotomy (bloodletting).
Continue making the incision on the cornea until you reach the discharge, as in its deepest parts there is always some discharge due to the white-grey substance that comes out through the aforementioned split.
Donc extratz aquella am draps los quals tu as envolopatz entre les tieus ditz a las partidas deforo e revolv entre la ma dextra e sinistre entro que sia dispargut.
And be careful not to tighten the wound so that you don't pierce it with a splinter and worsen his condition.
If no artery appears at the beginning of the wound, but you find a small one nearby which is easily accessible, then quickly remove it as we have explained; next, immerse some linen cloths in water and vinegar, place them over the area, and press firmly with powders.
And if someone suffers from the breaking of salt in the wound, place that which is left behind into its cavity to prevent more moisture from entering.
Then treat him until he recovers completely.
But if an abscess forms in the area, then treat it with soft poultices until he is cured.
It seems that you are referring to chapter 11 of this medical treatise. Is there anything specific from this chapter that you would like me to translate or explain further?

Here is my line-by-line translation of the text:
Furthermore, consider that the shape should be according to the amount of elevation of the eyelid, as this already varies among individuals, because there are those who require a large incision on the eyelid depending on the extent to which the eyelid is softened.
Then take the spatula and place it over the two lines you have marked, starting from the large tear duct towards the smaller one. And if your incision is close to the natural hairline, it should be as wide as a king's ring.
Then place the ounce in one of the two corners of the chain, thoroughly scrape it, and then sew the two lips together using fine wool thread or glue, wipe away any blood, and use some adhesive to stick the superfluous hairs on both eyebrows, if you wish to do so; otherwise, leave them be.
After three or four days, remove the stitches made with wool thread and treat it.
If you prefer, leave the wound without stitches and treat it with drying and constricting agents; however, for an elevated eyelid, you need to seal the wound and promote adhesion. Stitching is better, as the ancient physicians would say.
But there should be concern for the patient's well-being, and it is a good practice not to induce fear in them.
Another way to examine this is to look for signs on the eyelid; you might see a shape resembling a myrtle leaf. Then, lift the eyelid with three separate but joined hooks like this:
If you cannot obtain these hooks, and this is not preferable, then take a needle with thread; place the needle in the middle of the shape, and insert one end of the thread near the larger tear duct, and the other near the smaller one. Make sure both ends are even, and then use your hand to lift all of it up as evenly as possible, just as described before.
Then close the edges of the wound with stitches, and treat it until it is fully healed.
However, if an abscess occurs due to your incision or opening, you must drain that abscess with a sharp tool and apply ointments and poultices.
And sometimes, on the eyelid where the hairs have grown inward, you should use what we've discussed regarding incisions; however, stitching in any case is more of an artificial remedy.
Ataxinir am cannas es segon aquesta forma: Here is my translation of the provided text: And you have already made incisions at the ends of each part, where you have placed the threads.
Then add each thread with subtlety beneath what superfluous parts of the eyelid remain, constrict the ends of each part tightly and leave them there for a few days; the tissue bound by its constriction will die and decay until it drops off on its own.
But if it is delayed, then break them with tongs; after that, cure the wound until it is healed.
Once it is solidified, lift up the eyelid without piercing skin or hair follicles.
And this is how you treat two channels according to this form: Make sure the length and width are neither more nor less than what is necessary.
The number XII in Roman numerals represents 12, so this may indicate that it is chapter twelve of the treatise.
On raising sharp hairs on the eyelid with a needle when the hair is hard.
When the unnatural, hard, and coarse hairs of an eyelid are sharp and painful, perform this operation: take a delicate needle and place it on some fine silk thread or lion's hair; then arrange its ends in such a subtle way. And let the length of the thread be about one palm's width.
Then you assemble another fine thread underneath them in the same way, and use its ends if you wish.
Place the patient's head in your lap, and be close to sunlight so that your work is clear, for this operation is delicate and precise.
Then introduce the needle into the root of the hair that requires manipulation, and make it pierce through the eyelid swiftly while extracting it from above the natural hair.
Pull the hair outward from above and insert it into the forceps, taking care that there are only one or two or three hairs, but not more.
Then draw your hand towards yourself, so that the hair is removed with the forceps from the eyelid, leaving it with its own natural hairs.
If the forceps are pulled and the hair is not removed, draw the forceps towards the area you have prepared with the thread, until it is extracted from above.

Certainly, here is my best attempt at translating each line of the provided text into English while maintaining its medieval medical context:
Here is my translation of your provided text:
When it appears in the eyelid and is the contraction of the eyelid, which is contracted towards itself or to one side, due to bad consolidation after an injury, or cauterization, this condition is called leporina and such ptosis can be natural or accidental; it may happen due to bad healing of a wound, operation or cauterization, or something similar.
The procedure to operate on the patient consists of cutting that consolidation and separating its lips or edges, placing between them a bit of linen cloth, and tying both together so they can heal.
You should not use treatments that dry or constrict the area because if you do so, ptosis will return worse than before.
Use treatments that soften the area such as fenugreek, and make a mouthwash with water in which you have soaked figs and flax seeds; or use a diaqulon ointment, which has been made liquid with one of the oils, and soak the cloth in it before applying this to the patient.
The key to your successful treatment is perforating with any tool that has not yet been consolidated according to its initial shape.
And this operation that we have mentioned is nothing but some kind of correction or adjustment to ensure the hernia does not return to its previous shape.
I'm happy to assist you with your request! However, please provide me with more information or context for what you would like me to do with this input. Is there a specific task you'd like me to complete regarding Capitol .xiv?
Regarding the treatment of an inguinal hernia that occurs beneath the eyelid.
This type of hernia that is performed beneath the eyelid, which is truly called an inguinal hernia, can be either naturally occurring or accidental.
Accidental hernias can be caused by blows, cuts, cauterization, or other similar injuries.
The method of operation for this is to take a needle with double thread and insert it into the flesh, passing it from the left lacrimal bone to the right one, ensuring the thread reaches both ends of the affected area.
Then stretch the flesh away from the divided ends using your needle and suture it with an ample spatula. Here is the translation of the provided text:
And the ends of these two incisions must meet at an angle to form a point where they intersect, so that when brought together it forms their figure.
And this figure is the Greek letter: Lambda.
Then secure the flesh with a length of string as thick as his finger below it, which is what we call the eyelid.
Then bring together the separated parts and sew them with wool thread; then treat it as mentioned earlier about softening medicines and compresses until it heals.
And if it opens up anywhere by incision or suture or cauterization, then you must make a flat incision on the skin of the eyelid as described earlier. Then separate with compresses between the two lips, just like we said before.
At the end of this treatise on treating dislocations when they are external or below, as it runs in its operation according to how it is prepared for treatment, and that takes various forms.
The skilled surgeon always prepares and uses various techniques to restore the body's shape as closely as possible to its natural form; this is done with the appropriate operation and instruments, taking into account the patient's specific needs.
Chapter 15.
On the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or to the cornea.
When this consolidation occurs in many men such that the eyelid is stuck together above the white of the eye and movement as well as its natural functions are prohibited, it is necessary to insert the tip of a needle under the eyelid and lift it up with that or extend it with your finger.
Then you should cut the adhesion with a thin spatula, which is not too sharp to avoid cutting and causing discomfort during the operation, and use the spatula gently so as not to injure the eye with its sharpness.
And your incision should easily remove that adhesion, facilitating the return of the eyelid to its natural shape and healing all adhesions.
Then you should put the eye in salt water to wash it, or you can use distilled water dissolved with alum.
Then separate the eyelid from the eye with a feather, place on the eye wool soaked in egg white, and on the third day use consolidative substances until it is healed.
Chapter 16.
On the incision of the claw and the prominence of flesh of the lacrimal glands.
Here is the translation of your first sentence:
And both species begin in the greater tear duct, as it gradually covers the eye and obstructs light and the movement of air.
Now the way to proceed with this incision is that the patient should sit in your lap and open his eyes; raise the eyelid with your hand; then take a curved needle, tie a piece of string around it, and extend that over both sides. Then take a needle and insert into it a hair from a horse or an ox or cow, or something similar; double the end of the needle slightly and place it in the middle of the eyelid, pierce that with the needle, and tie the eyelid to the hair with thread; extend this over both sides, then remove all the skin that covers the pupil. And you will keep it in place with this hair at the back of his head.
Then cut the remainder at the root of the tear duct with a delicate spatula or small scissors; and let the flesh around the greater tear duct remain, lest an incision there cause continuous weeping.
And sometimes the claw has the sole once stretched or with bile, as we have said, and then it is scraped with the lion's spatula which has this shape:
Make sure that you do not touch the corneal layer with the spatula and that it does not cause a rupture; ensure that the pupil is perforated.
Then place a small amount of crushed salt or three drops of sigillum oil in the wound and leave it for another day; then treat it with what is necessary to ensure healing.
If the claw is not nervous and you cannot insert the needle into it or if it is not embedded in that one, then note that this type of claw can be cured with medications; it will also be healed as I have described in the section on divisions.
And if you wish to incise it, then open the wound of the patient and take a fine lion spatula with a sharpened edge according to this form: with delicacy. If you find that it is thinned and hardened with rash in it, then pour some of your oil into the wound with three drops of sigillum or with three grains or crushed salt, and leave the wound for another day.
Here is my best attempt at translating the provided text:
And then repeat your operation until it is healed.
If the prominence of the tear meat is causing great harm when touched, it should be suspended with a string; make an incision from one side to another, but do not finish the incision completely so as not to cut off the flow of tears.
Then, apply distilled water from goat's milk into the eye until it is healed.
It seems that this is the indicator for Chapter 17 in your text. Is there another section you would like me to translate?
On the incision of an abscess and what is born from tight, infected flesh.
Some injuries in the eye cause the formation of rigid flesh that covers the pupil or is close to/extends over the eyelids, and it strongly compresses the eyelids towards the outer edges, looking like a balustrade.
When operating on the patient, have them lay their head on your lap; then, open their eyes and gather all that rigid flesh with suitable strings/threads, and tie it off with a forceps or hook; next, cut away the flesh at its beginning so that everything is finished with the incision, taking care not to let go of the eye during your operation.
And let your incision be made with the instrument that you incise those [with], or with a sharp razor that we have recounted in the incision of the nail, or with small scissors with which hair is clipped according to how it will come up in this chapter.
Once your incision is complete and all that flesh is removed, then fill the hole with powdered salt, or distill into it powder of quicklime and similar to that of corrosive medicines, and place over the wound often raw egg white until you are certain of a cauterized abscess.
And if some cause of infection remains and the blood is cauterized, and you fear an internal abscess, then open the wound and treat that abscess with whatever removes it, and then repeat the operation on them until they are healed, and do likewise to the tightened flesh which occurs in the hole of this kind.
But know that all cure of the open wound should be done by nature or accident, with iron instruments, and do not put your hand into any of these operations unless you see that the member is enduring said operation.
Chapter 18.
De colleccio de sabel en le huel.
Sabel so venas rogas las quals son testudas sobre le huel e prohibeysso al vesement la sua operacio, e develican le huel am longitut de dias.
Therefore, it is necessary at the beginning to consider whether the wound in which he was injured is strong and there are no other illnesses that he has. Then you collect his injury.
And have the patient place their head on your lap. Then tie up those veins with a thread or two, depending on your discretion. And this thread must be made of thin and delicate material, prepared in such a way:
Here are two threads greatly connected by one body as follows:
Then those veins are tied up with delicate forceps and care is taken to remove the blood as it appears, ensuring that these veins do not move from the wound or get twisted.
Make sure you do not touch the wound with the tip of the rib cage. If your operation is at midday in front of the sun, be very firm during your operation so that you only cut these veins.
And when you have completed this process, then pour into the wound hot or warm water so that with its sharpness it erodes what is stuck to the injury.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
And then repeat the process on him a second time in the same manner until he is healed.
This is how the scissors should be shaped:
It appears that you are referring to chapter 19 of this medieval medical treatise. Is there anything specific from this chapter that you would like me to translate or explain?
On the reduction of a dislocated nose."
When you treat a patient with caustic cautery or sharp, burning medicine as described earlier and it does not heal, do not be discouraged; instead, create an incision over the abscess to promote its maturation, and extract all the moisture from it until the bone is exposed.
Once the bone is exposed and you notice any corruption or blackening on it, use this instrument to remove it:
It is called an asper capita, and it should be made of iron; the rounded head should have a pattern of points created by filing or fine-tooth chiseling (as shown in this illustration): [insert illustration depicting the instrument here].
Place the instrument over the corrupted bone area and then rotate it among these points; press down with your hand gradually until you know that all of the corruption has been scraped away.
Do this several times, then restore the area with drying and astringent agents.
When the wound has healed and good flesh has grown in it; when the patient's body is separate from the injury and remains so for 40 days without any recurrence or abscess formation, you can be sure that they are cured.
Certainly! Here is my translation of the provided text into English:
Let the end of the iron be triangular and let its shaft gradually become smaller towards that extremity.
Then place it on the bone and let that be near the lacrimal bone; extend your hand a little from above, then turn your hand with the rod until it penetrates the entire bone, and you will feel the patient's pain as he throws out air.
So then restore the place with astringent, drying medicines as you have been taught.
When the flesh and place have become hardened, then the matter that had escaped to the exterior returns into the nose, thus this is more light for the patient.
It seems that "Capitol" here refers to a chapter or section heading in the medieval medical treatise you provided. The number ".xx." likely indicates Chapter 20, so this text is likely part of Chapter 20 of an ancient medical book.
On the reduction of the swelling on the head.
When the head swells completely and there occurs no damage nor diminution in the wound, then you should relax the patient, then continue on, then place bellows on the neck without scarifying it and suck for a good suction; then place on the head an ointment that is made from aconite, aloe, incense, and resin, and then bind the poultice to the head with many cloths.
And the way to use the powders is to take lion's skin cloth, and each piece of cloth should be doubled into four folds; make powder from these pieces.
Then place one layer on top of the other according to the amount that is required. Then press down on these layers with a strong, tight cloth binding; repeat the cupping with suction and scarification; afterwards, remove the cups and keep the wound tightly bound day and night.
But if during this time the ligament becomes softened, you must ensure it is not too tightly bound.
Then remove the binding both during the day and at night, as we have described.
And if you find the wound has not yet healed, apply a new poultice with powders and continue with the binding and cupping until it is cured.
It seems that your provided text ends here. Is there another portion you would like me to translate?

And then extract the needle and place it on a clean piece of cloth infused with egg white and alcohol, allowing the thread to pass through the eye of the needle.
Then treat the wound with something that comforts it until the plague is healed.
In some cases, gather scraps from all sides with a circle of cloth that tightly fits over the large prominence of the wound, then pierce it with a thin spatula that reaches the bottom of the wound, allow the white moisture to flow out, and remove the wound immediately.
And then bind it tightly until it is healed.
It seems you have provided me with a new paragraph or section of the text. Here is my translation:
De curacio de alconati.
This ailment that is called alconati is nothing but sanies (purulent discharge) which accumulates in the heel resembling descending water, and it is not that.
The way to treat this is as follows: make the patient sit on a properly arranged and straight chair, then take his head in your hands from both sides and press it so that you stop the flow of sanies to the affected parts; then let it dry without flowing further, and block its passage. The patient will see the causes for themselves this way.
And if it does not flow downwards, then you should know that it is water (fluid).
But if the discharge's flow is not prepared as we have said, then make the patient sit between your legs and take a thin spatula; place it over the panniculus carnosus (a layer of skin) just below the continuation of the conjunctiva with the cornea in the eye's corner, so that the sanies is wiped away.
Once it is wiped away, then you should drop into the wound a water-based solution in which you have mixed honey or an aqueous extract of boiled fenugreek and honey.
And then it should be treated for other causes until it is healed.
I assume you would like me to translate this text into English as well. Please provide the source sentence, and I will be happy to assist you!
On treating cold water diarrhea.
We have already mentioned the types of diarrhea in the previous section and which one needs to be addressed with specific treatment, depending on the patient's health condition.
Then make the patient lie down between your two legs on a cushion and squeeze his belly, forcing him to pass stool.
And then place your left hand near the patient's left eyelid if it is left-sided diarrhea, or your right hand if it is right-sided.
And then with your right hand take some almond paste if it is left-sided diarrhea; or with your left hand if it is right-sided.
And then place the tip of the almond paste near the edge for the thickness of a finger in the white part of the eye towards the inner corner, and immediately rotate your hand away from it.
And then insert your finger into the patient's rectum and feel that the almond-shaped object has reached the end of its journey.
And make sure that the length of the almond's journey from the anus to the prison is equal to the distance from the pupil to the end of the blackness, which is the crown of the eye; for it is through this pupil and the clarity of the corneal layer that you see with your vision.
Then place the almond within the water-filled space and gently pull it down once, then do so again; if the water level drops even slightly, you will see that the patient's sight is focused on it and the almond in his eye.
Wait for a short moment, then if the water level has dropped again, you should remove it once more before the almond falls out.
And when it has settled and the water level no longer drops, you can easily extract the almond, turning it little by little with your hand; then dissolve a small amount of clear gem salt in the water and use that to rinse the eye from within; afterwards remove the eye dressing, or replace it with a poultice made from rose oil, egg white, and gauze, applying it so as to cover the eye.
May we and those who are of our time place an egg white poultice over this wounded body.
And if it does not obey you with your finger inside the abscess due to its hardness - for this is one of those men whose abscesses are very hard -, then take the spatula which is named 'alberid', and this is how it looks:
And thus, pierce with that spatula this joint, do not stop your hand in the hole, and make way for the pus to come out of this soft place.
And then remove the pus as we have said before.
You must complete the treatment, have the patient prepared lying down decently in a dark room, and forbid them from any movements.
Place yourself in front of the patient so that you can see their nature clearly, and do not hit them on the right or left side of their head.
And let the healing begin according to its disposition within three days.
And then untie the patient from that dark room and expose them to fresh air, let them see some light, and repeat this process on the seventh day.
And do not perform this during the time of treatment or immediately after applying the infusion. It is important that you remove this to allow the water to flow more easily due to its abundance and urgency.
However, if an abscess occurs suddenly, it is necessary to lance the boil before the seventh day and treat it with a remedy that draws out pus.
Then you will cover the patient's eyes and place a mask over their face to guide them into darkness for several days, keeping them in the deepest shade.
And they will gradually be taken out of this darkness and told about their condition.
Know that the apprentice is not exempt from some blindness during this operation, so you must be bold about performing it.
We have already come across some of those who are skilled in the art, and some claim that they made fire in the air pump even though it was pierced by a metal wire.
However, I have not seen anyone in our land who has achieved this, nor is it written about in the books of the ancients; perhaps this is a new phenomenon.
And these are the forms of different types of madness for those who are ignorant of them:
Whether they are made of horn or iron itself, and their ends have this triangular sharpness, the sharpest point is thus shaped.
Chapter 24."
De la curacio de carn nada en le nas.
When in the nose are born diverse tissues aligned, of which some cause is assembled to resemble scorpion stings or polyps; and this disease is called polypus because it resembles that represented polyp. And there is cancerous flesh on him, withered, of a dark colour; and that which resembles lion's flesh but not of the same dark colour.
Thus in that which is not fraudulent nor cancerous lion's flesh, it is necessary to make the patient sit between your two hands and place him out into the sunlight, open his nose, and pick at his warts with your fingernails where those tissues are present. Then extract that which is outside of the nose and divide what you have removed with a thin sharp spatula from one side to another so that you know all flesh has been taken; for if there remains any cause of which excision is possible, then remove it with one of your fine instruments provided nothing else remains. But if it should bleed or if an abscess appears and becomes septic, then you must apply what is required; if it is a malignant abscess, then remove it and cauterise that area to ensure blood is stemmed and all cavities are emptied.
And then pour vinegar or water mixed with wine into the nose. If you open up their nose and observe that there is no more moisture reaching the palate, then know that they are healed.
If the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then you will know that there is still raw flesh inside of them, on top of their nasal bones where no incision has been made.
Therefore, it is necessary to insert some flax thread into the nostrils, and place multiple mustard seeds inside them, leaving about one finger-width or less between each seed; then block up the patient's nose with rags or other materials that you have at hand.
And after doing this, let the scent of it reach into their nostrils, and be smelled over their throat; because children in school often do similar actions with their faces when they want to make farting noises.
Then hold the two ends of this thread, leaving one end sticking out over their nose and keeping the other inside; then cover the mustard seeds with a piece of meat on top of the thread, and keep doing that until you notice that no more flesh is attached to these seeds.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
And then, at the end of the procedure, place a leaden tube in their nose for several days until they are healed.
Make sure to use this method of treatment if you encounter similar cases in the future.
And this is how the form of the purging device should be, through which oils and medicines are distilled into the nose:
And make it out of silver or copper, shaped like a small open lamp, with a similar bowl-like structure and a handle.
You may also make the tube closed like a reed, and leave the outlet of the purging instrument open and flat; there should be a handle at its back end which you can hold when heating oil or water that you want to mix with juices and soluble substances.
Chapter 25.
The nostrils are located at the extremities of the nose.
Sometimes thick crusts form in the nostrils at the extremities of the nose, and it is significant and noted on certain days when the patient neglects to clean them.
And because of this, you must treat the patient at the beginning of their illness and inherit all those treatments. Then place on the affected area either a cauterizing agent or a medicine that is corrosive to it.
But if the incision is delayed and it becomes significant, then consider if it has hardened, turned dark in colour, and feels little, then do not touch it with iron as it is an abscess; for many crusts on those who incise this abscess will cause great harm to them.
And if the abscess is soft to the touch and not dark in colour, and it is possible that incision can be made on all of it, then remove the patient's clothing and make an incision without fear, treating the area with something that dries and constricts it until it is healed.
It seems like you've provided me with a fascinating medieval medical text! I'll do my best to translate it line by line into English:
When it comes to suturing the nose, lips, and ear, which have been disrupted in continuity by injury or similar causes.
Know that when there is the occurrence of separation in continuity of one of these cartilages, it rarely matters in this operation except for in certain individuals.
Therefore, friend, when there is any cause of these injuries in someone and you believe it to be a fresh injury with its own blood present, then align the two edges of the wound with sutures, and ensure that this area heals properly.
And if the edges of the wound are already separated and each one is devoid of healthy tissue, then it is necessary for you to excise any part of the surrounding area until there is no more blood present. Then align the two edges with sutures and tighten them, over which you should apply a mixture of dragon's blood and finely chopped onions, then place on top a piece of diabolic plaster or any other consolidating plaster, and leave it bound for two or three days. After this time, remove the binding and change the plaster, leaving it until the filaments are cut off, and then treat with an ointment until it is healed.

On the incision of the flesh attached to the gums.
When removing growths from the gums that the ancients called *albulus*, it is necessary to cut off this excess flesh with scissors or a knife and then incise it down to its root, allowing blood or sap to flow out freely.
Then place raw wool or other astringent or drying powders on the wounded area.
And if that flesh grows back, cut it away a second time and cauterize it; the cautery will not allow for regrowth.

On the extraction of teeth with an iron instrument.
When the surface of the teeth in the back and front is covered with rough, hard scabs, some of them blackened and others made yellow or green by this, there being thereby corruption of the gums and loosening of the teeth,
Here is the translation of the provided sentence:
Here is my translation of the provided text:
And know that teeth often require many remedies of different shapes and sizes, depending on the procedure you are performing. Therefore, the sharp tool that cuts away parts of the tooth is different from another type of tool that scrapes between teeth. You must prepare these various types of tools as follows.
I am unable to find the meaning of this text, but I can help with any other translations or provide further assistance if needed! Would you like me to translate another sentence for you?
Regarding the extraction of teeth.
When you treat a toothache with all your skill and take great care in extracting the tooth, there is no reason to fear its loss since it is a waste matter that is removed during extraction.
In cases where the patient is forced to have a tooth extracted, you must be absolutely certain which tooth is causing pain, as many healthy teeth can cause discomfort and deceive us into thinking they are the source of the problem. If we extract a healthy tooth and the pain persists after its removal, it means that the diseased and painful tooth has not yet been eradicated, something we have seen occur during jaw operations.
Here is my best attempt at translating the text line by line:
Here is the translation of your first source sentence:
And therefore, do not forget, then take one of those instruments and place it below them on all sides with ease, exerting force for their removal as was done initially.
But if the tooth is shaky or decayed, you must first wrap it in cloth and attach a thin string to its end, ensuring it doesn't break during your grip on it with forceps.
And make sure you carefully scarify all around the gum line, being mindful of your strength to avoid tearing it and leaving a piece inside, as this is often more painful than the initial ailment.
Be aware and do not commit the mistake made by some ignorant barbers in their haste and boldness during tooth extraction, who fail to follow the steps we've outlined; for many times, such negligence leads to severe illnesses in men, which are more challenging to treat, and their roots remain partially or fully intact, or even parts of the jawbone may be extracted along with it, as testified by numerous cases.
Then, after the tooth is extracted, rinse the mouth with either sour wine or vinegar mixed with salt.
Here is my best attempt at translating the provided text:
The shape of the forceps and subtle pincers has a tooth at its beginning that is very elongated with a short handle and thick, so that it does not bend when you need to operate with them.
And they are also this way some times with thick handles so that when you open them they do not bend but have short extremities.
And they are made of Indian iron with straight extremities and on the extremities there are teeth which one goes into another and open with a strong force and sometimes the extremities of these have the form of the beak of a bird called ciconia, so it catches well and has a strong grip.
It seems you are citing the chapter title or number in your original text. If you wish to translate this into English, please provide me with the full sentence so that I may be more accurate with my translation.
On the removal of teeth and extraction of jawbones that have been broken.
When you have to remove a broken tooth and there is some reason for it remaining in the mouth, then it is necessary that you place on the location cotton with borders for one or two days until the area becomes softened; and apply forceps or pincers whose extremities resemble the beak of an bird called ciconia or guanta as described previously.
Their extremities should be made smooth like a pumice stone or a millstone.
And if they do not obey you with these forceps or pincers, then you must cut over the joint and remove all the flesh, introducing this instrument which is called an "atalia," it's a small lever that looks like this:" (followed by a drawing)
And its short thick extremity must be small, not sharpened so it doesn't get stuck.
Therefore, if by this the joint becomes forgetful (or loose), so be it; and if not, help yourself with these other instruments which are of these shapes: The shape of the first instrument is triangular with a thick, pointed end:" (followed by two drawings)
The shape of the second instrument is also triangular but with an even more subtle, pointed end." (followed by a drawing)
And you have already been aided by these instruments, having two levers of which this is the shape then followed by another:" (followed by three drawings) And with other instruments which I will describe later regarding the scraping of teeth; for their assembly is done with this instrument which resembles a large ounce (a unit of weight or mass), and this is its shape:" (followed by a drawing)
Of the triangular, twisted extremity that is somewhat thick, and should not be submerged because it must not be pierced.
And remember that the instruments for loose teeth are similar to other surgical tools.
A skillful and subtle artisan in the art will find that they can adapt according to what the operation means for them and the various illnesses at hand; since there are many diseases which the ancients did not name nor assign specific tools based on their forms or species.
If the bone of the jaw or other bones in the mouth are broken or dislocated, then treat it carefully with what is suitable for you from the tools and forceps we have mentioned for extracting tooth roots; assist yourself with this tool which has the following shape:
And if there is any small swelling, gradually restrain it or hold the mouth shut so that it does not dry out or escape before the bone has been completely perforated; then restore the place with appropriate medicines.
But if there is a small dislocation in the bone, then remove this from the area of dislocation and its blackness, and treat it until it is healed.
Here is my translation of your provided text:
De la cura de las dentz eminentz sobre las autras.
Here is the translation of the first sentence:
And let your incision be the one which you make in too many days due to the hardness of the tooth and that none of the other teeth have been affected.
And if the tooth is prominently exposed after filing down with a rasp or file, then smooth it off using an Indian steel file of this shape:
And it should be entirely made of Indian steel and the handle as well; and let it have very small sharp points like that of a file with which needles are made. With this file, the tooth is filed little by little over several days easily, so that no other teeth are affected or disturbed. Then smooth it off at the end with some rasps, then cut it down with small knives.
And if it is a tooth of which part is broken and it scratches the tongue, then make sure that you smooth off its roughness until this section is evened out, flattened so that the tongue won't be scratched nor will speech be corrupted.
Chapter 33.
On the restoration of damaged teeth using gold or silver file.
When there is a concussion and movement due to a blow or fall affecting the teeth, and the patient cannot exert any strength on what they eat, despite your treatment with constipating medicines being ineffective; therefore, it is recommended to resort to those who are tight-fisted with gold rather than silver, as silver can be melted down, but gold remains unchanged over time.
The thread should be as fine or thick as the amount that can fit between the teeth; and for its preparation, you take the gold wire and double it between two healthy teeth, then twist it with both thumbs between two fingers, or one if multiple, until you reach the healthy tooth on the other side. Then repeat the weaving process from where you started, strengthening your grip with ease and wisdom so as not to damage any teeth.
Make sure your grip on the wire is such that you do not exert pressure on the roots of the teeth, so as to avoid any damage or pain for the patient.
Finally, cut off any excess wire with forceps or a sharp knife, manipulate these pieces, and carefully insert them into the space between healthy teeth and unhealthy ones, ensuring it does not cause harm to the tongue.  It is crucial to exercise caution during this process to avoid any potential injury. And then leave it like that, tight as an oven.
But if it is loosened or torn, tie it with another one in such a way that they are always tight.
This is how the teeth are arranged and the appearance of two healthy molars and two bad ones when joined together:" (followed by an image or diagram)
And when a tooth or two are returned to their sockets and they have regrown as we have described, but they remain bad.
Do not do this except by skilled artisans and knowledgeable people.
Sometimes a piece of cow bone is adapted and shaped like a tooth, placed in the missing tooth's position, tied as described earlier, and left there for a long time.

On the extraction of a ranula from under the tongue.
Sometimes, abscesses occur beneath the tongue that are similar to small wens and prevent the tongue from functioning properly; they can be slightly enlarged as they fill the mouth.
The procedure for treating this involves opening the patient's mouth wide to face the sun and examining the abscess.
If you see that it is of dark or blackish colour, hard in consistency, and the patient does not feel any pain from it, then do not touch this one which is ripe.
If it leans towards a whitish colour and there is moisture, then you put your thumb on it and cut it with a fine spatula; if blood comes out during the procedure, place dry powdered material such as vitriol over it to stop the bleeding.
And now return to your work before you have completed it; let him be washed with sour wine and salt, and cure him with another cure until he is healed.

On the extraction of an abscess from both ears, or one that is located in the throat, as well as other types of abscesses."
When there is a swelling in the throat, these are glands that become like cotton balls, which protrude outward and are known as two ears. When you treat them with what we have mentioned earlier (in the division) and it does not heal, then consider if the abscess is hard, dark-colored, and has little sensation. In such a case, do not touch it with an iron instrument.
And if it is of a reddish color and the root (of the swelling) is thick, then do not touch it with an iron instrument due to the flow of blood; instead, let it mature on its own, and only then either you will cut it or it will break by itself.
And if it is of a white color, soft, and its root is thin, then it needs to be incised (cut open).
And before performing the operation on it (the patient), consider whether the abscess has already reached its full maturity or if it has diminished in size to some extent. Then, expose the patient to the sun, with their head facing you, and open their mouth. The assistant should hold their tongue down using a fine instrument of this shape: [Describe the shape of the instrument]
And it should be made of silver or brass, and be as fine as a knife.
So when you press it with your tongue and the abscess is revealed to you, take the implement and place it in the mouth, then pull it outwards as far as you can. Remove any cause of the tumors, then make an incision with this tool, which has the following shape:" (At this point, the text likely describes or illustrates the shape of the surgical tool.)
Remove any cause of the tumors, then make an incision with this tool, which has the following shape:" (At this point, the text likely describes or illustrates the shape of the surgical tool.) It is similar to a pair of forceps, but its ends are curved so that the hole in each one faces the other, being very sharp and made of tempered iron.
If this instrument is not available to you, make an incision with this spatula, which has the following shape: It should be sharp on one side and blunt on the other.
And once you have incised one margin, incision the other in the same way, and then let the patient's wound be washed with cold water.
But if any blood flows from it, wash it with water infused with the bark of pomegranate or myrtle leaves and similar astringent herbs until the flow of blood is staunched, then treat it until it is healed.
And sometimes there are abscesses in the throat or pustules on both ears; incise these as I have said before in regard to double tonsillectomy.
I have treated a woman with an abscess that had formed in her throat; this abscess was dark in color and gave little sensation; it had already closed up the woman's throat, making it difficult for her to breathe; I prohibited her from eating or drinking water; she would have died within a day or two without intervention.
The abscess had become so severe that it burst, releasing pus through two openings.
Therefore, I surgically treated her by making an incision and inserting a fistula into one of the openings; I then extracted some of the pus, and after removing a large portion, I made another incision to connect it with the other opening; afterwards, I forced her mouth open and pressed down on her tongue; finally, I placed the fistula within the abscess.
And then I cut away a significant part of it, leaving only a small amount of blood flowing from the wound. Here is the translation of the provided text:
Therefore, I bring fire and cauterize his throat with a hot iron, then I walk around and do not know what God has done to me afterwards.
Chapter 37. (Or 'Chapter XXXVII'.)
On the incision of hernia when it is incarcerated.
When the swelling is on the hernia and it is incarcerated and long, then it is called "perpendicular"; if it is in the lower part and is thick and round, then it is called a "bubo".
But when it is cured with what we have said in the division, and your cure does not work, and you see that the incarceration has already stopped and it is subtle, then you must incise one which is thick and round; if it is elongated, and contains blood, black or dark in colour, and is not at its centre, then you should fear making an incision on him, as this disease is feared.
And when you see it according to the manner I have said, regarding its whiteness and length, make the patient cough and press his tongue with an instrument that conforms to its shape; then place something on their neck, and pull that down and incise it with one of two instruments which are mentioned in the section on 'two knives'.
And be careful not to cut into that area unless it is absolutely necessary beyond the natural limit, for if you were to cut deeper, you would sever their ability to speak.
Then make the incision, use whatever we have recommended for this kind of operation on two wounds, and care for it until it is healed.
But if the patient is terrified of the procedure, you must use discretion in cauterizing them without causing fear. The method for the cautery on them should only involve hot water; place their head upon your lap and then press down on their tongue with the instrument we discussed previously. Next take some of the water that has been mentioned in the chapter on cauterization, and mix it with a living organism, like eggs, until you have formed a paste that is neither too thick nor too thin. With this mixture, fill the cavity of an instrument shaped as follows:
Let the end of this cavity that holds the medicine be similar to the bottom of a spoon's bowl; place the instrument with the medicine upon their tongue and have them lay on their side so that saliva or mucus may flow from their mouth due to the intrinsic nature of the medicine, thereby preventing any part of it from descending into their throat and choking them.
Then take your hand and apply the medicine, pressing it onto the uvula for a period of half an hour until you see that it has turned black and become numb due to the action of the medicine.
And if you wish, take a cork and wrap it around the end of the rod, then dip the cork in the medicine and insert the rod with the cork into a tube from above until the cork sticks to the tube. Do this several times until you achieve the desired cauterization effect on the grape, then leave it alone as it dries out and falls off within three or four days.
And if you find that the medicine needs to be reapplied, do so and repeat the cauterization process by cleaning around the grape with a cork dipped in vinegar, modifying what is within the area of the medicine, and wash it with water. Treat the exterior with ointment and gargle inside with mouthwash until it is healed.
And this type of treatment is safer than incision surgery and involves less pain for the patient.
Some patients' ulcers are cured using methods gentler than cauterization and incision surgery, as they can be treated through fumigation in the following manner: take cumin, hyssop, oreganum, rue, scicados arabic, chamomile, broyda, and other similar herbs; mix these causes together into a bowl, submerge them in sour wine and boil. Seal the bowl properly with decent wax, leaving an opening on top where you place an instrument crafted from silver or copper like so: [diagram of the instrument].
And insert the extremity into the patient's mouth so that the vapors reach the uvula above which it is slightly obscured.
Then repeat the procedure on those slightly hidden spots until it becomes dry and make sure you don't perform this treatment at the beginning of the appearance of abscesses as it would cause them to rupture and you shouldn't do that but rather let the abscess heal by itself.
However if you don't have this instrument at your disposal then take a cane and make an owl's beak on its tip to insert into the patient's mouth so that it will be opened as the beak of the owl prevents vapors from entering.
This treatment is good for health.
Chapter 38.
On the extraction of spines or other objects from the throat.
Hidden spots (foreign objects) stuck in the throat, be it fish bones or any other cause.
You should then extract whatever is visible by looking at it and pressing down the tongue with an instrument in front of sunlight to see what's stuck in the throat.
Here is my translation of the provided text: Here is the translation of the provided text:
But if those causes which we have mentioned are not forgotten, then use this lead instrument in the following form:
And even if it is slightly thicker than a finger, at its end there should be a concave shape that can easily be inserted into the patient's mouth.
Raise the top of it upwards and ensure that its tip does not touch the patient's throat bone, as this may lead to injury or damage to either the bone or spine, which is something the doctor should avoid with their hands.
However, if the patient is more knowledgeable about the location of the attached cause and wishes to insert it themselves downwards, then let them take their hand and place the instrument upwards, all according to the amount that has been prepared for them without forgetting anything.
It seems like you may have included a chapter or section number before your previous prompts. Would you like me to include this in my translations as well, or should I focus on translating the text you provide?
On the extraction of leeches attached to the throat.
When the bloodsucker is medicated with what we have mentioned in the division of treatment using medicines and not by cauterization, then look at the throat of the patient under the sun because you should compress his tongue using an instrument that we have recommended to you.
Therefore, when you see the bloodsucker, remove it gently with your finger or a subtle instrument appropriately.
And if it is not possible for you to extract the bloodsucker by hand, then take a concave cannula and insert it into the patient's throat. Place a lit iron rod inside the concavity of the cannula, and do this several times until the leech dies and detaches from the throat. Make sure the patient abstains from water during the day.
Then take a vessel full of cold water and place it at the patient's mouth so that they can rinse their mouth with this water; make sure they do not swallow any of the water but instead spit it out using your hand. The bloodsucker will feel the cold water and come off immediately.
However, if you do not forget what we have previously recommended, then fumigate the patient with incense or asafetida using the instrument that was mentioned for fumigating the throat.
Fay aquo, so en quar cayra.
E es un’autra manieyra de operacio en sufumiguacio de aquella, es que tu prenguas una ola en la qual sian carbos ignitz e la ola sia cuberta am una cobertora en le mieg de la qual sia un trauc, e sia compausat en aquel trauc la extremitat del instrument; e aprop dega desus la subfumigacio; e pause le malaute la sua boca en la extremitat de la canula, e claugua la sua boca per que la subfumiguacio no sia foro-getada entro que sapias que la subfumigacio es pervenguda a la sancguisugua, quar la sancguisugua tantost cayra.
And if you do not succeed, then repeat the fumigation many times, and keep the patient from drinking, feed him salty foods and almonds, let him drink no water, and it is necessary that he adheres to this treatment for a prolonged period.
This is the shape of the instrument with which one draws blood from the vein when it appears swollen; and it is similar to forceps in some ways, only it has a slight curve to it. It is placed on the vein, and its end resembles the beak of a stork, which is sharp like a rasp, ensuring that when it pierces something, it doesn't let go.
Chapter 40.
In which is the summary of the discussion concerning blisters, their incision, and care.
Blisters come in many different sizes, shapes, and types as described throughout this book.
They are also varied in the way they are opened and cut for two reasons: one is due to the type of blisters themselves; another being the moisture level within them.
The second method is to treat the areas of the body where abscesses occur, as an abscess on the head is different from one on the buttocks; and an abscess in a fleshy area differs from one in a joint; each type requires its own specific treatment approach through surgical intervention.
There are certain abscesses that should not be pierced, but instead require maturation of the pus within them or their enlargement.
Other abscesses need to be drained when they are hard and not yet mature according to their size; for example, those close to the joints or near a main limb, since an abscess by the joint will cause prolonged damage until you can treat what is inside it, and often the ligaments or nerves of that joint become corrupted, causing contraction of that limb. If it is located near a main limb, delaying its drainage after maturation may harm the limb; or if it is close to the anus, drain those which are not yet mature. You should avoid draining one that is bleeding without having achieved full digestion (maturation), but rather drain the one next to the anus so you do not damage the rectum and prolong what is inside the anus, causing a fistula or prolonging its healing time. Mays cove que tu sapias la hora de la perforacio de la apostema, e aysso es quan es maturat.
And you should know that it is mature when there is a reduction in pain and a cessation of fever, along with the diminishing of swelling and pulse rate, as well as the sharpness of the head of the abscess, and other signs.
And take note that you should recognize the perforation in the place below the abscess, which is a sign of healing and subsidence of the swelling.
And the perforation should always be made through the length of flesh or body if abscesses are on hands or feet and in places such as joints, nerves, tendons, etc.; and finally, in all other similar locations where there is no reflection; for those areas that do reflect light, use a perforated tool appropriate for that particular limb.
However, when the abscess is in a fleshy area, it's better to delay its perforation until digestion of its contents has been confirmed according to what we've explained; because if you pierce it before then, there may be an extension of pus from within and some dirtiness or hardening at its edges that make it difficult for you.
But some abscesses need to be perforated based on the width of flesh or body part due either necessity itself or because it is required by that specific limb.
And now, make a small hole for small abscesses, large holes for big abscesses and wide cuts or multiple sections depending on the size and variety of the abscess.
Other abscesses require a conical incision and should be cauterized when they are ready, just as it happens with those that appear in large groups of boils.
And for those that are cut open with three-angled sections; and for those where the incision is made like a myrtle leaf shape, such as in abscesses of the neck.
And for those that require round or crescent-shaped incisions.
But for those who do not have abscesses that are as large as lions on their skin, you should only make a shallow or flat perforation.
When the abscess is large and has already formed a healthy core, you should perforate it without hesitation to remove all the pus at that moment; instead, extract one portion from it, then compress the abscess the next day, later extract a larger amount of pus, and repeat this process multiple times until the hole closes.

Regarding the incision of abscesses that occur on the back of the head.
On the back of the head, there are small abscesses and nodules that contain thin layers or membranes, and their appearance is mottled.
They have points or heads, and within them, there is moisture similar to pus. Some of these nodules contain a substance resembling dust or powder, similar in appearance to pollen; while others are stone-like and hard.
When incising all of them, and during the extraction, there is no fear or concern; you must ensure that their excision does not cause any injury to the surrounding flesh.
The operation for the incision of these nodules involves using an instrument suitable for this purpose, which is called an 'entromes', knowing that it contains what you need.
If the content within is moist, then you must make an incision along its length with a shallow cut that follows this shape:
Here is the translation of the provided text:
Here is the translation of the provided text:
Here is my translation of the provided text:
And if there is an abscess with greasy nodules, then you should incise it like this: Make a cross-shaped incision, and once the two lips of the incision are open, scrape away all the divided matter, and exert your skill in extracting the tunic that contains it.
But if the wound becomes irritated, then do what I told you first.
Similarly, perform the incision and treatment for an abscess with hardened matter as we have described earlier; the incision over the hardened abscess is gentler, as it has less blood and moisture.
There are some abscesses that form on the head of certain men with very little moisture; this is caused by an incision I made on the head of an old woman, which resulted in a hard, rough, white stone-like mass that could not be broken and if anyone had hit it, it would have hurt.
However, in other abscesses on the head, this phenomenon does not occur, just like the abscesses that form on children's heads and the roots of their ears; all these abscesses should have a shallow incision.
And make an incision in those of the lower part of them, so that the body is relieved at the lowest parts.
Then treat these with what is appropriate for their cure.
This appears to be a chapter or section heading, but without additional context, I cannot determine its exact meaning. Could you provide me with more information so that I can accurately translate it?
On the excision of scrofula which occurs on the neck.
Faint blotches frequently appear in these ulcers on the neck, under the arms and in the armpits; and some occur in other parts of the body.
And those that occur on the neck, and are blotches formed between them, and any scrofula of these is within its own tunic, just as in the glands and ulcers of the head, as we have related.
And the types of these scrofula are blotches, for some of them are stony, and some contain moisture, and those that are malignant do not obey any treatment.
So when you see one of good disposition in the Touchard, whose colour is like that of the cord, and which extends to every part, but is not attached to the neck nerves, nor to the veins, or to the arch; and it is not deep, then you should incise this with a dry cut on the upper part below the body's midline within Boyde's line, and remove that from any other parts, and open two lips of the cord up to an ounce, or several ounces if need be as we have said for ulcers in the head, and extract it little by little.
And it is important to exercise caution so that veins or nerves are not cut.
If the tumor hasn't softened enough and you can't adjust your hand for the incision, or if it disturbs the patient and leads to an unnecessary cut; because if you were to cut a vein or artery and thereby hinder your operation, apply powdered sulfuric acid or other powders that stop bleeding, compress the wound, and leave it so that the sharpness of the abscess is supported and let the wound become soft and start to ripen. When blood is cut off.
Therefore, return to your operation before it is completed.
Then examine with your finger if any cause of the other small scrofulae is broken, so cut them open and clean them.
And if it is on the root of the large vein, know then that you should not cut this scrofula from its root. Make sure you grab it with a strong, folded cloth and that you let it fall by itself without causing harm.
And then fill the wound with old cotton which you have already dipped in Egyptian ointment and treat him accordingly.
And if you open up that scrofula completely, then make sure that the two lips of the wound are joined and sew it as soon as possible so that there is not left any superfluity.
However, if you notice that there is remaining superfluity due to the size of the scrofula, it is necessary that you understand opening its root, remove it and apply the suture and what has been described.
And for those scrofulas that contain humidity, pierce it with a superficial perforation here where you see the place of its maturation to you, and make a puncture of what we have said is beneath the body.
And then apply the puncture, cover it with ointment and something similar to those, so that it corrodes what remains of corruption. And then when you see the wound already cleaned, treat it with an ointment of generative flesh until it is healed.
It seems that the text you provided has only 13 chapters or "capitols," including the one with the number xliii., so it is not clear what chapter xlvi. would be referring to. If you provide me with more context, I could try to assist you further.
Of the incision of the abscess accidentally in the throat.
The ancients called this incision epilhot, and I have not seen anyone in our land who has undergone it.
And here is the inscription of their speech:
When a person has a disease in their brain, it is necessary to avoid extracting the epilhot, as all of the patient's veins and major vessels are here.
But for those who have abscesses caused by cautery in their mouth, throat, or ears, and the disease is not in the bone, it is necessary to use the incision of epilhot to avoid the loss that occurs due to perforation.
Therefore, when we want to do this, we must incise the epilhot below three circles of the epilhot circles, or four times with a small incision for its width in that which is between two circles by quantity, so that the incision is in the skin, not in the cartilage, and this place is suitable for incision as it is devoid of flesh and the patient's blood vessels are far away.
Here is the translation of the provided text:
Here is my best attempt at translating the provided text:
And leave the wound open for some time.
When the time comes to be cautious about making an incision, take two edges of the wound's lips, and see that only cartilage is cut.
Then administer medicines that promote flesh growth until it is healed.
And Albucasis says that the main point of this discussion we have recounted is to show how some of these abscesses can penetrate the patient's throat, and the patient may come back from death, their soul returning to them, and some will cut through the epiglottis so that the patient breathes at the site of the wound, thus saving them from death.
And for this reason, I advise leaving the wound open until the poison of the disease is expelled; and the poison will be expelled in three days; after that, I recommend cleaning the wound, and cure it until it is healed.
And what I have seen in my practice is that a servant thrusts a spit into her throat and pierces part of the lung with it, and I was called to treat her; she made a noise like a moan from the dead, and I discovered an abscess and drew out pus which had come from the wound.
Sure, here is a translation of the provided text line by line into English:
And it did not harm the servant if she did not weaken her voice, and after some days she returned to an improvement of her dispositions.

Regarding the incision on an abscess that occurs on the neck outside of the wound, which is called a hernia of the neck.
This abscess called a hernia of the neck is a large abscess according to the constitution of the body and occurs in women.
And it happens in two ways, either naturally or accidentally.
And in the case of a natural occurrence, it is not easy to cure.
The accidental occurrence is of two types; one resembles fatty tumors and the other way is similar to an abscess caused by arterial blockage, which can be feared. It is not necessary to use forceps on them unless it is a small one. Here is my best attempt at translating the provided text into English:
It seems like you've provided me with a fascinating glimpse into medieval medical practices! I'll do my best to decipher and translate each line for you.
De seccio de las specias de nodes."
There are many types of lumps, and I have already mentioned all the species of them in the previous section.
And now I shall explain to you the distinction between a lump and an excrescence, as there may be some doubt.
So I tell you that an excrescence is a quality accompanied by fever and violent pains while the superfluity ebbs; and it is complete putrefaction which, when the fever, pain, and heat cease.
However, a lump is not a quality nor does it have fever or pain, as in the case of the lion's paw which has its own sac.
And it is according to the colour of the flesh, and its beginning is like a kernel, and it is made in such a way as wax, either large or small, and there are two species of them, whether they be greasy and contain moisture, and the colours of the moistures are many, as I said in the previous section.
So now, when you reach the treatment of a lump, you should express it and inquire about it at its beginning with the instrument which is called an entomes, according to how its form will be in the chapter that comes next.
This medieval medical text describes various treatments and examinations for different ailments, with a focus on joint pain, gout, and issues related to the feet and intestines. Here is my line-by-line translation:
And then with your hand, close off the area according to the size of the abscess, and carefully extract the contents; examine what has come out.
And if the running moisture is forgotten about, regardless of its colour, you shall make an incision with a superficial section as I have instructed for other abscesses.
And if there is no moisture present in the contents removed, then you shall understand that it is a fatty abscess.
Dry it with a section in the shape of a cross, following this form: As I have taught you, suspend it with the thread and easily remove the fatty tissue from all sides; keep the skin or sack, if possible, on that [abscess] and extract the healthy part with a knot.
However, if it [abscess] breaks during the operation, it is not possible to extract that healthy part; you shall wipe away what has spilled and then remove the rest of it in pieces until nothing remains.
For if anything at all remains, be it little or much, the knot will return as before.
Certainly! Here is my attempt at translating the provided sentence:
And if it is not large, then you sew its two lips together and treat it with something that encourages flesh growth.
If the pulsating vein is contrary, or non-pulsating, then you cauterize and fill the place with powdered vitriol, leaving it tight for two or three days until the ulcer matures and the blood ebbs; then return to cut away what remains of the tumor.
It seems you may have provided an incomplete prompt. Could you provide me with more information so I can continue assisting you?

De aquels so las formas dels intromesas, e so de tres specias, que de aquels es alcu gran, e de lor es migier, e de lor es petit.
The way of introducing the large (syringe) is as follows:
The procedure for introducing small objects is as follows:
If it is about iron, fulminate of mercury, or cooled extremities, prepare them well so that the introduction into abscesses may be swift.
These are the ways of an expert, they are called 'albereds', and one such person is known as Berid.
There are three categories of this procedure: large, medium and small.
The method used by an experienced practitioner for the larger procedure is as follows:
An expert's technique for medium-sized objects involves:
The way an experienced individual operates with small objects is as follows:
I assert that these abscesses, ulcers, fistulas and boils are caused by something entering the bones or other factors.
Round and thick objects are made like this: lions, as well as large needles with which the shields are sewn; they can be made of citron wood, horn, iron or silver. The best ones are those made from citron wood.
Here is the translation of the provided text:
And they are of three types; some of them are long, others medium-sized, and still others short, depending on the size of the fistula and its degree of constriction.

Shape of the medium-sized lead instrument:
Shape of the small lead tool:
The shapes of the hooks are varied, with some being simple and having only one curve, while others come in three sizes: large, small, and medium.
And some have body hooks, which also come in three varieties.
Some have hooks with two curves, also available in three types.
And some possess implements with three curves, which too come in three varieties.
All of these tools have their respective places where they are required.

They are made of animal fat, similar to lard, which is then processed into alcohol.
And at the tip of the wound is a hidden spatula, and in it there are small compartments inside and out, when you wish to see them.
The shapes of the spatulas, which are hidden within the aforementioned compartments for puncturing abscesses without the patients realizing it, and that you do not notice, are of three types: large, small, and tiny. And these are the shapes of those spatulas:
The shapes of the cupping glasses used to draw out blood, and they are also three types: large, small, and tiny. Their shapes are as follows:
They are made of citrus peel, rounded with some length to them, and they are thin.

Here is the translation of the provided text:
Chapter XLIV.
Regarding the perforation of abscesses that form after an insect bite.
These abscesses that appear after an insect bite are a type of hard scrofula, which contains a core or nucleus.
And for those that contain moisture or humors, they should be incised with a lunar-shaped blade as per the following diagram: from line G to line B. Once you have evacuated all of the pus and unhealthy matter from the abscess, fill it with old court wools and leave them there until the next day.
Then let the wool be taken away and cured with an appropriate ointment until it is healed.
And if the abscess is of the type that forms nodules or scrofula, then you should incise it in the same way we described for scrofulas earlier.
If the plague has spread in such a way that it forms putrefaction or decay, then apply the cautery as we have mentioned before.
Here is my translation of the text you provided:
De seccio de apostemas que accideysso per arceria o per vena.
When an artery is broken and the tendon above it has healed, then many abscesses occur, there are signs by which inflammation and abscess can be recognized whether due to arteries or veins: because when an abscess is from an artery it lies deep in the heart's sinews; and that when you press on the abscess with your fingers, a sound like hissing can be heard.
And what is due to veins appears round at the breast's surface.
Making an incision over this abscess is a mistake, especially in those who have suffered from gout, and also in the joints, neck, and many parts of the body; and it is very large, therefore its treatment with iron should be avoided, and those located on extremities or head must be prevented.
However, in the case of one whose abscess results from inflammation of the arterial opening, make an incision on the tendon in depth; and now uncover the incision with hooks, then expose the artery by freeing it from its sheaths.
Then place on it a needle and make that penetrate to the other side, and tie off the artery with double thread in two places - this will help you remember when extracting two arteries which are in the temples.
And then hold the area between two ligaments with a spatula until the blood that is inside it coagulates and the abscess dissolves.
Then apply a cure in which pus is produced until the ligaments fall apart; and then treat it with appropriate ointments until it heals.
If it is an abscess caused by the severing of a vein, you must hold with your hand what is possible of the abscess with a cord, and then insert the needle under the place which you have held underneath your hand, making it penetrate; and let there be in it a thread double so that you extract the other from the other side, and then tie the abscess with a bandage according to what I told you in the grapevine knot in two parts with two ends of the thread.
But if you are afraid of pulling out the thread, insert the sinew with that needle under all the abscess along the incision of the first needle, and tighten your sinews in four places.
Then dry the abscess in its middle so that when what is inside it comes out, you cut off the excess of the cord, and leave what binds it tied.
Then place on them a poultice that you have soaked in wine and oil, and proceed to apply the cure made with leeches and ointments until they are healed.
Chapter one on abscesses that occur due to nerve damage.
Just as abscesses occur in tendons and veins, similarly, abscesses form on nerves when they are struck or damaged due to excessive work or strain.
They usually occur in the areas around joints or ligaments, or any place where bones are vulnerable.
This abscess is severe and takes on the colour of surrounding flesh; it often appears in larger parts of the body and when it's very tight and intense, the patient experiences a similar state of shock.
It is not an abscess that gathers in the middle of the body, and thus it does not require cutting; rather, it affects all parts equally without favouring one side or the other.
In these cases of abscesses in the joints, it should not be treated with iron [tools], for surely it would then lead to contraction.
May he who has a headache or forehead pain be treated with a spatula. If it is a small abscess, then take the forceps and cut it out from its roots.
And if it is large, then you should suspend it with a thread, peel it, and remove it; then apply the plaster with stitches, and treat it until it is healed.
This appears to be the chapter number, which would be "Chapter 11" in English. Would you like me to translate any other text for you?
Regarding the incision of an abscess that occurs on the cheek or stomach." Here, 'de' means regarding or concerning; 'seccio' refers to the act of cutting; and 'accideys' can be understood as happens or occurs. This line sets the context for the following text, which will likely provide instructions on how to treat such an abscess.
I attempt to help some men with visible spots on their stomachs and other parts of their bodies, which are called fungi due to their similarity to mushrooms; these have delicate roots but large caps; and already the edges of these spots have turned inward, indicating one is small while another is quite enlarged.
And I have seen one case where there were two parts inside his belly, which had mushroom-like appearances, and there was no difference between these white, small objects.
And their lips were turned inwards and split, with moisture constantly flowing from it.
So I cut them open and examined one which was about 18 inches long, while the other was approximately six inches.
During the operation and incision of such cases, if you find that the patient is humid and the intestines are white, moist, and small in size, then you should make an incision with a broad spatula, and have your cauteries heated over the fire. You must ensure multiple washes are performed to expel much blood; and if you manage to stop the bleeding, cauterize it.
If you see that the patient is weak and fearful, refrain from using a knife for incision; instead take freshly made lead foil, mold it to fit the intestines as described earlier, and leave it there for two days.
Then secure it tightly with lead foil; therefore, do not cease to apply great tension until it is cut and falls off by itself.
However, if there is a large hernia, then its incision will be somewhat of a cause for fear and worry, especially when it is in the abdomen.
It is possible that you cut him in half, then cauterize it so that it does not happen again.
Then treat the patient until the wound has healed.
And be careful not to rush into cutting deep into something that is dark in color, has little sensation when prodded, and is hard to examine; for it may be a cancerous abscess.
And I will come with the recollection of that bitter experience shortly.
It appears that this may be the beginning of Chapter 52 in a book or document. Is there another line you would like me to translate?
Regarding the treatment for an umbilical hernia.
An umbilical hernia can occur for several reasons: it may be due to tears in the muscle above the abdomen or weakness of the abdominal wall like other hernias; or because of bleeding from a vein or an artery as previously mentioned, or due to trapped wind.
Here is the translation of the provided text: Here is the translation of the provided text:
But if it is due to moisture, then it is not hidden when you press it with your hand, nor is it constrained, or believed to be so.
And if it is due to blood, then these signs will appear: the abscess turns black as it declines.
But if it is due to flesh or meat, then it is a severe abscess, thick and hard, and it has been placed in a specific quantity.
But if it is due to wind or gas, then its touch will be soft.
And for the operation on it, you must consider that if the prominence of the navel is due to arterial blood or venous blood, or wind/gas; then you should be prohibited from treating it, as there is fear and danger involved, just as I have taught you in the chapter where I discussed abscesses caused by arteries and veins.
And if the navel's prominence is due to intestines or hernia, then instruct the patient to lie on their side and remain extended; then take a thread and pass it around the entire circumference of the navel; then command them to lean back between your hands onto their back; then encircle the area you have marked with a wide spatula around the navel; then extend half of the abscess towards the parts above in large stitches; then tie it around [the circumference] with strong flax or cedar, and bind it well.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
And if you have removed the cloth, then take a thin thread; and cut off any superfluous parts of it.
However, if it opposes your incision or vein, then surround it with a knot, and return to your operation; take two needles and put strong thread into them, insert the two needles into the circle you have made around the abscess in a cross shape, making sure they penetrate; then squeeze the abscess into four parts over the needles.
And if you wish, remove the needles and leave the area so that the flesh dries up and falls off on its own; or cut away what is thin and will dry out, then treat it with something appropriate for wounds until it heals.
And if the prominence of the navel consists of flesh that is bare or due to moisture, then treat the abscess as we have said, and remove any blood or moisture that you find there; then treat it with something that covers and consolidates the area.
It seems that this is the text's chapter marker, indicating Chapter 54 of the treatise. Is there another part of the text you'd like me to translate?
On treating fractures." It appears this is the title of Chapter 54, suggesting that it provides guidance on healing broken bones. Would you like me to continue translating from this chapter?
Here is my translation of the text:
And the ancients said that sometimes a disease is located in a place where it can be eradicated; for example, like how a tumor located on the breasts or groin area and its surrounding members are removed to extract all of it, especially when it's still small.
When it is an old and severe case, you should not get close to them, as I cannot cure their illness, nor have I seen another like it, or come across anything similar.
The operation on the patient is carried out as we mentioned earlier; you should proceed and place them in that position, then purge them with black bile sometimes, and bleed them if there is an apparent fullness.
Then prepare the patient for surgery by putting them in a suitable position, and prohibit any sharp objects that may harm them; then make a concave incision with a good cutting tool, being careful not to damage any of their roots. Let the blood flow and do not stop it lightly; squeeze the affected areas and wipe away any thick blood with your hand or an available tool.
Certainly, let's continue with the translation:
# Chapter 54
De curacio de ydropici."
Here is my translation of the provided source text into English:
Certainly! Here is the translation of your provided text:
E quan tu ja has medicat aquesta especia de ydropici timpanistre am medicinas e no comfereys la tua medicacio, lahoras considera, quar si al malaute ja es conseguida debelitat, o es am aquel autra malautia otra ydropici, ayssi cum si es en lu tos o cos de ventre e semblant ad aquels, lahoras guarda te que no le mediques am ferr, quar temor es sobre aquo.
Mays si tu vezes le malaute de vertut exuberant, e am lu no es autra malautia sino ydropici tant solament, e no enfant ni vielh, lahoras la manieyra de la operacio de lu es que tu eleves le malaute entre las tuas mas, e le ministre aprop lu exprema le ventre de lu am la sua ma, enpellen la aygua a la partida dejos del pentenilh, e aprop pren spatum spinos segon aquesta forma:
Let it be made of two sharp sides, with a pointed end like a spatula; but let there be some small degree of shortness in it, that when you use it in the operation, you may not thrust too far into the belly and wound it.
Then consider whether the generation of dropsy is from the intestines; in which case you must make your incision three fingers' breadth away from the navel on his right side towards the hair.
But if the generation of dropsy is due to kidney disease, then your incision must be on the left side of the navel for three fingers' breadth.
And if its generation is due to the malice, then your incision must be on his right side.
And it is not necessary for your incision to be over the side which the patient wishes, because superfluities do not run into that place freely.
Then pierce with the instrument through this line, and introduce into that incision, and lift your hand at the spatula between the line and the belly; you will then flay it, which is about the quantity of a nail or thereabouts.
And then I pierce the skinfold until the spatula reaches the empty space, and this is where water collects. And then extract that [water] and insert an instrument of the following form: It resembles a fine silver cannula; it is made of silver, brass, or lion-colored tin, with a small hole at its lower end and three holes on the sides—two on one side and one on the other. The tip of it is sharpened like a pen, as follows:
At its uppermost end, there is a ring; when the instrument reaches water, this [ring] immediately begins to rise on the instrument itself, thereby evacuating some of the water in an amount half the size of an hourglass, because if you evacuate more than what fits in an hour, then very lightly does the patient die due to resolution of their vital spirit, or it brings them closer to death.
One evacuates [water] in an amount corresponding to the quality of the patient, and according to what your evaluation of their disposition, vitality, and health suggests.
Then extract the instrument and retain the water, which is caused because it is immediately retained by the cord that holds the tube above the navel, of which you have cut according to that manner.
Then repeat the procedure with the instrument on another day if the patient can tolerate it; extract a small amount of water and do this for several days as long as there is fear that too much water remains, but take care not to remove all of it.
May it be that if you fear for the patient's health and see a great amount of water has been released, then treat him with burial in warm sand, apply soothing ointments, wait for a long time under the sun; and give him drying medicines until he is healed.
Cauterize the stomach, and the belly and liver soon after water extraction, as I have recounted in what was previously written.
I'm sorry, I did not understand your input. Could you please rephrase the question or provide additional context?
Regarding the healing of children who are born with their urine ducts unpenetrated.
Alcunas veguadas algún dels enfantz es eyssi del ventre de la sua mayre e·l cap de la sua mixtio no es perforat (o es trauc streyt o no es en son loc)
Therefore, quickly close up the opening of the wound with a very thin thread according to this shape:
Then insert into the wound a thin leaden peg and bind it, keeping it there for three days or four.
And when he wants to urinate, let him be urged on, and let him urinate; then return the peg.
And if you do not place lead there, it is possible that the urine which goes over this place will dissolve the peg.
Moreover, when treating an extremely narrow wound with a leaden peg, as we have said, do not keep it in for too many days before removing it.
Furthermore, those with wounds that are not located on the penis itself should be treated in this manner: if their wound is at the end of the penis head and causes death due to an inability to urinate or expel semen as one would normally do so when aroused by touching oneself, then elevate your penis using your hand while ejaculating; it is a serious disease.
The way to operate on the patient is as follows: have him lie down on his back and then extend the head of his penis with your left hand, pulling it out forcefully; cut into the head of the penis at its junction with the foreskin using a sharp blade in a manner similar to that used to split open a feather quill. Do not cause any harm and ensure that the middle part of the glans (the bulbous end) is exposed so that the wound falls within this area.
And make sure that during your operation for the flow of blood, as it often happens; stop and give him something to cut off the blood, and treat the wound before it is healed.
I am happy to assist you with your request! However, could you please provide me with more information or context about what you would like from me? I aim to provide accurate and helpful responses, so any additional details will ensure I can assist you effectively.
Regarding the whitening that occurs on the foreskin of the penis' head, as well as its corruption, blackening, and adherence to the penile head.
This whitening of the penis often happens due to an excess of moist flesh.
One type is malignant, while another is non-malignant.
For the non-malignant type, take a sharp lancet and cut it away completely; then apply Egyptian ointment to the wound; finally, treat it with fine ointment until it is healed.
If the whitening is malignant, appearing in dark colors, you must apply a cautery after its incision and removal.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
Here is my translation of the provided source sentence:
Then attend to the other cure until they are healed.
If there is indeed an outflow of blood, then apply the lunar cautery in this manner:
As the healing cautery has two applications, it is useful for blood outflow and in cases of corrupted wounds.
And if the head of the penis is corroded and destroyed immediately, you should insert a lead cannula into the foreskin so that the patient can urinate through it.
In the case of adherence between the foreskin and the head of the penis (and this occurs only in those who have not been circumcised, as it is not required; but when adhesion happens due to wound or abscess), you must excise with a blunt spatula until the bond is dissolved and the head of the penis is freed from all attachments.
If it is difficult to separate these exceptionally well, then you must excise with a spatula some part of the head of the penis and foreskin, and this is because when the foreskin is thin, it can be lightly perforated by its own thinness.
And then separate the foreskin from the head of the penis using very fine thread, which has already been soaked in cold water so that it does not stick again.
Then clean the wound with astringent vinegar until it is consolidated (healed).
Chapter 7.
On the cleanliness of children and healing those who suffer complications after circumcision.
Circumcision is not the only cure for continuity like other diseases; rather, as it is our operation and our will, and theirs (the children's) in particular, we must assign to them the best procedure and lightest process that leads to health.
So I say that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books, as it was not part of their laws, and we have only acquired this practice through experimentation. The reason for this is that I have found most surgeons and barbers use a knife and a lancet to perform circumcisions and cleaning, and they use thread made from sinew for stitching.
And I have tried all these methods and found that the best cleaning is done with scissors and thread made from sinew rather than with a lancet, because often you remove too much of the glans, as the glans has two tunics, and the inner one remains, which must then be cut again, causing certain injury and pain. Here is the translation of your provided text:
Mays en la operacio am ungla, fort leu obazeys ferr e corromp la tua operacio. And the child's skin is soft by nature, and many times it happens in such a way that there is no need for modification, and I have seen this myself.
The modification that is done with scissors and a thread of sinew has shown me its goodness, for the scissors are of proportional cutting, because the sharpness above is just like the sharpness below; and so when you press your hand down there are two equal sharpened edges, and it cuts according to this comparison in one motion; and compression of the sinew is made with a contoured figure enclosing the entire shaft of the penis, which catches no mistake at all.
The way the first operation is performed is that for children who are old enough to understand a little bit, you should only tie the thread of sinew around their penis and leave it there until the next day.
Then make them happy in every way you can, according to their level of understanding. And then have them stand between your arms, prepared and still; hide the scissors in your hand or under your armpit so that the child does not see them or any of the other instruments.
Here is the translated text:
The shape of the forceps is modified, this is how it looks:
One end is not cut and the other is cutting; it should have a single handle that has two prongs whose length equals the combined length of both handles.
However, be careful not to make a mistake in the modification, as any error may cause you to lose the entire intrinsic chain or part of it during the incision.
Therefore, make sure you extend that part of the forceps at this hour with your nail in front of the affected area and proceed to make an incision according to equality.
And if you cannot hold it with your nail, then remove that part of the forceps with pincers and make an incision.
But if three days have passed and there remains something that is still swollen under the penis after the abscess has subsided, then you should carefully remove it as soon as the abscess has softened; excise that part with ease, and proceed to make an incision according to your preparation.
And be careful not to touch the head of the penis with that, as it should not come into contact with it.
And so treat him with this ointment that solidifies from powders which we have recommended in the treatise of powders.
And if you make an incision over the area according to measurement and follow the directions carefully, it will not harm them.
And continue treating him with what we have advised before he is healed.
This indicates that this information is part of chapter 58, which may provide additional context for the medical treatise you are translating. Would you like me to translate another portion of the text?
The chapter title, "On the treatment of retained urine in the bladder," suggests that this section likely contains instructions on how to treat issues related to urinary retention or bladder problems. Would you like me to translate any specific sentences from this chapter?
Urine retention in the bladder occurs due to blockages caused by stones or blood clots, infections, or tumors, and the treatment methods are similar to those we mentioned for other conditions in this treatise."
And if the problem is not solved with what we have described and it is a severe case for the patient, then you must administer extraction using an instrument called a syringe, which has this form: It should be made of fine silver with a concave lion's head; there should also be a tube made from a bird's feather with the fineness of a ray's spine that is about one and a half palms long, and at its end, it should have a small opening.
The method of inserting the syringe to extract urine is as follows: Take a doubled string and tie it at its end to cotton or wool for a good fit; insert the ends of the string into that which is below the syringe, and cut with scissors any superfluous parts of the cotton. Then push it in vehemently so that it enters the tube; next, extend the syringe with wood and egg white.
Sure! Here is a line-by-line translation of the first source sentence:
Here is my translation of the provided text:
And then extend the gallbladder gently little by little because urine is like wool.
Then extract it and make a remedy with urine, using gauze; do not stop doing this and use the gauze until the bladder is evacuated and the patient experiences relief again.
Chapter 59.
On the quality of bladder irrigation with belladonna and similar instruments that are suitable for this purpose.
When there is an ulcer or abscess in the bladder, or when blood has clotted within it, or when pus needs to be drained, and you wish to introduce water and medicines into the bladder, then do so with an instrument called a clampcedra. Here's how this tool looks like:
However, its end is closed, not perforated. And in it, there are three holes: two on one side, the same number of times.
Its beginning is concave; this is where the liquid that will be pushed in is placed. It should be added according to how much you want to fill it with, until when something from within is pulled out due to any cause and is then poured by being withdrawn, as what happens when naphtha is thrown onto a ship during battle.
When you want to remove moisture from the bladder, insert the end of the reed into the moisture and draw it up with water that is forced towards higher regions, for moisture is drawn into the cavity of the reed.
Then insert the end of the reed into the penis as we have previously described in the surgical procedure; and now drive out the moisture with water that you push through it, for this moisture passes immediately to the bladder, which the patient feels.
The shape of the catheter that is used to empty the bladder takes this form:
It is made of silver or brass, its head being as large as a small feather, and there are fine channels inside it.
Then take a bladder of an animal and place in it the moisture that you wish to introduce into the bladder; then tie this tightly with strong double thread, and heat the moisture over fire.
Then insert the end of the catheter into the penis.
Then grasp your hand over the bladder, with the moistened part tightly closed until the patient feels that this moisture has reached his bladder.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
And then you tie him onto the instrument and do so as you have done with the bladder, expressing by hand to prevent moisture from reaching the bladder.
Chapter 60.
On the extraction of stones (or potentially, gallstones).
We have already spoken about the different types of stones and their treatment with medicines in the previous division, as well as the difference between stones formed in the liver and those formed in the bladder, along with their distinguishing characteristics.
And we have discussed the type of stone that requires surgical intervention with hands and cutting.
The stone formed specifically in the bladder is the one that becomes lodged within it.
And I describe this with clear exposition and brevity.
Thus, I say that stones formed in the bladder mostly occur in children; and their signs are as follows: the urine excreted from the bladder is similar to water in its subtlety and has sand-like particles; the patient scratches their genitals frequently, often cries out in pain, and assumes an arched posture; for this reason, many have had their bottoms pierced by these stones.
And it is easier for children under 14 years old to recover, while curing the elderly people is hard. It could be helpful for young adults as they are in between children and the elderly.
And for those with large kidney stones, the recovery is easier; if they are small in size, it's the opposite.
Thus, when we reach the treatment of this condition, it is necessary at the beginning to modify the patient's diet by making them drink crystal clear water that eliminates all waste from their intestines; because sometimes this waste can prevent the kidney stone from coming out.
Then the patient should be held by their feet and rotated while being shaken a bit for the stone to go down into the bladder or jump out sometimes.
Then prepare the patient's hands and place them under their buttocks so that when the bladder is fully emptied it naturally leans toward those parts.
And then do this procedure on him and repeat all of these steps as needed.
Therefore, if you feel the stone in the space, then quickly perform an incision on them.
And if it does not catch at all with your touch, then you should anoint with oil your left index finger or middle finger, depending on whether the patient is a child or an adult, and insert it into their rectum. On the right side of the stone inside you should feel with your finger. And move it gradually towards the neck of the bladder.
Then press on it with your finger, and expel it to the exterior, away from the incision site.
Instruct the assistant to press on the bladder with their hand; and instruct another assistant to use their right hand to stretch the testicles outward, and with their other hand hold down the scrotum below the testicles, away from the incision site.
Then insert the instrument called 'espatum', which is used for incisions, of this shape: e scindeys en lu aquo que es entre·l cul e·ls genetius, no en le mieg loc, abantz al latz de la coyssa sinistra;
And know that with regards to stones (in the body), there are some which have angles and edges, making their expulsion difficult.
And this is like a lion that resembles an acorn, it is round, and its expulsion is made easier.
Therefore if this stone has edges and margins, adjust it to fit into the fissure.
And if it is not removed in this way, you must insert your fingers into the orifice, or grab it with a decent gesture using your hand's extremity, which should be like a lime that scrapes the stone and does not evade it; alternatively, use a delicate instrument with a curved end to introduce under the stone.
But if you cannot extract it, slightly enlarge the opening and, should you see blood flowing from it, tie off that area with a strand of ground vitriol.
But if there are multiple stones present, first insert your hand into the bladder's opening and probe it; then push a little more inside; act similarly if there are more than two stones.
If the stone is very large, it is ignorant to make a large incision because it will cause the patient one of two problems: either death or an ongoing urine distillation, due to the area not being fully consolidated.
Either administer an expulsion of the object that is forgotten or engineer a fracture with scissors to extract it in pieces.
After you have completed the operation, fill the wound with aloe juice and dragon's blood, then stitch it up. Place on it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or in rose oil and hot water, to make sure that the abscess does not break.
Then turn the patient onto their stomach over a pillow, and do not remove the bandages until the third day.
And when you have unbound them, flush the area with water and plenty of oil, then cure it with ointment of alkanet and ointment of red lead until they are healed.
However, if there is an abscess which appears burnt and corrosive in the wound, and it resembles blood being trapped inside a bladder, and therefore urine is prohibited (as this is known from the exit of blood with urine), then insert your finger into the wound to extract that blood, as if left, it would cause inflammation in the bladder and its putrefaction.
Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt, applying any relevant remedy until he is healed.
Cover the entire treatment area by bringing both thighs together and securing the medicines that have been placed on it.
And if the stone is small and situated in the middle of the penis, having already entered it, and micturition is prohibited, then treat it with what I have recommended before, lest you be accused of performing surgery; now I will explain this, and take a red-hot iron instrument shaped like this:
With a triangular tip, sharp, enclosed in wood.
Then take flax thread, and bind it around the penis below the stone to prevent its return to the bladder.
Then insert the iron instrument into the penis, piercing with ease until the tip reaches the stone. Rotate the instrument with your hand on the stone gradually, piercing to make way for the other end of it to emerge through its hole; then micturition will immediately take place.
Then press your hand over what is broken of the stone from the outside of the penis, for it is cracked and blocked by urine, and the patient is healed.
But if this treatment is not equipped to you for any reason that prohibits it, then tie one string beneath the stone and another string above the stone. Then make an incision on the penis between the two ligatures, over the stone. Then extract it. Then untie the ligature and modify the congealed blood, which is done on a plate.
And it is not necessary to tie the string beneath the stone unless it prevents the stone from returning to the bladder; nor is the other string above necessary, for when you untie the string, the wound of the stone closes, and the condition returns to its place on the plate.
And this is necessary for you when you untie the upper string: that you lift the condition to the parts above or return it to its place; and take back the plate as we have said.
Great! Here is my translation of your text:
De extraccio de peyra de las femnas.
Peyra en las femnas pauc es engendrada.
However, if you find a stone in any of those places, then it is difficult to cure him, and it is forbidden by several methods.
One of them is when the woman is very light [in weight], being a virgin.
The second is that you do not find a woman well-known to the doctor when she is chaste, or if she has a husband.
The third is that you do not find a woman well-versed in this practice, especially when it comes to operating with the hand.
The fourth is that the place of incision over stones in women is distant from the stone's location; for this reason, initial incisions are deep, and there is fear.
But if you have to resort to this, then realize that you should take an experienced female doctor who is rarely found.
But if you are deprived of that [female doctor], then look for a cautious and clever male doctor or present a female midwife well-versed in the affairs of women, or a woman who has previously given birth.
Therefore, perform this examination and instruct him to do everything you command regarding the stone's investigation at the outset; the reason being that it must be ascertained whether the female is a virgin, in which case he should insert his finger into her anus and feel for the stone.
Thus, if you find it, pull it out with your finger, then instruct him to incise upon it.
But if she is not a virgin, then instruct the matron to insert her finger into the patient's vagina and feel for the stone, as she places her left hand on the bladder and presses it firmly.
So if you find it, instruct him to gently remove it from the bladder's orifice towards the lower parts with great care and caution until he reaches its root near the hip.
Then incise upon it at the midpoint of the vagina near the hip's root wherever the stone is located and feel its size with your finger without letting it escape from your grasp.
And if the incision is shallow at first; then insert the raspatory into that incision, and if you feel the stone, adjust the incision according to the amount you know the stone will be extracted from there.
And know that the types of stones are many: some are small and large, smooth or rough, long or round, and they may have ridges.
Yes, you should now understand the different types of stones based on what I've described earlier.
And if you wish to induce bleeding, place crushed vitriol on the spot and apply it for an hour until the blood is drawn out; then return to your operation and remove the stone.
And prepare one of the instruments which I mentioned for extracting stones from men, so that you may be assisted by them in your operation.
If you notice bleeding and understand that the blood discharge is from an incision in the artery, then place powder over the spot and apply pressure with your fingers while maintaining a firm but gentle grip; do not repeat this action; leave the stone alone and avoid extracting it, as strong pressure may kill the patient. Then treat the wound.
Once the sharpness of the blood has diminished over several days and the area has healed, you may return to your operation and remove the stone.
It seems you provided me with two different pieces of text. The first one is your instructions while the second part appears to be a medical treatise that I translated into English below:
De seccio sobre ernia acoza.
Hernia ayguoza is nothing but an accumulation of humidity in the white ciphat, which is under the testicle's cord that holds the egg and it is named ciphat.
And sometimes it occurs in the proper panniculus, which nature has prepared for him at birth when he is still an embryo, or rather another egg that is already a different one; and this is the cord of the testicle between the white ciphat we mentioned earlier, and it is nothing but a tumor.
The generation of this hernia occurs due to weakness that happens in the testicles for some people where this material gets accumulated and sometimes it may happen because of an injury caused by a hit on the testicles.
This humidity has many colours; its colour is either like that of the yolk or inclines to yellow or red, or green, or it is black and fertile, or is white water-like which is more common.
And the signs by which this accumulation of water is known are as follows: if it is in the white ciphat that we mentioned earlier, then the abscess will be round and slightly elongated resembling an egg in its shape; and the testicle appears because the humidity contains it on all sides.
And if moisture is within the fat layer itself, then the abscess is found near an ovary and thus it is thought to be another egg.
And if the moisture is between the tendons of the genitals and the white membrane, then remove it with a needle.
When you want to know the color of the moisture, observe the color of the moisture in the abscess using a small piece of wax whose shape precedes it; and according to what is seen on the piece of wax, judge what lies within it.
Therefore, when we come to the treatment with iron, it is necessary that we command the patient to undergo bloodletting if this is possible for him, and expose his body.
Then let him be placed on his back on some slightly elevated support, and place many cloths beneath him.
Then sit on the left side of him, and command your assistant to stand at his right, who will stretch out his penis in one or two directions towards the tendons of the genitals and around the navel.
And then take a wide spatula and cut along the line of the genitalia, extending up to the pubic bone.
Make the incision as directed, evenly distanced from the hairline of the genitalia, going up to but not crossing over the white pubic bone.
Flay it, and observe, ensuring you do not cut into the underlying tissue; your flaying should be done in two halves, hanging one side with the larger end of the bird, then carefully examine the exposed area for any abnormalities.
Then pierce the white bone that is full of water with a wide instrument, and remove all the liquid.
Now separate the two lips of the incision with hooks and extend the white bone into two halves; do not touch the line of genitalia in doing so, and cut the bone as best you can. Cut this with its entirety or in pieces, especially the thinner side, for if you do not examine the incision closely and carefully, there is a risk that water may return.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
And if the other testicle becomes corrupt due to another illness, then you should tie off the vessels above the suspensory ligament, remove the testicle, and then treat it with what we have mentioned before.
But if water is added in two parts when you examine it, then know that there are two hernias present. Proceed to cut open that part as you have done for the other one; and if it appears to be a tumor, then perform the operation.
Then you clean the blood and place inside the incisions wool that has been soaked in oil or rose oil; and put another piece of wool outside, which has been soaked in wine and oil, spreading it over both thighs and the lower abdomen; and place on top some folded cloths and poultices, and tie them with a bandage like this:
Then take two cloths and dampen them with carmine-colored wool according to this pattern; make the ends of the cloths into points using cotton or moist wool, and attach them together with a bandage in the underpants' crotch area, with one end going around the buttocks at the back and the other at the front, just above the pubic bone. The two pointed ends should rest on each thigh below the groin, while the other two ends are placed over the testicles; all these wrappings should be tightened securely in place by the underpants' crotch area.
E alcunas veguadas aquesta hernia es medicada artificialment am cauteri en loc de seccio am ferr; e es que tu prenguas cauteri cutellar subtil e que inscidas am aquel la codena dels ginitius, e es ignit segon que havem recomtat entro que sia descubert le ciphac blanc contenent la aygua, e lahoras tu pren cauteri segon aquesta forma: e es asemblat a letra greca.
And then pierce it with that spatula, and ignite it until all moisture is driven out.
Then extend the spatula with hooks, scrape it with hooks, and then use an ignited subtle cautery; cut into it as much as you can to completely eradicate everything; be careful that the flesh does not touch the fire.
And know that this operation is safer and more distant from the flow of blood, and better than performing an amputation.
If you encounter post-operative complications such as abscesses after an amputation or during the use of cautery, or if there is excessive bleeding, then it is necessary for you to address these issues accordingly through appropriate treatment methods, as previously explained.
If the patient is particularly fearful and cannot bear the thought of a second operation due to its severity, then proceed with the perforation as I have recommended; this is especially true when it has been confirmed, based on what we have discussed about the signs, that the hernia is watery in nature.
Ensure that the patient is positioned on an elevated surface; proceed to pierce the abscess in its lower region using a flat spatula, and make the incision according to the length of their body.
And let the incision be wide enough so that all the fluid can flow out.
Then place a pad over the site and let it remain there, allowing any remaining fluid to drain out. And then treat that area until the wound is healed.
But if there is difficulty with the discharge of fluid at this point, you should make an incision: this is not done except because white fat in the orifice of the wound creates an obstacle and hinders the evacuation of the fluid; therefore, it is necessary that you insert into the wound a probe or instrument by which the water of hydropids can be extracted, whose form has been previously described; or place on top of the wound a small.
And know that the fluid returns, and this is usually added again around six months later; and when it is repeated, then let it be incised in the same manner, for the patient will thus spend their days.
It seems that this indicates the end of the chapter or section. Would you like me to translate any other text?
Regarding incision for a fleshy hernia and its treatment.
Sure, here is the translation of the first source sentence:
And I am recalling the operation along with the types of ointments for abscesses.
Thus, I say that abscesses arise in parts of the body where there is a deficiency, and they are caused by various reasons: either due to an acute excess that spreads to the deficient part, or as a result of trauma.
And the colour of the abscess matches that of the body part it's located on; pain is not a common symptom in these cases, and this type of abscess is severe.
Very rarely an abscess becomes fistulized; it turns dark in colour and is insensitive to touch.
Sometimes abscesses are caused by the obstruction of arteries, and in other cases, it's due to the inflammation of already inflamed areas or veins.
Abscesses caused by arterial inflammation are known for their spread when pressure is applied with the fingertips; it's not necessary to touch them.
Abscesses formed due to venous inflammation do not disperse under any circumstances, even when compressed with the fingertips.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
Therefore, if the bird has already been fed with those preservatives, then you should remove the bird and insert it.
And if there is an adhesion due to any cause in the hip joint, or between what is known as the blood vessels, then it is necessary that you release all such adhesions and make a circular incision.
However, if there is a birth of flesh in the place of adhesion which is behind, then it is necessary that you cut out all of it as we have said and remove the bird.
Once your operation is complete, fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine; then treat it with another cure until it is healed.
It seems that "Capitol" might be referring to a chapter or a specific section of the text, but I don't have enough context to provide a more detailed translation for this particular part without any preceding information. Please provide me with additional details if you would like further assistance!
On the treatment of an inguinal hernia.
Inguinal hernia is an abscess wrapped by some enveloping structure similar to swelling of the scrotum, and it makes physical exertion and walking difficult for the patient.
And in the treatment of this illness, it is important to consider the patient's fear and anxiety, which often precedes the onset of symptoms.
However, let us call this procedure an operation, as it was the first of its kind.
It is recommended to place the patient on an elevated surface during this operation; then apply the testicular suspension device below them; and have the genital chain with attached weights tied securely to the penis; ensure you have other assistants ready to assist, and stretch those limbs vigorously.
Then make an incision with a sharp, thin spatula across the right side of the vessel until you expose the veins.
And carefully remove any parts that may have been mentioned earlier, such as the arch of the temple bones during extraction.
Then place a needle with a double thread into those areas and tie one end at the first location where you observe blood, and secure the other end in the rear. Make an incision in the middle of those areas with a straight cut along the length of the body, and remove any accumulated foul and corrupted humors.
And then treat the wound with a cure for other wounds where you want healing to be generated by causing veins to burst, as this is not harmful.
But if there is an accident where all the vessels are affected, then it is necessary to remove the testicles or ensure that they become detached from the vessels, preventing them from receiving any nourishment through vessel incision, and leaving them useless, or ensuring their withering so they do not receive benefit.
It seems you provided an incomplete sentence or phrase; please provide the full text to ensure accurate translation and interpretation.
On the treatment of intestinal hernia."
The occurrence of this hernia is due to an incision that begins in the upper abdomen and extends over the belly from the region of the diaphragm, so that when the intestines fall through that rupture, they descend into one of the intestines.
This rupture can be either from the diaphragm or due to an excision of it, and these two types occur for various reasons: due to a blow, a fall, a loud noise, or a sudden elevation caused by some severe condition, or similar events.
The sign of this condition, when it is caused by an extension of the diaphragm, is that it happens gradually over a long period and does not occur suddenly. It is characterized by an abscess forming within the chest due to the diaphragm pressing on the intestine.
The sign of this condition when it is caused by an incision in the diaphragm is that initially, it causes severe pain suddenly; there is also an abscess different from the one mentioned earlier appearing below the wound, which is due to the intestine protruding through the diaphragm's opening, and the body reacting at its outer edges beyond the diaphragm.
In some cases, the intestine is pushed through an opening in the abdominal wall, and this type of hernia is called an intestinal inguinal hernia.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
And in curing the various aspects of this illness, fear is involved, so it's necessary to avoid causing harm during treatment.
The way to perform the operation is as follows: instruct the patient to gently guide their intestine back into its cavity using their hands, following its natural curve if it does not obey and returns outward, then invert it over their neck between your two hands, lifting their legs.
Then grasp the cord that is attached to the testicles on top, make an incision along the entire length of the cord of the testicles; and place two curved clamps onto the edges of the cut as needed in order to open the wound with them.
And if the cut is such that you cannot fully open it.
Then remove the skin that covers the testicles, ensuring you reveal the white hard capsule on each side.
Now insert your finger into what follows the testicle, that is between the white capsule, which is below the cord of the testicles, and between the second capsule, then remove any adhesion located behind the testicle.
Sure! Here is the translation:
And ask them about what could be the cause of the hernia being wrapped in a hard white cloth. Once you find any cause of it in him, then remove that from his belly.
And now, make an incision below the scrotum, dividing it so that blood and pus can drain as we have explained in our previous instructions.
Then, apply a cloth soaked in oil and place it on the wound; use the bandage we have described (and sometimes cauterize with white cypress, as we mentioned earlier regarding the flow of blood, for there are many cases when this occurs) and leave the bandage until it falls off.
If the wound is delayed in healing, then warm water should be used for embrocation and applied to it until it falls off, as we have mentioned earlier.
Then treat the wound with another remedy for wounds until it is healed.
Chapter 66. (Assuming this refers to the chapter number in a book or treatise)
Regarding hernias that occur in the belly." (A 'ventosa' is a type of suction cup used for medical purposes, so this likely refers to abdominal hernias.)
In this type of hernia, I have not seen anyone successfully treated with iron." (Here, 'ardit' likely means 'cured', and the text suggests that iron treatment is ineffective for this particular condition.)
E les primiers diyssero que es fayta ayssi cum havem recomtat en la hernia que es am vi; la qual es que tu lies les vayssels aprop la seccio sobre aquella am fecilitat de lu; e aprop secca en le mieg loc en enviro le apostema am aquo que obro aquel, entro que caian les vayssels.
And treat the wound as we have mentioned until it is healed.
This indicates that you are referencing Chapter 67 of a book or treatise. Is there any specific text from this chapter that you would like me to translate or provide the meaning for?
Regarding the procedure performed on the testicles."
Alcunas veguadas endeve ruptura en les angonars ayssi cum havem dit, e emineys le loc.
And do not allow any cause of hernias to remain in the genital area; and if there is one, it is minor; but it returns at all hours.
If the condition persists for a long time, there is an adjustment of the ring around the groin where the hernia descends into the scrotum; and this happens due to the extension of the inguinal canal, which we have mentioned earlier, because the canal has been stretched, causing it to soften and develop an abscess, resulting in swelling.
The cure for this condition is to use the cautery as described earlier in the narrative.
In some cases, it can be cured with an iron rod using this method: have the patient lie on their back between two servants' hands and then dry out the rupture site by scraping across its width for a length of three fingers.
Then strengthen the white inguinal ligament, which is below the groin area, making sure it is exposed.
Take the iron rod and place it over the protruding area of the inguinal canal, pressing it towards the front of the abdomen.
And then cover the two protruding places with the tip of your finger, and join one to the other with the suture.
Then remove the tip of the finger, do not push it too deep into the navel, and do not extend the wound, or any other cause as I have previously instructed you in the treatment of intestinal hernia.
Then treat that with the cure for wounds, and when you incise the veins, clean it and restore the wound before it is fully healed; because the navel has contracted and the bulge of the rupture is not properly aligned.
Cauterization is better in this place, as it is closer to the source of health.
It seems that you have provided another part of the medieval medical treatise. Please provide me with the original text for accurate translation.
Regarding softening the cord of the testicles.
Note that the cord of the testicles in some men is softened because the tissues between them are also softened; this has been observed.
It is necessary for the one who is treating it in order to cure that person to make them lie on their back and incise all of the cord that has softened above the natural cord, then join the two lips with a suture.
And if you wish, begin by softening the surplus of skin with three or four cauterizations and then make a firm suture.
Then make an incision between the sutures, and take care of other wounds or injuries, ensuring they are healed and free from infection.
The number 69.
On Castration."
Here is the translation of the first source sentence:
And so I say that castration is performed in two ways: either by constriction or by incision.
In the case of castration performed by constriction, the method is to submerge the animal in warm water until its genitalia are softened and loosened, allowing for easy manipulation. Then take those [genitalia] with your hand while they are relaxed and do not appear to be affected by the touch.
For castration performed by incision, it is necessary to hold the animal and press on the base of its testicles with your left hand.
Then lift up the scrotum and make an incision over each testicle with a single stroke.
Then, after making the incisions, remove those [testicles] that you have skinned. And do not leave any part of the testicles inside the body cavity, only the delicate covering which is over the veins.
This method of castration by constriction is better, as strong constriction leaves no part of the testicles inside, ensuring that the animal does not suffer from lingering pain.
And then treat the wound until it is healed.
This is most likely referring to chapter 70 of some sort of medical text or treatise. Would you like me to translate any further sections for you?
On the treatment of hermaphroditism.
Hermaphroditism in men occurs in two ways: one is when a hole appears in the space where the testicles should be, and there is an indentation like that of a woman's genitals with hair on it.
And sometimes, from that area where the hole is located (in the region of the testicles), urine flows.
However, in women, it is a different matter: the woman's genitals on their pubic mound are like two testicles of a man but slightly smaller and located further apart like the foreskin of a man with two testicles.
The treatment is also different, being three ways: for the two types found in men and one type found in women. It is necessary to insert those tight tissues/muscles until the price of that operation is paid, and then you can treat those with a cure for other wounds.
In the second type of men where urine comes out in the region of the testicles, there is neither a cure nor an operation for him.
Chapter 21.
Of tumours and flesh that arise due to causes in women.
A mole is generally attributed to natural causes, although it can be accentuated and made noticeable by exposure; in some cases, it becomes prominent in some women to such an extent that it occurs as well in men, especially after intercourse.
Therefore, when you have an abundance of moles on your body, take some in your hand or with a needle and press them.
And do not end the incision in the middle of the mole, especially on its edge or rim, to prevent a flow of blood.
Then treat that with wound-healing ointments until it is healed.
A tumour of newly formed flesh is a flesh that grows in the womb of the mother because it fills that place; and it can be clearly seen on the outside as similar to a tail (and for this reason, some may call it 'tailed disease'); therefore, we must cut it just like we cut moles, and treat it until it is healed.
The number ".lxxii." likely represents the chapter or section number in the medieval medical treatise you provided. In Roman numerals, ".lxxii." is equivalent to the number 72, so it could be Chapter 72 of the treatise.
De curacio de alratica."
Alratica is that the woman's womb should not be perforated or have a small outlet (birth canal). This means whether it is natural or by accident/circumstance. In the context of childbirth, this could refer to the position of the baby during delivery, which can impact the ease of birth.
In this context, "accidental" refers to the complications that arise due to a previous illness or health condition of the mother. The text mentions various factors contributing to these complications: an unadjusted body (perhaps referring to inadequate physical preparation), subtle contractions (indicating weak labor pains), or thick secretions/discharge.
Here, the text describes the different areas of a woman's body where these accidental complications can occur: the abdomen (likely referring to uterine issues), her sides, upper back, or lower back. It advises against any external pressure or strain during pregnancy and further cautions against menstruation during this time. These practices were believed to be harmful to both mother and child.
The text here refers to the diagnosis of these accidental complications during pregnancy. If the obstruction or blockage is visible (oppilatio), then immediate action must be taken. However, if it is not visible externally, one should use their hands (tieus) or a rod-like instrument (ray) for internal examination and further assessment. This was likely done to identify any issues with the fetus' position or the mother's health that could hinder an easy birth.
If the obstruction is caused by weak contractions (ciphac) and it appears between the two lips of the birth canal, then one must wait for the appropriate moment to intervene and disrupt/weaken this blockage. This may refer to a procedure aimed at assisting the baby's passage through the birth canal during difficult labor.
And place two pillows below his lips, then put your index fingers of both hands on top of his chest.
The woman should be on her back, with her thighs extended, then spread the two lips forcefully until that subtle covering is broken and the obstruction is opened.
Then take some wool, soak it in oil, and place it on the wound; have a man hold it there for a day to prevent the incision from hardening.
But if the covering is thick and dense, then use a broad knife or myrtle leaf to incise it.
If the obstruction is due to flesh, then suspend it with thread, and cut into it.
And these are the medicines that stop bleeding without a bite: achillea, dragon's blood, and onions mixed with egg white.
Then insert a wide lead tube to prevent the ulcer from hardening superficially.
Keep it in place for several days, and administer a poultice of dry leaves.
And then it is cured with another treatment of consolidation until it is healed.
Sometimes accidents occur during childbirth with other flesh, in which case it is necessary to cut according to this method. But if this is due to an abscess in the brain, one should not make any contradiction with iron on the mother.
Chapter 73.
On the treatment of hemorrhoids, tail bone issues, and red bumps that occur in women's genitals.
Hemorrhoids are considered to be the dilation of small veins around the anus, from which a continuous flow of blood occurs; and when hemorrhoids become old and form lumps.
I have already discussed the different types of hemorrhoids and their symptoms, as well as those that can be treated and those that cannot.
Therefore, I say that hemorrhoids and lumps that are located deep inside the mother's rectum and are not felt should not be treated with iron.
Mays aquellas las cuales son en el orificio de la matriz (útero) donde se percibe sensibilidad, esas son las que se curan.
And now you should place the woman in a warm bath and then extend her thighs with forceps or a rough cloth, and make incisions in them with a sharp instrument.
Then sprinkle over these wounds the blood of one of the leeches with their bite marks; use this just as you would acacia and other similar substances.
And now immerse her feet for an hour, then place them in cold water.
And if the blood flow persists, then make her drink a decoction of wormwood and pomegranate rinds as well as other similar substances.
Then take oat flour, mix it with honey and sour wine to make a poultice, and apply this to the patient's back.
If blood comes out, good; if not, apply two cupping glasses and make incisions on the breasts.
Then take wool and soak it in either coriander juice, or elderflower juice or even butcher's broom juice with vinegar, apply this to the area and keep the wound clean until it is healed.
And when that one has healed within.
Chapter 74. (Note: The number lxxiv is represented as 74 in Arabic numerals.)
Regarding the piercing or cutting of the uterus accidentally.
Special notes on abscesses that occur in the uterus, as well as cancer, abscess of a stone (lithopedion), ulcers, adhesions, herpetic lesions, fistulae, haemorrhoids, ragworm infestations, cysts, and other abscesses. I have already described these diseases, their types, symptoms, and the treatments for them in this section.
Now I wish to speak in this treatise about an abscess that occurs on the uterus, one of the abscesses that can be cured; and if you wish to know how it is operated upon with an iron instrument.
Therefore consider that if the pain of the abscess in its early stage is sharp with percussion, phlegm, and fever, and sometimes it reddens and becomes hard to the touch, then do not proceed with piercing it, but rather treat it with what helps the maturation from within so that the severity of the symptoms ceases.
And then it is necessary for you to make the woman lie down on a bed that has two pillows; and lean her back against the edge of the bed and adjust her feet towards the lower part below the abdomen, and let her thighs be spread apart, and place her arms underneath her buttocks, and tie each [part] with suitable binding.
Then the midwife should approach from the right side and use an instrument to open up the mother's birth canal in a manner that will be determined by the circumstances.
And take care when handling this instrument that you do not apply too much pressure on the mother's abdomen; and ensure that only a small portion of the instrument enters the mother, so as to avoid injuring her or causing harm to the patient. If the instrument is larger than the mother's opening, then it is important to place powders on the surface of her abdomen in order to prevent any foreign objects from entering into the birth canal.
Be sure to grasp the handle which extends beyond the side of the instrument, and ensure that the person administering has a firm grip on the instrument before rotating it as you open up the mother's birth canal.
And when you see that the wound is open, and it feels warm and moist to the touch, then you must dry it by cutting off its head with a broad scalpel.
And when the wound is evacuated, you should place on it a sponge soaked in rose oil or green oil, which has some styptic quality; and put the plaster on the wound inside the membrane.
Place outside the membrane and on top of the periosteum a clean cloth soaked in water infused with steeped mallows.
And it shall be healed within two days by an ointment you must apply, which is suitable for this wound as it heals.
In some cases, the membrane and the wound are washed with a solution of water and honey, then they are crystallized with water in which rhizomes of lily or long aristo have been boiled; finally, return to applying ointment.
And if the wound is inside a softened membrane, then you must be aware that it cannot be cured with iron instruments; rather treat it as we have described in this section.
Capitol .lxxv.:
A ensenhar las matronas en qual manieyre les enbrios bius sian medicatz quan yeysso segon figura no-natural.
Here is the translation of the provided text:
When you see these signs, then make sure to compress the abdomen so that the baby can descend gently; when they lie on their head, deliver them with forceps, and clean them of any superfluities with a good cleansing process.
If this part is not natural and implausible, such as when the baby is seen with its feet first but its body is facing upwards, or one of its hands is by its foot, or its head is near a hand or stomach, or if it has turned strongly onto its back and presents an impossible position.
It is necessary for the midwife to be wise and skilled in all these matters, ensuring she avoids mistakes and deception.
I have illustrated all these figures, and their respective meanings are indicated by the illustrations themselves.
When the baby is born headfirst through the natural orifice, and it's a difficult birth that exhausts the mother, or if her virtue has already been weakened, then make an incision for her, or have other women suckle milk from her, evaporating her blood with fennel-based poultices and moist oils.
And then insert the meter between their said small stick and cut it with that secondine, or squeeze its claw until all moisture is removed from it. Press the woman's abdomen so that the fetus descends.
However, if it does not descend, then ensure the woman is purified with a mixture of horsehair mucus and fenugreek seeds with scissors.
Then command him to be purified and have him compressed, making him sneeze with vinegar; plug his mouth and nose for an hour, as the fetus will be pushed out soon.
And if both the fetus's hands are outside at the beginning, then you must withdraw them gently and slowly. But if it does not obey and enter, then place the woman on a stool and lift her legs up, then push the stool towards the ground; the woman must be held so she doesn't fall due to the impact.
And if the hands are not turned inward and the fetus dies, then cut those open and extract its brain or tie its body to her hand with cloth and pull it out equally, as it will be stuck.
When the patient is positioned on their feet, you should push them forward and then make the fetus smaller by turning it; gradually lengthen the leg of the child until its foot is extended.
When the head is felt between the thighs, you instruct the patient to push and bear down, and have them sneeze by blowing their nose; this will hopefully make the baby turn if God wills it so.
If the baby does not turn with this maneuver we have described, you gently return it to its original position and then pause; this will likely cause the fetus to turn more easily due to gravity's influence.
If all these previous methods are unsuccessful, take a mixture of alum and gum arabic dissolved in water, grind it well in a mortar, and then apply this paste to the woman's cervix, at the lowest part of her abdomen. Then have her sit in cold water until the hypochondriac regions of her body become numb.
When the affected parts of her body have been softened, fumigate them with myrtle smoke and then let the patient rest. Here is the translation of the provided text:
The act will then be performed laterally while one of your hands hangs down. Try to reduce her hand's movement, but if you cannot do so, lift the woman and make her walk.
And if she cannot walk, then make her lie down on the ground, and shake her thighs vigorously with strong impacts, then apply softly the ointments that I have mentioned earlier.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
Eyssiment del fet sobre·l col expandudas las suas mas e la fassia de lu es al dos de la sua mayre. Cove que la matrona tengua la ma del fet e aprop revolva aquel petit a petit, e eque aquel am facilitat.
And when it is ready and you know what to do, then apply on the wound what we have prepared with oil and poultices.
Then instruct them to yawn slowly and steadily, and when you have done this, perform the same action on their forehead and command them to lean towards their right side, then compress them. Make them sneeze under these circumstances. The prepared fetus exits onto its side.
When you take out the horrible substance from the mother according to this way, observe and then remove the afterbirth with your nail until it is evacuated of moisture.
And if the fetus is suspended by its face or neck, then cut its navel so that it is not restrained and dies.
Then remove the fetus from the deceased woman's womb until you take out that which is covered, and order the female to compress herself several times, and she will expel it lightly with a slight push, if God wills.
Exit of twins or many fetuses. Here is the translation of the provided text:
Here is my best translation of the provided text:
And if some of them are difficult to deliver and arrive at what we have said about unnatural positions, then treat those as well as we have described.
And if the midwife is skilled and does what makes it easier, more subtle, slower, and uses her ingenuity according to each position as prepared by nature for a successful outcome.
A reminder of what is formed in the womb from embryos, and what happens when they are aborted.
Some conjoined twins are formed in the womb as one, two, three, four, five, six, or seven, and I have personally verified that one woman aborted sextuplets, while another aborted ten, all fully-formed; this was due to a lack of measurement by skilled physicians.
And all of that falls within the science of midwifery as it pertains to the small part of this subject; therefore, I have omitted what is well-known.
It seems you're providing me with chapter titles or headings. Can you confirm if there's any specific text or information you'd like me to translate or work on? I'm happy to assist!
On the extraction of the fetus when it is dead.
When you treat the dead body with what we have mentioned in the division of medication and it doesn't go away, and you are forced to use manual operation, you need to consider whether the woman has healthy virtues and is not suffering from any accidents that could lead to her demise.
Then ensure that the woman is placed on a bed lying on her back, with her head tilted downwards and her thighs raised.
The minister should have two parts or be tied to the bed, ensuring that her body doesn't stretch during the extraction process.
Then you should moisten the mother's mouth with moist oils, marshmallow root (althaea) and fenugreek seeds.
The matron should anoint her hand with those oils and marshmallows, then gently insert her hand into the mother's womb and feel for the baby's claws.
Here are some important considerations: if the baby is ready to come out head first, you should check for claws in its ears, neck, mouth, palate, under its beard, around its collarbone (furcula), or towards its armpits and flanks.
But if the descent is over his feet, then on his penis or in the middle of his back.
And if he has the finger of his right hand and places its curve in that place which is between the said fingers of his left hand, introducing his hand with ease and placing his finger in any one of those places we have mentioned until you reach the hidden cause.
Then place and keep in the position of the patient another finger or a third if necessary, to ensure equal traction and not only extension according to its straightness.
Let it be pulled from all sides, so that its extraction is eased just as when pulling a tooth.
And in the case that its extension is softened; if any part of it remains stuck, then let the midwife apply her said fingers with oil and introduce them skilfully while revolving [the] said stuck thing.
Therefore if the part of it is forgotten outside [i.e., still inside], then change fingers to that which is higher and do so until everything is expelled.
Mays si la ma es eyssida denant l'autra, e no es possible reduzir aquella per la coartacio de lu, lahoras cove que drap sia envolopat sobre aquella; e aprop extratz aquella entro que tota sia fora-getada, e inscideys aquella o en la junctura de la ma o en le coyde.
And likewise cover that which is done in the other hand and in both feet.
But if the foetus' head is large or it encounters constriction during delivery, or there is an excess of water in its head, you should intervene between the aforementioned spine and break the head to extract the water, or use an instrument known as "alundat", which will be shaped like other instruments mentioned in the next chapter.
Similarly, do this if the foetus has a large head by nature: you should cut it with scissors or take it with an "alunda" as we have said before; and then extract the bones using forceps.
And if the head is delivered but there is a constriction in the fork (vagina), you should split it open until the moisture inside is drained.
But if there is no complication or obstruction during delivery, you should cut the head as soon as it is accessible.
And if the birth canal is full of pus or has hydrops (excess fluid), you should pierce it until all moisture inside is released.
May I add that if it's on their feet, then the attraction is light and its direction towards the mother's mouth is also light.
But if it's constricted in the abdomen and foot, you should consider extracting that with cloth which you wrapped around your hand, and make an incision in both to let out what is inside.
However, if other parts are exposed and the head is turned back, the midwife should insert her left hand; but if the mother's mouth is open, she should put her hand in front of her nose, grasp the head with that [hand], and pull it with the aforementioned hands into the mother's mouth, then insert one or two fingers and draw [the baby] out.
And if the mother's mouth is constricted due to an abscess that occurs in her, then you should ensure it is not swollen over [the baby]; instead, administer the infusion of moist fatty substances. Apply plasters, and bathe the patient in waters that soften and moisten.
And if the fetus is on its side, then it's best to prick and administer what we've mentioned for a living fetus.
E si aquo no es possible, lahoras sia inscidit en pessas, e sia extrayt."
And make sure you do not leave any air inside the wound.
And once you have completed the entire operation, then administer what we have discussed about treating abscesses that are caused by the mother.
And if there is bleeding, then apply astringent waters (or ointments) and administer the other treatment.
I have seen a woman whose fetus in her womb was dead, and over that fire another woman pregnant, and there was also a dead fetus. It happens that after some time an abscess forms in his navel; it becomes swollen and opens up like a fire, and he begins to shake his arms.
I was called to treat him, and I treated him for a long time, but the wound did not heal.
So I placed on him some plasters with strong drawing powers and over a few days extracted one bone from the wound, then another after that; and I was too amazed as there are no bones in the abdomen.
And then I thought they were from the bones of a dead fetus.
So I dissected the plague, extracting from it many bones, as was common for a woman in her condition and having lived this way for so long, crawling away with one arm.
And I did not find this strange but rather it is a matter of science and aids the doctor in his craft to administer treatment.
Of the forms that the tools, which are necessary for extracting the fetus.
The form of the vortex with which the womb is opened:
This is the form of a book cradle in which books are secured with two vortices at each end of two posts. However, this vortex container should be more subtle than the cradles, and can be made of ivory or wood.
And the width of each post is two fingers wide and the margin on both sides is one finger wide, while the length of each is a palm and half; in the middle of these two posts are two adjustments for the insertion of another smaller post which is already fixed, with its length being half a palm plus a little more, and the width of this inserted post is also around 2 fingers or slightly wider.
And these two additives should be inserted into the mother's mouth so that it can be opened with them when you turn the two prescribed virtues.
Another form, similar but more subtle and lighter:
It is made of wood or horn, shaped like forceps. However, at the ends of its two additives there are also spikes, and the length of these additives is about one palm, and the width of each is two fingers.
And when you want to open the mother with these, then make the woman cease lying on her back with her feet hanging down, and open what is between her thighs. Then, open your hand with the instrument like you do with scissors, equally as much as you want of the edge of the mother's mouth until the midwife does what she wants.
The form of vertigo which the ancients said:
A form of impetus with which the fetus is propelled.
Way of friendship that is bruised with a large head.
It is assembled with forceps, which have teeth at the end, sometimes it is made long like forceps according to this form, and other times it has teeth like those of a saw, which are sharpened and bruised. Form of small friendship:
Form of one nail having one spine:
Form of one nail having two spines:
Form of spatula having two ends with the head being cut off:
Form of two wide spatulas:
All these instruments are exercised and used in various ways by the artisans as their work requires, both for lighter operations and more extensive ones.
And you should not be without any of these instruments as their need is undeniable.
De extraccio de la segondina translates as The extraction of the second vertebra.
When the second vertebra is retained due to prolonged labor, you must instruct the patient to hold their breath and then make them sneeze under certain conditions. Press your hand over their mouth and nose, and if it is expelled, so be it.
If not, then take a tube and pierce a hole through the mother's nipple, place within it fresh herbs such as lemon balm, chamomile, aloe vera, cinnamon, wood cassia, and yarrow. Soak all or some of these herbs in water inside the tube, then place it over a fire.
Then place a cannula made of cane into the mother's mouth, keeping it there until the steam reaches the mother's cavity.
Then make them sneeze as we have described, and the second vertebra will be expelled rapidly.
But if this treatment remains and is not expelled, instruct the midwife to submerge her left hand in sesame oil or marshmallow broth, then insert it into the womb and grasp the second vertebra; when she has found it, pull it out slowly little by little. If it is attached to the mother's cervix, then insert your hand as previously described, and once you have located the second vertebra, extract it gently so that the mother does not suffer from violent traction. Abantz cove que sia permudada als costatz dreyt e sinestre am facilitat.
And if the mouth of the wound is constricted, we have already described the cure through sneezing and the application of medication to the wave with herbs.
But if all the causes we have described are not forgotten, then take care not to fatigue yourself by repeatedly applying abstraction to it; instead, cover what has come out of him at the mouth of the wound with a cloth and apply that which is taken from her vagina, then anoint it with ointment and tetrafarmacon; for this will make it rot after some days and be dissolved and forgotten.
But when you rise, there is a harmful vapour that rises to the head and stomach, which harms the patient; therefore, it is necessary that fumigations be administered underneath and appropriate for it.
But some of the Ancients have experienced fumigation with nettle and dry figs.
The form of the instrument with which the woman is fumigated should retain the menses and the afterbirth:
Sia fayta de veyre o de eram.
And place the fine end in the chimney and the wider end over the fire, and keep the fumigation close to the embers of the fire.
And hold this until that fumigation is consumed, and do another one after.
For the treatment of an unperforated infant's anus:
Pick up the infant and his anus is not perforated, which already has a thin and opaque covering. Then ask the midwife to perforate his anus with her finger; if not, perforate it with a sharp spatula, and make sure you do not touch the scrotum.
Then place over it wool soaked in wine and oil; then treat him with ointment until it is healed.
But if you fear it will be blocked again, then place in the perforation a cannula for several days, and remove it when the child wants to defecate.
And it sometimes happens that the anus becomes blocked due to a suppuration or abscess; then this suppuration must be incised and treated as we have said for the cure of lead.
De curacio de las fistulas que endeveno dejos translates to: The treatment of fistulas that occur in this way (or below).
Las fistulas que endeveno en la partida dejos pus bassa so nodacio e grossetut las quals endeveno prop del cul defora o en l’espazi de la una partita translates to: The fistulas that occur in the buttocks area, which become swollen and thickened, can be found either externally near the anus or internally within this region.
E es una fistula o motas translates to: And it is a single fistula (or ulcer).
E cum aquella nodacio es antiquada e corr de la humiditat aygosa blanca o poyridura subtil, e alcunas veguadas so de aquestas fistulas alcunas penetrant translates to: And when this swelling is old and filled with watery white matter or subtle pus, sometimes some of these fistulas penetrate.
E aquellas penetrant so cognudatz per aquo qu'es exxit de aquellas per la egressio e per ventoceitat; e alcunas veitz use lo malautz d'egression, e for lo men es exit de aquellas verm translates to: And those that penetrate are known by what comes out of them through discharge and flatulence; sometimes the patient calls it a discharge, but very rarely is there any worm seen.
E so d'aquelas fistulas alcunas veguadas en l'espazi penetrantz entron a la vesica, e entron el meat de la verga; e son d'aquelas penetrantz entro la junctura de la coyssa e entro al notz de la coxa translates to: And there are some of these fistulas that penetrate into the space within the bladder and into the urethra of the penis, as well as those penetrating into the joint of the thigh bone and into the marrow of the hip bone.
Here is my translation of the first source sentence:
If there is any curvature [in the bones], then insert a thin lead rod or horsehair into it until you feel that your finger has touched it.
And if you do not feel anything at all and there is no cause for discharge or the presence of worms or gas, as we have mentioned earlier, then know that it is non-penetrating, and proceed with treatment.
When the fistula is penetrating towards the bladder or into the urethra, its significance indicates an expulsion of urine from that area and prevents it from being treated with medicine.
If it is penetrating towards the hip joint or into the bone and there is pain along its path, then it indicates that the probe has reached here even if there is no curvature in the bone, and there is pain along the course of its journey; and that it causes hardening over time; and that no medication is effective for this condition nor can it be consolidated with ointment.
In all these penetrating fistulas, there is no complete cure, and the treatment for them becomes a matter of trial and error by foolish doctors who treat them.
For those cases where the wound is not deep and ancient (i.e., old), healing with an iron instrument is expected according to what I will tell you, and this based on my own experience.
And when the patient has his head between your arms over a stool and lifts their legs onto it, let their thighs be inclined towards their belly, and then introduce lead or brass probes into them, as long as you know the place where they should pass through.
And if the patient feels it around his back, you should then introduce your finger in there.
And if you feel the probe being discovered by your finger as it penetrates, or something else that you perceive between your finger and this soft tissue or flesh, then know for certain that it is indeed a penetrating wound; and thus do not work on it, for there is no cure in such case, as we have said.
But some may say that it heals late for some men.
And regarding the treatment for which aid is expected, let you light a fine cautery according to the size of the wound, as mentioned before, and introduce it into said wound around the back until you know that all those fistula-like tissues similar to bird feathers have been burnt.
Here is my best attempt at translating the provided text:
E si la tenta intra, e no penetra entro·l tieu dit le qual es en le cul, e entre aquel e la tenta que es velament spes de carn o de ciphac, e vezes la fistula en aquo que siec la superficia de la codena, lahoras secca la codena del comensament de la fistula, e tu ve seccan am la tenta, e sia en la fistula entro que la seccio pervengua al loc en le qual perve la extremitat de la tenta, e per la tenta es liberat e catz.
And then cleanse those fistulated flesh areas, which are gathered like bird feather shafts and leave none of them uncared for.
If there is a flow of blood during your operation when you incise those flesh areas, then the best option and the lightest instrument to use are cauterization with fire or sharp medicine; for a cautery with fire accomplishes two good things: the charring of that adjusted flesh, and the exsection of blood from moisture.
Then treat that with calluses wrapped in leather or caustic [substance] until the place is strong and then cure the plague by growing firm flesh to create a scab.
And so the medicines in which there is astringency and exsection, when those are restored they are healed already, for you do not fear recurrence.
But if the fistula already passes into the depth of the anus and is elongated beyond its surface, then insert your finger into the anus and examine it with that.
And so if you feel the attempt and between you and it is a veil of pus or flesh that can be penetrated by touch, then there is no operation here but rather two paths forward: one of trust and hope.
Here is the translation of the provided text: Here is the translation of the provided text into English:
e entromet en aquella fiel envolopat de v fiels o entorn aquels; e aprop entromet tenta am fiel en la fistula entro que consiegua la conquavitat de lu.
Here is my translation of the text you provided:
And then treat the wound before it becomes solidified or healed.
If the openings of the fistula are not already penetrating, then make them penetrate, in whatever way you have prepared, but be careful not to go too deep and injure the surrounding tissue. Then, treat it so that it may heal properly.
The shape of the spinal spatula that you use to open the fistula should be carefully considered: its curved end must be very sharp and the other end blunt, so as not to injure any unnecessary tissue during the procedure.
On the suturing of hemorrhoids that have been cut open:
Hemorrhoids are treated in two different ways, depending on their appearance and severity: they can either resemble charred wood or fatty tissue from grapes. And as for the hemorrhoids that are either small or large in size, those from which blood flows constantly and abundantly, whether they be numerous or singular, located outside of the anus, or found at the ends of the rectum...
However, those hemorrhoids which are located outside of the anus and possess little moisture should be treated differently: they may produce a yellowish fluid or bleed slightly in a continuous manner, and their coloration is similar to that of the body.
Here is the translation of your first source sentence: Adonc tu te coyte e suspen am uncis o que tenguas aquellas am la tua ungla, e aprop incideys aquellas deves las suas razitz.
Mays si les uncis no so tengutz en aquellas per la humiditat de lor e mollificacio de aquellas, lahoras pren aquellas am drap aspre o am coto o am flassada de lana, e extratz aquelas am les tieus ditz, e aprop inscideys aquellas e polveriza sobre lor alcunas polveras caudas aprop la inscizio, per que sian ad aquellas en loc de cauteri; o cauteriza aquellas segon que es precedit en le capitol de cauterizar. And then proceed with other treatments until they are healed.
And if the anus does not yield to evacuation, then harden the patient's condition with a small cauterization, and wash it with the water that is in the rear which will allow for gentle evacuation when the patient squeezes.
However, if the hemorrhoids are outside the anus, then their cause is minor, and it can be treated by taking them with your fingernail or a hook, pulling them out, and treating them with the methods mentioned earlier until they are healed.
For those who require an incision, you must administer sutures in the following manner: take wrapped thread and pass it through a needle, then extract the hemorrhoids from their location, make the needle penetrate to the other side of the wound, wrap both ends of the thread around that point below the needle horizontally; tighten the hemorrhoid with strong tension, tie the thread, and remove the needle.
Do this for all of them, leaving one unstitched and untied so that the excess blood can drain from it.
And then place on the buttocks a cloth soaked in rose oil or in grease; put that over their hips and command the patient to rest. Leave it there until the swelling subsides; when this is done, treat any wounds with ointment or another suitable cure.
And since they are old and do not respond to that treatment, you must cut them with the edge of a spatula or your nail until they become moist and host small quantities of pus above which prevent consolidation; then treat them so that they may be consolidated.
Then you clean them with strong caustic that causes blood to flow and exocriates them; then treat them so they may heal.
Know that leeches are key and they are round worms with the colour of the body like a small key, found all over the body but mostly in areas below the feet and elbows; for any pain you must place them there.
And then it is necessary to cut what is around the nail, and hold it with forceps or a hook, and pull it out from its root; then treat that area.
And if you wish, cauterize it as described in the previous chapter.
Warts are small rough raised bumps with a core, they appear on the surface of the body and are commonly found in children.
To treat them, you must stretch and cut it, or pierce it with a needle or hair that has been heated. And if you want, cauterize it as we have mentioned, with fire or with sharp medicine.
Moles are small, soft or core-filled bumps on the body's surface that grow in number with age, and when the cold reaches them, it feels like an ant bite, and they appear all over the body.
To treat them, take a pen feather quill from an eagle or a vulture, make it strong, and place it over the mole so that the circle of the quill covers its edges; then roll your hand with the quill to cut what is around the mole, push the mole into the flesh, and pull out the root.
And if you wish, make this with a cannula made of horn or iron according to this form:
Make the top part of the cannula thin and blunt (it should not be perforated) and wrap it around your finger, ensuring that when you rotate it, the insertion is smooth.
And if you wish to cauterize the wart as mentioned earlier in the chapter on cautery for hernia."
De forma dels instrumentz que so aministratz a dar cristeri.

The form of large and small warts:"
The cap of the cannula above which is tied the bag should be wide in this way, and it shall remain at the place where the bag was tied that same number of times.
And the lower end of it, which is inserted into the anus, should be closed (it cannot be opened) like a lion's mouth, preventing softness; and on one side let there be two openings, and on the other side one opening, and let the width of the opening correspond to the thickness of the rays and more thick for smaller ones.
And let the bag be made of bladder from an animal or sheepskin, and let its width be one palm.
And let it be pierced by several openings as it is rolled up, with the space between them being equivalent to the thickness of a finger.
Then introduce into these openings strong gall from fresh gall which amounts to about ten galls or so, and fit the bag with it; and when the bag is placed on the patient, let its head be narrow between two distinct points with a tight compression, and then crystallize each opening with it: The way of crystalizing this is for you to fill the bag with medicine, which should be heated according to how much the patient can tolerate. Be careful not to make it too hot or too cold.
Here is my attempt at translating the provided text into English:
And if the medicine forces him out, keep it [the hernia] as long as you can; and if he falls asleep for a whole night, it is better afterwards.
But if you happen to come across this in cases of abdominal ailments and the expulsion of its contents from the body, then repeat the cauterization until it is cured.
And if there are hemorrhoids or painful abscesses in the anus, then use a gentle and soft cauterization like those used for children.
On the treatment of wounds:
I have already mentioned in the division of wound treatment what is relevant for this book, and I speak thus of the treatment of those with both physical intervention and medicines according to the situation.
So I say that wounds are diversified according to what causes them and the location where the wound occurs.
And the causes for which wounds are sometimes made are also diverse: like from a stone strike, or incision by a sword or knife, or blow with a lance, or club, or arrow, or similar to any of these.
Mays las plaguas que so en les locz del cos so ayssi cum plagua la qual catz sobre le cap, o·l col, o·l pietz, o·l ventre, o·l fitge, e semblantz ad aquels dels membres.
And I am recounting the cure for certain wounds so that you may apply this reasoning and rule to other similar cases.
I will begin with the simple wounds on the head, as the recollection of the composite ones shall come at the onset of the third chapter.
Thus, I say that when a simple wound occurs on the head and it is not fractured, consider: if it was caused by a blow from a stone or something similar, and the skull has only cracked slightly but it's a large wound, and you fear the development of an encapsulated abscess, then you should proceed to cauterize and bloodlet the cephalic vein immediately. Do not delay in this action; extract as much blood from them as their condition allows, unless some reason prohibits bloodletting, especially if very little blood is exiting the wound.
And bloodletting is the opposite of treating a wound with a poultice; make sure the patient avoids fullness and heavy foods.
But if any cause prohibits mincing, then reduce the amount of food they eat and keep them away from meat and wine.
And place over the wound, if an encapsulated abscess occurs, a poultice made solely with rose oil or wine that has been astringent.
Here is the translation of your provided text:
Under these circumstances, if the air has already changed there, then place some ointments on it until it is healed.
If the wound is large or has been caused by a cut with a knife and its edges are not close together due to poverty, then join them using stitches according to what I will recommend regarding their sewing.
But if the wound has already exposed bone and skull, and there is no retention of any kind but only a small suspension, then cut it open and cure the wound with medicines; restore the flesh to its place instead of tying it up, and command the patient to eat food which contains fat: cabbage heads, calf's foot jelly, and similar substances until it has healed.
And if there is also putrefaction on the other side of the bandage and it does not stick to the bone, then cut out all that has become rotten and throw it away; afterwards cure this wound with medicine.
But if in these wounds there is an artery or vein from which blood can flow out, and it has not been cut off by medicine, then inquire about the artery; if you find that it has not been cut open, then do so with a spatula, or tie it up; and if what we have said does not work for you, then cauterize until the bleeding stops.
Here is the translation of your provided text:
The translation of the provided text is as follows:
And then compress that above with poultices and let it be, do not release it while it is like this so that the medicine is not removed from him before he is healed.
And sometimes you do this with just the cautery when there is no pine tar or dragon's blood available.
And you perform this surgical operation on large wounds when it is appropriate to place them under tension and they are fresh with blood that has not been exposed to air.
But if the air has altered them, especially in summer, then it is not intended to place this powder on them, but rather treat them with what we have said before, and apply some digestive ointments or a poultice of barley flour with water and honey until they heal; and then treat them with another cure so that they may be fully healed.
But if there is an open fracture with broken bone, and it is small, then you must extract the putrefaction.
And I will tell you about the treatment of skull fractures when they are poisoned.
De las plaguas del col." translates to "Regarding the ulcers of the neck.
Mays si la plagua accideys en le col, lahoras no es en lu differencia in medicacio, e entre la plagua del cap quan es simpla." translates to "But if the ulcer occurs on the neck, there is no difference in treatment compared to a simple ulcer on the head.

E no pauses sobre la plagua alcuna causa de tot freja, quar la substance del nervi es freja e la continuation de lu es a lo cervello, el quel es lo mas alt de tots los membres." translates to "And do not apply any cold remedy on the ulcer, because nerve tissue is fragile and continues up to the brain, which is the highest part of all body parts.
E si’ aquo am que es curat de medicinas leugieras, ayssi cum es caus lavata am aygua tépida, alcuna veguda infusa en oli rosat o no-rosat, e thucia quan es lavada am aygua tepida e las autras peyras minarantz segon aquesta manieyra, e unguents humitz." translates to "And if it is to be treated with gentle medicines, such as washing with warm water, sometimes infused with rose oil or plain oil, and when using thuya (thuja), wash with warm water and other stones in this manner, and apply moist ointments.
Certainly! Here is a translation of the provided text into English line by line:
If there is a deep wound or it reaches the lowest part of the flesh, then pierce that spot in the most affected area.
If the artery has already been cut in the wound and there is bleeding, then you must either separate or stop it, tie it off, or cauterize it if required to control the situation.
If you have already cut the vertebrae of the neck and saved the veins in the vicinity, then you should join the edges of the wound with sutures on either side of the windpipe and do not touch it; instead, bring them forward and return it to its natural shape, securing it with a suitable bandage, and leave it for a few days; afterwards treat it with ointments that contain astringent and stimulant ingredients until it is healed.
If there is an injury to the bone in the wound, then you should strike it and drive out any fragments of bone that can be removed; as for anything beyond your capacity, leave it alone until the wound becomes putrid, at which point it must be isolated and drained.
And if the wound is new, sprinkle over it the powder that has been prescribed. Here is a translation of your provided text into English, line by line:
Here is the translation of your provided text:
Under these circumstances (if there is not deep penetration and the wound is recent with his blood), you should place powder on him for the first hour, and don't press it so that the blood is not retained in its depths and return to the heart and harm the patient; rather apply attractive ointment, and release it twice a day.
And if the ointment is not available to you, then put in the orifice of the wound as much lint as can be stuffed in so that it sucks out what comes from the humidity; and make the patient sleep on the wound so that it flows with what is in him fitted.
But if three or more days have passed since the wound and there are no accidents to the patient of spasms nor shaking of a bad heart nor constriction of the lungs, as well other good dispositions of him, then you know that the wound is safe; and therefore cure it with dressings and another curative ointment until it heals.
But if his healing is delayed, and the wound has been open for a long time already, then you know that it has become a fistula; therefore cure him by applying this capital (ointment).
And if the wound is from an incision by a knife or dagger, and it is simple on the surface of the foot or back, then cure this with what follows after stitching, if it's large, or powder, if it is small.
Mays si ja ha fayta enprecio en le os, e so ja de lu inscizas pessas, lahoras tu torqua la plagua e coyta ad extrayre aquellas pessas, si so separadas. But if they are not separated, then allow them to putrefy; their extraction will be alleviated.
And for other accidental wounds in the other body parts, the aid for their healing is that which we have mentioned.
Regarding wounds of the abdomen:
The discomfort that occurs in the abdomen is either great, small, or moderate.
A small rupture is handled in a different manner and the reduction of it is more difficult; be careful to not interfere with its location at first instance, as opening it up will cause it to swell and make access harder.
Therefore, the best type of rupture is moderate, as it does not make the reduction of the intestine difficult like in the other two types mentioned before.
Also note that the suturing of the abdomen can be done in four ways; but two of these are common and similar to the suturing methods for other wounds on the body.
And two other specific sutures connect to the other wounds, but they are particularly suitable for sewing up the abdomen.
And I recommend that you explain and describe each procedure to him/her in detail.
So say that when the wound is small and there seems to be a cause for the hernia from it, but it is difficult to reduce (put back in), this could happen due to two reasons: either because of the small size of the rupture as we said before, or if the hernia has become swollen due to cold air.
And when it is like this, then you should apply a compress so that you immerse a sponge or cloth in lukewarm water alone, or take vinegar, cypress, wormwood and chamomile and apply them to the hernia until the swelling subsides.
And in some cases, I have seen that it has astringent properties, and is better than water alone in reducing the swelling.
And so when you see the swelling has reduced, then moisten the hernia with water in which is soaked althea and mallows, because this will soothe its interior with little effort.
Mays si es escusat le intrament de lu  aprop aquesta curacio, lahoras scindeys la disruptio un petit am strument am le qual so inscididas emorroydas.
And the initial treatment is better when it is timely rather than delayed, and there is no need to resort to amputation or excessive draining.
Regarding the instruments, consider their shape:
One part of it is sharp and pointed, while the other part is not so acute; its tip is delicate but not as fine as a spatula, rather slightly blunt.
When the swelling is exacerbated and pushes out the intestine, it requires that its reduction be done according to its natural form, returning it to its proper place if this can be achieved; for it is better this way.
But when the rupture is extensive and located in the lower part of the abdomen, you must have the patient lie on their back with their legs elevated higher than their head; if it is in the upper part of the abdomen, place their head and feet at a level above that of their body.
Similarly, if the rupture is in one of the two halves of the abdomen, always keep your attention and consideration focused on this: ensure that the side with the swelling is positioned higher than the other.
And so make sure you administer this for large wounds and medium-sized wounds.
For small wounds, apply this medicine that you have prepared; then let it be administered between your thumb and forefinger, which should grasp the disrupted wound with its hand and bring together its lips. Then uncover from where you began sewing up until another place.
This is the common method of suturing: once you have taken the needle (or thread depending on the size of the wound); then leave it at the tip of the little finger, hold the needle with one hand and do not put wax on both ends of the thread but rather two threads from the spools that are next to each other. When you make these penetrate a part; then you have joined both ends of the thread together and made four knots.
Then hold double wax on the loop of the needle, sometimes with two parts together, and then join both lips and the wound by decent approximation; leave another thread in place of that one at the other side of the gap and fix another needle there; let it be tied also with wax like with the first needle. Do not cease until you have completed this for all needles where a suture is required.
Here is my line-by-line translation of the given text:
Here is the translation of the provided source sentence:
And do not prolong the stitching so that the wound is not prevented from consolidating.
Then sharpen the tips of the needles so that they do not injure the patient while they sleep; you will place powdered spices from every part over the stitches, which cover the needle ends; and leave them there until you know the wound has fully consolidated.
These spices for stitching are most useful for small wounds, where you only need one or two needles to stitch them up.
The second type of suture is more complex: it involves stitching the four corners and two edges of a wound in one go, using a needle with thread that matches its thickness.
Then, once the needle has pierced all four corners of the wound, withdraw it from the same side you started on, so that as the thread retracts, it tightens at the highest point of the injury in a manner akin to sewing fabric.
Leave the width of your little finger between each stitch.
And this suture is known by men.
And I employed this suture technique to close a wound that had been inflicted on a man's abdomen with a knife, and the rupture of the wound was larger than a palm, extending around two palms from the center of the stomach, and it had torn through the flesh in the middle of the body; and by then, the intestines had already protruded for twenty-four hours.
The wound healed within fifteen days or so, and the patient recovered completely; and thus he lived for many years afterward, remaining in good health.
And the other doctors had judged that he would not recover; but it was a miracle, for I did not treat him with any ointment or medication, only applying pure lamb's wool over the wound twice daily and washing it frequently with honey water until he was healed.
But I shall describe two types of sutures, as mentioned in the biblical account.
It is with the continuous suture that you begin, inserting the needle from outside in.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
Here is my translation of the provided source sentence:
And make your penetration with that which you use to penetrate the hip at the extremity of the mirror, which is placed between them so that all may be penetrated."
Here is the translation of the provided text:
And do this once and again, doing this another time within a short period before you sew up everything that is outside according to that example.
The summary of this suturing technique is that you sew with a simple interrupted suture, which I stitch the hairs with, so that you sew one arm of the catheter once on the side of its end and then do another before you have completed it.
However, the second special type of suture specific to this, and which Guy de Chauliac gives as an example, is that you should use it for his circumcision wound; that is, with a simple continuous suture where they apply each part to its corresponding part according to nature; and connect one end to another and the mirror image at the other end, doing so as I recommend to you.
Take care to leave the needle at your closest end of the mirror image to the outside part, and make it penetrate into the inside part in that sole, then pass both ends of the catheter; and then revolve the needle and make it penetrate from the outside to the inside in those two ends of the catheter.
And then turn each of these and make the parts that are inside penetrate into the outer part at two ends of the mirror opposite each other.
And this manner of suture is better than the common light suture, and it is the suture that I mentioned earlier.
This is the speech of Walter.
Furthermore, they say that the suture of the belly is rectified with two needles, which is when you insert into these a wire each and begin by introducing the needle where it should be to you, making this penetrate onto the other side according to the suture of those which I sew skins in the same way.
And you should know that when the rupture is in the middle part of the belly, then its suture will be more difficult than those of other parts of the belly.
Furthermore, the judgement of treatment for this disease is also a judgement of other diseases.
Whose cause is when you have the disease recently with its blood before the air changes it and reduce the intestine and sew this and adapt it properly; then place on it incarnative powder.
Here is the translation of the given text:
Here is the translation of the provided text:
It seems like the text you provided is a medical guide or treatment manual from the medieval period, potentially written in an early form of Catalan or Occitan. Here's my translation attempt:
Here is my translation of the provided text:
And know that one with a large hernia has a slower recovery than one with small hernias.
It is difficult to heal the hernia called 'gegunu', as it does not respond well to treatment due to the large number of veins present and their size, as well as the delicacy of the surrounding tissue and its proximity to nerves.
However, if what arises from the inflammation is a hernia, and it is fresh, reduce it in the same way as you would reduce hernias using your usual method.
But if it has progressed and turned yellow or black, then you should apply a piece of gallstone to the affected area to encourage blood flow, as there are veins and arteries within the hernia.
Then cut into the hernia and hang two ends of the gallstone above the wound with a thread, so that the pressure from the hernia's tightening and the emission of pus are relieved.
A reminder of the types of inflammation that occur in hernias:
Here is my translation of the provided text:
Adonc yeu pansegui la curacio de lu ja sia que no era confizat en la sanacio de lu, mays cessegui subtiliar aquel entro que foc sanat e le loc es consolidat:
Here is my translation of the provided text:
Here is my translation of the provided text:
And then place another leech close to the first one, and do not stop until you have applied leeches in sufficient numbers according to the extent of the disease.
Then reduce the extent of the disease and remove its cause from the intestine while it is still inside, provided that the intestine has healed; in this way, the patient will not suffer any harm.
And it is possible that the intestine is tied with a thin thread made from the intestine of an animal; since this has been put through a needle, take the end of these threads of intestine and remove all flesh from them. Then tie one end to a needle, wrap the other end around it, and insert the needle into the gut, reducing its size at the point of injury.
And this method of suturing with leeches is nothing but another way to gain trust and hope.
But if the disease is extensive and affects one of the finer guts [i.e., intestines], then it will not be anything but a palliative treatment; it does not constitute complete healing.
On the healing of ulcers and fistulas.
Here is my best translation of the provided text:
Here is my translation:
And in some men, it is moist, which causes weakness; and often this moisture is expelled within a few hours. Sometimes this moisture is light, sometimes it is small, sometimes thick, and sometimes subtle.
I have already shown all these causes, their symptoms, and the cure for them with medicines in the division.
And now I shall inform you of the treatment for fistulas, which are caused by surgical procedures done with the hands.
Know that fistulas can occur in any part of the body; for there are fistulas that affect major veins, arteries, nerves, intestines, bladder, ribs, spine, or any compound joint such as those found in hands and feet; and they also impact areas near vital organs.
Therefore, these types of fistulas are among the most challenging diseases to treat and often do not respond well to cure; dealing with them requires patience and an understanding of their complexities.
If there is a fistula that does not affect the aforementioned areas and you wish to pursue its treatment with confidence, then obtain iron or steel instruments; if the fistula has formed along a straight path, then use these tools to explore it.
However, if the fistula is curved or twisted, then use fine lead instead; because of its lightness and flexibility, lead can navigate such intricate passages.
And if the fistula has very horrible sores, it is not possible for you to treat him by any means.
Therefore, you should close the anus by its own openings because the moisture through which it is closed will reach and flow from the other openings.
Then carefully examine which way it is possible for you to know whether there are worms or nerves here, and if the fistula cavity is deep or shallow, and if this is a fistula with several openings that has reached its full development under your treatment, through your interrogation of the patient, through his disclosure of pain when you press on the area, and similar signs and accidental causes related to inflammation.
And once you have thoroughly considered all these causes and established the facts correctly, then proceed to treatment based on certainty: consider whether this is an external fistula near the surface or in a salty location, far from any joint, nerve, artery, vein, or one of the other places I mentioned to you.
Then dry out the fistula as mentioned before in this description of it: remove whatever is extraneous and made up of corrupted flesh, what has grown from the opening of the flesh or from the membrane and similar things; then cure it so that it may be healed.
Here is the translation of the provided text:
E fay aquo am aquella alcunas veguadas entro que la medicina acuta corroda tot aquo que es romas en la conquavitat de la fistula de la corrupcio.
And then restore it with ointments that generate healthy flesh until it is healed.
If it does not heal with this method, then you must cauterize it according to what we have described.
But if the cause of the fistula is bone and you must certify this, then you shall examine it and dry it as we have described earlier, provided that you do not encounter any cause affecting a vein, nerve or main member as previously mentioned.
But if the bone is exposed and there is any corruption or blackness on it, then you must remove this until all corruption is gone; afterwards treat it with something that will make it flesh again until it is healed.
And if it is not healed and the arm falls off as before, then you should know that you have not achieved total eradication of the corruption; in this case uncover it again thoroughly, carefully remove its cause and clean it with a final light scraping, and afterwards restore it.
And so if it is healed, this is good; but if not, then you should know that the corruption lies deep within the body, which you have not reached, and in such case your work here is done and you must leave it.
And if the corrupted bone is small or it is feasible for you to extract it, then remove it using fine forceps that are suitable for this purpose.
And if there is damage to the bones, then carefully perform the extraction of all those affected areas, and leave none unaddressed due to your strength.
However, if you encounter any difficulty caused by the humors, and there is no fear or mistake in your incision, then incise those ligaments or flesh where necessary, and free the bones.
If you do not have the preparation for bone-setting at your disposal right now, then place on the wound something that will cause it to contract and leave it there until it is around those bones of flesh and ligaments, ensure that the wound is not consolidated, and the section that you have incised during your operation should be constricted.
Later on, if you are worried about any potential issues, place the affected area in warm wax soaked with oil or Egyptian plaster, or one of the green plasters because when these ligaments contract and the bones are separated from each other, this action will reduce the force being exerted.
Mays si es un gran os ayssi cum le os de camba o de coyssa o semblantz ad aquels, e aquo que de lu es corromput es la facia de lu tant solament, lahoras ratz aquella am resio tant solament derriera entro que sia ostada aquella negror e corrupcio, e aprop restaura la plagua.
Here is the translation of your first source sentence:
And I recommend to you that you bring a man to lie in the patient's lap so that he can provide support and assistance during your operation.
For a young man in his thirties who experiences pain in his hip, and the inflammation is internal, originating from within the body, where the matter (pus) has reached the hip. It is a case of a large abscess, with no apparent external cause.
And thus the healing process was prolonged due to the mistake of the doctors, as the abscess grew and released pus. The recovery was further delayed because his leg became fistulated (developed a fistula), resulting in multiple orifices emitting putrid matter and bodily fluids.
For two years, many doctors attempted to treat him, but they lacked the necessary knowledge and skill in this field of medicine; eventually, I was called upon.
I examined his leg and observed the flowing matter discharging from those orifices, which extended to a great length. The man's body was entirely debilitated, and his skin had turned yellow.
I then inserted a probe into one of the orifices and guided it to reach the bone.
And then I carefully examined all the openings and found that they led to their corresponding parts of the leg.
So I cut and incised above one of the openings which led me to discover a part of the bone, and I found it corrupted, already dirty and rotten, and a portion of the leg was already corrupt where the disease had penetrated up to the muscle.
Then I secured what was exposed and prepared, leaving the bone uncovered.
I believed that the disease was not in the bone but rather in the corrupted flesh which I had already cut away and secured.
Then I applied restorative medicine to the wound for a long time but it did not heal.
Again I cut back to the bone for a second time above the first incision, and discovered that the corruption had reached as far as the bone.
I secured what was exposed of the corruption, but I could not perform its cure and restoration.
Here is the translation of the provided text:
It is not necessary to repeat the operation and incision on him, but due to the condition of his testicles and his low tolerance level, along with fear of death because he faints at all hours due to excessive loss of blood.
Therefore, he is healed and fully recovered, with no hardness in any part of his body. His condition has improved overall within his body and his health has returned to him; he has regained his faculties and can move without causing himself harm or creating a nuisance.
However, if the bone that is prominent in the chest has already been extracted, then you must cut it according to this method: Take a thin and strong thread, then grasp the end of the protruding bone with it; instruct someone else to extend that bone outward while you hold onto the thread's extremity. Next, place over the initial thread a larger one made from wool; bind that one against the flesh beneath the bone and stretch its tip so as to draw the skin aside towards either side of where you are cutting, taking care not to allow the saw cut into any meat.
Then place a stick or board underneath the bone appropriately; when you do this, it will not hinder the saw from cutting through any corrupted flesh.
And now apply the plaster to the corrupted wound gradually, because if it is in the cavity of the bone and does not appear externally, then you must apply another bandage.
And if the bone is corrupted but not prominent, with one side continuing onto another, and the corruption is in the middle or on a part of it, then you must remove all flesh from around that area; place wood underneath, and then bandage the first part where the corruption is located before continuing to wrap the other part.
And let the bandage be small according to the location of the corruption, as we have said.
If the corruption is in the joint, then you must incise that corrupted joint and bandage the bone where it continues to another part.
And if the corruption is in the connection of two joints, then it must be an artificial reason rather than a natural one.
If the corruption is in the palm of the hand or foot, it is quite challenging; however, you must examine how the corruption appears to you and remove any affected tissue, cleansing it as best as possible according to its disposition, ensuring that any artificial corrections do not harm any veins or nerves.
Here is my best attempt at translating the provided text:
Here is the translation of your provided text:
And I, at the end of this chapter, will list the instruments that you will use with simples, which will be your procedure for prohibition, which you will try on others. Saw type:
Other saw type:
Form of another large saw:
Rasp form: Let the head of this rasp be according to the form of the star key, and its points follow the shape of the points on a chisel.
And it is not suitable unless with that the heads of joints are rubbed when they are corrupted, or the mouth is very wide.
Form of the minor razor:
Form of the wide razor:
Form of the other saw made decently: make its arch as high as possible and sharpen its iron part; also, let its handle be wooden, properly made. Forma de lu:
Forma de razori en la cual ha concavitat:
Forma de razori autra subtil:"
Forma de autra razori de curvada extremitat translates to "Another method for a curved extremity" or "An alternative approach for treating a curved limb.
A small, tent-like incisor" is what the given text translates to. This seems to be describing some form of medical tool or instrument resembling a miniature tent structure used in dental procedures, perhaps for treating specific conditions related to the teeth. It may refer to an early type of dental appliance or a temporary covering placed over damaged teeth during treatment.
Another smaller incisor" is the translation for the provided text. This seems to describe another type of surgical instrument or medical tool, specifically one that is smaller in size compared to other incisors mentioned previously. It could be a reference to a specialized tool used for delicate procedures requiring precision and finesse. The context suggests it might be employed for more intricate surgeries where a larger incisor would not be suitable.
Another incisor resembling a saw with its end like a blade is displayed in many places for the treatment of bones." This seems to describe yet another surgical instrument akin to a small saw or a specialized bone cutting tool. The reference to its being "displayed in many places" suggests it was a commonly used and well-known instrument during that era, likely employed by medical professionals for various orthopedic procedures. Its design with a serrated end like a blade further emphasizes its purpose as a cutting tool for bones.
A saw suitable for bone perforation." This text describes a type of surgical saw or drill designed specifically for creating holes or perforations in bones during medical procedures, likely orthopedic surgeries. The reference to its being "suitable for bone perforation" indicates that it was carefully crafted and intended for this specific purpose, ensuring precision and accuracy when used by medical professionals.
E la extremitat de lu es triangulada e de aguda extremitat."
And it is made of iron from India, and similarly, it covers all the causes we have mentioned regarding razors, knives, and saws.
Regarding the incision of extremities and the cutting of bones.
The extremities may require treatment due to intrinsic or extrinsic causes. If you have administered medication for the corruption but the cure does not take effect, and the corruption spreads to an uninjured part of the body without any apparent cause, it is necessary to incise that part where the infection has reached, so that the patient can escape death or severe illness which is more detrimental than the loss of the limb.
The sign that this has occurred is when the limb turns black before it is burned by fire, or if the blackness spreads from that part of the body to other parts and eventually affects the whole body; in such a case, proceed with the incision.
Similarly, if the cause of the corruption is due to the sting or bite of venomous creatures such as the scorpion, viper, adder, or similar, then proceed with the incision.
And if the corruption or injury is located at the tip of the finger, then you should cut into the finger and not give any space for the corruption to spread into the hand.
Similarly, if the problem extends to the hand, then you should make an incision at the base of the forearm and not allow any space for the corruption to reach the arm.
If instead of that, then make an incision on the arm above the elbow at the joint.
And if the corruption goes beyond that and it surrounds the elbow, then at this point there is death for the patient; to administer any other cause of cure besides this is a matter of virtue.
Similarly, do the same for the foot when corruption goes beyond the toe; then make an incision above one of the joints.
And if it reaches the arch of the foot, then you should cut open the entire foot. But if it goes further up to the shin, then make an incision on the leg above the ankle joint.
And if the corruption has already reached the shin, then it is not treatment but release; leave the patient to their death.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
And it is necessary that a cloth be placed over all parts so that it does not touch the affected area, and that the patient receives proper care and treatment for their injury or abscess.
However, if there is bleeding during the procedure, you should cauterize the wound gently or apply some blood-clotting powders to it; then return to your medical treatment until it is complete.
Then bind the affected limb with suitable bindings, and keep caring for it until it is completely healed.
And I recommend to you that this man should avoid walking on his foot due to the accident we mentioned earlier; it is an unfortunate incident where he injured the sole of his foot with burning, which was similar to fire-related burns.
And that accidental injury first affected his toe before spreading to the entire foot.
Therefore, that man should prepare himself for the possibility of pus formation as he undergoes treatment on his foot, which will be painful and intense due to its severity; he must incise this foot up until the joint, and then it can heal.
Long time afflicted with that same corruption in his right hand.
And so it came to me, and I must pierce that superfluity with what I put on his hand as medicine, thus cleaning his body; but the superfluity was not driven out, and I began going to the other side of his hand while beginning in his palm.
And he called me to incise his hand, but I did not want to do this hoping for the expulsion of that superfluity, and more so because I feared the incision into his dead hand, as the cause of his illness was over his heart.
And after he departed from me, he returned to his land and I heard that the man prepared and incised his entire hand, and was healed.
I have not added this narrative other than for it to be helpful in understanding this illness, and that it may serve as an indication of what it means and how it should be treated.
On the cure for abscesses and the quality of enemas with medicines.
When an abscess occurs on any fleshy part of the body and the space of the abscess is elongated so as to form a collection of pus, and it breaks open and perforates, expelling its pus, leaving behind an empty cavity like a vessel, and with only thin linen cloth remaining over it, and no further corruption has occurred, nor does it affect bone or nerve or ligament, then this is called a sinus and not a fistula.
However, if the space is prolonged and corruption begins in any part of the body, it is then called a fistula, not an abscess.
The treatment for it is to remove that affected area entirely as it stands, especially when it is ulcerated and formed like a piece of cloth, and ensure that it doesn't stick or attach itself back to the wound due to its corruption.
But if you hope for the affected part to stick and for that corruption not to spread any further, and there is an absence of pus in the wound, then treat it with a clyster.
And if you consider the sinuses and find that they are large, and emit an offensive odor from the arm which has them, then treat it with a clyster using an Egyptian medicine made of oil, vinegar, and resin (frankincense) taken in equal parts, mixed together in a vessel, and heated over fire until the mixture thickens to the consistency of honey.
Then take the required amount of this medicine and dissolve it in water and honey; use that to clyster the sinus, plug its opening, and let the medicine remain inside for two hours.
And then remove that with contempt; do this for as many days as it takes until the sinus is cleansed and the pus is absorbed.
Sometimes you may administer an enema with water and ash when this medicine is not available to you; take the ash from wood, mix it with water, and use that mixture to perform the enema until you notice that the sinus has been cleared.
If the patient cannot tolerate Egyptian medication nor water with ash, then administer an enema with plain water and honey mixed together; you can also use wine mixed with honey as it has the property of cleansing and soothing, and the wine will adhere to the sinus, especially when there is superfluous astringency and dryness in the wine.
And when you have done this several times and notice that the sinus has been cleansed, then administer an enema with water that promotes flesh growth.
Take some daffinicon ointment and dissolve it in rose oil and astringent wine, or you can use other medicines and ointments with properties that I have already written about in the treatise on ointments.
E si le orrifici del sinu es streyt en le qual no es recebuda la canula del clisteri, lahoras tu le amplifique aquel am ferr petit a petit, e pausa en lu calgua envolopada en enguent egipciac o en enguent basilicon entro que sia amplificat.
And if the opening is wide, then you gather its lips with a suture and leave in it as much as the enema needs to enter.
And if the opening from which the arm protrudes is elevated to higher parts, then dry it in the lowest place within it so that the arm can enter smoothly because when the arm is constricted at the depth of a sinew, flesh will form there.
And if it is not possible for you to dry the sinew around the lowest area as desired, then you must prepare the member with preparation so that the arm can move lightly according to your desire and be restrained by nothing.
May he who is above the navel, who always pushes down for this reason that what is put in him of the arm. And so that you may know if what runs from the arm is a lot or a little, whether it is digested or undigested.
And you should consider the place of that navel, if the patient feels pain there or not, and if it is inflamed.
And when your treatment is prolonged in this way, and you see that the matter which has been drawn over the navel has already adhered or has formed an appropriate adhesion, then on the third day you will release the patient's belt or girdle, and when you remove the plaster, then change it for another piece of cloth and renew the ointment.
But if from the navel a very thin fluid exudes then do not despair of the adhesion that has formed there, for its healing is appropriate, because only some people take time to form flesh in their wounds and those are the ones where the opposite occurs.
And if a lot of undigested fluid has come out from the navel for many days then know that the navel will not adhere; and if it is taking time for an adhesion to form in the navel and this situation continues, then you should use drying medicines, and if the medicines are moist by nature but dry in their action like unguent of diachylon when there is a superfluity of sharp humors.
And the last thing to do for their treatment is to take some ointment of diaphoretic and dissolve it in rose oil, and spread it over them like you would with a linen bandage on their substance, then apply that to them, and use it.
And it seems like an odd action when there are no arms to apply the diaphoretic ointment, you can use fat instead as a substitute or melt together myrrh and aloe with wax, grind everything into powder over fire, then spread this mixture onto cloth and place that on their side; also spread this with melted fat which has been thickened, sprinkle it with powder on a piece of cloth and place that.
And sometimes it is administered to them with aristology, long pepper roots and celestial lily (which is celestial lily) as well as the flour of ergot and centaurea, you can use these simple ingredients or combine them altogether, grind those together then sift and powder over honey that has been melted; and use this mixture.
And if the side is still sore and has not been healed by this treatment method, then know that the corruption is in its depth, already inquiring into their bones or other hard members or ligaments; then treat them with fistula treatment, as mentioned above.
De curacio de panarici et unguis attritae et incisione digiti additi et sectione.
Panarici is an abscess that forms beneath the nail of the big toe or little finger; it may also appear on other fingers/toes but this is rare. When prolonged and treatment is delayed, or if it becomes infected, pus spreads and corrodes the root of the nail, potentially corrupting the entire region and spreading infection to the bone (signaled by an odor). The tip of the affected digit will become discolored and darken.
And so, when you have the aforementioned condition as described in the previous section but your treatment does not bring relief, it is necessary to extract all superfluous matter remaining beneath the nail and then cauterize the wound afterwards, for cauterization is greatly beneficial in this case.
If the bone is healthy but the nail is detached and its roots compress the flesh around it, causing pain to said flesh when touched and drawing blood, then one must place a thin blade beneath the edge of the nail that pierces the skin and extract that skin with ease; put whatever remains of this flesh onto corrosive medicine so that all may be dissolved. Then treat the wound with ointment until healed.
But if corruption has already penetrated the bone, then you must cut into the bone and remove it, for there is no hope of healing when a corrupted bone remains.
And if you see the corruption and its progression in the finger, then you must cut into one of the joints depending on which is affected by its memory, and then cure it before it heals.
But if the nail suffers trauma or injury and becomes extremely painful, then you must first bleed the patient, and then use a sharp instrument with a transverse edge to cut off the nail from above downwards, ensuring that the incision does not reach into the flesh underneath the nail, as this will cause intense pain and could lead to an overgrowth of scar tissue in the area; treat the affected area with remedies for pain relief.
This finger deformity, which is born in the hands of some men, contains very little flesh and rarely has bones or nails.
Some of these deformities appear at the base of the joints or are formed in some of the finger joints. May he who is born with defects in his fingers not be harmed, but one born with severe joint problems may face difficulties.
And for those born with fleshy bodies, the incision should be light, and you must insert the spatula laterally.
However, for someone born with a defect at the root of the joint, healing is difficult; therefore, beware of his excision.
But for one born with a defect in the fingers above the knuckles, it is necessary that you make an initial round incision into their flesh and then saw with one of those saws suitable for this, and then treat him until he is cured.
However, for the consolidation that occurs in fingers due to visible swelling or from congenital defects, or from the healing of injuries or burns, it is necessary to cut off this consolidation until those fingers return to their natural form.
Then place the patient between clean sheets and fill them with rose oil so that they are not lightly consolidated, or separate those fingers with a thin lead plate until they consolidate as required.
And likewise, if hardening occurs in some parts of the palm, you remove that hardened part according to its preparation and suitability for the shape of the member.
Regarding incisions, there are varicose veins.
Varicose veins are dilated and thick veins filled with superfluous melancholic humors that appear in parts of the body, especially on the legs, primarily on the legs of travelers, workers, and carriers.
Therefore, you should administer a purge of black bile from the body several times with force and then bleed the patient from the basilic vein.
The treatment of varicose veins with iron can be done in two ways: either by incision and drawing out the black blood or by elevating the vein and extracting it entirely.
The incision is done in this manner: first, bathe the leg with cold water until the thick blood from the leg is resolved and becomes more liquid; then bind the patient's leg tightly above the hip and below it with a bandage; next, cut into the vein at one point or two or three places with wide incisions; after that, draw out the black blood by gently pulling down on the part of the vein closest to their foot towards the part just under the knee; do this until you have drawn off enough blood and removed its harmful qualities.
And then bind him/her up, and command them to abstain from foods that generate black bile.
Repeat the cure by means of bloodletting when the veins are full, and he/she feels better.
However, their elevation is done in this manner: you who scratch the patient's leg, if he/she has dead flesh, then immerse him/her in a bath and douse the leg with cold water until it reddens and the veins are raised; or if there be no bath available, have him/her exercised vigorously so that the limb is scraped.
Then cut the cord on the right side of the vein by incision into his/her thigh or in his/her behind you should pull it out, or at its lowest point you should cut it off.
Then open the cord with hooks and strip the vein from all parts until it appears in view, and you should look for what you see as thread turning towards blackness.
And thus, when you draw out (blood) and see the cord white in appearance, it is good.
And then you place under them a board that is raised and tilted towards the head end, and suspend their arm on a pulley system.
Then suture another section just beyond that one with three stitches, and carefully cut the skin of the head end back to expose the vein.
Then lift it up and make an incision in the rear section behind the ankle, then extract it and push it out through the second section, and finally remove it from the section above.
Do this until you have extracted it from the most superior or highest section, once everything has been pushed out; then make an incision.
If you are unable to extract and raise it, then insert a strong double-pointed needle and use it to hook the vessel and pull it out, or insert a board under them and rotate your hand around until it is freed. And be careful not to make an incision in it, for if you break the vessel, it will be difficult for you to remove the clot and the patient may suffer harm from its rupture.
And when the air around has been expelled, place on the wound a poultice of wool soaked in rose oil and uncolored oil, and treat it until it is cured.
And if the bowel is contracted with twists that bind its parts together, and it does not return to straightness as we have said before, then you should cut into it over all those twisted parts and binding points, and then suspend it with hooks until you lift it up.
And take care not to cut into the vein and block it off, for it will be difficult for you to lift up that part; let your wisdom guide you in this.
The shape of the instrument with which you cut into the dried-out bowel:
It is not pointed like hooks nor has a sharp end so as to not pierce the vein; and it should be made of thick flexible iron, for if it were too thin, it would cut through the vein due to its thinness; there is a superfluous thickness in it just as we have said.
De extraccio venae cruris translates to "The extraction of the leg vein.
This translates to: "This vein is generated in the legs, in low-lying lands such as Al-Ateeqi in Arabia and the marshy lands of India that are dry, poor in vegetation, and have little grass.
And it is rarely generated in other parts of the body besides the legs.
Its formation comes from the putrefaction that follows an injury, just like how snakes, worms, scorpions, and other vermin breed inside a wound in the body.
A sign of its onset is the leg vein that appears in the thigh, causing severe inflammation; then blisters form there, and soon after, the vein begins to emerge from where these blisters appeared, looking like a plant's roots.
Once it becomes apparent to you, take a piece of lead weighing one drachma or two drachmas and secure it around the vein; then leave this lead suspended from the thigh.
Every time it causes pain in other parts of the body besides the thighs, bind that area with lead as well and secure it. E si mot es prolonguat, lahoras tu inscideys una partida de lu e envolopa le romanent; e no inscidas aquella de razit entro que sia fora yssida, quar si inscideys aquela es contrayta e intra en la carn e fa accidir apostema e poyredura en le loc e ulceracio mala.
For this reason, it is necessary that it be treated thoroughly and extracted little by little, until it is expelled from the patient's back, and no cause remains in their body.
And from this vein, I have heard that in some men it can be up to 10 palms [in length], and I even came across one individual whose vein reached an incredible 20 palms.
If it is cut during its treatment hours, then insert a rod into the wound and pierce that long gash across their body until everything within the affected matter is evacuated, and apply putrefaction to the area for several days with medicine; thereafter cure the wound through proper post-operative care.
And this vein occasionally exhibits many knots, and mostly when it appears at the ankle joint or on the foot; many orifices emerge from it, and each orifice is known to produce a branch.
So treat it as we have described in the section above, and with what has been mentioned therein.
Regarding sections on worms generated beneath the skin, this condition is known as bovine sickness.

May you see the patient's condition reach the top of their head, then grasp the eyebrow with a strong grip and pull it out; afterward ensure that the patient undergoes body purification using medicines to evacuate unhealthy foul humours, and avoid foods that cause decay.
On treatment for nose ailments.
This ailment is called "nafir" in our region; it is a pain that moves from one body part to another.
And I have seen the latter, which I will recount for you. I was called to attend to a sick woman in a village; I examined her arm and noticed a small inflammation on the vein of her arm, which had remained stagnant for an hour, but then it started moving upwards like vermillion spreading across this space, more gently than fire would consume, as if it were liquid silver flowing from place to place.
Then the pain subsided from that spot and settled into her muscle; I stayed there for another hour.
Afterward, it coursed through the rest of her body until it reached the other arm.
And I witnessed him writhing throughout his body as I observed; and I was greatly astonished by the interchangeability of his limbs and their velocity. I had previously witnessed this in my patients according to that manner, but I have seen many who find pain relief through the movement of their limbs. I have not observed this in my male patients as it occurs in females.
And I did not think this was anything other than what it is because the female patient was elderly, with thin skin and visible veins; in her, such movement of pain manifested itself.
It is important that this retro-curative approach not be utilized for those who are delicate and have moist skin with prominent veins.
And if you wish to cure the patient and they experience pain during treatment, but the issue is not as described above, then press firmly on them and lightly tap the area where the pain has shifted until it subsides; then cauterize that spot.
But if you cannot identify the issue with your own eyes, then cure them by drawing out the humors from their body and through the expulsion of these winds; administer foul-smelling pills and pills made of serpent flesh or similar.
De extraccio de sagetas: The Extraction of Arrows.
Sagetas (arrows) are diverse according to their types and the parts of the body they hit, for their diversity is such that some have large heads, others small ones, while yet other have concave or blunt ends, still others are solid; further there are those with three edges, as well as those which have barbs, and those which have feathers.
As for the signs pertaining to the brain: if an arrow pierces its bone and emerges from the crown of the head, this causes violent headaches, blindness, dizziness, pain in the eyes, inflammation and pain of the tongue, spasms, confusion, vomiting bile, severe impairment of speech, loss of voice; furthermore a white discharge oozes from the wound like dust, and the flesh around it appears watery.
And so if these signs appear to you, then you should refrain from the cure and extraction of the arrowhead, unless otherwise specified.
But when the signs of the arrowhead being in the heart are as follows: it is close to the left nipple, and you feel that it has been embedded in hard tissue, not soft tissue; and its movement, if any, resembles that of the pulse, with dark-colored blood flowing out, along with coldness of the extremities, shallow breathing, and fainting spells; then know that death swiftly descends upon them.
And the signs when the arrowhead has pierced the lung are: foamy blood is issuing from the wound, the vessels near the neck have become inflamed, and the patient's complexion changes; they breathe heavily and deeply, as if drawing in cold air with great effort.
If the arrowhead has penetrated into the covering that is in the foot, and pain occurs nearby the small ribs, then a great outcry should be made with intense pain and gasping for breath, but there will not be paralysis of all the body's muscles.
And if the arrowhead has entered the stomach, then quite likely some undigested food will emerge from the wound.
Here is the translation of your provided text:
Here is my translation of the provided text:
Moreover, other body parts such as the face, neck, throat, shoulders, vertebrae of the back, ribs, hip bone, thigh, and similar areas are treated according to established practice when the arrowhead has not pierced a vein or artery and is not a poisoned arrow.
And I will recount this to you about the nature of these arrowheads so that you may know how to treat them.
The reason for this is that in the case of an arrowhead lodged in a man's tear duct near his nose, I extracted it from him on the opposite side, leaving a wound behind his ear, and he healed without any harm coming to his eye.
I extracted another arrowhead from a Jew who had been shot in the socket of his eye, just below the eyelid, where the arrowhead was already hidden and could only be grasped by its small tip that remained attached to its shaft. This was one of those long, sharp arrows used by the Turks with a lion emblazoned on it but without ears.
The Jew is healed, and his eye suffered no harm.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
Here is my translation of the provided text:
And there was a man in whom an arrow had pierced his back, and the wound has become hardened on him with suppuration for nearly seven years now, until the arrow came out at the hollow of his hip.
I saw a woman in whom an arrow had pierced her belly, and the wound is hardened inside her, with no change to its appearance over time, and the woman does not suffer any harm or obstruction in her natural functions.
I observed another man in whom an arrow had pierced his face and the wound has healed but broken open again as if the arrow is still there, causing him no pain, with many similarities to the previous cases.
I extracted the arrow from the nose of the king's chief minister, which had entered just between his eyebrows and slightly inclined towards the right side; the entire arrow was hidden within.
I was summoned for his treatment only three days after the injury occurred.
Then I closely examined the wound to try and locate the arrow, but I could not find it; however, he felt a pricking sensation just beneath his right ear, which led me to believe that this was due to the tip of the arrow.
And cover the area with a plaster that has attractive and digestive virtues, trusting in me that the place will become infected so that the wound appears to me, so I can dry it.
And do not make a mistake in assuming that the arrow has reached this place; I will continue with the plaster on it for many days and no accident happens; meanwhile, the wound is healed, and the patient recovers from their extraction over several days until one day they felt the arrow inside their nose and told me about it.
Then I placed sharp corrosive medicine on the wound for many days until it opened, and with a hook, I tried to grab it, but only found the tip of the arrow, which was stuck to the shaft.
Then I poured the sharp corrosive medicine into the wound until I could clearly see the tip of the arrow, and this process took place over four months.
And since the wound was enlarged, it became possible for me to insert the scissors into it, and I removed the tip of the arrow that remained inside. However, I could not extract the rest, so I did not stop trying different methods and tools until one day I managed to design a pair of forceps specifically tailored for this purpose, as will be described later in this chapter, and successfully extracted the arrow; then I treated the wound.
Here is the translation of your provided text:

Here is my best translation of the given text:
And so, I say that arrows are not removed from the members in which they are embedded but rather according to two methods: either by attraction from the place where it enters or by pressure from the opposite side.
And the one that is removed by attracting it from the entry point may be an arrow that has hit a fleshy area and been drawn out.
If it does not obey the attempt to extract at this moment, then you must leave it for a few days until the flesh around it swells and is loosened from its attraction and its exit.
Similarly, if it is embedded in bone and does not yield to your extraction attempt, then leave it for a few days and try again with traction and movement each day until it is removed.
And if it does not yield to your attempts after a few days, then you must drill into the path of the arrow in that bone from both sides with a fine borer until the area is widened around the arrow, and then extract it.
But if the arrow has already penetrated the chest cavity and is hidden from sight, you must probe for it carefully with your hands or some other suitable tool, and when you find it, then draw it out with appropriate instruments.
And if you cannot operate on the patient due to the restricted access caused by swelling and the length of the arrowhead, there being neither a vein nor nerve involved, then you should make an incision in such a way as to widen the wound so that the arrow may be extracted.
And if they have an arrow in their ear and you hold it there, then release the flesh into which it is embedded from all around with as much skill as you can muster; and devise some plan for this, such that if you cannot free the flesh at the fracture of the ears or if they twist, they will obey.
When you perform the extraction of the arrow from any location, use your hand in such a way as to twist and apply forceps all around so that it obeys; and be gentle yet firm so that the arrow is not broken nor do you make its removal difficult for yourself.
Here is my translation of the provided text: If you find that bleeding causes discomfort to the patient, then apply the treatments we have discussed in this chapter.
Take heed of your skill in incising veins, nerves, or cords, and manage any accidental arrow injuries with all the means at your disposal to avoid further harm; do so with ease, calmness, speed, and firmness, as I have instructed you.
Therefore, press against the arrow in a way that aligns with the figure showing the direction of its entrance into the body; this is most beneficial for the patient. If that is not feasible for you, then apply the treatment that is within your capabilities based on the figures provided.
For arrows that have bent outwards due to the opposing force of another part, or those that have already caused some damage to the surrounding parts and have become embedded in the flesh with their tips visible above the wound; you must cut off the tip using scissors according to its size. Then pull it out, as this is a gentle process.
If the arrow is lodged in the bone, you must twist it gently in an opposite direction until it releases from the bone and can be extracted.
And if not, leave her there for a few days, then repeat the process until it succeeds.
And if the shaft of the arrow is inside her, then you need to push it out.
However, if the shaft has fallen out and you need to administer a push, then introduce a concave instrument into her if she is unconscious, ensuring it fits over the tail of the arrow, and then push the shaft out.
But if the arrow is concave, you will need to push it out with a strong instrument that enters her deeply, as the arrowhead is relieved by this.
And if the arrow is envenomed, you must ensure that you hollow out all of the flesh surrounding the wound, if it is at all possible to do so, and then treat her with whatever seems appropriate.
If the arrow has penetrated the foot or the abdomen or bladder or side, and it is close enough that you can feel it with a rod, and it is at all possible to do so, then saw through the flesh surrounding it and remove the arrowhead, taking care not to cut any veins or nerves. Suture the wound if necessary and treat her until she is healed.

The opening of veins that are near the ears is recommended by ancient cataracts and for various head ailments, such as ear infections, skin diseases, and old ulcers.
And the process of bleeding these veins is as follows: first, shave the patient's head and rub their head vigorously at the occipital region where both veins are located; then, bind the patient's neck tightly with a cloth around which two sticks have been placed over the two spots near the ears on either side of the head; finally, feel for these with your finger and if you can detect their pulse there, begin the procedure.
Then take the lancet-like blade, which should be sharp, and insert it beneath the vein in such a way that the phlebotomist can reach the bone. And then lift your hand, holding both the vein and bone at their divided points, and make an incision in the vein with a sharp blade. Let the length of the incision be about two fingers in size or thereabouts, and let as much blood flow out as you wish.
Then bind it firmly with powder and leave it until it is healed.
And previously, at the beginning of this book, we discussed incisions and their cauterization.
More often, the two veins used in bloodletting by ancient physicians are the temporal vein and its opposite, as well as the occipital artery, which is prone to excess fluid buildup.
The process of bloodletting, which I recommend to you, should be done by restraining the patient's collar with your hand until both veins become visible and can be felt under your fingers; their pulse will also change beneath your touch.
Then you should lift the cord off the vein by using your index finger, insert the bloodletting instrument underneath it, and raise the vein upwards; proceed to cut into it just as you did with the other two veins before, letting out enough blood for your needs.
After releasing the patient from their restraint, place your finger on the vein for an hour; then cover it with a compress and powder, binding it tightly to keep it compressed until it heals.
The reminder of these procedures has been given before; earlier in the book we discussed incisions and extractions.

E alcunas veguadas es uberta am fleubotomi lat, empero no cove que·l fleubotomi sia de acuta extremitat ayssi cum les autres fleubotomis, abantz sia de lada extremitat, e fleubotoma aquella segon le tranvers, quar le os es propda e fort leu trencaria en lu le fleubotomi quan es subtil.

Undergoing phlebotomy is such that the patient should strengthen his neck with a bandage, and then you perform phlebotomy on them while standing over their head.
When performing phlebotomy along the transversal and longitudinal direction with short, shallow incisions as there is little meat at this place, a precise incision will prevent its end from being torn.
Let the blood run from them for as long as is necessary to you, and place a plug on it, bind them tightly with bandages for one night, then free them from their bindings.
Indeed nasal venous phlebotomy is applicable to acute fever and violent headaches as well as diseases of the head such as migraines or tumors that happen in the cranial area, especially when they are old.
When performing the phlebotomy on them, have the patient strengthen their neck and hold their nose with your left hand, take a precise long incision instrument and place it in the middle of the root of the nose according to its straightness, as the vein does not appear at all here by feeling and the blood begins to flow immediately.
Withdraw your hand from the incision instrument little by little and let the blood flow according to what is needed; then bind it for one night as the wound heals lightly.
Here is the translation of the provided text:
E la qualitat de la fleubotomia de aquelas es que el malaute strenha dejos quascuna en le sieu col am liament; e estia le artifexs sobre le cap del malaute, e le malaute sia sezent sobre una sezela.
Under the flank, slowly bleed one vein with a small wide lancet; then draw out as much blood as you consider necessary or sufficient according to season and quantity; and do likewise on the other side.
Then untie the ligature and bind both veins with a moderate bandage so that the patient is not suffocated; leave them until morning when the wound has healed.
The benefit of bleeding the algaroth veins is that it brings about small boils and blisters in the mouth, corruption of gums, and bad ulcers or cracks; as well as bad ulcers found inside the nose and around its area.
And the quality of this bleeding is that you make the patient lie down before you and bandage his neck; then turn up their lips and look at the two veins, one being on the right side of the lip and the other on its left; their identification comes from the blackness of each of these two, especially as small black veins are found around them; so make an incision in each with a cutting instrument.
If you have any doubts or do not know which is which, then make your incision in the larger of them and the more apparent one.
And make it appear that you are dealing with the two veins located above the lips.
The help provided by the two veins below the tongue is mostly useful in performing a bloodletting of the cephalic vein to address swelling in the throat, disease of the uvula, and ailments of the mouth.
And the way to perform bloodletting on them is as follows: have the patient sit between your two hands facing the sun, lift their tongue, and look below it for the two veins on either side of their tongue; the colour of each should appear blackish.
Then bloodlet each of them; be careful not to overdo it while you bloodlet as below those veins lie arteries.
And the two veins that are bloodlet in the elbow run through all men, and their bloodletting is performed according to two methods, either by applying myrtle or olive leaves, finely crushed; or use a sharp blade as your fleubotomi and handle it like this:
Keep his hips this way as well, and you need to open the concave veins full of large, visible, clotted blood.
This bloodletting method has a smaller width and a more refined tip, making it suitable for the delicate veins that contain thin, yellow blood.
Always let the blood flow from the basilic vein, which is one of three veins: first draw out the blood from around the throat and neck, then that which is in their feet and belly.
And it is the bloodletter's duty when letting this blood to be careful and gentle in their work, as there lies an artery close by; should they miss and pierce that instead with the sharp end of the bloodletting tool, they would cut into the said artery causing a gush of blood. Thus you must not perform bloodletting on it with a pointed tool but rather incise it like so with a knife.
And if the basilic vein is not visible to you then it must be left alone and you should move on to another instead or look for one of its branches; Or let blood from the end part of their arm, as that too is visible; and cut into this with a knife just as we have said.
Here is my best attempt at translating the provided text:
And when you see that, as the ligament is tightened, there is inflammation in the place you have marked with a bandage, then that inflammation is of the artery, and therefore avoid it.
And if you see the blood flowing during phlebotomy like a child's urine, and the blood is subtle and reddish in color, then know that it is arterial blood; and at that moment, apply pressure with your finger on it for a long time; then remove your finger, and if the blood is cut off, as it has been many times before, then tighten the arm and leave it.
Take care of the patient's discharge, which may be excessive due to fear, but do not harm them if it does not improve within a few days.
But if the blood is not cut off and you see that there is no other way to treat it with medicine, then you must incise the artery yourself; for its end is contracted and the blood is cut off; or take a fresh fig leaf, apply it, and take half of it and bind it over the vein's location tightly with threads and powders until another day.
And if the blood is cut off, it is so; but if not, then treat it with what was mentioned earlier regarding the location of the powder that cuts off the flow of blood.
And bloodletting from him is difficult in many positions due to the small location of the wound and the possibility of tying up his arm.
More often, phlebotomy is beneficial for drawing blood from the upper part of the head and from below the chest; as it consists of branches of the basilic vein and the cephalic vein, as we have said.
And be aware, phlebotomist, of the one who is overly fearful during their phlebotomy, as there is a nerve nearby; and if it is struck during the puncture of the phlebotomy and the nerve is severed, it will cause them to faint, and it is difficult for them to heal, and quite often they are not completely healed. This nerve appears in many places where there is sensation; and if it is hidden from some people and is subtle and not visible, then be sure to place your phlebotomy instrument with the part that is like a handle, and avoid the nerve with your strength.
And if the vein is located between two nerves, then you should cut the vein lengthwise.
The benefit of phlebotomy using the cephalic vein is that it draws blood from the head and provides relief to those suffering from headaches.
And now for this specific case, if you wish to perform phlebotomy, use either the olive-shaped fleam or the myrtle-shaped fleam; because it is the safest among all veins, as it is located away from arteries and nerves.
Although in some individuals there may be swelling due to a haematoma when the phlebotomy is not done correctly on the first attempt, do not puncture this haematoma.
The first thing to know is that phlebotomy should be administered for the preservation of health and as a preventative measure against illness; it should not be used unless necessary. Phlebotomy should be performed on one of the veins in the arm: the cephalic, the basilic, or the median cubital (antecubital) vein. It is best done at the start of spring, before breakfast during spring and autumn, and in winter after eating, when there are signs of fullness.
And bloodletting should be done on the third day or when three hours of daylight have passed after the first day.
Bloodletting can be administered whenever it is deemed appropriate and necessary, whether during the day or at night, at any hour and in all times.
It is advised that an infant should not undergo bloodletting until they reach the age of 14, a pregnant woman should be spared from this procedure until the fourth month up to the seventh month, and elderly individuals who have passed their sixtieth year should refrain from it altogether.
If anyone wishes to undergo bloodletting for any reason, it is necessary that they cleanse their intestines beforehand with a lion-strength enema (i.e., an enema made from the extract of lions), especially if there are any retained fecal matter or tears in the intestines, so as not to allow the veins to absorb these superfluities during bloodletting, which would result in impurities and harm to their vital organs.
Patients suffering from nausea due to excessive drinking, those recovering from illness or debauchery, individuals with edema (i.e., water retention in the body tissues), as well as those experiencing severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and gastrointestinal issues should refrain from bloodletting. Moreover, it is imperative that one abstain from practices that deplete the body's strength or virtue, whether these are physical endeavors like heavy labor or excessive exercise, dietary restrictions such as fasting, sleep deprivation through vigil-keeping, or any other factor that might diminish one's vitality, be it of a bodily or spiritual nature.
And now consider the elevation of vapors; if the blood is thick, use diet and drinks, and medications if it is necessary for them.
Then proceed to bathing if nothing prohibits it, or engage in some exercise to make the blood more fluid.
Perform the bloodletting on them in the foot around third hour of the day, as we have mentioned before.
Ensure that the patient's foot is protected on that day from all evil animal spirits, such as anguish, anger, fear, and any physical harm, including unnecessary work or punishment, and anything similar.
At the patient's bedside, ensure that there are fragrant and pleasant-smelling herbs or similar things commonly used by people to create a soothing atmosphere.
Have the bloodletter sit on a cushion, one that is higher than the patient's cushion, for them to perform the bloodletting.
Then pull out your arms, and rub the patient with your hands two or three times; after that, tighten the ligature with a strap and wrap it around twice.
E sia la strictura temprada, quar la strictura quant no es engual, o la strictura es am superfluitat, lahoras prohibeys de fluxs del sanc; o es am mollificacio, e lahoras prohibeys le cors del sanc eyssament.
And then apply a tourniquet, ensure that the person who will perform the phlebotomy presses both their hands together between them while the veins are swollen and easily palpable.
Then the phlebotomist should grease their phlebotomy instrument with a little old oil (the type used by surgeons); then place your index finger of the left hand on that vein, where you want to perform the phlebotomy, so that the vein swells slightly and its pulsation ceases because among the veins it is this one which like a cord moves away when struck; and it must be full of wind (a fleury, or aneurysm) and when you place your phlebotomy instrument on it, it should contract around the instrument, and the phlebotomist will feel it. The phlebotomy instrument does not enter the vein, if so, this means that the vein is too narrow.
And therefore it is necessary for the phlebotomist to be steadfast and vigilant in all these circumstances.
Then withdraw the phlebotomy instrument, but if the vein is found in one spot, then it is so; and if not, repeat this action elsewhere near that place a little or with an incision, if the area is not abscessed.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
And then repeat the bloodletting if she desires.
And if the aperture is small and the blood flows gently, and you fear that it won't come out in the quantity desired, then repeat the fleubotomia on that same wound but with a slight adjustment to the aperture, doing so quickly before the site becomes abscessed, because this area often becomes abscessed and requires little incision.
But if you see that it is already abscessed, do not repeat the procedure on it, for there is no excuse for you to do so; instead, place a small portion of olive oil salve over it, as this eases the heart of the blood. And it is better in this location to use olive oil over any other oils.
Similarly, apply a salve of olive oil on all fleubotomia where you have prohibited the heart's blood from flowing through the veins; and do so with Tyrian myrrh and sagapenum when placed over the wound, as it purifies and cleanses the thick blood.
And if a large abscess forms in the location of the fleubotomia, which often happens, especially to those who have not been bled recently or whose incision into the vein was small; and you should treat it by placing over the site a sponge infused with water and salt, slightly scraped, and hold this for an hour as it will dissolve.
And now it is necessary to take a blood sample from that vein with its corresponding tube or another vein.
And if there remains in the place for a few days any blackness or greenness, do not note it; and if you wish, apply to that area some aloe and myrrh solution, or some juice of mallow or calament or something similar.
And when occasionally this happens, abscesses and swellings appear; you must perform venesection on the basilic vein.
Then place your hand on it, and if you find softness there, increase the pressure of your hand on that area; then that swelling is bad and harmful; so be careful to apply any of what has been said before, as blood will flow strongly from the artery.
Make an ointment with what astringes, so that the place hardens; and then cure it with another remedy until it is healed.
And you must draw blood from all men according to the quantity of their strength, and according to the appearance over the blood as it comes out.
Here is my translation of the first source sentence:
Under these circumstances, when a person is full and strong but requires bloodletting in one session, the venesection should be expanded and the vein-cutters made broad.
For someone who is feeble, the opposite should be done; it's advisable to extract blood in multiple sessions and make sure the incision is narrow.
The best way to perform venesection is by making a transverse cut across the vein rather than piercing it.
This method of venesection is safer than the longitudinal and latitudinal cuts, as it reduces the risk of blood flowing out excessively and nerves being cut during the process. It's more advisable and safer overall.
If the patient is prone to fainting during bloodletting, it's recommended that you treat them beforehand with a small piece of bread soaked in either pomegranate wine or plain oxymel (a mixture of water and vinegar). Then proceed to extract their blood in three or four sessions.
If the patient's complexion appears cold, treat them with bread soaked in myrrh syrup or spiced honey syrup infused with pepper, cinnamon, ginger, and similar spices beforehand. Alternatively, an aromatic and strongly scented simple syrup can be used instead.
Here is my best attempt at translating the provided medieval medical text into English:
And make use of the other causes that we have mentioned in the division of syncope due to evacuation.
And for those who wish to strengthen their arms and dissolve their blood for the second time, it is necessary to apply leech therapy, which is done by evacuation, and its virtue is cold, so that the blood is evacuated little by little, depending on the amount of virtue over consecutive days.
For those who wish to strengthen their arms and purify their blood for the second time, and if their body is strong, then let this be done approximately seven or nine hours after the first bloodletting.
For those who wish to purify the blood of their body in opposition to its natural course, it is necessary for this to be done on the second or third day.
If a body has an excess of blood that is already weakened and aggravated, causing fever, it must be purified by letting out a large amount of blood in one go, and care should be taken to increase the perception when syncope occurs. You should place your hand on their pulse until the bleeding from the heart stops, so as not to cause death instead of syncope, for many times this has happened due to the ignorance and negligence of the bloodletter.
Here is the translation of the provided text:
Having allowed the blood to flow until it is extracted appropriately; or remove with the sharpness of the fleam that coagulates the blood in the opening of the vein; or place on it a poultice made from aloes, or sage, and compress lightly until the blood has ceased to flow.
And if the vein is inflamed, leave it alone and do not touch it until the inflammation subsides.
And if it is necessary to evacuate the blood further, and there is no excuse not to do so, then you may bleed him in that same place or in another arm, on a different vein.
When the vein known as the 'brachial plexus' is fleam-bled in the place of the cephalic or basilic veins, when they are not found or are hidden, as it is made up of those.
And the quality of the patient's phlebotomy is that he should immerse his hand in cold water until the tip reddens and the vein appears clearly.
Then it should be compressed lightly with a gentle grip; and then you may phlebotomize according to the small transverse [cut], not longitudinally nor according to its length.
And if the incision is large and you perform your bloodletting above the elbow joint, do it a little higher.
And if the flow of blood is blocked, then dip your hand in warm water and let the blood run into the water until you achieve what is necessary.
However, if you were in the summer days, then you would be exempt from repeating the hand dipping in warm water; and for them it is enough to stop the bleeding of the patient's heart by using cold water during winter.
And the bloodletting of this vein is safer than all others, for it does not have any pulsating veins or nerves.
The bloodletting of the snuffbox on the right hand is appropriate for liver ailments.
And the quality of your bloodletting should involve you squeezing their hand with a bandage or using yours, since you've dipped it in warm water already, until the vein is swollen and clearly visible to the surgeon; then make the incision across it; and if you go too deep it will not harm them at all.
And make sure you do not cut too deep during bloodletting, for their nerves are exposed and stripped of flesh.
Then dip your hand in warm water and let the blood flow into it; for if you do not immerse it in warm water, the blood will clot at the opening of the vein, preventing its proper flow.
And once the required amount of blood is extracted, you should apply oil and salt to the vein so that it does not become permanently sealed shut; similarly, it is recommended that you do this for all narrow veins.
The bloodletting from the left hand is most beneficial for ailments of the chest.
Similarly, proceed with bloodletting from the other side in the same manner as you did on the first.
The bloodletting from the cephalic vein is beneficial for ailments that affect the lower part of the body, such as diseases of the genitals and menstrual disorders, as well as for old sores and ulcerations on the thighs and legs, and their like.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
And thus, let the largest phlebotome [be used] on either side of the leg below the malleolus, for it is better and safer.
And if you perform phlebotomy on the foot's surface [sole], then beware of the nerves that lie beneath it over the sole of the foot, and place your phlebotomy instrument across it as if you were going to incision.
And let your phlebotomy be gentle [or: not be strong].
But bloodletting is prohibited in this case; then dip the foot into warm water and let the blood run through a vessel until evacuated.
And if the phlebotomist errs at first, then repeat with the phlebotomy instrument on it a little more, for this site is safe; and do not fear harming him [or her], but be mindful of the nerves as we have said.
Similarly, do the same on the other foot likewise.
And for the sciatic vein [or: nerve], the site as we have said is on the side of the heel below the popliteal fossa.
And the benefit of bloodletting for him is relief from hip pain when it is caused by excess blood.
The quality of the bloodletting process is that the patient should enter a bath, and then quickly and firmly bind their thigh from the side of the hip to just above the ankle with a long, fine bandage, as it should not appear anywhere else.
And when it appears, then you should bloodlet that area according to what is possible for you and with the least trauma; you can make an incision or a cut, as the place is sensitive.
It is often less painful in men with large calves; but if you find it and it does not appear to cause any sensation when pricked, then bloodlet a branch of it, which appears on the back of the foot between the little toe and the one beside it.
Be careful to avoid the nerves, and let out as much blood as you wish.
Then untie the binding and place a compress over the bloodletting site, firmly securing it, as it heals quickly.
De ventozacio is about cupping therapy and its qualities of use.
Ventosas (cupping glasses) can be made of horn, clay, or glass.
Cupping therapy is performed in two ways: one involves making incisions and extracting blood, while the other is cupping without incision.
The cupping therapy without incision is also done in two ways: one with fire and the other without fire.
The cupping glasses applied with incision and blood extraction are used in fourteen places of the body: one is placed at alnocrati, which is the back part of the head; another on either side of the neck, above the collarbone; below the jaw under the mouth; near the chin; on both temples; at the end of the spine; on both armpits; on both elbows; and on both hips.
Cupping therapy extracts blood only from the small veins spread in the flesh, and because of this it does not deplete the virtue like phlebotomy; nor is it necessary to use fire or not during cupping for any illness except fullness such that the whole body has been evacuated.
If the need arises for cupping due to illness or persistence, administer it at any time of the month: its start, middle, or end.
And therefore, whenever you observe any of these signs, and especially if it is in the middle or latter half of the month, we command that cupping be performed after two to three hours have passed.
The benefit of cupping at the nape is that it aids in relieving heaviness felt in the head and around the eyes, provided there is no serious blockage in any part of the body.
And this window is located in the area of the cephalic vein for bloodletting.
It is not suitable to use this on a person with a dark complexion or one who has a catarrh (cold), as it can cause great harm.
For this reason, one should not use it on old people, or those with cold ailments in their head.
There is often forgetfulness in those who continuously apply this to others; therefore, you should instruct the window-operator to remove their hand slightly from the cupping area to prevent further forgetfulness.
Cupping with Al-Kohl is done in the area of bloodletting for the dark vein and the basilica vein; it helps with asthma, chest tightness, shortness of breath, coughing, and congestion.
One should ensure the Al-Kohl cup is only slightly placed on the skin because if it is left in contact with the skin for too long, it can cause weakness in the heart and stomach.
Cupping with Al-Hagdhan is beneficial for accidental headaches, eye inflammation, migraines, tension before headaches, and tooth root pain. It should be done in the area of bloodletting for the basilica vein.
And now you must instruct the cupper not to press his hand during the scarring, so that he does not cut the artery and cause a flow of blood.
The cupping applied to the chin will give you alcohol in the mouth, and cause corruption of the gums, as well as a similar appearance to those illnesses that are found in the mouth; and it is located in place of phlebotomy for jaundiced patients who have two lips.
But the cupping that is done over two flat pieces of wood gives you headache, which is caused by an excess of heat.
And the cupping applied inside two forked sticks gives you the bloodletting of three veins: basilica, median cubital, and cephalic; for it draws out all that is most fluid from the flesh through these small veins into those large ones where the attraction reaches the three main veins.
Instruct the cupper not to go too deep when scarring; for it is flesh-free and only nerves and arteries remain.
It is a cup with which one cups over the buttocks, giving hemorrhoids of the anus and deeper ulcers.
Here is the translation of your provided text:
Mays ventozas de las cambas minueysso per minuicio manifesta, quar atiran le sanc de tot le cors, e comfereysso a dolors antiquas dels ronhos e de la mayre, e de la vesica; e provocan las mestruas, e comfereysso a bothor e ademil; e stan en loc de fleubotomia de doas sophenas, e alahorcoben, e de doas cavilhas.
However, they weaken the entire body and cause many men to faint.
For cupping, the process is similar to that of applying cups on both legs.
The placement of the cups should be such that you place the cup at the beginning on an empty stomach and draw out [the humor] by early suction, and do not prolong the position of the cups, but rather place them lightly, and remove them gently, allowing the humors to return to their natural state. Do not cease repeating this process until you see the area turn red, swell up, and notice the appearance of blood blisters.
Then you make incisions and repeat the suction little by little, while considering the condition of the body.
For those men who have delicate flesh with few pores, it is enough to make incisions once and not more, as the area should not become ulcerated.
Instruct the cupper to increase the depth of the incisions slightly, but also facilitate the suction accordingly.
And if the blood has thickened, then it is necessary to perform two scarifications (or incisions), because in the first incision, the path of subtle assimilation for the blood and its fluidity is opened. During the second, there will be an examination after drawing out the thickened blood.
And if the blood is very turbid or thick (like feces), then a third scarification should be done so that it flows out.
Finally, when we want to extract the blood slowly or in small amounts, one scarification is sufficient for us.
And if we want to extract a lot of blood, we should make several incisions with deep cuts; but if we know that the blood is thick, then it is necessary to make wide and shallow incisions.
The limit of the depth of an incision is determined by its length alone.
If the vein is thick, hard, dark-colored, and its pores are narrow, then the places for cupping should be anointed with softer, more open, quickly absorbing oils; if it is during summer, then use aloe vera oil or violet oil, or oil made from crushed almonds, or pig fat oil; but if it is winter time, then narcissus oil, lily oil, chamomile oil, blood-derived oil, and similar should be used.
And if the superfluity is thick and greasy, let it be rubbed with amaranth oil, or balm oil, or aloe oil, or aniseed oil, and such like.
However, if the leech-gatherer has wide pores in tender flesh, then it is necessary that they abstain from oil; and for them, before cupping, one must wash the areas to be treated with rosewater or cold sunwater, or goat's water, or borderland water, and similar liquids.
And for the one whose blood is of thin moisture, wash their cups with sour wine or water from myrtle and sumac, and similar substances.
And for the one with thick superfluities, wash their cups with old wine or water from sweet marjoram, or decoction of aniseed, or chamomile, and similar liquids.
It is necessary that cupping be kept away from baths; and it should be administered immediately after the bath for one or two hours at most, and rest must follow the cupping.
What should be considered when regulating venesection before bloodletting.
Consider this at the beginning: if the bloodletter or the one who is to perform the phlebotomy is choleric and has sharp and inflamed blood, then they should take cooling remedies, such as sour millet, acidic endive, lettuce, rocket salad, and similar things.
And eat their food as such pollock, flesh of birds with feathers, and seasoned foods with vinegar, and similar things.
And for the one whose complexion is cold, they should drink almedra syrup or rocket seed syrup with sumac, and a sweet odour that lies between old age and youth; and it is recommended to them to moderate their drinking and eating, eat less of pollock and cannabis foods and pease and small birds and pigeons.
And on the day of venesection and phlebotomy, their drink should be more than food.
And for some men, it is advisable to give them theriaca alfarac or medicated wine with musk, if the latter is muscaded, before venesection or phlebotomy, or soon after, so that their main parts are comforted and blood becomes subtle; they should not take anything scalding.
Mays las ventozas que so ses scarificacio sian ventozas que so pausadas sus le fetge, e sobre la melsa e podagra, e sobre le umbelic, en les locs dels jonolhs, e la pixida del ancha, quar aquestz membres no suffertan scarificacio sobre si.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
And it is placed on the wounds when it happens in their navel or abdomen, for by virtue of strong attraction the man's navel and expels the disease from its place.
Similarly, do this when it is placed on the liver and spleen to relieve flatulence in those sufferers.
And these cups are administered empty with suction only; some are administered with fire.
And some cups are administered full of cold water in diseases of the spleen.
This is why the cup should be filled and made larger; it should only contain cold water or water in which suitable herbs have been boiled.
Way of administering the cup with fire: its diameter should be two fingers wide, according to how we have shaped it; and the quantity of the horn should be half a palm; and on its side, at the location where it is in contact, let there be half of it, the hole being small enough for a needle to pass through.
It should be made of horn or citrus wood, with thick edges, light, smooth and even so as not to hurt the body part where it is placed.
And it is in the middle of his abdomen that a candle with fire is placed over either a wooden or iron bar.
And this bellows is much bigger than the one we have previously cut open; and the small one is lesser in comparison to the diseases and the state of the patient.
And the cupping glasses for children and exhausted people should be different from those used on young adults or robust bodies.
The quality of placing this bellows with fire on the body part is that you extend the iron grate with well-lit wood in front of a small wax candle, and place it over the middle of the transverse bar at the center point of the bellows, so that the fire does not burn the patient's body.
And once it is placed on the patient's body part and your finger is over the hole we mentioned earlier, while having the bellows and not needing to move your finger and letting the vapour come out of that hole, then the bellows will be lifted up a little.
And then you remove the iron grate according to its manner, and replace it if needed.
Mays en ventosa que es aministrada en la malautia de plauressi, am aygua, en la qual no ha vergua transversa ni trauc, e no es aministrada sino que sia umplida de aygua, e es pausada sobre le membre tant solament.
And this is its form: The bigger this bellows-like device is, the better it can be used to receive a large quantity of water.
I presume you are referring to chapter 97 of a book or document. However, without further context, I cannot determine the exact meaning or content of this chapter. If you provide me with additional information or a specific text related to Chapter .xcvii., I can assist you better!
Leeches should not be applied to many body parts but only to those areas where cupping is impossible due to their small size, such as the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, or to a part deprived of flesh like the nose and its similar appendages."
And when it comes to using leeches, find those that are located in clean waters free of any corruption.
Then let them be immersed day and night in clean water until they are completely famished, ensuring there is no remaining food in their stomachs. Next, evacuate the body through venesection (fleubotomia) and cupping (ventozas), then rub the patient's limb(s) until it reddens, finally placing the leeches upon them.
And when they are full (with blood), remove them.
If it is possible to extract more blood from the area with cupping (ventoza), then this will be of further benefit.
Otherwise, wash the area with vinegar, followed by warm water; then rub it (gently) and wring it out.
And if the blood continues to flow from the wound after removal of the leeches, then you place a cloth soaked in cold water over it until the bleeding has ceased.
If the blood flow increases, then apply a powder of pulverized vitriol, or other substances with similar styptic properties to stem the bleeding; alternatively, place cooked bean husks on it and leave them until the beans adhere to the area.
And now, if it is necessary, repeat the bloodletting with leeches, when it is possible to change them.
And if the use of leeches is prohibited due to their suspension, then rub the area with fresh blood or insert a needle into those places until blood flows out; and once they are placed, they will immediately increase (the flow) as soon as they sense some blood.
And when you want them to stop (bleeding), sprinkle a little powdered aloe over them, or salt, or ashes, and it will stop immediately.
This begins the third part of the treatment: restoration. This chapter is very important to see in the art of medicine; it is about restoring fractures and accidental dislocations of bones.
Oh, my child, know that this chapter is disregarded by foolish doctors and common people, as well as those who have never spent time studying the books of the Ancients nor read a single letter from them.
And it is for this reason that the way of the knowledgeable is hidden in our land; and I have never forgotten anything from all those good times studying; and I have not added what I learned, but only through a long reading of the books of the Ancients and my study over their understanding, which allowed me to extract science from them.
And then I devoted myself to experience and study throughout my life.
I have already described in this chapter everything that encompasses my knowledge and all the matters on which I have experimented; since there is an abridgment of these to you others and it frees them from prolixity; I have abbreviated this at the end as an abridgment, and have shown it at the end by a declaration. And I will form in this notes about the forms of the instruments that are applied here, as it was made by addition of a declaration, thus having done so in two preceding chapters.
Chapter One.
Sums and collections about bone fractures, among those things whose introduction is necessary before we begin the recollection of broken limbs and their diverse kinds. Therefore, let us say in the prologue of this chapter some summations of our speech, and also the chapters to which the master craftsmen's attention is drawn at the beginning, as a kind of station on the truth of these matters; it is you and those who are ready that know or learn this noble art from among yourselves.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
Here is the translation of the provided text:
And then return the patient to their previous regimen with what they are accustomed to eating.
And when the broken bone begins to heal, it is necessary for the patient to be fed with nutritious foods that are heavy and rich in nutrients, such as porridge made of dry wheat with water, rice, beans, peas, cow's stomachs, eggs, fresh fish, red wine, and similar items. With this regimen, fracture coagulation occurs more quickly and effectively.
And know that broken bones in men who are either in their first stage of life or old and frail cannot be completely healed and restored to their natural state due to the dryness of their body parts.
However, nature adjusts and provides nourishment to the broken bone by means of a substance similar to glue, which makes it adhere and bind together what was previously separate and fragmented. This is when strength and firmness return at last, just like fire initially, so that nothing prevents it from doing its work.
And for this reason, it is necessary that you provide the patient with food and drink which has gravity, viscosity, and thickness, as we have mentioned before.
And know that the types of fractures are diverse depending on the variety of body parts, for a fracture in the leg bone is different from one in the skull bone; similarly, a fracture in the foot bone differs from that in the spine; and likewise, all other body parts vary from each other.
I want a recollection of every type of fracture, expanded upon in its own distinct chapter.
There is also diversity within each type of fracture itself. The types of fractures are further diversified within themselves; for instance, there is the curved fracture and another one that occurs in stars; some depend on the length of the bone, such as the fracture of the shaft, head, articular and non-articular processes; it's like when a pen is prepared to write but breaks instead, or there are fractures with wounds, disruption in the skull, and small fissures.
And this whole procedure is designed as an appropriate torture during recovery, which will be recalled distinctly in their specific places.
Signs of bone fracture. And it is known as a bone fracture because of the bending of the limb and that bulge becomes apparent to touch; moreover when you compress it with your hand.
And when there is no visible bending in the limb and upon touching the bone with agitation, the patient does not feel great pain, then it is not a fracture.
However, there could be a bending or small fissure present where you shouldn't press too much with your hand and with compression all around; instead apply the appropriate medicine that you will recall at that very moment which suits this place best; and then bind it tightly with subtle pressure.
And know that when the affected area is curved and not split into two or another thing which does not happen often, like when the entire part of its body swells up, then you must start immediately to straighten it before an abscess forms.
And if the patient has an abscess in the groin, then leave it be for a few days until the abscess subsides; then dress it according to your best ability and ingenuity.
Remember that the restoration of the patient's health and their recovery is more important than the severity of the disease.
Then strengthen the patient according to when they will be able to remember what has happened to them.
But if the disease reaches the bone, then it is necessary to extend this broken member in two parts, be it an arm or a leg; use your hand if the member is small; or use two cords or one cord and your hand.
And make sure your position is such that you place the member in its natural shape while the separated parts of the broken member are extended; then you must skillfully and ingeniously join these additions back together.
Watch yourself according to your strength so that you do not cause the patient more pain or injury due to your operation; and make sure, as much as it is in your power, that you place one bone against its companion according to their best shapes.
And now it is necessary for you to touch him with your hand at that very moment, and if you find any other cause, rectify it and adjust it according to the extent of your ability.
Avoid violent extension and compression, just as foolish doctors do who cause abscesses by their treatment or bring about contraction in the limb, which we have seen happen due to their unskilled operations.
The kind of binding I recommend for a broken limb is as follows: understand that fractures vary according to the size, weight, and shape of the different limbs.
And for those who are very small like the arm and forearm and similar to these, it is appropriate that the wrapping be made of very fine cloth.
For those who are overweight and large like the thigh or leg, it is necessary that their wrapping be made of thick and stiff material. The tight binding connects a large and strong member with constriction on all sides so that nothing foul enters them.
Then begin, immediately start your evacuation process by placing appropriate padding suited to the situation over the site of fracture using three wraps or four according to how much you think the member deserves; bind your hand tightly with a small bandage.
And now turn to the most important part of the fracture site and bind less tightly than you did when binding the site so as not to impede blood flow. Then extend the wrapping from the fracture site a little, gradually loosening the binding as you take away an important part of it.
Now take another bandage and wrap it around this other side over the area previously wrapped, then go to the wraps at the bottom of your fracture; let your operation be in binding the wrap and loosening it as we mentioned before with the first wrap above.

E sian las stelhas de la maytat de canna lada raza, e be formada saviament; o sian de fust de pi; o de ramps de palma ; e sia le ample de quascuna stelha segon aquesta forma e aquesta figura:
Here is the translation of the provided text:
And make sure the threads are thicker in bulk and thinner in width, and they must be made of silk; and if you use thick threads, I have seen through my experiences that some fools place their stitches with rope-strings, which is a huge mistake because it will cause tension.
And using thinner threads is not suitable because you will not achieve the desired tightness with them; it should not be less than a finger's width between each stitch.
If the patient complains of pain at the ends of the stitches and you need to tighten them in those places, then place some soft linen cloth or woolen fabric beneath to prevent injury.
Sometimes fractures occur with inflammation, causing a rupture in the bone; I will recall this in more detail when discussing specific cases.
Be aware that not every broken limb can be straightened with traction on the first day; this is because when a limb is large, it should not be subjected to traction until after several days or weeks, depending on your confidence in preventing the formation of pus.
This is the method of using plasters as practiced by ancient physicians; they were applied over fractures, dislocations, and sprains.
Here is my translation of the first source sentence:
Certainly! Here is a line-by-line translation of the provided text:
Here is the translation of the provided text:
Another method for applying an ointment to fractures and sprains: take myrrh and mix it with a white alum, add 10 drachms of each; aloe, 5 drachms; acacia, 6 drachms; Armenian bole, 20 drachms.
Grind all the ingredients together in a mortar until they are finely mixed, sieve them, and then combine with water or egg white to form a paste, which should be applied.
A method for applying an ointment to joints and bones that have moved out of place, as well as for sprains, fractures, and dislocations: take some soft wool, soak it in vinegar and warm oil, and apply it to the affected area.
If this ointment does not provide any restoration or relief from abscesses, then expel the pains properly.
Another method for an ointment that restores a closed passage (i.e., an obstruction): take fresh fig leaves and wild poppy leaves, mix them together, and make an ointment from these.
A condensed method for an ointment to be applied when restoring a fracture and seeking relief from the remainder of an abscess: take roots of marshmallow, chamomile, and violet flowers; add some flour of bran, equal parts of each, grind them together, mix with wine, and apply if the member is not scalded.
But if it is scratched, then apply to it moist coriander water or warm water and oil.
Another way to make a poultice that is more effective for resolving hardened abscesses when they occur: take roots of marshmallow and flax seeds, and also balsam fir, mallow, melilot, marjoram, violet flowers, chamomile, all of them equal parts; grind these together and moisten with willow water or warm water or wine, according to the quality of the affected body part and its color.
But Hippocrates did not say in his book that wax and oil cerate should be applied to the affected body part during its restoration process, but only if necessary; he also recommends it be neither too thick nor too thin.
But in Gaul [France], it is seen that they apply [poultices] to the broken body part during its restoration process and the substances for which are drying but with little heat are thus similar to myrrh, incense, and those already mentioned.
A poultice that treats the wound and eases pain: take ground, equal parts of chickpeas, human hair cuttings or bird feathers, marshmallow root, and salt; grind these together and mix them into a paste, then make it into a poultice.
Mays la quantitat segon la qual cove que romangua la liadura e aprop sia disliada, es que consideres si no es accidit dolor ni pruziment ni le os es trencat no es maugut de son loc, lahoras tu no deslies de motz jorns. If a painful wound or severe inflammation occurs at this location, treat and untie it immediately, removing the plaster from it.
Take a cloth and a moist marine sponge, dip them into lukewarm water, and use them to wash the area until the swelling subsides and the pain is relieved. Then let the body part rest for an hour; afterward, place over it soft wool submerged in vinegar or rose oil, bind it with a bandage for one night so that you can ensure suppuration occurs safely and there is no resurgence of inflammation in the affected limb, nor any recurrence of its original pain.
Repeat this gentle compression and small plaster without tightening it beyond the initial restriction; apply this treatment subtly until the wound heals completely.
If you find that the pus, scabs, pain, swelling, and all other symptoms have fully subsided, and there is no longer a need for bandages or restriction, then repeat the same treatment as was done initially.
If no other cause of the symptoms mentioned above occurs in this limb, then do not remove the bandage for three to four or five to seven days; sometimes all of this can be left for up to twenty days depending on how quickly you see the limb heal when you loosen its binding, as we said before, until the fracture fuses and the flesh hardens over it.
And then fasten it in the largest opening you made earlier, and adjust according to the swelling of the patient's body, as previously instructed.
If you notice that the fracture site has dried out and become weaker than it was initially, understand that nourishment cannot reach that part of the body; therefore, you must apply tepid water to it whenever you treat him; do this for three consecutive days; loosen the binding slightly, through which operation nutrition will return to the limb, and he shall be healed lightly.
What those foolish restorers of the limb's fracture do once again when it is not healed at first as expected, and is healed according to its tortuosity, is an error on their part in this operation, and a great cause for fear; had this been rightly done by the Ancients in their books, they would have achieved something through it.
And I have not seen anyone among them do this, which is all the more reason why it should not be done.
Chapter two: On fractures of the head.
There are many types of fractures, and their forms are varied, with distinct causes as well: some fractures occur due to the impact of space, which drives all of the bone into the brain, just like when an arrow pierces wood, and for this reason, this type is called 'ascial'; or else space may cut through a part of the bone, along with its flesh, but does not pass beyond that; this latter form of fracture is called 'levatio absoluta'.
Certainly! Here is the translation of your provided text:
Here is my translation of the provided text:
E de fractura es que es ameguada en le os, en la subtilitat del cabel petita, e per aquo es nompnada aquesta specia fractura capillar.
Here is the translation of the provided text:
And this is mainly done in the bodies of damp bones, as in the heads of infants.
And for all these kinds of leg fractures, they should be fixed with splints like separated slats. And I will return to the explanation of all this in its proper place.
And I know all these types of fractures by touch and by questioning them about it, as well as through the examination of their corrupted flesh.
The type of fracture involving the scalp is known for being uncovered over the bone and being cleaned; it is bandaged with thread, as the fracture appears black.
When considering the treatment of fractures at the beginning, you should look into the circumstances of the patient's injury and their symptoms; if you observe that they suffer from things like vomiting bile, fainting spells, loss of reason, loss of voice, collapse, acute fever, discharge or swelling in body parts, stiffness of limbs, and similar severe conditions to these when injured, then do not attempt treatment.
If you find that the symptoms are not severe, then you may expect recovery and begin their treatment.
Here is the translation of the first sentence:
Here is the translation of the provided text:
Under the circumstances that the fracture has reached the brain, and it is divided into small pieces and bruised, you must insert the fractured part as I will tell you.
When you shave the patient's head and uncover the bone according to custom and manner as is possible given the shape of their disease, ensure that it is light on them.
If you find that there is bone exposure, raw flesh or pus present then refrain from what typically ought to be done and instead apply a dressing of cloth infused with wine and rose oil and let the patient rest until the abscess has calmed down and make sure the bleeding stops; Then begin by circumcising the bone and removing it.
This is according to one of two ways of operating.
One way is to insert the bone with a narrow chisel like this and then administer another one slightly wider than that and of this shape.
Then use the wider chisel more than the previous one.
Here is the translation of the provided source sentence:
And use their assistance in percussion over the scrotum so as not to bruise his head and injure him.
And if the bone is strong and hard, then you must pierce it in its circumference before administering the incisions with the trephines, which are called non-penetrating trephines.
And they are not called thus but rather non-penetrating because these do not reach the end of the bone to which it is adjacent, for the trephine has a round edge or margin on that which is below the skull similar to a small margin or circle, which prevents being submerged and passing through the thickness of the bone.
And it is convenient that you take a large number of these trephines, each suitable for the thickness of each bone, as far as it is present in all parts of the skull whose end is sharp, and the quantity regarding its length and shortness should be according to the degree of hardness of this skull.
And this is the form of three types of trephines: The quality of piercing the circumference of the broken bone is that you place the trephine on the bone and turn it with handles called *ditz*, as long as you know that the bone has already been penetrated; then change the trephine to another location, and place what is between all through the quantity of the thickness of a ray or thereabouts.
Here is my line-by-line translation of the provided text:
And make sure with all caution that the scissors do not touch any part of the intestines.
Once you have encircled the perforating bone and separated it from the intestines if they are attached to it, and extracted that part, you should then file and smooth it on its rough surface with another tool similar to scissors, but make sure it is thicker and more delicate than other scissors.
And if any parts of the small bones and tendons remain, take them out easily with whatever tools you have at your disposal; then treat the wound with the ointments and unguents we have mentioned.
Another surgical method is less invasive and far from causing fear, which was praised by Gallia, and I will also commend it. This is what he said about it: in the beginning, you must start by uncovering the bone part of the area where the fracture is most violent and most visible; once you have uncovered this part and placed one end of a slow and gentle tool on it, whose shape is as follows:" (followed by an illustration)
The tool's shape is similar to that of a lens: it is broad on one end and has two sharp edges running along its length, sometimes in this way (referring to the illustration); the lens-shaped part should be placed against the intestines with its cutting edge towards the bone.

Here is the translated text:
For any of the other minor fractures or subtle breaks, it is necessary to administer treatment based on what has been lost in order to rectify it.
And this is something that needs improvement, especially for those who have studied the subject thoroughly. And this is what we have demonstrated previously regarding major fractures.
If the flesh is torn when you extract the bone, then you must take a cloth according to the amount of injury, and dip it in rose oil, and place it over the wound; then take another folded or tripled cloth, dipped in wine and rose oil, and place it over the first cloth with as little pressure as possible on the affected area; subsequently apply soft bandages, but do not tighten them except to match the quantity of injury.
Leave the wound to heal for a day or two until you are certain that an abscess has not formed; then untie it and apply medicines that promote dryness, such as linen rags and flour of ergot, powder of ants and of aristolochia, and similar remedies.
And it is necessary for you to prepare these powdered medications and apply them onto the wound when dry; in general, administer all medicines of a nature that cleanses and does not bite.
Ensure that you maintain your integrity and ensure the wound is clean in your treatment process; avoid applying any grease or ointment onto it, nor allow any contamination to occur; for when this [grease] is spread over the brain's membrane, it corrupts it and spreads its corruption, bringing about malignant illness upon the patient.
And if there is a fracture on the skull where bone has been modified and treatment of it is delayed, especially when its surface turns black; hence, should you visit the patient with these symptoms we have mentioned, know that they are extremely dangerous.
If there is no blackening, but rather from the medicine applied above it, and if this blackness is due to said medicine's nature, you should then prepare a mixture of beeswax, olive oil and roses in equal parts; use these ingredients to line a cloth, and place that onto the fracture. Subsequently treat any further symptoms as required until cured.

On the restoration of the nose when it is broken."
Here is the translation of the provided text:
Here is the translation of the provided text: And let this be done by you with ease, and take care that your operation on the patient does not cause pain.
If the fracture is in the upper part of the nose and it does not perforate to the brain, then it should be aligned with the extremity of the wing where there is a small thickness.
And if the fracture has occurred in two places, then you should do this: follow a similar procedure.
Endeavour to restore the patient on the first day of the fracture if it is feasible; otherwise, in seven or fourteen days you must wait for the swelling to subside.
Then insert into the extremity of the nose a piece of linen cloth if the fracture is in one place, or use two combs if it is in two places, and let there be on each comb as much thickness as will fill the hole in the nose.
Some ancient restorers advise that the combs should be dipped in oil and changed every day, but I have not found this to be effective. It is better if the cloth is soaked in white of egg mixed with powdered lime; then leave the comb in place until the bone is set and the cartilage hardened.
Here is the translation of the provided text:
This reason is not necessary for you, and if you wish, do this, and if you wish, do something else.
And if another abscess occurs, treat it by applying a plaster to the nose made of wax, or with cotton soaked in vinegar and rose oil, or use *diaquilon*.
However, if there is no abscess present, then cover the area with a plaster made of sesame flour and powder from burnt bones mixed with egg white; place it over the affected spot and do not touch your nose for any reason.
However, if the nose bones are fractured or crushed, it is necessary to cut open the affected area and remove the bone fragments with appropriate instruments; then stitch the wound, treat it with a substance that promotes flesh growth and strengthens the bone, and cover it with plasters suitable for this purpose.
And if there is an ulcer inside the nose, it must be treated with various applications and by inserting lead tubes until complete healing.
It appears that this text is divided into different chapters or sections, indicated by the use of "Capitol". In this case, you have provided me with the chapter number ".iiii." (Chapter 4). Please provide the corresponding text for this chapter so I can translate it for you!
De restauracio de la mandibula quan es trincada."
When the jaw is broken and there's no visible damage on it, check if the fracture is only on the outside surface, not in two pieces or curved at the inner edges; then its diagnosis is mild.
And now, if the fracture is on the right side, you should insert your left index finger into the patient's mouth; similarly, if it's on the left jaw, use your right index finger; then push with that finger against the bump of the fracture inside and ease out the outer edges using your other hand from outside the bone, moving it decently towards that one.
If the jaw fracture is already separated into two pieces, then you need to apply an extension of both parts according to their original straightness as much as possible for them to align properly.
And if there's tooth dislocation along with the jaw fracture, then bind those that will stay connected by a gold or silver wire, or cedar twine; then place on the broken jaw some wax, and on top of it a folded cloth, and on this one a large star-shaped piece of linen as long as the jaw; then tie it all together according to how you've arranged their position so they don't move.
Under these conditions command the patient with rest and tranquility, and give him a low-salt diet, which must be accompanied by cold baths.
If you notice that the figure is already altered in some way, then wait and untie him on the third day; afterwards correct what has been changed from him, with ointment of mallow powder, egg albumin or oat flour, since you will have removed his cerot, and place over the plaster sheep wool.
And so when this plaster is attached and adjusted to him, and the bone's position is not altered, let it be, do not remove it until he is healed and the fracture has consolidated; because in many occasions this fracture consolidates within three weeks.
And if another wound becomes infected, then administer what we have mentioned previously for its healing many times a day until it is cured and the abscess has drained.
And if the fracture is infected with pus, then consider whether it is a part of the bone that has separated or is the periosteum; afterwards you must be subtle and remove those periostea with what suits this operation among these tools.
If the wound's openings are narrow, then you should widen them with a lancet according to your required extent.
Then, once you have followed these strategies and nothing has improved, sew up the wound if it is wide; otherwise, apply a plaster suitable for this purpose and let the flesh grow over it until it heals.

On restoring the collarbone when it is fractured."
Motas veguadas es trencada la furcula de la partida denant deves le muscle, e aquella fractura es fayta en una de tres manieyras.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
Here is my translation of the provided text:
And then use your fingers to grasp the fracture and adjust it so that its form fits properly, without leaving much prominence or cavity.
And if you require more extension, then place a pad of cloth or wool under the patient's chin, and let its size be according to your need; extend and lift the fork (referring to a medical instrument), and with your hand, shorten the pad so that you can properly align the fracture.
If you are unable to draw the outer ends of the fork towards each other due to its position on the bone, then turn the patient onto their neck (or possibly their back), and place a moderate-sized cushion under their muscle.
The assistant presses the patient's muscle downwards on either side of the bone, lifting up the fork on its inner ends towards the wound, and then you can correct the fracture and align it with your fingers.
However, if you feel any splinters on the fork (i.e., the bone) and they are loose, then it is necessary to cut into them and remove those splinters carefully.
And if the splinters are retained within the bone, then you must devise an incision of it using one of your incising instruments prepared for this purpose. You have placed under the fork the instrument that serves as a lever; this is made of wood or iron and has such a form:" (likely referring to a diagram)
And it resembles the groin area, which is like a hollow for this purpose; and let its width be according to what you need of him, depending on his size or thinness.
Let its length be as convenient for you during the operation; it should have two ends with one end being wide and the other narrow.
And if the incision of the wound that you made when extracting the splinter from the bone is wide, and there is a risk of abscess formation, then you should join the two lips of the wound with stitches.
If the incision is small or you are concerned about abscess formation, then fill the wound with cloths and powders according to the size of the gap in the wound.
If an abscess occurs, dip a cloth in vinegar and rose oil mixed with wine, then place it on the affected area.
And make sure the star-shaped wound is not covering the broken bone; thus, you must see the patient every day so that when the ligature has softened or you see the star being remolded again, then you correct it and tighten the binding.
Then make the patient sleep on their neck, and place underneath them at night a small cushion under their right side so that it raises the helper of theirs from that side, and thus elevates the fracture in the shoulder to elevate the muscle; or bind their arm to their neck.
And do not remove the binding unless there is an accident in that place or an abscess forms within 12 days.
Then renew the plaster if you have seen the face of the patient swell to that, and tighten it in a firm way and restore that, and let be until it is restored and the shoulder fracture has healed.
And it is tightened and strengthened according to the month in 28 days; for some men, this may take less time.
This indicates that this is chapter six of an overall text or document. It often precedes the title or content of said chapter. Is there another line I can translate for you?
When it comes to restoring a broken shoulder,"
Spatula tart is broken in its place beneath it, and not torn away from it but only its edges.
And so when the place of it is broken - and it is broken in its middle part - and it is only known through touch, then according to what you see as the fracture's shape force yourself to prepare it and reduce that based on its natural figure in all ways which are available to you.
Then place over the area powder of moly with egg white and wax, then place a cloth pad on top, then gently place upon it a star-shaped tablet according to the quantity of the whole spatula or slightly more.
But if the star has a cavity in any of the places of the spatula, then fill that cavity with wax, and adjust the star according to equality.
Then strengthen it from above with a long rod with decent compression and the firmness of the star so that it is not pushed out of its place.
And consider the binding on each day; and every time it becomes loosened, bind again and tighten it and adjust the star if it is pushed out of its place.
And place the patient on his side.
The spatula is healed in twenty days or five weeks."
And so, when this number is completed, you then dissolve the binding, and ensure that you know which bones have a safe beginning and their dissolution.
And if you are operating on the place of the hip bone and placing a chain there, then you make an incision over it, open it up, and proceed as we have mentioned for the fracture of the shoulder blade, being cautious about any abscess that may occur.
I am unable to determine what you mean by "Capitol .vii.". Could you please provide me with more context or information?
On the restoration of fractures of the foot.
Sometimes the foot is fractured in its middle part and this usually happens to both ends, but also many times just one end of it is broken or crushed.
And among the complications when the middle of the foot is fractured are that it often affects nearby parts and causes great pain to them, difficulty in walking, coughing, and strong vomiting of blood; this complication is evident as there is a cavity inside the broken bone and it is not hidden from feeling.
And for the restoration of the foot, have the patient be laid on their back and place a cushion under their shoulders; then press their muscles and adjust their sides with both hands, performing the operation delicately and in every way that is possible and convenient to them until you restore the bone's figure as it was.

Sapias que fractura de las costas no catz sino en locs grosses que siegon le dos; e de las extremitatz de lor de la partida denant no accideys ad aquellas contricio sino per aquo quar so cartillaginosas. And his cognition is not obscured by feelings; you must inquire about it with these words.
Let the restoration be such that it aligns the fracture with these words according to the possible maneuver; while being careful as required, then plaster and strengthen the broken bone with a splint if necessary.
And if the fracture of the ribs is shifting towards the inner organs, it causes great pain and piercing to the patient, just as happens to someone who has pleurisy, and due to this, when the bone moves, it covers them with a cloth; and they experience difficulty in handling objects, coughing, and vomiting large amounts of blood; and such an injury is difficult to cure.
The ancient masters have already created many ingenious mechanisms for this purpose.
And they say that you should avoid giving the patient food that causes inflammation and flatulence, so as not to inflate their stomach and cause the fracture to be pushed outwards.
It would have been better to avoid this situation because it should not be a light cause of an open abscess, but if it happens, then it helps with that.
E diyssero alcus de lor que sia pausada desus ventoza e aprop que sucque am fortitut; e es semblant a ratiocinacio, mays empero es temut que la ventoza atire las superfluitatz al loc per la debilitat.

On the restoration of fractures in the spinal column and neck.
Some injuries in the neck involve fractures of the vertebrae there, which is similar to the condition of the bones of the spinal column. And when this happens to someone and you want to know if they will recover or not, consider that if their hands are already soft, dull, and lifeless, unable to move nor extend the fingers, and when you press them with your finger or prick them with a needle without causing any pain, then you'll know it's not healed. In such cases, it is fatal.
And if he feels pain and a restriction in the said points and areas when they are pricked, then you may know that the neck of the bone is safe and the patient will recover with treatment.
And if you see the vertebrae of his neck in such a state and want to know whether he will be cured or not, then consider his feet.
Then if you see that they have softened already, apply to him those things which are applied to the hands, and when he lies on his back, give him an emetic (a substance to induce vomiting) and an enema of his own will, and sometimes turn him over onto his back and make him want to urinate but cannot, then you may know that it is fatal, and so do not work on his cure.
But if you apply nothing to the said areas, then the cause is better and lighter.
And the cure for him is that you pierce into the center of the abscess which you place over the compressed vertebrae with oil rose or very fresh eggs; place on it some times during the day until the abscess is drained.
Then place one of the comforting and exciting cataplasms on it, and bind it with linen cloth; and command the patient to rest and be tranquil, and not sleep upon that part until he is cured.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
Mays si es trencat le derier del os alhoses, e es la fi de la coeta: But if the back part of the thigh bone is broken and it is at the end of the shaft, then you must put your left hand into his anus and mould the broken parts together with your other hand as far as possible by approximate alignment; then put on him a poultice and splint, if you have those things, and bind up that part.
And if you see shattered shinbones in the patient, then cover them with a cloth and compress that part until the wound is healed.
Chapter 10:
On the Restoration of the Shoulder Blade:
The bones of the shoulder blades are rarely broken and if they do break, the fracture occurs only in their ends where it is a comminuted fracture which follows their length and slopes inward; this happens to the patient with pain in the region and punctures, his arm becomes paralyzed when there is a fracture.
And the restoration of it is for you to place your hand upon him over that fracture in such a manner as to represent its figure.
Here is my best guess at the translation of your provided text:
But if the fracture is in the long bone or one that inclines toward its joints, then have the patient lie on their stomach while you prepare for the restoration of that fracture. And once you have aligned it, place a plaster cast over it, then place a wooden splint or metal rod over the cast, and bind it tightly with bandages so that there is no fear of further puncturing the fracture or dislodging the rod.
Realign the cavity with a substance that fills it while maintaining its shape under the tightness of the binding, and instruct the patient to sleep on their back or side.
But if there is an occurrence of pus, cease the extension and restoration until the pus has been drained, then place on it what is needed to draw out the rest; afterwards, return to restoring it, binding it as tightly as necessary.
And if the bones have been shattered or splintered, you must treat them.

De restauracio de la fractura del adjutori.
Adjutori is what lies between the elbow and the head of the shoulder.
And if it is broken, its restoration can be done in one of two ways. One way is to take a wooden splint of medium thickness and shape it like this:
If its two ends are tied together and then it is suspended from an elevated place.
And place the patient on a chair, then bend their broken arm over a stick so that it reaches up to their wrist in the middle of which is attached the curve of the stick.
Then suspend something heavy over that, or let the attendant stretch it out at both ends; and have the doctor place his hands on either side of the fracture so that it returns to its proper position.
The other method is to have the patient lay on their back with their neck supported, and suspend their hand at the nape of their neck with a ligature. Then instruct two attendants such that one has something placed over the fracture with his hands; while the other supports them from below; each stretching it out at both ends.
And if you want the extension to be stronger, then you bind over the fracture with one ligature and another over that with another ligature, and each of the two ministers extends towards their respective side.
And if the fracture is close to the end of the muscle, then it should be placed half of the ligature over the elbow and the other below the fracture near the elbow.
Similarly, if the fracture is close to the elbow, then it should be placed the ligature over that area and also on the elbow itself.
Secure that with ease and simplicity, and once it is secured according to what is required and applied properly, then bind it tightly without causing a blood blister.
However, if a blood blister occurs, then leave the binding for seven days and place on it a poultice of soaked wool in vinegar and rose oil until the blister subsides, and then you can bind it again.
The method of binding is to place a plaster over the fracture, and then cover it with a wrapping of new cloth; adjust the arm over the support, and leave their hand exposed on top of the plaster.
And place the cloth and bandage over the arm support so that the arm is in a fixed position, unless there is any reason to prevent this due to a broken bone.
And then use crutches.
And place the crutch directly over the fracture point, making sure it is stronger and thicker than the other crutches; leave a finger's width between each crutch, and make the overall length of the crutches equal to the broken bone plus three fingers' worth.
Then secure the crutches with the bandage I mentioned at the beginning of this chapter.
Make sure your bandage is tightest over the area of the fracture itself. And the longer the bone has been broken, the looser your bandage should be.
And so if you check the positioning of the crutches and bandage as we have described, then you will ensure the limb returns to its proper place.
And if you fear an abscess may develop, then leave the bandage and crutches in place for seven days as we have instructed.
Here is the translation of the provided text:
But if you are confident that there will be no complications, then do not remove the bandage for at least three days or more.
Let the patient's sleeping position be on their back, with their arms placed across their stomach.
Place a clean woolen pad as support, and ensure at all times during the night or day that the shape of the broken limb is not loosened nor disturbed, thus rectify this with your skill.
Provide the patient with food according to the order mentioned earlier, such that their diet is light in the beginning while they are still weak; then gradually make their food more substantial.
It is customary for the helper and the patient's servant to be strict during the first 40 days; thereafter, they should be loosened, and the patient should be given a bath and treated with ointments that heal the affected area.
And if the fracture is simple (not compound), then do not remove the bandage and splints before 30 days or two months.
Capitol .xii.: Chapter 12.
De restauracio de fractura del bras.
Bras is composed of two bones which are called the two phalanges; of which one is small and it is the one that lies below the finger, and the other is large and it rests under the smaller finger, from a joint further down.
And it is rare that only the larger phalanx is broken, or the smaller one, but often they are both fractured together.
And when the smaller phalanx is broken on top, then its restoration is light and healing of it is easier.
And when the phalanx is broken below, then its fracture is bad and healing of it is difficult.
And worse than that is when both bones are broken together.
So if the bone that is broken is the smaller phalanx on top, then it is advisable for the doctor to do its restoration with little extension and facilitate that it be bandaged easily.
However, if the larger phalanx is what is fractured, then it requires more forceful extension.
And if both phalanges are fractured together, then you must apply the most forceful extension.
And now you should place the figure of the hand to restore and extend it over a cushion, with the wrist of the hand at the upper edge, so that everything else said before is higher than this, and the little finger is lower than the other fingers mentioned, and the patient lies on his side supported by a pillow.
And place another cushion in front of them at their level or height, so that the patient does not exert themselves.
Then have the minister extend their arm from below with their hand or gently, and another minister extends similarly above.
Then the physician should manipulate the bone until it reduces to its best possible shape.
And if the bone has suffered damage during its dislocation, you must use your skill to carefully return it to its place.
If you notice that the separated wound is not healing and there is little hope for their recovery, then proceed to close it according to the method mentioned above.
However, if the fracture is open with a wound, I have already dealt with this specific case previously, so take care of it accordingly.
Here is the translation of the provided text:
And know that the types of arm fractures are most commonly either a break at one point or two points together.
Then apply your bandage firmly and strongly over the fracture site, placing the pressure either above or below the broken bone; make sure that you bind a little more loosely depending on how far into this chapter you are.
The bandages used to wrap around the fracture should be soft and moist, not hard or rough, and in terms of thickness, they ought to fall somewhere between fine and coarse; we have already explained this.
Keep an eye on the affected limb and ensure that it is bound tightly for several days after the fracture has been set. If there is any reason to suspect that the limb needs realigning, and should this indeed be the case, you must submerge it in a bath of warm water until said problem resolves itself.
Leave the limb unbound so that it rests, then apply fresh bandages again.
If the bandage has loosened and the bone is now knitting back together in alignment with itself, you should tighten it up again.
Here is the translated text:
But if the patient has not shown any of the causes we have mentioned, then it is not necessary to release them within about twenty days or thereabouts.
Then suspend the patient's arm by its active movement power, and make them sleep on their back.
And know that this fracture is healed in thirty days or in thirty-two days, but sometimes it is healed sooner in twenty-eight days, and all of this depends on the patient's constitution and the disposition of their powers.
It seems that ".xiii." may be referring to a chapter number or some form of section identifier in this context.
De restauracio de fractura de la pinche de la ma e dels ditz.
Sure! Here is my best guess for your translation request:
And when there is a fracture or break in the hand, it is necessary that the patient be placed lying down and supported with cushions according to his comfort, then place their hand on an extended surface.
Then, the minister extends or stretches out the broken bones, and the doctor aligns them with good alignment.
And then it is necessary to apply a plaster and padding, unless there is an abscess which must be lanced carefully; then place the splint according to the size of the area, and you have already wrapped it in linen cloth.
However, if the tear is located within the palm of the hand, then make a ring-like pad out of cloth, and ask the patient to grasp it with their injured palm; then it should be secured with a long strip of cloth.
And use a leather splint with cloth on it which is light in weight, so that the leather can be applied to the palm of the hand; secure it as required.
But if the fracture is on the outer part of the hand, then it is necessary to place a splint above and another below in the palm, so that the hand is open and straight; then apply the bandage, as when you wrap a spindle with thread.

De restauracio de fractura del os de la coyssa translates to "The restoration of a fractured hip bone.
The bones of the hip, which are commonly called 'mottled' and were considered fragile due to their delicate nature have been fractured and are classified as 'broken.'
And to restore it [the fractured bone], the procedure is as follows: a strong ligature or binding is applied over the fracture and another one underneath it, and the patient lies prone on their belly with their face down.
Then the minister or practitioner extends the ligature to its full length on one side [of the body], according to the patient's comfort level, when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
However, if the fracture is near the hip joint or socket, then the ligature should be tied below [the injury], towards the lower part of the buttocks on one side, ensuring that it doesn't extend too far and cause discomfort to the patient.
Similarly, if the fracture is closer to the bottom or lower end of the bone, then tie the ligature towards the upper part and make sure its extension goes downwards.
Then the physician or doctor aligns and reunites the two halves of the broken bone with his hands before reducing it to its natural shape and form, ensuring a proper union. Afterward, apply a plaster cast and provide support, otherwise, there may be complications like infection or amputation. Mays si accideys en lu apostema, lahoras tu layssa aquel per alcus dias entro que l’apostema caut sia cedat, e aprop retorna a la tua curacio.

Here is the translation of the provided text:
And then place a bandage over the hip in the area of that broken bone, and put a splint on top of the leg bone.
Then fill the voids between the leg and hip with soft cloths to promote clotting of the structure.
Start with a strong binding of the cloth around the fracture site with three or four wraps, and as you move away from the fracture location, make your bindings less tight and more gentle.
And then extend both ends of the splint to where they meet at the ankle of the foot; secure both ends together on the other side, ensuring that the binding does not loosen from its place.
Loosen the binding around him such that no injury occurs to his limbs, nor does any sore, festering wound or inflammation appear; and if any of these things do occur, then immediately unbind him, and rectify what has happened wrong according to what we have said before.
But if there is bone protruding from the wound, then you should set it as best you can; otherwise, close up the wound and let it heal, and treat it according to what has been said before until it is healed.
And sometimes this fracture of the hip is strengthened by what we call 'adjustment to stars', as we have said in the treatise about the arm.
But after restoring the patient in this way, it does not happen that they limp; and if only one part is restored without applying the other leg, then it is necessary for them to always limp on that side.
Know that the hip is strengthened within forty days or a little more or less; and this duration may vary depending on the diversity of constitutions and other individual dispositions.
Chapter 15.
On the restoration of the fractured knee joint.
Know that a fracture of the knee joint usually results in atrophy over time.
If this atrophy occurs due to fracture, it is only a fissure or tear in its parts; and this is what we call 'plague' or the plague has passed over them.
The restoration process involves mending the torn parts of the joint by bringing them together and joining them as closely as possible with appropriate adjustment, ease, and craftsmanship.
And then apply a plaster and place it over that round object if you have one available; tighten this with an appropriate binding.
Then take into account all the treatment methods we have recommended for other fractures; they are similar to those applied in such cases and should be used accordingly while considering any specific circumstances that may arise during healing.
Chapter 16.
On the restoration of a broken leg.
Be aware that in the leg there are two bones: one is thick and is named after the leg itself, while the other is slender and is called the fibula.
This type of fracture can occur in both bones of the leg and requires restoration similar to that of an arm; the procedure is essentially the same.
If both bones are broken together, the leg becomes completely disabled.
If the thinner bone is fractured, the front part of the leg becomes disabled.
E si es trincat le os pus gros, atrobas aquel dejos, e es de aquellas causas que no so a tu ameguadas.
And now administer extension, equalization, and bandaging of the splints according to that measure.
However, be aware that if the fracture of the leg is transverse and has many splinters, the extension should be less intense and gentler, and you should apply your strength with caution.
And if there is any reason for an operation on the arm, and it requires you to measure splints and complete all necessary procedures, then take pieces of pinewood that are placed under the calves and are supported by posts at each end; make them from palm branches. Join those that have a small thickness and not too large in diameter, and let their length be according to the length of the leg and as wide as possible below.
Then wrap each splint with two layers of cloth according to its length, placing one on the lower part of the leg from one side and another from the other, and let them reach as far down as possible towards the feet.
And now tie the two splints in three places at both ends and at their middle section, as with this binding, the leg is prohibited from bending to either side, and it will stay stable.
And a wooden board has been administered, according to the length of the leg; it is placed under their leg to restrict any movement.
Most importantly, ensure you do this in case of a fracture; it is then called 'plastering' appropriately.
Then observe the leg each day and examine it from behind to study it; keep an eye out for abscesses, inflammation, or similar complications; and if any of these occur, immediately apply whatever treatment is necessary until healing occurs.
It appears that you are referring to the seventeenth chapter in this medieval medical treatise. Is there anything specific within this chapter that you would like me to translate or explain further? I can provide additional context if needed.
Regarding the fracture of the talus bone and other bones in the foot.
Al talo no accideys fractura de tot; mays als osses del pe accideys fractura alcunas veguadas; e als ditz del pe pauc accideys fractura, e no accideys a lor sino atricio en las mes de disposicio.
And if the bones of the foot suffer a fracture and these bones become elevated above one another, then let the patient place their foot on the ground prepared in this way while they walk.
Then place one foot on what is elevated above those bones, then press them down and manipulate them until they return to their places.
Then place plaster and a bandage on top, and underneath the belly of the foot, put a small board with two flat ends.
Strengthen that with the foot in a straight position, as you have wrapped it with bandages and other things that are required.
And when three or four days have passed, you can untie the bandages, for you will find that the bones are manipulated, either set in place, joined together, or back in their original position, and the operation on them is thus complete.
But if some say their bones are dislocated, then restore those and manipulate them as I have told you in the procedure for restoring the bones of the hand. Then place the dislocated finger on a splint according to its length, and let it rest slightly on the side of that finger. Then put this board underneath the foot as I have told you before, and secure it with a bandage in a straight position.
Mays si aquo que es trincat dels osses so dos o tres o mays, lahoras tu pausa sobre quascun dit astela de la sua quantitat envolopada en drap leon, e strenh la taula en le pus bas del pe, e sia stant sobre la un dels caps de la taula foro le ventre del pe per que la tengua am bona retencio.
And it is important for you to remember not to overlook any of the causes that I have explained to you regarding other fractures and accidents we have discussed, and apply this knowledge appropriately to each case.
It seems like you may be referring to the text from your previous prompt as Chapter 18. Please clarify if there is any specific information or translation related to this chapter that you would like me to provide, and I'll assist you further.
Regarding fractures of the woman's vagina, the boy's penis bone, and the man's penis.
When the woman's womb is trapped, perform a caesarean section in the selected area and then slightly tilt her toward the back part of herself while holding her from behind.
Then the midwife should fill the womb with cud, and it is done in her womb as we expect; then the woman is shaken, lifting her back little by little, for all this is forgotten before being in front of the area of the womb as expected and the trapped bone returns.
Then place powders on her back, and when she wants to urinate, stimulate the cud with ease and let her urinate; return it and bring that back in the way it was at first, then put your powder back.
And do so for seven days or around that time, as it is restored.
And if you want, take a sheep's bladder and put it on her wound with a piece of cane; insert the entire bladder into her womb, then blow air through the tube with force until the bladder is inflated inside the womb since the fracture returns.
Then it should be filled with cud and remain there for some days as we have counted until she is healed.
When a man or woman's pubic bone is broken, we administer the same treatment and procedure as we mentioned for a hip bone fracture.
This, which is the straightforward and not hidden truth about these types of fractures that rarely occur, especially to someone who has some knowledge and experience in understanding my book; because this fracture signifies to you one of the most important considerations in terms of treatment and healing process, so understand it well.
For a man's penis fracture, take a goose bladder and place the penis inside it; then wrap it with cloth bandages, covering it entirely, and leave it wrapped for about three days or so, after which it will be healed.
Chapter 19.
When restoring fractures of bones in cases of festering wounds.
It is necessary for the one who has suffered a fracture with an infection, especially if the bone is large like the thighbone or arm bone, or similar, that you treat them and perform phlebotomy immediately if the conditions for bloodletting allow it, as we have mentioned before.
And if the infection exudes blood, then you must treat it with retention so that you can powder it with dried spiderwort root, unless another cause is present.
Then begin to restore the fracture on that same day, do not delay it, unless an abscess occurs.
But if an abscess appears, then you should delay the restoration of the fracture for up to six days until the abscess subsides, and do not approach it on the third or fourth day at all, because you will cause bad accidents.
But if the broken bone is protruding through the skin, you must pierce it to reduce and align it with your hands gently and with minimal extension.
Here is my translation of the first sentence:
And it should be round, and have just a little thickness so that it doesn't bend; you must apply pressure on this during the operation.
And it should have a pointed end with edges at its tips; the upper part of it is thicker and tends to be tapered from the middle towards both ends.
This is the shape of it:
And its name in Greek is "labre volentz atelarem", which translates to "small shovel".
The pointed end should be placed with its tip raised above the highest point of the bone.
Push it into the gap before the bone returns, and align it with some force.
Then try to align the ends of the fracture between them, and if the broken end is too thin, and it doesn't take the instrument well, you must push that bone end inwards so that the instrument can reach it.
But if you cannot reduce the bone completely using what we have described, then cut it with one of the knives/scalpels that we mentioned or saw through it with a saw in any way that is feasible for you.
And now remove what remains in the bone of roughness and small scratches.
And when the bone is reduced, and then the reduction causes the patient to feel severe pain again, you should know that the bone has not returned to its natural place; therefore, do this as it will greatly benefit the patient.
Once you have completed the restoration of the bone, immerse a cloth in black styptic wine and apply it; especially if it is summer, do not place any cerate or other oily substance on the wound, as this will cause decay and corruption.
Then give the patient a star-shaped herb at the end of your bone restoration procedure, and leave the wound uncovered so that you can cut away the dead flesh with scissors and use suitable dressings depending on the amount of discharge.
Be very cautious not to stretch the wound with the fracture, as inexperienced doctors have done this and caused their patients death or severe illness; only health is restored. And if your constriction is light, soft, different from other fractures.
Here is the translation of your provided text:
E cum aprop un dia o dos vezes ja la plagua comensar, que en lu sia engendrat brac, lahoras tu osta desus le drap le qual havias pausat sobre aquel am vi, e aprop aministra calguas, enguentz am les quals de nostra constuma es que mediquem las plaguas, ayssi cum enguentz tetrafarmacon e semblantz ad aquel.

Here is my translation of the provided text: And for those wounds that are separated and extracted, as well as those from which blood has not been taken and the limb is causing pain, incise them however you can.
And if there are sores that are itchy or painful, or any other type of inflammation and putrefaction, you must place on each of these [sores] the water that is appropriate for their cure, as described in this chapter.
And now my speech must end and you should take over: when the bone is protruding, it emerges on the limb like the hip bone or its appendages and resembles those of large limbs, do not attempt to reset it, nor extract it for the obvious reasons that may lead to death; instead let it remain there, for it will likely heal in twenty or thirty days; and then treat the wound if you see fit, or leave it be.
It appears that "capitol" may refer to a chapter, as in this case, Chapter 20. Would you like me to translate the text for this chapter?
On curing calluses that occur on the site of any fracture.
Here is my translation of the first source sentence:
Adonc considera si la nodacio es recent e aministra en aquella medicinas que han stipticat ayssi co es aloen, e enses, e mira, e sercacollo, e acrassia, e semblantz ad aquels; enayssi que prenguas de aquella alcunas o totas, e comfesiys aquellas am vi stiptic, o am album de huou, o am vi agre, e pausa aquela sobre la nodacio en estopa, e constringeys aquellas sobre lu per bona constriccio.

Here is my translation of the provided text:
When restoring a fracture once it is restored and what remains of the limb is not according to its natural form.
When a bone fracture is restored, and what remains of the limb is not in its natural form, it is not done for just one reason but rather multiple causes: such as an abundance of liquid from the wound or ligament damage that was not properly treated; or due to excessive tightening of the ligaments which prevents nourishment from reaching the limb; or because of unnecessary over-greasing; or due to excessive movement at the wrong time; or due to a lack of blood in the patient's body and their weakened state.
To cure this, one must feed the patient and make their heart tender so that blood may multiply within them; administer a bath; and surround them with joy and merriment.
Then apply wax to the limb, so that it draws in more nourishment; or continue greasing them with thick water until nourishment runs and returns to its natural form.
The number "xxii" likely indicates that this is the twenty-second chapter or section of the medieval medical treatise.  Chapter titles were not included in the text provided, so I am unable to provide a translation for it.
When treating broken bones that are restored crookedly, forbid any operation on them for this reason.
When an accident occurs in the already restored limb due to its crookedness and the prominence of the broken bone and knots, and it is deformed in shape, but still allows natural movement, then you should not assume that this limb has been recently broken.
But there have been many foolish doctors and restorers who have done this in our land, and such an operation is highly reproachable, leading to great fear as its signal is often fatal.
But if the lameness and knotting are recent, they should be treated with tepid water in which softening herbs have been steeped, such as marshmallow leaves and roots, as well as others like them; let it be made into a poultice with a softening ointment just like diacylum; or that it is seized with a mucilage of marshmallow root and bound with goose grease or almond oil, and plastered with it; or that they are covered with rich figs and wrapped in dove feathers, as well as other similar medicines named after consolidating amulets.
And sometimes it is dissolved by gentle friction with moisture, and movement of the limb should be administered at every opportunity throughout all hours.
If the torsion has already progressed and is severe, turning into a stone-like formation that requires correction with iron, then it must be cut away completely, followed by dissolving of the bone's continuity, and cutting out any superfluous knots from around the bone using delicate instruments, while providing ease to the patient through careful consideration and study.
The text you provided does not contain the information related to your request. Could you please provide more context or details about what you would like me to assist you with?
Here is my translation of the provided text:
Dislocation is the displacement of a joint from its normal position, resulting in restricted movement and an altered appearance of the limb, causing severe pain and injuries to the patient.
Therefore, when a dislocation occurs, it is necessary to perforate and reduce it immediately. Delaying the reduction process should be avoided as it can lead to an abscess formation at the joint, making the dislocation difficult to treat later on.
For this reason, the patient should not be massaged or stretched during an abscess formation, as it can often lead to muscle spasms and severe pain in the affected area.
However, if an abscess does form, it is recommended to perform a flebotomy on the patient and allow the abscess to drain naturally. Afterwards, the limb should be immersed in warm water with oil, facilitating an easier reduction of the dislocation.
Every limb should be carefully cleaned with water, as this will aid in the restoration of its proper function and position.
I have arranged the chapters on dislocation according to their precedence in relation to fractures, starting from the most superior part of the body and moving downwards.
It seems you provided me with two separate texts. The first one is an excerpt from a medieval medical treatise, which I have translated into English for you. The second text appears to be a chapter title or heading, which I will also translate below.
De curacio de dislocacio de la mandibula dejos."
Here is my translation of the provided text:
But when the dislocation is slight, it often returns on its own with little effort.
However, if the dislocation is complete and severe, it requires gentle reduction to be performed promptly without delay.
And if the carer holds the patient's head, and the doctor places one of their fingers in their mouth at the base of the dislocated jaw, if it is displaced on one side; or they insert two fingers together if it is dislocated on both sides, while the other hands remain outside with their palms facing each other; then instructs the patient to close their jaws and bring them towards the center; as the doctor aligns the jaw and pushes it back into its proper position.
If the reduction is difficult, especially when both jaws are dislocated, then apply warm water and oil for evaporation to facilitate a gentle reduction of both sides without any delay in the process, as mentioned earlier.
Once the jaws return and are aligned but remain stiff and the patient's mouth is closed without relaxation, place on them a soft cloth filled with powdered cerot (a type of medicinal substance) and made from wax and rose oil; then secure it gently using soft bandages.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
And this should be administered easily, and do not work on the perception of taste in terms of eating and drinking unless the jaw is tied and healed.
If it is difficult to reduce the dislocation of two jaws when they are displaced at some point and have not returned to their original places, then frequent fever occurs, as well as constant acid reflux; stomach pain in the patient is rare, but pure bile vomiting may occur.
And when you see this, then you know it is a fatality; frequent occurrences are that the one who experiences this dies within 10 days.
It seems you have provided me with some more text, but I am unable to determine what exactly the "capitol" refers to in this context. Could you please clarify so that I may translate or explain it accurately?
Regarding the reduction of the dislocation of the furcula and the extremity of the muscle.
The furcula is not dislocated from the left side towards the leg because of its continuation to the foot, but sometimes it is dislocated outwards on the outside part of the body; this is clear by how it feels.
And its restoration is that the patient crawls onto their back and stretches out their arms. Then close the wound tightly with your palm using a strong compress, for it will return.
And then place an ointment and powder plaster over it, binding it firmly in place.
Unless the extremity of the arm bone is cut and it remains attached, it will never be dislocated again; therefore, it must be reduced and bandaged as we have described and according to your equipment.
And then apply another plaster with powder, use bandages, and instruct the patient to maintain tranquility and rest until they are healed.
And in this method of cure, the extremity of the muscle is reduced when it is detached from its place.
It appears that your message contains a reference to chapter 26 (".xxvi.") of this medieval medical treatise. Is there anything specific you would like me to extract or translate from this chapter? Feel free to provide more context, and I'll assist accordingly!
On the reduction of muscle dislocation."
Here is my translation of your provided text:
The second case is when it is dislocated at the top part of the muscle, and this is done late; it is not dislocated in the rear parts near the shoulder; nor is it dislocated in the front parts near the nerves.
Most commonly, it is dislocated and pushed out in the lower parts below the collarbone, especially in those areas where there is little flesh, as it is lightly dislocated; but in those with more flesh, it is pushed out with difficulty.
And it is rarely that some men experience a blow or fall, and their muscle becomes inflamed with a sudden swelling, and [the bone] is dislocated due to this prior dislocation.
Therefore you must push this back into place while it is on top of a support, and then proceed with its treatment.
Dislocation is known to occur in the lower parts below the collarbone; so that you can distinguish between a dislocated muscle and an intact one, as there will be clear difference between them; and you will find at the head of the muscle a concave area below the collarbone near the touch of the head of the muscle like an egg, and the patient cannot lower their hand to their ear, nor move that ear at all.
If the foot is dislocated, you must pull it or push it upwards; then you will find another sign, and it cannot be hidden.
And this type of dislocation requires gentle reduction, especially when the patient is young.
For the reduction process, have an assistant lift the patient's hand above their broken bone; then place the thumb underneath the patient's chin and bring the joint into its proper position with strength, while another assistant lifts the patient's arm and extends it; finally, let it fall lightly back down.
If it does not return to its place with the above method and if the dislocation is still fresh at the beginning, then for several days, have the patient bathed in warm water; give them an infusion that softens and soothes, like comfrey root, fenugreek, and mallow in water, to be administered.
Then have the patient laid on their back and place some wool underneath their chin which is slightly stiffened; then the doctor should put their heel against the sternum and lift up the head of the muscle with strength, while pulling the patient's arm so that it does not go downwards, and another assistant holds the patient's head to prevent it from going downwards as well. With this method, it will return to its place.
Here is the translation of the provided text: However, if the patient is light in weight, then ensure that another cause of weight is suspended upon them, so as to weigh them down, for the dislocation may return quickly.
And it is reduced in this other way: place on the ground a long pole with its top being rounded like a mortar pestle which should not be too thick nor too thin and then place the patient underneath; since cloths are placed over the head of the pole, let the patient stand along the length of the pole, and extend their hand towards what lies below from the other side; and extend the body of the patient on the other side with strength, for the joint returns to its place quickly.
And if the reduction is difficult due to all the reasons we have mentioned, then employ this cure: take a piece of wood that measures two arms-lengths in length and four fingers in width, and its thickness should be equal to the diameter of your thumb when held like so [demonstrate with hands].
Then over the rounded top, tie some linen cloths to prevent the wood from hurting the patient.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
Now place the arm on a step of the ladder according to its latitude, with the hand extended towards the lower parts, and let the other body be suspended from the opposite side, for the joint will soon enter.
Once the entry of it is completed according to each manner that is possible for you, then it is necessary that you place under the titillium over woolen cloth in equal quantity; and now place plaster prepared with powdered moly and egg white on top of the entire muscle, so that it covers all around, and then tie underneath the titillium with decent firmness; the ligature should be wrapped over the plaster, and his hand should be attached to his neck, left hanging, and not disturbed for seven days.
It is necessary that the diet of the patient be light, while the member is being comforted, for it is easier for their healing.
Then the diet should be increased after seven or five days of being exercised; therefore, if it is firm and not softened, then they are healed.
If the joint is dislocated multiple times due to humidity affecting them or for another reason, then it is necessary that a three-pronged cautery be administered there, according to what was said earlier in the chapter on cauteries.
Here is the translation of the provided text:
Of the dislocation that is made to the feet and thighs or backward parts, reduction is done with a push-pull maneuver using both hands until it returns.
Apply another bandage to the wound, and cure it so that it may heal.
And if it happens that the healing process becomes heavy in this limb and slows down its movement, then let the patient use warm baths often until that heaviness is alleviated and it returns to its former nature.
Chapter 27.
On the cure for shoulder dislocation.
Know that the shoulder joint is dislocated with difficulty and returns with difficulty; and it can be dislocated in all directions, mainly towards the front or backwards, and its dislocation will not be hidden from you when examining it visually or by touch regardless of how it is dislocated, and when you adjust the dislocated shoulder with your hand, this is declared to you clearly because the joint is concave and cannot bend the arm nor touch with that muscle.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
Here is my translation of the provided text:
If the dislocation is at the front part of the body, then return it by bending the hand towards their chest, while striking the elbow with the edge of your palm.
And if the dislocation does not submit to reduction, then administer a vigorous extension with great force.
And have two ministers extend the arm, with each minister holding its placement to prevent it from being pushed back due to extension.
Then the arm should be revolved all around after it has been wrapped with a folded cloth over their hand or bound with bandages.
And when the doctor touches the joint with their hand, grease it with some oil to make sure that these actions help lubricate the joint and facilitate its movement; then manipulate the joint vigorously while returning it to place.
Then, after the reduction, it is necessary to place a poultice on it made of styptic and astringent albumen of eggs, bound with tight bandages; the arm should be suspended from the neck, and left like that for several days.
Then it is unbound; so if the joint has been reformed in its place, then you can release the bandages and let them go.
And if you see that the joint is not getting stronger, then you must apply another plaster and bandage, leaving it for a few days until it strengthens; then remove the bandage.
But if the situation is severe and the reduction of the joint requires more force, and the patient's condition is unstable, then provide moist compresses and gentle friction along with compression until it subsides; or place on the joint a poultice made of oily substances; then bandage it tightly, leaving the dressing in place day and night. Then remove the bandage and put him in a bath; when he is relaxed, you should massage the joint with moderate friction, and then reapply this poultice if it is oily or fatty, once, twice, or three times. With the aid of a bathing instrument, but be gentle.
Or if you prefer, place over it an ointment made of moist and scraped cow dung mixed with barley broth, and leave this on for several days until it improves its condition.
It appears that your prompt is missing information or has an error; could you please provide additional context so I may complete the request accurately? Thank you!
For the treatment of dislocation in a bad situation, it is regarding the joint that is between the arm and hand.
Sometimes the hand is dislocated and its reduction is easy; it's different for other joints. However, one must be quick in reducing them when they are dislocated to prevent the area from becoming swollen or developing an abscess.
The reduction of the dislocation is done by placing the patient's hand joint on a table and having the assistant extend their arm. The physician then places their hand or palm over the prominence of the joint and applies pressure to push it back into place.
However, one must consider if the palm is facing towards the stomach of the patient's hand; in that case, the back of their hand should be placed on a table for extension and reduction. If the dislocation occurs anteriorly to the back of the hand, it should be positioned with the palm down on the table so the doctor's hand can be placed over the prominence of the joint.
If the joint returns quickly, that's good; but if not, then hold it firmly with an adhesive bandage until the swelling subsides and leave it be. Do not interfere again because you cannot and should not force the reduction of the dislocation after several days have passed.
Here is my best attempt at translating the provided text:
Hence, when the illness is returned, then apply on them the plaster which we have recounted, and let it be left and strengthened for five days; then let it be unbound and let it be left until their hand is exercised.
If their movement is hindered and something happens to them with gravity, then soothe that with warm water and some friction until it is alleviated.
It seems you provided me with the chapter number in Roman numerals (chapter 29). Is there anything else I can help you with? Feel free to provide more context or ask specific questions about this text!
On the treatment of the mentioned dislocation."
Alcunas veguadas so dislocatz les ditz a tota partida."
Here is the translation of your provided text:
And then support the head of the finger, and suspend that part which is dislocated above it, and leave it like this for two days.
And then suspend that part, and extend it until it is straightened in its place on that same day.
And when it is night, bind that part according to this narrative, and do not cease to loosen and exercise it with movements during the day, and then bind it at night. Do this for a few days until it becomes tight.
And do something similar if it is dislocated at the wrist of the hand; bind that part to a splint and perform this as your first operation until it is healed.
Similarly, do the same when it is dislocated in other parts of the body.
It seems that this marks the end of this section or chapter, indicated by the number "30". Would you like me to translate any further text?
On the treatment of dislocation of the vertebrae of the spine."
When a complete dislocation occurs in one of the vertebrae of the back or neck and several vertebrae are forced out of their places, there is no cure because death awaits the patient.
The sign of this is that the patient's excretion happens involuntarily and they cannot control it; often some parts of their body or both legs, arms, or one of them become softened, or a vertebra is dislocated from its place, as often these are dislodged and many times it requires relocation in four directions.
Therefore, when it is dislocated backwards, it is called hernia.
The cure for this is to then consider whether the hernia occurred in childhood; if so there is no treatment and it will never be fully healed.
However, for those cases that occur due to straining or impact, or similar causes as these, the Ancients have described methods of treatment at great length which mostly come back to basic remedies; I have instead abbreviated this description here since brevity excuses its lack of detail in my limited proximity to their intention and exposition, which I will now present through various instruments.
And there is cure only for those inflammations that occur on the back itself, which I will now describe.
And if the patient is laid face down near a wall, and a moist cloth is placed beneath them to prevent chafing of their feet.
Then a straight stick is placed, fixed in the ground at the head end near his face, and another stick is positioned around his feet at the other end of the bed.
The minister holds one stick, taking care not to stand in a hole; another minister holds the other stick in the same manner.
Then wrap a thin cord around the patient's head, keeping it loose enough to allow for some movement of the neck; extend one end of the cord to the stick near their head and tie it there; then tighten the other cord over their hips at the back, bring the ends down along their legs, and adjust all the cords so that they are tied together on the other stick positioned by their feet.

And the doctor places their palms on the patient's spine with strength until it returns to its place, or they can place them on a table and adjust their legs onto the table as well.
But if it does not return with this method, then take a table whose width or length is around three yards long, and carve into the wall we mentioned earlier near the patient an area where the end of the table can fit. Then place the middle of the table over the patient's spine, and the doctor places their feet on the other end, pushing hard until the spine is aligned and returns to its proper place.
And if you wish, turn the handle that is turned by hand; and it is for you to place on the ground behind the patient's head two posts of one arm's length each, with their heads being placed in between the two posts; there should be a distance of one palm between each post, which must have holes drilled into them so that the crank can pass through, and ensure they are firmly fixed into the ground to avoid any movement.
There should be an additional round post in between the two posts through which the crank passes, and it too must turn with the two holes of each post.
And at the end of it is a hole in which the shaft is formed, the length of which is one hand's width and what is rolled up there; and on the two other shafts are similar to that."
And then tighten the ligatures that you have tied on his legs in the path leading to his head, and the ligatures you have tightened around his thighs towards his feet.
Then have each person assigned to a turn and let them stay there, twisting the screws with their hands; meanwhile, the doctor should adjust the vertebrae as described before.
Once the vertebrae are realigned and the area is adjusted, you should apply an exciccatious ointment (a type of medicinal balm) with egg whites as a base. Then pack it tightly; afterwards, place on top a piece of board, its width being three fingers or so, and its length matching the size of the affected area over the vertebral joint.
Then bind it with the ligature we mentioned earlier, and feed the patient with light, nutritious food until they recover.
If there is any remaining bulge in the area after the treatment, it is necessary to administer medications that soften and soothe for a long time, as we have recommended before; additionally, a lead plate has already been placed on that location.

De curacio de anca dislocada.
Here is my best attempt at translating the provided text:
The text you provided seems to describe various medical practices and conditions, likely in an ancient language with Latin influences. Here's my best attempt at translating the first sentence:
And it is mostly dislocated in internal areas, and rarely in front or rear parts.
The sign of dislocation in the inner parts is this: when you align the patient's healthy leg with the affected one, it appears longer and the ankle more prominent compared to the healthy side, and the patient cannot bend their foot inward. It is the area where the joint becomes swollen due to a closed abscess, indicating that the head of the dislocation has reached this point.
The sign of dislocation in the outer parts is the opposite of what was described for the inner areas.
The sign of dislocation in the front parts is when the patient extends their leg as much as possible, but cannot bend it due to pain at the ankle. They also cannot walk forward and experience urinary retention with a swollen shin, requiring them to walk on their heel.
The sign of dislocation in the rear parts is when the patient cannot extend their ankle and has difficulty bending it forward; instead, they can only bend it backward. Their leg appears shorter than the other one, with a softened shin, indicating that the head of the dislocation is located there.

Here is my translation of the provided text:
If it does not return in this manner, then you should prepare a strong assistant and extend the patient's leg from its joint or with their hands, or with something that is tied above the knee; another assistant extends the hand of the one like this so that he puts his hands below the testicles; then bind tightly with a lion-like bandage over the groin, while another assistant holds the end of the bandage.
And his extension or the part within compresses the part of the fork, or the part behind to the part of the back.
And with the extension of all these, in one movement as the patient is lifted with his body off the ground and remains hanging.
This special type of extension is common to all four [limbs].
And therefore, if the dislocation returns with what we have said, it will be good; otherwise, it is necessary for all kinds of special treatment that I will say about its own cure.
In its own reduction, when it is dislocated, and the dislocation is internal, the patient must be turned on their side; then place the bandages over the groin in that place between the head of the femur and the part below the inguinal region; then extend the bandage above the part of the inguinal region to the highest part of the fork.
And then another strong minister grasps his arms and pulls on the swollen area of the patient's groin, stretching it outwards forcefully, for that part returns to its place.
This species is the lightest form of cure when this member is reduced, compared to other methods.
But if you are excused and do not follow the instructions for this specific healing method entirely, then it is necessary to tie both of the patient's feet together with a strong, yet light rope, placed above both ankles and below the toes.
The length of each part should be equivalent to the length of four fingers, and the affected leg should be extended more than the other by two finger-widths.
Then the patient should be suspended over the head of the bed and raised to its highest point; their body length from the ground should be two arms-widths.
Command a strong young man to pull on the patient's hip with force while another young man pulls the leg and another assists by pushing it down with strength, for the joint will return to its place quickly.
Moreover, during the proper reduction process, when there is a dislocation on the outer side of the joint, it is necessary for the patient to lie on their stomach as we have recommended if they suffer from yellow jaundice; and the binding should be tightened above the diseased leg specifically, not around their feet.
Then two sticks should be placed, one under the patient's feet and another on their head; and tightly fitted sticks should be positioned in the middle of these, which are wrapped with wet cloth to ensure that the patient is not damaged by the stick being between their thighs, for this way the extension below will not be pulled.
Then every minister should extend to their respective parts, while the doctor applies his hand to guide the reduction according to this technique.
And when the dislocation occurs in front of the joint, it is necessary to slightly extend the leg, and this same procedure should be performed on the patient's back; the doctor will place his right palm over the diseased limb, then cut that with his other hand, and use this cutting motion to pull out the lower part.
Certainly! Here is my translation of the provided text:
And now a compression with a board must be applied over the area where the joint is located.
So, once the reduction is complete and you see signs of it being successful - when you extend the patient's legs and observe equal lengths, and the patient can bend their leg without pain or excuse - then you know that the limb has been properly returned to its correct position. And now, adjust both cushions, apply ointment and wrap with bandages so that no part is too tight; keep the patient at rest for three to four days.
Then untie the bindings and ointment, and compare one leg to the other.
When you see that they are of equal length in appearance, then you know the dislocation has been properly set, and thus you can allow the patient to move.
If you observe any signs of softness or weakness, then you must return and apply a new plaster cast, following your initial structure, and keep the patient at rest for another three days.
Then remove the cast, and have them walk around for several days until they are comfortable.
Chapter 32.
For the treatment of dislocation of the shoulder.
The shoulder can be dislocated in three ways: it can be dislocated outwardly, inwardly, and downward toward the back; it cannot be dislocated forward.
The sign of dislocation is when you ask the patient to bring their arm close to their hip; this indicates that the shoulder is indeed dislocated.
To restore the shoulder in all its dislocations, make the patient stand straight so that they can stretch their arm out if possible; stick your two hands to their face and place their foot between your feet; then hold their shoulder with your palms firmly and keep it pressed between your thumbs over the shoulder area while another assistant stretches out their leg until the shoulder returns to its place.
The sign of successful restoration is when their arm sticks to the hip without effort.
Then plaster the area and stick their arm to their hip with a bandage for three or four days; then remove the bandage.
And do not allow the patient to walk for a few days until they are healed and strengthened.
But if the reduction of it to you is not necessary, then administer strong extension with the ligatures that were used in the hip's cure as previously described.
It appears that "Capitol" may refer to a chapter or a specific section of the treatise, and ".xxxiii." indicates that it is chapter 33. Is there any additional context or information you'd like to provide so I can translate this accurately?
Regarding the cure for dislocation of the ankle."
In some cases, the ankle is sprained due to minor displacement, while in others it is dislocated completely. The dislocation occurs either internally or externally.
The sign of the dislocation is that sometimes you will see swelling of the ankle, originating from the direction it was dislocated.
Usually, the cure for a sprain is gentle manipulation, which should be done with ease using your hands and ensuring it returns to its proper position.
However, when treating a complete dislocation, it is necessary to make the patient lie down straight and have a strong, brave assistant positioned behind their back in the middle.
Then you should place your right hand on the upper part of their foot and use your left hand to hold the lower part of the foot at the ankle.
Pull the foot towards you with your right hand and then twice with your left hand, extending it to the left afterwards. Use your right leg to push down on their calf.
And perform this twice as we have counted.
Then apply the foot's leg to the thigh for the third time, you are at the ankle.
So if you return once or twice in this manner and see that the foot has become swollen, it is good. Otherwise, repeat the operation as it returns to its previous state.
However, if it is forbidden for you to reduce it as we have recounted earlier, then make the patient lie on their back on the ground. Press a very hard stick into the ground between their thighs and wrap them with cloth so that the patient does not get cold.
Then the minister of God holds their thighs, and another minister extends the foot with his hands or with a cloth tied over the ankle; then each minister pulls against the extension of their side, and the stick is between the patient's thighs holding it down so that its body does not move away from underneath due to its own extension.
Then the doctor swells up the joint with his hands while another minister holds the healthy side below it because the dislocation returns easily.
And so when the dislocation returns and you have confirmed the health of the reduced part of the patient, then apply an ointment or poultice and tightly wrap it with strong bandages, securing the foot with a bandage attached to the leg.
Be careful or take precautions to avoid the nerves that run behind the ankle, as you don't want the bandage over that area to be too tight and cause injury.
Leave it like that for two or three days; if the bandage becomes loose, remove it.
On either the third or fourth day, untie it and forbid the patient from walking for forty days. But if he is compelled to walk before this time has passed, it should not be surprising that the dislocation may have reoccurred and become corrupted, beyond repair.
And if an acute abscess forms on the patient, you should administer to them what we have previously mentioned in this account: other places of treatment and ointments while it is still fresh.
This indicates that the previous text was part of Chapter 34, potentially within a larger work or compilation of medical knowledge. The use of ".xxxiiii." suggests a structured division of content into individual chapters.
Here is my translation of the provided text into English:
Cove que aquel qu’es dislocat sia engualhat am pauca extencio ses trebal; e aquo que no es dificil, abantz es leugier.
But if the dislocation is in one of the ankle joints, then you should make the patient place his foot on the ground or on a table, and let him remain there as if he was walking.
Then stand on your feet and place your foot over what seems to be the joint, then press it with your foot vigorously until it goes back in, and make sure that you see it go back properly without any prominence.
Then place a board under the patient's foot covering the whole of it with two ends, then bind them together tightly but gently for three days; afterwards untie it and let him rest from walking for many days to make sure he is healed.
It seems that this indicates the 35th chapter of the treatise, which is a common way of structuring long texts such as books or manuscripts by dividing them into numbered sections called chapters for better organisation. Is there another text portion you would like me to translate?
Regarding the types of dislocation caused by blows, or fractures, or any other accident.
When any of these events happen, and you decide to meddle in their treatment and restoration, many times death occurs.
Here is my translation of the provided text: And so, exert yourself immediately to perform the reduction at the beginning of the procedure, before it develops into an abscess.
And if the limb returns to its desired position, then administer treatment that prevents the abscess from becoming a chronic wound and heals the plague with what you consider appropriate for drying ointments.
If there is dislocation with a fracture and the ends of the bones are separated, then you pierce their membranes, and do as we have said before for simple diseases in those places.
And be mindful and avoid those instruments of torture in the ways of fear according to what my teachings have preceded; for this is better for you before your Creator, and more permanent for your glory, and healthier for your true self during your time. Thus ends the words of Albucasis, from whom may God grant us blessings. Amen.
