On the treatment of contracture which appears on the upper eyelid.	On entropion occurring in the upper eyelid.	0.6956167
When contracture occurs in the eye, it is a contraction of the eyelid that is drawn upward or to the right or left due to improper healing of a wound, incision, or cauterization, and it is called "leporina." This contracture is either natural or accidental, caused by the improper healing of a wound, incisions, or cauterizations, or something similar.	The eye that suffers this inversion of the lid is called 'leporine' (i.e.	0.6174669
The way to operate on this is to cut through the consolidation and separate the edges of it, then place a piece of linen cloth between them and bind them until they are healed.	The idea of the operation is to excise the scar, separate the edges of the wound, pack linen between them, and bandage up till healed.	0.7349524
And you should not use drying or constricting treatments because if you do, the contracture will return worse than ever before.	In the treatment of it you should not use anything styptic or drying, for if you do the inversion will return worse than ever before.	0.78072906
Use softening treatments such as fenugreek, and wash with water in which marshmallow and linseed have been cooked, or an ointment called 'diachylon,' which is liquefied with some oils, and soak the linen cloth in it, and treat with that.	Employ relaxing substances such as fenugreek; and fomentation with water in which mallows and linseed have been boiled; and diachylon plaster which has been previously softened with one of the oils and spread on the packs; and treat it with this.	0.82322747
The key to your treatment is to ensure by all means that the wound does not consolidate as it did initially.	The main thing in the treatment is to use every device to prevent the healing up of the place as it was before.	0.7378975
This procedure we have described is merely a correction of the contracture that does not return the place to its original form.	This operation which we have described is but some correction of the inversion, not that the appearance of the place will necessarily revert to what it was.	0.7720684
