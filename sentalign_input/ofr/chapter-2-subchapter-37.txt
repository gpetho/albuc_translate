of the uvula
When a rheum descends to the uvula, and it is swollen and elongated, it is called "perpendicular";
and if it is large and round underneath, it is called "uvula".
When it is treated as we have described in the section, and the treatment is not effective, and you see that the hot abscess is subsided, and it is thin, then you must cut it;
and the one that is round and compact and not long;
and it is bloody or dark-colored or black, then you must avoid cutting it.
For there is great danger for the patient.
It is therefore necessary, when you see it, according to the manner I have described, by its whiteness and its length, that you have the patient sit facing the sun, and press the tongue with the instrument that we mentioned earlier;
then insert the hook into the uvula, and pull it down, and cut it with one of the two instruments that I mentioned for the incision of the tonsils.
And you must not cut more than the excess that is beyond the natural limit;
for if you cut more, you will harm the voice and speech;
and after the incision, use what we have described for the incision of the tonsils, and treat it until it is healed.
And if the patient is afraid of being cut, then you must use a trick for cauterization without him fearing.
And the manner of the cautery is with sharp water. (or: And the way of the cautery is with sharp water.)
And the patient should place his head on your lap, and then you press the tongue with the instrument that we mentioned in the chapter on cautery, and moisten it with hot vinegar, so that it is neither too thick nor too thin;
and fill the hollow of this instrument, of which here is the form:
And it has a bowl at the end where the medicine is placed, like the bowl of a spoon, and place the instrument with all the medicine on the uvula;
and the patient should be lying on his side, so that the saliva and mucus run out of his mouth with the medicine inside, so that it doesn't go down the throat and harm him; 
then hold your hand with all the medicine and press it on the uvula, for about half an hour, until you see it numbed and the burning sensation of the medicine has subsided;
and if you wish, take cotton and wrap it around some instrument, and soak the cotton in the medicine, and put the instrument with the cotton in the mouth above, so that the cotton rests on the uvula;
and do this often, until the cauterization is complete, then leave it to dry, and it will fall off after four or five days.
And if you need to repeat the cauterization with the medicine, then repeat it, and after the cauterization wipe around the uvula, with cotton soaked in butter, and clean what is around the medicine;
and it should be rinsed with cold water, and treated with gargles until it is healed.
This treatment is safer than incision, or than cautery;
if it is treated with fumigation in this manner, take calamint and hyssop and oregano and rue and chamomile and southernwood and similar herbs, and put them all together or some of them in a pot, and add vinegar, and boil it;
and the pot should be well sealed with strong clay, and in the middle of the pot there should be a hollow instrument like this:
And it should be made of silver or brass, and one end should be placed in the patient's mouth so that the vapor rises to the uvula through the tube, until the uvula is deadened;
afterwards repeat it often, until the uvula dries up, and be careful not to do this at the beginning of the appearance of the hot abscess, because several things can happen;
and do not perform this cauterization until the decline of the hot abscess.
And if this instrument is not available, then take a tube and place inside the end an eggshell, so that the patient's mouth is not too hot;
because the eggshell does not allow the vapor to irritate the mouth, and this is a good treatment together with healing.
