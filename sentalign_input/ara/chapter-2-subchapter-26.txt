Chapter Twenty-Six.
On suturing the nose, lip, and ear.
If its connection is severed by a wound or something similar, know that whenever a separation occurs in one of these cartilages, the procedure rarely succeeds except in some people.
So when something like this happens to someone, see if the wound is fresh with blood, then bring the edges of the wound together with sutures and then treat it until it heals.  And if the separation has separated its edges and each side has become sound, then you should scrape each side to the thickness of its visible skin until it bleeds.
Then bring the two edges together with sutures and tighten them, and sprinkle on them powdered acacia and frankincense, and apply over the powders a plaster of palm ointment or other healing ointments, and leave it tight for two or three days, then loosen it.
And change the medication and leave it until the sutures dissolve on their own, then treat it with the ointment until it heals. The method of suturing is to bring together the separated connection either with needles as we described in suturing the abdomen, or with thread as we explained to you there.
