When any of these conditions occur, and you attempt to treat and restore it, often death ensues.	When anything of this kind happens and you attempt treatment and restoration, death is a frequent sequel.	0.8436749
Therefore, only a skilled, experienced, merciful, and cautious practitioner, not rash or presumptuous, should attempt the treatment. Initially, use medicines that only alleviate painful abscesses and leave the patient to divine judgment, unless you have hope of recovery and alleviation of the disease, with some sign of hope. Then try to reduce the dislocation immediately at the onset, before a painful abscess develops.	Therefore such treatment should be undertaken only by a person that is skilled in the art, has long experience, is dexterous, sympathetic, cautious, and not reckless or over-bold. To begin with he should apply only remedies for the allaying of abscesses and then leave the patient to Divine providence, unless, of course, the injury is light enough to give some hope of his escaping death; in which case you should set out to reduce it at once before an abscess arise.	0.83271646
If the limb returns to place as desired, administer treatment to alleviate the abscess and heal the wound with appropriate drying ointments.	If the part goes back as you wish, employ the treatment for allaying abscesses and dress the wound with suitable desiccant ointments.	0.8586658
If the dislocation is accompanied by a fracture with separated bone fragments, stabilize them and proceed as described earlier for such conditions.	If it be a dislocation with a fracture and there occur splintered fragments in the bone, try to remove them, following therein the instructions relating to the simple diseases we have mentioned before in their place.	0.70942664
Protect and avoid exposure to hazards as much as possible, as advised earlier; this is better for you before your Creator, more lasting for your glory, and healthier for your body in the long run. Thus concludes the words of Albucasim perfectly, for which God be praised. Amen.	Use your utmost diligence; keep clear of entering upon a course with a dangerous outcome, as I have enjoined on you before. For this will best ensure the continuance of your prestige and safeguard your good name, God willing.	0.63471496
