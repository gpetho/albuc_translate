Chapter thirty-four on cauterizing hemorrhoids of the anus.
If there are many or one chronic hemorrhoid in the anus, and it is from thick cold humors or corrupt moistures, and it was treated with what we mentioned in the division, but the treatment did not work
then cauterize the patient with three triangular cauterizations on the bottom of the vertebrae of the back, slightly below the buttocks
and a cauterization below the navel by about two fingers' breadth
And if you estimate that his stomach has become cold, and his food is not being digested, and you see his face swollen
then cauterize him on the stomach with a large cauterization as mentioned before
and a cauterization on his liver
and another on his spleen with a nail-shaped cautery iron
and leave the cauterization open for a while
then treat it until it heals, God willing
