of dropsy
Cautery is not useful for dropsy, except in the manner called "ascites".
When you treat it according to the methods we have described in the sections, and your treatment is not effective, then you must make four cauteries around the groin, and one on the stomach, and one on the liver, and one on the spleen, and two behind the back on the spine, and one near the chest;
and let the cautery be very close to the thickness of the heart.
Afterwards, leave the cautery open to drain pus for a long time, and do not abandon the care of the patient after the cautery;
and healing will be hastened, and the two intentions will be together with God's help.
The form of the cautery for the belly should be the key (cautery iron) that we have shown before;
and that for the back should be olive-shaped, according to what is placed above.
