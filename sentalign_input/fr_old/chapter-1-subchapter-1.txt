Concerning the olive-shaped cautery
This cautery is effective for moisture and coldness in the brain, and there are two types made for a disease called "soda", and for many humors that descend from the head to the eyes, and to the ears, and for the multitude of dreams, toothache, and sore throat, and especially for all diseases that come from coldness such as paralysis, soda, apoplexy, and similar diseases.
The method for this cautery is that the patient is purged by a laxative medicine cleansing the head for three or four nights, according to what the strength, age, and habits of the patient can endure; then shave the patient’s head.
Then make him sit cross-legged with his hands on his chest; afterward place the base of your palm on the base of his nose between his two eyes; and where your middle fingers rest, make an incision there and then heat the cautery called "olivare", which has this shape:
And place it on the marked spot with ink, and gently press down while rotating your hand slightly; then lift your hand quickly, and examine the spot to see if you see a small piece of bone; if not, repeat the cautery until you see the bone as I have described; then take a little salt, put it in water and soak cotton in it, and place it on the spot, and leave it for three days; then apply cotton soaked in butter; and leave it until the burn is gone; afterward treat the wound with an ointment called "tetrafarmaçon" until it is healed.
And the ancients said that the longer the wound remains open, the more it is cleansed; and for this reason it helps greatly.
And some of them said that the cautery should be left on until part of the bone is burned, and then scrape off what is burned from the bone, and it will be healed.
And others say that the cautery should be left on and pressed so hard that it removes a piece of bone as large as a spindle that women use, so that the humors are completely expelled; and the wound should be left open for a long time; afterward, it should be cleaned and closed.
And these two methods of cautery do not seem good to me overall, except in some men where there is a way of fear; and it seems to me that I should leave it; for the head is weakened by the continuous solutions of nature, as we witness in other members; and especially when the patient’s head is weak by nature, and the first method of cautery is safer and better for me, and I use this method to work together for healing.
