And the author of this book, upon completing for you, my children, this book which is a part of medical knowledge in its entirety and achieving clarity and explanation within it, saw fit to complete it for you with this chapter which is a part of practical work by hand.
For practical work by hand is improved in our country and in our time utterly absent, so much so that its science is nearly studied and its influence discontinued. And what remains of it are slight illustrations in the books of the early scholars, which have been distorted by hands and subjected to errors and confusion, until its meanings have become obscure and its benefits distant.
So I saw fit to revive it and compose this chapter in the manner of explanation and clarification, providing images of cautery blades and other surgical instruments, as this adds to the clarity and is essential for what is needed.
The reason there is no skilled craftsman in our time is because the practice of medicine is long and its practitioner should first train in the science of anatomy, which Galen described. Until one becomes knowledgeable about the benefits of the organs, their forms, their temperaments, their connections and disconnections, the knowledge of bones, nerves, muscles, their numbers, their origins, and the locations of the arteries and veins and their origins.
For this reason, Hippocrates said that there are many who are called doctors but few in practice, especially in the art of the hand. We have mentioned some of this in the introduction of this book.
For whoever is not knowledgeable about what we have mentioned regarding anatomy is likely to make a mistake that could kill people, as I have witnessed many who have presumed knowledge in this field and claimed it without actual knowledge or understanding.
That is because I saw an ignorant doctor who cut into a goiter on the neck of a woman, thus cutting some arteries in the neck, causing the woman's blood to flow until she fell dead before him.
I saw another doctor who proceeded to remove a stone from an elderly man, and the stone was large, so he took a risk and removed it along with a piece of the bladder. The man died around three days later, and I had been called to remove it, but when I saw the condition of the stone and the patient, I determined that it was beyond what could be managed.
I saw another doctor who was employed by some of the officials in our city to practice medicine.
A young black boy had a fracture in his leg near the ankle along with a wound, and the doctor, out of ignorance, quickly bound the fracture tightly over the wound with bandages and splints without leaving any room for the wound to breathe.
Then he let him go to his desires, and left him for days, ordering him not to loosen the binding until his leg and foot swelled up and he was on the verge of death.
I was called to him, so I quickly loosened the binding, and he found relief and was alleviated from his pains, except that the corruption had already taken hold in the limb and I could not prevent it.
The corruption continued to spread in the limb until he perished.
I saw another doctor who cut into a cancerous tumor, and it ulcerated after days until the sufferer's condition greatly worsened. This is because if the cancer is purely of a black bile mixture, then it should never be treated with surgery at all.
unless it is in a limb that could possibly be amputated entirely.
And for this, my son, you should know that working with the hand is divided into two parts: work accompanied by safety and work that often results in damage.
And I have warned in every place in this book about work that involves risk and fear; you should beware of it and reject it.
So that the ignorant may not find a way to criticize or attack, take for yourselves firmness and caution, and for your patients, gentleness and thoroughness.
Use the best methods leading to safety and a praised outcome, and avoid dangerous and difficult-to-cure diseases.
Purify yourselves from what you fear may bring doubt into your religion and worldly affairs, for it is more lasting for your honor and raises your status in this world and the hereafter.
For Galen said in one of his admonitions: Do not treat bad diseases and thus be called bad doctors.
And I have divided this article into three chapters.
The first chapter.
On cauterization with fire and cauterization with sharp medicines, organized and arranged from head to foot, including images of the instruments and cauterizing blades, and everything needed for working by hand.
And the second chapter.
On incision, cauterization, bloodletting, cupping, surgeries, and the extraction of arrows and similar procedures, all are organized in chapters and arranged with illustrations of the instruments.
And the third chapter.
On bone setting, dislocations, and the treatment of gout and similar conditions, organized and arranged from head to foot with illustrations of the instruments.
The first chapter.
On cauterization.
And before we mention working with it, it is necessary to mention the manner of its benefits and harms and in what temperament it is used.
I say that the discussion on the manner of the benefit of cauterization and its harms is a long discourse, a precise science, and a hidden secret, and many wise people have spoken about it.
They differed on this, and I have summarized the little from their discourse to avoid lengthiness.
I say that cauterization generally benefits every bad temperament whether with matter or without, except for two temperaments: the hot temperament without matter and the dry temperament without matter.
As for the dry temperament with matter, they differed on it. Some said that cauterization is beneficial in it, while others said the opposite, that cauterization is not suitable for a disease caused by heat and dryness because the nature of fire is heat and dryness.
It is impossible to cure a hot and dry disease with a hot and dry treatment. Those who argue the opposite say that cauterization with fire can be beneficial for a hot and dry disease that occurs in people's bodies. For when you add the body of the human and its moisture to the temperament of fire, you affect the body of the human with cold.
And I say with his saying because experience has revealed that to me many times, but this matter should not be imagined except by one who has trained and practiced in the art of cauterization to a great extent. And he recognized the differences in people's temperaments and the state of diseases in themselves, their causes, their symptoms, and the duration of time they last.
And as for the other temperaments, there is no need for you to fear them, especially the cold and moist diseases, for all physicians agree on them and do not disagree about the benefit of cauterization in them.
Know, my sons, that one of the secrets of treatment is cauterization with fire and its advantage over cauterization with a burning medicine because fire is a single essence and its effect does not extend beyond the organ which was cauterized and it does not harm another connected organ except with a slight damage.
And cauterization with burning medicine may extend its effect to other organs and may cause a disease in the organ that is difficult to treat, and may even cause death. But fire, due to its nobility and the generosity of its essence, does not do this unless it is excessive.
And this has become clear to us through experience due to the length of service, attention to the craft, and understanding the realities of the matter.
And for this reason, I have dispensed with lengthy discourse, but were it not inappropriate for my book, I would present to you a mysterious secret about fire and its manner of action on bodies and its removal of diseases with philosophical and demonstrative speech that penetrates your understanding.
And know, O sons, that they have differed about the time in which cauterization is appropriate, and they made the best time the spring season.
And I say that cauterization may be appropriate at all times, because the harm caused by the time is overshadowed by the benefit brought about by cauterization. Especially if the cauterization is for severe, necessary pains that are dangerous and cannot tolerate delay, due to the fear that it may result in a disaster that is greater than the slight harm caused by the time.
Do not let it come to your mind, O sons, what the common people and ignorant physicians imagine, that cauterization which cures a disease will never return, and they consider it permanent.
It is not as they imagine, for cauterization is like a medicine that alters the temperament and dries the humidities which are the cause of pains.
However, cauterization is preferred over medicine due to its quick success, strong effect, and intense power.
And the disease may return at some time, depending on the condition of the patient, the strength and dominance of his illness, and what accumulates in his body from excesses and neglecting himself in acquiring them from foods and other such causes.
Except that the disease in which cauterization is used is a mild one and in an organ with little excess and moisture. Like extracting the tooth from pain and the like, it may be that such pain does not return, and this happens in the least.
And as for the common people's saying that cauterization is the last of medicine, it is a correct statement not in accordance with what they believe, because they think that no treatment, whether with medication or otherwise, can be beneficial after cauterization, but the matter is contrary to that.
The meaning of "cauterization is the last of medicine" is that when we use various treatments for a disease and those medicines are ineffective, then we use cauterization as the final method, which may be effective. Hence comes the saying that "cauterization is the last of medicine. Not in the sense that the common people and many ignorant physicians have understood it.
The early scholars mentioned that cauterization with gold is better than cauterization with iron. They said this because gold is balanced and its essence is noble, and they claimed that the site of cauterization does not suppurate. However, this is not always the case.
For I have tried this and found that it only occurs in some bodies and not others. Cauterization with gold is indeed better and more preferable than with iron, as they claimed. However, when you heat the cautery instrument made of gold in fire, it is not clear to you when it has reached the desired level of heat due to the redness of the gold.
Because it quickly cools down, and if you increase the heat, it melts in the fire and becomes molten, causing the craftsman to be troubled by this. Therefore, cauterization with iron is faster and closer to being correct for practical use, if God wills.
I have arranged this chapter on cauterization in sections organized from head to foot to make it easier for the student to find what he desires, God willing.
The first chapter.
Cauterization of the head is done once.
This cauterization is beneficial for excess moisture and cold that overpower the brain, which are causes of headache, frequent discharges from the head to the region of the eyes and ears, excessive sleep, tooth pain, and throat pains. In general, for every disease that occurs due to cold, such as paralysis, epilepsy, strokes, and other similar diseases.
The procedure for this cauterization is to first order the patient to purge with a laxative that cleanses the head for three or four nights, according to what is required by the strength of the patient, his age, and his habits.
Then order him to shave his head with a razor, then seat him in front of you, sitting cross-legged with his hands on his chest.
Then place the base of your palm on the base of his nose between his eyes, and where your middle finger ends, mark that spot with ink.
Then heat the olive-shaped cautery, which looks like this.
If the bone becomes exposed, about the size of a clove or a grain of carob, lift your hand. Otherwise, reapply with the same iron or another if it has cooled. Until you see what I have mentioned to you from the bone, then take some salt and dissolve it in water and soak a cotton piece in it and place it on the area and leave it for three days.
Then apply cotton soaked in fat to it and leave it until the inflammation subsides, then treat it with the four-part ointment until it heals, if God wills.
They have said that the wound is better and more beneficial the longer it remains open to discharge pus.
Some have mentioned that the skin should be cauterized down to the bone, and the cautery iron should be held until part of the thickness of the bone is burned. Then, what has been burnt from the bone should be removed and treated afterwards.
Others have said that cauterization should be intensified until it strongly affects the bone, causing pieces to fall off like carats or small disks. They claimed that this releases vapors from the head and leaves the wound open for a long time.
Then it should be treated until it heals. I do not approve of these types of cauterization except in some cases and as a risky method, and leaving them is better in my opinion. If it is safe, then the head weakens when its natural connection is disrupted, as we have observed with other organs.
This is especially true when the patient's head is naturally weak. The first type of cauterization is safer and better in my opinion, and it is what I use. Follow it and you will be safe, if God wills.
Chapter Two.
For the head as well.
If a chronic pain occurs in the head region and persists for a long time with the patient having used various treatments such as bloodletting, purgatives, fumigation, ointments, and dressings, especially if single cauterization which we described has been applied and none of these treatments have been beneficial, then examine. If the patient's head is inherently strong in structure and not weak, and if he feels a severe coldness, apply another cauterization slightly above the previous one. Then cauterize each temple of his head until the thickness of the skin is reduced and the amount of bone exposed is as we described. Cauterize another spot at the back of his head in the area known as the axe, but be gentle with your hand in this case and do not expose the bone, for the patient will feel intense pain here unlike the pain of other cauterizations on the head. I will mention this cauterization in its proper place.
The cautery used for the temples and the back of the head should be milder than the one used for the center of the head. This is its description.
Chapter Three.
On cauterizing non-chronic migraine.
If pain accompanied by headache occurs on one side of the head and extends to the eye, make the patient vomit with medicines that cleanse the head and use all other treatments mentioned in the sections on diseases. If this is not effective, then cauterization should be applied in two ways. Either cauterization with the sharp, burning medicine or with iron.
As for cauterization with the burning medicine, it is to take one clove of garlic, peel it, and cut its ends from both sides, then incise the site of pain on the cheek with a broad lancet until there is a space under the skin large enough to hold the clove.
It is inserted under the skin until it disappears, then tightly bandage it with care. Leave it for about fifteen hours, then remove the bandage and take out the garlic. Leave the wound alone for two or three days, then proceed with treatment.
Place cotton soaked in grease until the area suppurates, then treat it with ointment until it heals, if God wills. If you prefer, you can do this with some of the burning medicines that I provided in the eighteenth article on burning medicines.
As for cauterizing with iron, it is done in this manner: heat the cautery iron which has this shape:.
It is called the nail-shaped cautery because its head resembles a nail, with some perforations and a small protrusion in the middle.
Then place it on the site of pain and hold your hand as you rotate the iron slightly, and the amount you burn from the thickness of the skin should be about half of it. Lift your hand so as not to burn the artery below, which could cause bleeding. Then soak some cotton in salt water and place it on the area and leave it for three days. Then apply the cotton with fat, then treat it with the ointment until it heals, if God wills.
And if you want, cauterize this sinus with the sharp end of the cautery iron, and be careful not to cut the artery in this non-chronic sinus especially.
Chapter Four.
On cauterizing the chronic sinus.
If you treat the sinus with the treatments we have mentioned and those described in the divisions of diseases, and the treatment is ineffective, and you see in the condition what cannot be managed by the initial cauterization with medication or fire as we have mentioned. You should heat the cauterizing knife until it turns white, then apply it to the site of pain in a line about half a finger long or so, and leave your hand once as you press it until it cuts through the artery and reaches near the bone.
However, you should be careful not to affect the jaw that moves during chewing, as burning its muscle or nerve can cause spasms.
Be cautious and watchful of the bleeding from the artery you have cut, for there is great danger in cutting it. Especially for those who do not know what they are doing and have not tried the method, it is better to refrain from performing the procedure.
The management of incidental bleeding from the artery will be discussed in detail in its place in the book, if God wills. If you see in the condition what cannot be managed by this cauterization.
I have seen the body of the sick person able to bear cauterization in the middle of the head as described, and treat the wound until it heals, God willing.
And if you wish, use the cauterization we mentioned in the chapter on artery forceps with the two-bladed iron, for it is better and more effective than this.
Chapter Five.
On cauterizing the pains of the ears.
If pain occurs in the ear due to cold and is treated with laxatives and other treatments we mentioned in the classification, but the pain does not subside, heat the iron known as the point, which has this shape.
Then apply it around the entire ear after heating it, as if circling around it, or around both ears if the pain is in both. Keep the cauterization slightly away from the base of the ear after marking the spot with ink. The cauterization should be about ten points in each ear or so. Then treat the areas until they heal, God willing.
Chapter Six.
On cauterizing the larynx.
The larynx that is treated with cauterization is of the type caused by phlegm, as I mentioned in the classifications of diseases.
Cauterization should be avoided for the type that occurs due to dryness and nerve spasms.
If you have treated this type of larynx with electuary, pessaries, and gargles but your treatment has not been effective, it is necessary to cauterize the patient with three cauteries. One is at the base of the ear, the second slightly below his temple, and the third at the meeting of the lips.
Make your cautery on the opposite side of the affected area because the relaxation occurs in the side that appears healthy.
The image of the cautery is to cauterize it slightly below the temple, opposite the upper part of the ear, and another in the temple area, with its length equal to the length of the thumb.
Lower your cautery until it burns to about half the thickness of the skin. This is the image of the iron, which is a type of knife that has been shown previously, but it is slightly finer as you can see. It is desirable that the knife should be slightly thicker, then treat the area as previously mentioned until it heals, if God wills.
Chapter Seven.
On the cautery of chronic stroke.
If the stroke becomes chronic and the treatments we mentioned do not work and there is no fever in the patient, cauterize it with four cauteries. Place one cautery on each temple of his head, one in the center of the head as mentioned, and a cautery at the back of the head as previously described.
The description of the cautery is as previously mentioned, and it may also be cauterized at the mouth of the stomach for better effect, then treat it as previously described.
Chapter Eight.
In order to forget.
That which is due to phlegm should first be treated by giving the patient large draughts and purified seeds for the brain.
Then, his entire head should be shaved and a mustard poultice, as written in the chapter on poultices, should be applied to the back of his head multiple times, for this is a form of cauterization.
Do that in the same manner I described there, for he will be healed by it. If not, cauterize him three times at the back of his head, arranged from the top of the head to below the neck.
Make the space between each cauterization the thickness of a finger. Then, treat the cauterization as previously described. If you wish to increase the treatment and the patient can tolerate it, cauterize the middle area again.
If you wish to increase the treatment, cauterize him on the temples, then treat him until he is healed. The cautery should be olive-shaped as previously described.
Chapter Nine.
On the cauterization of paralysis and the relaxation of the entire body.
It is necessary to proceed with purifying the head with draughts and what we have mentioned. Then, shave the patient's head and cauterize it with one cautery in the center of the head, one on each temple, and one at the back.
And three on the vertebrae of the neck, and if you need for the condition of bodily weakness more than that, and the patient can tolerate it and the disease is strong and established, cauterize four burnings on the vertebrae of his back. And continue with the cauterization until it burns most of the skin, then lift your hand, and then treat it as previously mentioned until it heals, if God wills, and the cautery iron should be olive-shaped.
The Tenth Chapter.
On the cauterization of epilepsy.
Only the epileptic who has epilepsy due to phlegm should be cauterized; his brain should first be cleansed with large electuaries and all other treatments which we mentioned in the division, if the patient is an adult and can tolerate taking medications.
If it is a child who cannot tolerate medications, then use gargles and mouthwashes that cleanse the brain for many days beforehand, along with improving his diet.
Then shave his head, then cauterize one burning in the center of the head as previously described in the method, and another burning at the back. And on each temple of his head, one burning. If the patient is strong and can tolerate it, cauterize the burnings mentioned for paralysis and bodily weakness on the vertebrae of the neck and back, and the cautery iron should be olive-shaped as previously described.
If the patient is a child, make the cautery iron mild in this form.
Chapter Eleven.
On Treating Melancholia.
If the cause of melancholia is corrupt humors and thick phlegm, apply the cauterizations we mentioned in the treatment of paralysis.
If the cause of melancholia is an excess inclined towards blackness and the body of the patient is moist, give him what purifies his brain as was mentioned earlier in the classification.
Then shave the patient's head, then make a solid cake from linen like a circle, then place it in the center of his head while the patient is sitting cross-legged holding it on all sides. Then take one pound of old sheep's fat.
Then heat it over fire to a moderate temperature, about what a finger can endure when inserted into it. Then pour it in the center of his head within the circle and leave it until it cools. Do this once a week for the patient along with other proper treatments until he recovers, if God wills.
And if you wish, cauterize it with small drops without holding the cautery iron tightly, but rather by light touches. For this type of cauterization moderately moistens the brain.
Then apply cotton soaked in sheep fat or chicken fat to it.
Chapter Twelve.
On Cauterizing Water Discharge from the Eye.
If it becomes clear to you that water is discharging from the eye based on the symptoms mentioned in the classification, then immediately give the patient what purifies his head, protect him from all moistures, and induce sweating in the bath on an empty stomach for several days.
Then shave his head and cauterize a spot in the middle of the head, then cauterize two spots on the temples if the water starts to flow from both eyes or from one side if it is from one eye.
Then cut with the cautery all the veins and arteries under the skin, and let the cauterizations be long in width on the temples, and beware of bleeding.
If you see anything of it, cut it immediately with whatever treatment is possible for you, and we will come to the wisdom in threading the arteries, cutting them, and preventing bleeding.
And it may be cauterized on the back of the head under the two bones with two significant cautery marks.
Chapter Thirteen.
On the cauterization of chronic tears.
If the tears of the eye are chronic and constant, and they come from the veins and arteries that are on the outer surface of the head, and you are certain that this is due to excessive cold and thick phlegm, then cauterize with the cautery I described precisely at the start of the water flowing. Cauterize in the middle of the head, and cauterize two spots on the temples, and two spots at the back of the head under the two bones. If more is needed, cauterize one spot on each side at the tail of the eye near the eyebrow with a small cautery iron.
Chapter Fourteen.
On the cauterization of foul-smelling nose.
If you treat it with what we mentioned in the division and the treatment does not succeed, then quickly apply the qawwaiya to the patient for three nights, then shave his head and cauterize it moderately with an olive-shaped cautery iron. Then cauterize it twice above the eyebrows slightly under the hair with a nail-shaped cautery iron, and be careful not to cut the artery. This is the image of the nail-shaped iron.
Chapter Fifteen.
On cauterizing the relaxation of the eye lid.
If the eyelid sags due to illness or moisture, cauterize the eyelid once with this crescent-shaped cautery iron.
If you wish, cauterize it slightly above the eyebrows twice on each side and keep away from the temples; the length of each cautery should be equal to the length of the eyebrow.
Do not overdo the cautery with your hand, but to the extent that a third of the skin is burned, and the shape of the cautery iron should be as described.
Chapter Sixteen.
On cauterizing the eyelid.
If the eyelashes turn inward and irritate the eye, then the cautery for this has two types. Either cauterize with fire or cauterize with a burning medicine. As for cauterizing with fire, you should instruct the patient to stop plucking his eyelashes if he does so, until they grow long and even.
For if you pluck them at the time of their growth, then bind his eyes with a bandage so that they do not move until they grow. Once they have grown and settled, place the patient's head in your lap, then mark on the eyelid with ink the shape of an as leaf.
And the beginning of the mark should be near the eyelashes, then place under the eyelid cotton soaked in egg white or in the saliva of a lizard, then heat an iron, this is its shape.
Then iron over the shape you marked little by little in many times until the surface of the skin, which is like the shape of an as leaf, is all burned, especially its outer part. A sign of the correctness of your work is to see that the eyelid has wrinkled and the hair has risen from the eye flesh.
Then raise your hand at that time and leave it for three days, then apply cotton with fat until the scab falls off, then treat it with ointment until it heals, if God wills. If any hair returns after some time and the eyelid relaxes.
Then repeat the cauterization on that area as you did at first. If the hair is in the lower eyelid, trim it until it returns to its natural position and does not touch the eye with the hair. As for cauterization with a burning medicine, instruct the patient to let the eyelashes grow long and even.
Then make a shape of an as leaf from paper. Then take from the known soap and unslaked lime, one dirham or so of each, and grind them both very well together. Do this quickly so that it does not dry out. Then spread it on the paper you have made like a leaf of basil, and place it over one or both eyelids, and put cotton soaked in egg white under the eye, and have the patient's head in your lap.
Place your index finger on the medicine and press it slightly while moving it whenever the patient feels the sting of the medicine because it will feel like fire to him. As long as he feels the sting, leave the medicine and move it with your finger. When the sting subsides, remove the medicine and wash the eye with water.
And look, if you see the eyelid has risen as it does when cauterized with fire or cut, and if not, then reapply the medicine to the area where it did not affect and did not turn black until you complete your work and the eye is cauterized. Then apply cotton with fat until the inflammation of the burn subsides.
Then treat it with the palm ointment or another until it heals. You should be extremely careful during the procedure to ensure that no part of the medicine falls into the eye, for if the eyelid becomes loose after a few days, there is a fear of hair falling into the eye.
Reapply the medicine to the area of the eyelid that has become loose as you did initially, then treat it until it heals. This is a picture of a basil leaf.
Know that people's eyes differ in size, so adjust your cauterization accordingly. The right way is not hidden from one who has experience in this craft.
Chapter Seventeen.
On treating the hemorrhoid that appears in the rectum.
If you treat the hemorrhoid with what we mentioned in the divisions of diseases and your treatment is not effective, it should be cauterized according to this method.
Instruct the patient to place his head in your lap, and have a servant hold his head in your hands so that he does not move or shake his head.
Then place cotton soaked in egg white or in the saliva of a tortoise on his eyes, then heat the cautery which looks like this.
It should be hollow like the shape of a vulture feather on one end where the cautery is, and if you wish, the other end can be open, or it can be closed like a spindle, but this hollow one is better for your work, God willing.
Then squeeze the hemorrhoid if it is open and extract the pus, and dry it. If it is not open, then open it and extract its pus, then place the heated cautery on it while it is very hot, hold it with your hand until it reaches the bone.
Keep your hand slightly away from the eye towards the nose during cauterization so that your hand does not make a mistake or disturb the patient, causing the cautery to fall into the eyelid and damage it. If you reach the bone with the first application of cauterization, otherwise repeat the cautery if necessary.
Leave it for three days, then apply cotton with fat and treat it with a drying ointment until it heals. If forty days have passed and it has not healed, apply a sharp, corrosive medicine until the bone is exposed, and scrape it as will be mentioned in its section, God willing.
Another method for cauterizing the hernia mentioned by some early practitioners is to direct attention to the site of the hernia, cut it open, then place a thin tube into the incision. This is its shape.
Pour into it the amount of a drachm of molten lead, and hold the tube firmly with your hand without moving. The patient must not move at all so that the molten lead does not flow to his eye. It is advisable to place cotton soaked in egg white or water on the patient's eye.
For the lead burns the site of the hernia and cures it remarkably. If the hernia is cured by the cauterization and treatment mentioned, then there is no need for further action; otherwise, it is necessary to use nasal piercing and return the hernia to the nasal passage as will be detailed in the section specifically addressing this procedure.
Chapter Eighteen.
On cauterizing the cleft lip.
A cleft often occurs in the lip, called a fissure, especially in the lips of children, as it frequently happens. If you treat this cleft with the method mentioned in the division and the treatment is not effective, then heat a small scalpel cautery in this form.
Its interior should be thin like a knife. Then place it, while hot, quickly into the cleft until the cauterization reaches the depth of the fissure. Then treat it with kerotini until it heals, if God wills.
Chapter Nineteen.
On treating the abscess occurring in the mouth.
If a swelling appears at the root of the gums or in the palate or at the roots of the molars, then it hardens and bursts, and the pus that flows from it forms an abscess, and if you treat it but the treatment is ineffective, you should heat an iron to fit the size of the abscess.
Then, insert it while hot into the abscess hole and hold your hand until the iron reaches the depth of it. Do this once or twice, then treat it with the treatments we have mentioned until it heals, if God wills.
If the material is severed and it heals, well and good; otherwise, it is necessary to examine the area and remove the decayed bone as will be detailed in its respective section, if God wills.
Chapter Twenty.
On treating loose teeth and gums.
If the gums become loose due to moisture and the teeth move, and treating them with medications is ineffective, place the patient's head on your lap, then heat the iron, whose image will come after this, and place a tube on the tooth.
Insert the heated iron quickly into it and hold your hand for a moment until the patient feels the heat has reached the root of the tooth, then raise your hand. Repeat this with the iron as many times as you deem necessary, then have the patient rinse their mouth with salt water.
Hold it for an hour and then remove it. The loose tooth will become stable, the relaxed gums will tighten, and the harmful moisture will dry up.
Chapter Twenty-one.
On the Pain of the Tooth.
If the toothache is due to cold or there is decay in it and treatment with medicines has not been effective, then cauterization can be done in two ways: either by cauterization with fat or by cauterization with fire.
As for cauterization with fat, it involves taking buffalo fat, heating it in an iron spoon or shell, then wrapping cotton around the tip of a probe and dipping it in the heated fat. You then place it quickly on the painful tooth and hold it until it cools.
Then repeat this several times until the heat reaches the root of the tooth. If you prefer, you can dip a piece of wool or cotton in cold fat and place it on the painful tooth, then put a heated iron above it until the heat reaches the bottom of the tooth.
As for cauterization with fire, you should take a copper or iron tube that is somewhat thick to prevent the heat of the fire from reaching the patient's mouth. Then heat the cautery tool, whose image is provided, and place it directly on the tooth. Hold it until the cautery tool cools down. Repeat this several times.
The pain will be gone either that same day or the next day. After the cauterization, the patient should fill their mouth with good fat, hold it for a while, and then spit it out. This is the image of the cautery tool.
Cauterize with whichever end you prefer and to the extent possible. This is the image of the tube.
Chapter Twenty-two.
On castrating pigs.
If the pigs suffer from phlegm and cold humidities and do not mature with medicines, and you want quick maturity, heat the hollow iron, which has its ends perforated as shown in this figure.
So that the smoke comes out from the other end when cauterizing, place it heated on the same swelling once and twice if needed until you reach the depth of the swelling. If the swelling is small, make the iron according to the size of the swelling.
Then leave it for three days and apply cotton soaked in butter until the burned part is healed, then treat it with ointment and poultices until it heals, if God wills.
Chapter Twenty-three.
On cauterization for hoarseness of voice and shortness of breath.
If humidities overwhelm the windpipe, especially if this is accompanied by a cold temperament, it is advisable to first purge the patient with laxative medicines, then cauterize him at the notch of the neck near the base of the pharynx in the lower area.
Be careful not to reach the pharynx with the cauterization and do not burn more than half of the skin, then cauterize another spot at the joint of the neck at the last prominent vertebra. The cautery iron should be awl-shaped as previously described.
Then treat it with what was previously mentioned until it heals, if God wills.
Chapter Twenty-Four.
On Treating Lung Disease and Cough.
If the cough and lung disease are due to cold moisture and there is no fever or consumption in the patient, and the disease is chronic, then apply two poultices above the collarbones in the low, soft, empty areas, and another poultice in the center of the chest between the breasts.
The poultice should be nail-shaped as previously described. If you prefer, your treatment may be by dripping with a poultice called the "dropper," whose form was previously described in treating ear pain, and the number of drips should be around thirty or so.
Then treat it with what was previously mentioned until it heals. You may also make a poultice with three prongs in this shape, and use it for quick cauterization because you can apply three cauteries at once with it. This is the shape of the poultice.
Chapter Twenty-Five.
On Cauterizing the Armpit.
If the head of the humerus dislocates due to slippery moisture or if it does not stay in place when reduced, making dislocation a habitual occurrence that happens with the slightest movement as we have observed, then the first thing to do is to reduce the joint. Then the patient should lie on their back or on the correct side. Then raise the skin inside the armpit upwards with the fingers of your left hand if the joint dislocated inward.
Then heat the iron with two handles which looks like this.
Then iron the skin until it penetrates to the other side and the shape of the ironing becomes four irons, and sometimes it is ironed with an iron having three points then the shape of the ironing becomes six irons and the points are according to the thinness of the material.
And this is the image of the iron with three points.
And one may be added to this number so the irons become eight, then apply the balls ground with salt to the ironing, and the patient must rest without moving the limb for a time until it strengthens, and if the dislocation is upwards, which rarely happens.
So iron above the shoulder one strong nail-shaped iron or many dotted irons, for the joint will strengthen, moisture will disappear, and the patient will heal.
Chapter Twenty-Six.
On ironing the stomach.
If cold and excessive moisture occur in the stomach, causing it to deviate from its temperament and increasing the secretions, and if various treatments have been ineffective, then the patient should lie on his back, extend his legs and arms, and be ironed with three irons. One iron under the nipple, the size of a finger, with a nail-shaped iron, and two irons below on both sides of the single iron so that the shape of the irons forms a triangle, keeping them apart to prevent them from meeting if they discharge, and the depth of the ironing should be two-thirds the thickness of the skin, and this is the shape of the irons.
In this manner and to this extent, no more.
And if you want, make one large branding in the middle of the stomach as follows.
The iron used for this single branding should be circular in shape as follows.
The stomach may be branded with dots for those who fear this branding. This is done by marking the stomach with dots using ink to the extent you desire, then branding it with a dotted iron, and then treating it with the previously mentioned treatment until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Seven.
On branding the cold liver.
If pain in the liver is due to cold and moisture or to a heated vapor such that it has departed from its natural temperament excessively, and if the patient has been treated with what we mentioned in the division but this was ineffective. It is advisable that the patient lie on their back, and three brandings should be marked with ink in this shape and exactly this quantity on the liver, below the ribs where the arm of a person ends.
There should be the thickness of a finger between each branding, and the branding should be along the length of the body in a straight line. Do not press your hand too tightly on the iron.
The heat should be such that it burns only half the thickness of the skin, no more. The patient should stand on their feet; if they cannot stand, they should lie down with their legs extended and arms raised. This is the shape of the iron.
You can cauterize these burns with a knife-shaped iron if you have the skill and caution to do so, taking care not to over-cauterize and thus burn all of the skin, which could lead to burning the abdomen and reaching the intestines, as the skin there is thin; be aware of this.
Chapter Twenty-Eight.
On cauterizing the swelling of the liver.
If there is an abscess in the liver and you want to determine whether the swelling is in the liver's flesh or its membrane, know that if it is in the liver's flesh, the patient will feel a heavy pain without sharpness.
If it is in the liver's membrane, there will be a sharp severe pain. I have observed that physicians find its treatment challenging. The patient should lie on their back, and then you should apply a poultice to the swollen area.
Then heat the iron in the fire, which is the iron that resembles a chisel, and this is its shape. Cauterize it once with it until you burn all the skin and continue cauterizing until you reach the membrane, causing all the pus to come out. Then treat it as you would an abscess until it heals.
This type of cauterization should only be performed by someone who has long practiced medicine and has extensively treated these diseases through experience. In that case, they may undertake such a procedure, though I consider leaving it to them the best option.
Chapter Twenty-Nine.
On stitching the wound.
The early ones mentioned cauterization with the roots of the zeraunud for a cold wound in this manner: take one root from the dry long zeraunud roots, as long as you can find, and it should be as thick as a finger. Then dip it in oil and ignite it in fire. Then cauterize with one large cautery between the connection of the clavicle and the neck, two small cauteries slightly below the carotid arteries, leaning towards the side under the beard, and two large cauteries above the breasts, between the third and fourth ribs.
Two more cauteries between the fifth and sixth ribs, leaning slightly backward. Another cautery in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach. Three cauteries from behind: one between the shoulders, and two beside the spine below the cautery that is between the palms.
You should not plunge your hand deep with the cautery but it should be on the surface of the skin slightly. Some of the early ones mentioned that some people used an iron cautery resembling a nail, heating it and inserting it between the ribs until it reaches the swelling itself.
The fluid is discharged as we mentioned in the swelling of the liver. With this cautery in the belly, there is a risk that either the patient may die immediately or an Fistula may develop in the area which cannot be cured.
Chapter Thirty.
On cauterizing the spleen.
If you treat the spleen disease with the treatments we mentioned in the division and your treatment is not effective, then cauterization can be done in three ways, all of which are correct. One of them is to cauterize it with three or four cauteries arranged along the length of the spleen.
In the form of liver cauterizations which are presented in their shape, and there should be between each cauterization the thickness of a finger or slightly more. The quality of the cautery is as we mentioned for liver cauterization, and you should not deepen too much with the cautery. The patient is laid on his back.
And the other side is in the elbow, lift the skin opposite the spleen where the patient's left elbow ends, and lifting the skin should be across the body so that the cauterizations fall along the length of the body.
Then insert the two probes very carefully until they penetrate the skin on the other side, then remove the cautery so that there are four cauterizations. If you wish, you can use the other cautery with three probes.
Then treat the cauterized area after allowing it to discharge pus for many days, as this is more effective than all the previous treatments mentioned.
Chapter Thirty-One.
On the cauterization for dropsy.
Cauterization is only beneficial for dropsy of the dry type, specifically. If you have treated the patient with various treatments as mentioned in the classification and your treatment has not been effective, it is advisable to perform four cauterizations around the navel and one cauterization on the stomach.
Another cauterization on the liver, one on the spleen, two behind his back between the ribs, one opposite his chest, and another opposite his stomach. The depth of the cauterization should be close to the thickness of the skin. Then leave the cauterized area open to discharge pus for a long time.
Do not abandon the patient from treatment after cauterization with what is appropriate, as it combines both meanings and speeds up recovery. The shape of the iron used for cauterizing the back should be nail-shaped as previously described, and that used for the back should be olive-shaped.
Chapter Thirty-Two.
On Cauterizing the Feet and Legs.
If they swell in the case of dropsy and are filled with yellow water, it is appropriate to cauterize on the back of the foot between the little toe and the fourth toe.
Hold the cauterizing iron with your hand and do not bend it, then raise your hand and do not return it at all, for the yellow water will drain. The cauterizing iron should be in this shape.
Then cauterize both legs, twice on each leg. The cauterization should be done with the blade-like end of the iron, along the length of the leg—once below the knee and another lower towards the middle of the leg. On each thigh, do two cauterizations as well.
Leave the cauterization open without treatment for a long time, allowing the water to drain from it. Then treat it with all the methods we have mentioned.
Chapter Thirty-Three.
On Cauterizing Diarrhea.
If the diarrhea is caused by cold and moisture, weakening the digestive and binding powers in the stomach and intestines, and if it has not been cured with various treatments, and you see that the patient can tolerate cauterization and is strong enough, then cauterize them with a large cauterization on their stomach. As mentioned previously regarding ironing the stomach with a circular iron and four ironings around the navel, gently use the fine nail iron and apply one ironing on cotton above the anus, either large or two.
If you see that the moistures are abundant and the patient can tolerate that, then apply one ironing on the pubic area, one on each side of the waist, and sometimes add two small ironings on the stomach near the large one. Indeed, this is a successful treatment whose benefit does not fail, if God wills.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
On ironing hemorrhoids of the anus.
If there are chronic hemorrhoids, whether many or one, and they are of thick cold mixtures or corrupted moistures, and have been treated with what we mentioned in the division but the treatment was ineffective, then apply three ironings to the patient below the sacral vertebrae slightly under the crease, in a triangular shape.
Apply one ironing below the navel, about two fingers wide. If you determine that his stomach has become cold and his food is not digesting, and you see his face swollen, then apply a large ironing on his stomach as previously mentioned, and one on his liver. Apply another one on his spleen with a nail iron, and leave the ironing open for a while, then treat him until he recovers, if God wills.
Chapter Thirty-Five.
On ironing warts.
After cutting it, if the wart is cut off, heat the iron that resembles a mill, then insert it hot into the very center of the cut wart and push your hand until the iron reaches the mouth of the vein from which the blood flows. Do this once or twice.
If the warts are numerous, cauterize each one as described, then treat them with appropriate ointments until they heal. Cauterizing them again over cotton can be more beneficial.
Chapter Thirty-Six.
On cauterizing the fistula that occurs in the anus and its surrounding areas.
If the patient does not respond to incision and the procedure we described in its place and is reluctant to do so, it may heal by cauterization. If one develops a fistula and pus and corrupt moisture flow from it over time, the first thing you should do is measure it with a thin probe.
Then determine its depth with the probe. Heat the iron that resembles a mill, then insert it hot into the fistula straight to the depth where the probe entered. Repeat the cauterization until all the corrupt substances are burned, once or twice or three times as needed.
Be careful not to burn a nerve if there is one, or a major vein. If the fistula leads to the bladder or the intestines, be cautious.
Be careful with all these areas. You should do this if the fistula is in a fleshy area and you determine that it is not penetrable. Then treat the area until it heals. If the area seals and the discharge stops and remains so for a period of time, know that it has healed completely.
And if the materials do not cease from it, know that it is penetrable or there is rotten bone in its depth or something like what will be mentioned in its place.
Chapter Thirty-Seven.
On the Treatment of the Kidneys.
If pain occurs in the kidney due to cold or heavy wind and the patient's sexual function is impaired because of that, it should be cauterized on both sides directly on each kidney with a nail cautery as previously mentioned. Sometimes it may be cauterized a third time on the same day, so there are three cauterizations in a row, which is more beneficial.
Chapter Thirty-Eight.
On the Cauterization of the Bladder.
If weakness and relaxation occur in the bladder due to cold and humidity, causing the patient to be unable to retain urine, cauterize it with a cautery below the navel on the bladder where pubic hair begins, and another cautery to the right of the navel and another to the left.
The cautery should be applied on each side to the width of a thumb joint, and it should be cauterized with one cautery below the lower back or two if necessary, using a nail cautery as previously mentioned.
Chapter Thirty-Nine.
On the Cauterization of the Womb.
If cold and humidity cause a condition in the womb that prevents pregnancy, impair its function, or cause pain upon menstruation, it should be cauterized with three cauteries around the navel as mentioned in the cauterization of the bladder. Sealing with pitch on the cotton under the back or two sealings and the iron should be nail-shaped.
Chapter Forty.
On how to dislocate the hip.
Moisture errors may affect the hip joint, causing it to dislocate from its position. Its sign is that one leg appears longer than the other when comparing them, and you will find an empty space where the dislocation occurred. It should be treated by applying a circular-like branding directly on the affected hip area.
After marking with ink around the joint, as it circles, to place the center of the circle on the joint itself. The iron used should be similar to the one shown for branding the stomach. If you do not have this iron, use the large olive-shaped iron to brand three times.
Make the branding deep according to the thickness of the entire skin, then treat it until it heals, if God wills.
Chapter Forty-One.
On branding for sciatica.
If pain occurs in the hip joint and this is caused by cold and moisture, and if the treatment mentioned in the division has not been effective and the condition persists, it should be treated with laxatives such as black seed or senna seeds, or similar remedies.
Then brand it, and there are two methods of branding: either branding with cauterizing medicines or branding with fire. Branding with fire can be done in various ways, one of which is to brand three triangular burns directly on the hip joint itself, like this.
It becomes of suitable depth, and there should be between each cauterization the thickness of a finger. The cautery iron is olive-shaped; sometimes one cauterization is made in the middle at the hipbone itself. There are thus four cauterizations, or if you wish, use the circle previously described for dislocated hip, with a single cauterization.
To have the circle surround all of the hip and burn through the thickness of the skin entirely. This is the description of the cauterization for sciatica if the pain is confined to the hip itself and does not extend to the thigh and leg.
If it extends to the thigh and leg, cauterize with two cauterizations on the thigh in the place where the patient indicates the pain is felt, and one cauterization above the ankle by four fingers towards the outer side slightly. The cautery iron should be knife-shaped, and the depth of the cauterization should be only as thick as the skin.
If he indicates that the pain extends toward the toes, cauterize where he points with a pinpoint cautery iron three or four times, or more if needed. If he indicates the pain is below the knee towards the leg, cauterize there once with a knife-shaped cautery iron.
Be cautious in all your cauterizations to not burn a nerve or a major artery, as this could cause a severe or permanent injury to the patient.
I have seen cases where cauterization above the ankle was excessive, leading to gangrene in the leg that spread to the foot, causing it to become ulcerated and resulting in the corruption of the entire limb, followed by diarrhea and death. If the pain is on both sides, cauterize them in the same manner described.
Some of the wise scholars have mentioned in hip cauterization, its description is as follows: a vessel-like object is made from iron, its diameter being half a shibr, and at its mouth it is thick like a date pit or slightly less. Inside this vessel there is another vessel and a third one.
And there should be the width of a thumb joint between each vessel. The vessels are open on both sides and their height is about one or two joints. A handle made of iron, firmly attached to the vessels, is prepared for them and this is its form.
Then it is heated in the fire until it turns red and spits sparks. It is then placed on the hip of the patient who lies on his healthy side, and it cauterizes it with three circular burns at once. Then it leaves it for three days and bandages it with fat, leaving the wound open for some days.
Then treat it with ointment until it heals. The author of this book says: We rarely use this type of cauterization due to its ugliness and the terror of its appearance, and because few can tolerate it. However, it is a good form of cauterization for those who can endure it and apply it correctly.
As for cauterization with burning medicines, it involves making two vessels like rings into which the tip of the penis can fit, made of brass or iron.
There should be a height of about two joints or so around them, and the distance between them should be the thickness of a finger. They should be open at both the bottom and the top, and they should be held together in this manner.
Then place it on the true hip with the patient lying on his healthy side, and firmly grasp with your hand. Then pour between the two circles some sharp water that has been warmed by fire slightly and let it stay for about an hour; the patient should endure its stinging and burning, for he will feel a sting like fire.
Until the stinging subsides, then raise your hand with the instrument and wash all the hip with fresh water, then leave it for three days and apply fat to it until the blackness of the burn disappears. Leave it for some days until pus flows from it, for this is more beneficial.
Then treat it with ointments until it heals. If the pain extends to the thigh or leg, make a compress for him in what holds water according to how you made for the hip equally. This is the description of sharp water and I have confirmed it in the article on drug preparation.
Take equal parts of calcined salt and unslaked lime, crush them, and place them in a new pot that has one small hole at the bottom, just large enough for the mercury to enter. Place another glass pot underneath the bottom of the pot.
Then pour fresh water over the calcined salt and lime until it covers them by a finger's depth after you have firmly pressed them with your hand. Leave the pot until the sharp water drips into the bottom glass pot. Then collect all of that water and pour it over another batch of lime and calcined salt, also renewed.
It is then extremely sharp and can be used for many medical procedures and for cauterizing other body parts, as it acts like fire itself. Some medications are also used to cauterize the hip, such as turpeth mineral, balador honey, lime with soap, all pounded together.
Galen reported a story about an ancient man's treatment for hip pain and sciatica, greatly exaggerating its importance, claiming that it does not require any other treatment and that it cures in one go.
To the extent that he might enter the bath carried and come out healed. This is by taking green mercury, and if green is not available, then take fresh dry [mercury] and finely grind it with some fat, then apply it to the hip where the pain is, or on the leg, or on the thigh.
It is tightened and left for about three hours or until the patient feels that the burning has subsided. Then, he enters the bath; if his body sweats, then he is placed in the pool. The pain will go away and he will be healed by the will of God. If he is not healed, then repeat the poultice again after ten days.
For he will be healed if God wills. Know that one should not use cauterization with these medications unless the body is first purged. Dioscorides mentioned that goat dander, if used for cauterizing sciatica, is beneficial.
The cauterization should be done in this manner: take some wool, soak it in old oil, and place it on the deep area between the thumb and the wrist, which is closer to the wrist. Then, take dry goat dander.
Ignite it with fire until it becomes a ember, then place it on the wool and leave it until it extinguishes. Then take another one and continue doing this until the sensation reaches the middle of the arm to the hip, and the pain subsides by the will of God. This type of cauterization is called dander cauterization.
Chapter Forty-Two.
On treating back pain.
Pain in the back may result from various causes, such as a fall, a blow, excessive vomiting, and the like. It is due to the accumulation of cold and moist matter, and cauterization is only applied in this category alone.
When the pain is due to the accumulation of cold matter, after the patient vomits with the use of aromatic seeds and the like, cauterization should be performed on his back where the pain is located, in three rows across the width of the area itself. Mark the location with ink first, then perform five or more cauteries in each row, depending on what you judge to be within the patient's tolerance and strength.
Cauterization should be done with a point cauterizer. If you prefer, you can perform three or four cauteries with a medium-sized two-pronged cauterizer in this manner.
Chapter Fifty-Three.
On cauterizing the initial stages of hunchback.
This condition often affects small children. A sign of its initial onset in a child is difficulty breathing when standing and moving, and you may find a protruding vertebra at the end of their spine that stands out from the other vertebrae.
If you see this and wish to prevent it, cauterize it with a circular cautery in this manner. Apply the cautery evenly on each side of the vertebra. If you prefer, cauterize around the vertebra in two or three rows with a point cauterizer, making sure the points are close to each other. Then treat the area until it heals as previously mentioned.
And it is important not to use cauterization on the hump that results from nerve spasm.
Chapter Forty-Four.
On Cauterizing Gout and Joint Pains.
If the joint pains are due to cold moistures that settle in any part of the body, and if the pains occur in the legs, it is customary for physicians to call this gout, particularly.
If cold gout is treated with the various treatments we mentioned in the classification and the pains do not subside, then cauterization can alleviate them. This involves cauterizing around the joints of the legs after purging, with many cautery points. The cautery tool should be olive-shaped and medium-sized, as follows.
And if you need to apply cauterization to the foot, do so with a point cautery. If the pains rise to the knees or other joints, which often occurs, cauterize each knee with three or four cautery points on each side using the same olive-shaped cautery tool.
If more cauterization is needed, do so without deepening the cautery beyond the thickness of the skin. If the pains rise to the hips or back, apply the cauterization as we have described in the appropriate section.
If the pains are only in the hands, apply point cautery around the wrists in two rows. If the pain remains in the fingers, apply a point cautery on each joint and on the palm. If the pains rise to the elbows or shoulders after a few days.
Treat both from every side and do not let the patient lack good care and taking of medicines, for if he improves his diet and expels phlegm, then he will be cured with this cauterization, God willing.
Chapter Forty-Five.
On cauterizing fistulas.
If a hernia appears in the groin and part of the intestine and its contents descend to the testicle, and this is newly occurred and close by, it is advisable to order the patient to abstain from food for a day and to use laxatives that will expel stool from his body.
Then he should lie down in front of you on his back, and you order him to hold himself until the contents or the intestine protrude, then you push it back with your finger. Then mark with ink under the hernia on the pubic bone a sign resembling a semicircle, its ends toward the upper part of the body.
Then heat an iron that looks like this.
Until it comes white and throws sparks, then push the intestine or contents back into his body. Then have a servant place his hand on the area to prevent the intestine from protruding. The patient's legs are spread apart, and a pillow is placed under him. Another servant ties around his legs.
Another person holds his hands by placing themselves on his chest. Then lower the iron onto the same mark and press with the iron standing straight, holding it until it reaches the bone, or repeat once more if it did not reach the bone the first time.
You must protect your effort from the protrusion of the intestine while cauterizing so as not to burn it, which could result in either the death or a great disability of the patient. Know that if you do not reach the bone with the cauterization, your work will not succeed. The cautery for children should be delicate according to their size and for adults according to their size.
Then treat the cauterized area after three days with fat until the dryness from the fire disappears, then treat it with ointments until it heals. Let the patient lie on their back for forty days until the wound is sealed.
You should make his diet during the treatment such that it softens his stomach so as not to protrude the intestine when straining or defecating. Then, if he wishes to get up after forty days, use a firm bandage and keep it on for another forty days. He should reduce exertion, overeating and drinking, and loud shouting.
For if this procedure is followed, he will be completely healed, God willing. I will discuss the treatment of hernias by incision in its own section, God willing. As for a hernia that occurs elsewhere in the abdomen and is new, if you wish to prevent it from growing larger, cauterize the area with a circular cautery according to its size. Let what you burn of the skin be about two-thirds, then treat it as we have mentioned, for it will not increase, God willing. Some early practitioners have suggested cauterizing the hernia with a triangular cautery in this manner.
After you mark the hernia with ink, make a line across at the top of the hernia and another line below it. Insert your hand in the middle and use a single nail-shaped cautery. The first method of cauterization is easier and better, God willing.
Chapter Forty-Six.
On Cauterizing Ulcers.
If pain occurs in some organs due to a fall or blow and the pain persists for a long time and treatment with medicines is ineffective, it should be cauterized with a point cautery. The cauterization of each organ should be according to its size, strength, and weakness.
If the pain and ulcer persist, then if it heals from the first cauterization, well and good; otherwise, you should repeat the cautery. For these pains usually move from one organ to a neighboring one, so you should follow them with cautery until the patient is healed.
Chapter Forty-Seven.
On Cauterizing Leprosy.
As for lepers, they may greatly benefit from cautery, especially those with leprosy caused by the corruption of phlegm and black bile.
When you wish to cauterize it, if the leprosy is in its early stages and treatment with what was mentioned in the classification has not succeeded and you fear that corruption may take over the patient's entire constitution, then cauterize him on the head with five cautery applications. One in the center of the known head, the second below it toward the forehead at the end of the hair, two on the temples, and one behind on the occipital protuberance. Insert your hand slightly with the cautery so that it affects the bone a little.
And remove its scales to facilitate the breathing out of thick vapors from it and cauterize it like the spleen as previously mentioned. And if leprosy has persisted in the patient and clearly appeared, then these types of cauterization which we mentioned for the head should be applied. Cauterization at the tip of the nose, two cauterizations on the cheeks, two on the cervical vertebrae, six on the dorsal vertebrae, one large one on the coccyx at the end of the tailbone, another above it on the same plate, and two on the hips, one on each hip. Two on the knees, one on each knee, two on the shoulders, two on the elbows, two on the ribs of the chest, cauterization on every joint of his fingers and toes one cauterization, and on each heel and wrist of his hands.
And be careful of the nerve at the back of the heels so as not to burn them. Cauterization may also be done on the pubic bone, another on the mouth of the stomach, and another on the liver. Know that the more you increase cauterization, the more beneficial and effective it is.
And know that the patient does not feel pain from cauterization as a healthy person would, because his body has become numb. The size of the cautery should be adjusted according to the parts and joints, as previously described for the characteristics of the instruments.
Then treat the cauterization with crushed almond flour mixed with honey and other treatments until it heals, if God wills.
Chapter Forty-Eight.
In cauterizing numbness, when a body part becomes numb and is treated with medicines, ointments, and dressings but does not heal, then cauterize the numbed body part itself according to whether the part is large or small, and let your cauterization be somewhat deeper in the thickness of the skin.
Then treat it with ointment until it heals. Cauterization may also be applied to some forms of numbness that affect the hands and feet due to issues in the vertebrae where the nerves that move that body part emerge, which can eliminate the numbness.
None but those who are knowledgeable about the anatomy of body parts and the emergence points of the nerves that move the body should undertake this.
Chapter Forty-Nine.
On cauterizing leprosy.
If leprosy persists and no medical treatment is effective, then apply cauterization to it with a slight depth according to the thickness of the skin until the whiteness disappears and its color changes.
Then treat it with ground lentils mixed with rose oil, mint leaves, and pigeon blood or the blood of doves, using an equal part of each. Mix everything together and apply it to a cloth, which should be kept on the affected area until it heals.
Chapter Fifty.
On cauterizing cancer.
If the cancer is in its early stages and you want to stop its progression, cauterize around it in a circular motion with a circular cauterizer. Some wise men have mentioned that a deep cauterization should be applied to its center, but I do not agree with this because I expect it may cause ulceration, which I have observed on several occasions.
The correct thing is to cauterize around it in a circle as we said or with many cautery points.
Chapter Fifty-One.
On cauterizing the hernia.
If a hernia occurs in someone and it delays in maturing, either due to the influential excess causing it, or because of the age of the patient if he is an old person with little blood, or due to time, and you want to hasten the maturity of the hernia, then cauterize around it with many small cautery points drop by drop.
Then leave it, for it will hasten to mature. If you want to cauterize its base, heat the cautery instrument which has this shape.
And place it in the center of the hernia until it penetrates the skin. Let the cautery be on the lower part to facilitate the flow of pus. Then treat it as appropriate until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-Two.
On cauterizing the ulcer.
An ulcer is corruption that spreads in the organ, consuming it like fire consumes dry wood. If you see an ulcer in a place that can tolerate cauterization with fire, heat many nail-like cautery instruments, small and large, according to what is suitable for the location of the ulcer.
Then cauterize it from all sides until all the corruption is completely removed and nothing remains of it at all. Then leave it for three days, and apply powdered sulfur with oil to the cauterized areas until all the scab and all the corruption fall off entirely.
Then treat it with poultices that promote flesh growth. If you see after three days that the flesh grows properly without any corruption, otherwise repeat cauterization on the remaining corrupted areas. The corroded area can be treated with sharp medicine.
For it serves as a substitute for fire with quicker benefit. I have mentioned its treatment with sharp medicine in the division, so take it from there whenever you need it.
Chapter Fifty-Three.
On the cauterization of reversed and non-reversed nails.
This condition often occurs on the soles of the feet, and it is a rough thing that bothers the person. Cauterization in this case can be done in two ways: either by fire cauterization or by cauterization with sharp water.
As for cauterization by fire, it involves heating a hollow iron tool similar to an eagle's feather. The tool should be made of iron and sized to fit around the nail on all sides, with a thin edge. Then, place the heated tool directly over the nail and rotate your hand with the tool around the nail until the tool reaches the depth of the nail.
Leave it for three days to pus, then dress it with crushed wild barley mixed with salt and leave the dressing on it overnight, as it will remove it from its roots. Then treat the wound site with a flesh-growing ointment until it heals. If the nails are not reversed.
And this often occurs on the surface of the body, especially in the hands and legs. You should take a tube made of copper or iron or similar to an eagle's feather, place it over the nail or wart, then pour a small amount of sharp water into the tube.
Hold your hand as you turn it with a slight twitch of your hand so that the edge of the tube affects the base of the nail, and the sharp water finds its way to penetrate to the base of the nail, and the patient endures the sting of the sharp water for a moment.
Then leave it, for the nail will be extracted with its root. Do this one by one until you have treated all of them in the body. Then treat the areas after extraction with ointments that promote flesh growth.
Chapter Fifty-Four.
On cauterizing the nasal polyps.
If one develops nasal polyps due to cold in the nerve or from quartan fever or otherwise, it is advisable to cauterize them four or five times between the vertebrae, with a cautery at each vertebra, and a cautery on his chest. And on his stomach, apply a cautery with an olive-shaped iron, for the nasal polyps will subside and hasten the maturation of the cold disease.
Chapter Fifty-Five.
On cauterizing boils that occur on the body.
Boils may appear on the body, formed from cold, thick, putrid materials. When they first appear, each boil should be cauterized gently at its top with a heated cautery, such as a lit end of an iron rod, or the long root of zeraunjan (a type of metal), or with a lentil-shaped cautery iron.
And the abscesses may be cauterized at the beginning of their outbreak in this manner, so they do not increase and the effective excess dissipates, and the sick person recovers from it, except that this should be after the sick person has been purged by venesection.
Chapter Fifty-Six.
On cauterizing bleeding occurring from cutting an artery.
Bleeding of blood often occurs from a severed artery in an external wound or when incising a tumor or cauterizing an organ and the like, making it difficult to cut it.
If this happens to someone, quickly put your index finger on the mouth of the artery and hold it tightly until the blood is contained under your finger and nothing comes out. Then place several small and large olive cauters in the fire and blow on them until they become very hot.
Then take one, either small or large, depending on the wound and the place where the artery was severed. Place the cauterization tool directly on the vein after quickly removing your finger and hold it until the bleeding stops.
If the blood gushes out when you remove your finger from the mouth of the artery and extinguishes the cauterization tool, quickly take another one from those in the prepared fire. Continue doing this with one after another until the bleeding stops.
Be cautious not to burn a nerve, which could cause another disability in the patient. Know that if blood is bleeding from an artery, it cannot be cut, especially if the artery is large, except by one of four methods: either by cauterization as we said, or by amputation if it has not already separated. For if it is amputated, its ends will contract and the blood flow will cease. It can be tied tightly with threads, or medicines that stop the bleeding and tighten with bandages can be applied firmly.
As for those who attempt to cut it with a ligature or by tightening with cloth or placing cauterizing substances and the like, it will not be severed at all except rarely. If such a thing occurs to someone and there is no doctor or medicine available, they should immediately place the index finger on the mouth of the wound itself as we have described.
It should be tightened greatly until the blood is constricted and flows out above the wound and on the artery. The finger should not be removed, always keeping it cool with very cold water until the blood freezes, thickens, and stops. During this time, assess what cautery or medicine might be needed.
The Second Chapter.
On Incisions, Punctures, Lancing, Surgical Operations, and the Like.
Khalef said, we have mentioned in the first chapter every disease that can be treated with cauterization by fire and burning medicines, their causes, reasons, instruments, and forms of cautery tools. I have arranged this from head to foot in sections.
And I will follow the same approach in this chapter to make it easier for the student to understand what is required.
Before I begin, you should know, my sons, that this chapter contains more risks than what is in the first chapter on cauterization.
And for that reason, the warning should be stronger because the work in this field often results in excessive bleeding which sustains life when opening a vein or incising a swelling or lancing an abscess or treating surgery or extracting an arrow or incising on a stone and other similar procedures which all accompany risk and fear and often result in death.
And I advise you to avoid what is doubtful for you, for various kinds of people with different diseases may come to you in this profession. Some of them may be weary from their illness and may have given up hope, considering death lightly.
Due to the severity of his illness and the prolongation of his suffering, there are signs of impending death in his disease. Some may spend all their wealth on you, hoping for health, but their illness is relentless. Therefore, you should not be influenced by those who come to you with such characteristics at all.
Let your caution be greater than your desire and eagerness, and do not proceed with anything unless you have certain knowledge that is valid to you regarding the desirable outcome. Use your knowledge and warn in all treatments of your patients about what leads to safety.
For in that, you will find support in acquiring praise, glory, remembrance, and commendation. May God guide you to wisdom, O my sons, and not deprive you of the right and success. Indeed, that is in His hand; there is no god but He.
I have arranged this chapter in sections following what was mentioned earlier in the chapter on cauterization, from the ankle to the foot, to make it easier for you to find what you need from it, if God wills.
The first chapter.
On the treatment of water that accumulates in the heads of children.
This disease often affects children at birth if the midwife presses the child's head without gentleness, and it may also result from a hidden illness that is not known.
I have not seen this illness in anyone other than children, and all of those I have seen from them died quickly, which is why I decided to avoid treating it. I have indeed seen a child whose head was filled with water, and the head grew larger each day. Until the child could not even sit up due to the enlargement of his head, and the moisture increased until he perished.
This moisture either accumulates between the skin and the bone or beneath the bone on the pericranium. The procedure for this is as follows: if the moisture is between the skin and the bone and the swelling is small, it should be incised with a single transverse cut in the middle of the head, with the length of the cut about two inches so that the moisture can drain. This is the image of the surgical instrument.
If the moisture is more and the swelling is larger, make two intersecting incisions in this manner:.
If the moisture is beneath the bone, its sign is that you will see the sutures of the head open on all sides, and the water will sink when you press it with your hand; this should not be hidden from you. You should make three incisions in the middle of the head in this manner:.
After the incision, all the moisture should be drained out. Then, the incisions should be sutured and bandaged. For the first five days, they should be treated from above with poultices and oil. Afterward, the bindings are removed and the wound is treated with lint and ointments. Do not neglect to moderately bind the head, and nourish the patient with dry food that is low in moisture.
Until the organ is strengthened and healed, another method of incision is to look where the bone of the swelling and gathering of water appears because it may be more at the back of the head or in the front or on the right or on the left.
Aim the incision where the swelling and accumulation of water appear, make the incision as much as you can, but be careful not to cut an artery, causing bleeding that could lead to the patient's death along with the discharge of moisture.
The second chapter.
Cut the two arteries located behind the ears, which are known as the carotid arteries.
When one is afflicted with severe attacks to the eyes or the chest, and this persists without improvement from medication, the most effective treatment is to cut these two arteries.
If you intend to cut them, you should shave the patient's head with a razor, then rub the area with a coarse cloth so that the artery becomes visible. Then secure the patient’s neck with their garment. Look where the pulse beats; they are located in the two lower areas behind the ears, and they are rarely hidden except in some people.
Then mark them with ink and cut them with a sharp scalpel down to the bone. This should be done across the head. If you wish, insert the scalpel under the artery and lift it upwards by cutting. The length of the cut should be about two closed fingers.
If the pulse is cut, blood will gush out in a pulsating manner, spurting forward continuously. If the artery cannot be felt, you should measure about three finger-widths from the ear, mark with ink, and incise down to the bone. What should be done is to.
Six ounces of blood should be let moderately, and sometimes more or less may be let, all depending on the strength of the patient and the fullness of his arteries. Then look at the wound; if there is any laudable pus remaining on the bone, cut it off.
To prevent a hot swelling, then bind the wound with a wick of linen cloth, then treat it with ointments until it heals.
Chapter Three.
On cauterizing the arteries located in the cheeks.
If a person suffers from chronic migraines or acute attacks caused by sharp humidities and heat in the cheek muscles, or severe chronic headaches and the like, and has been treated with various medical treatments to no avail, we have tried cauterizing or sealing the arteries in the cheeks for these diseases as described.
The method of cauterization involves shaving the hair from the cheeks of the patient and locating the visible artery in the cheek, as it can be identified by its pulse. It is rarely hidden except in a few individuals.
Or, in extreme cold, if it is hidden from you, let the patient tighten his neck with a fold of his garment, then rub the area with a cloth or compress the area with hot water until the artery becomes clearly visible. Then take the scalpel, which is depicted as follows. Then, gently cut the skin with it until you reach the artery. Then insert a forceps and pull it upwards until you extract it from the skin and free it from the surrounding adhesions on all sides. If the artery is thin, you can twist it with the tip of the forceps. Then a part of it is cut according to the distance between its ends and it contracts, and no bleeding occurs. For if it is not amputated and does not break, the blood will not clot at all. Then drain the blood from six ounces to three.
If the artery is large, it should be tied in two places with a strong double thread, and let the thread be either from abriresm or from the tendons of the bow so that rot does not set in quickly before the wound heals and causes bleeding.
Then, cut the excess between the ties. Do this at that time or another later. If you wish, cauterize it to the bone with a knife cauterizer until its ends are severed; it will perform the same function or even better as we have said.
Unless the patient has a fever or an inflamed temperament, for cauterization is one of the things that help in consuming moistures and thus is more beneficial. After extracting the arteries, the area should be filled with old cotton, and well-packed bandages should be placed on it. After removal, it should be treated with drying medicines that promote flesh growth and with bandaging until it heals, if God wills.
If bleeding occurs from the artery during your work, immediately cut it either by cauterization or fill the area with pitch and hold tightly until the bleeding stops. If you do not have any of these, place your finger until the blood clots.
Cool the area with very cold water until the intensity subsides and secure it as needed. What is lighter and easier than extracting the artery is to cauterize the vein with this two-bladed cauterizer after marking the areas with ink.
And let it be very hot until it reaches the bone and sweat stops in two places so that the distance between its ends increases, for it will not heal with this cauterization at all. This is the image of the cautery iron.
The two knives are sharp, resembling small tips, except they are much less sharp than a knife because if they were as sharp as a knife, they would cool down faster and the flesh would not be cut quickly. If there is some thickness in them, the heat of the fire will adhere to them.
And cut the flesh quickly, and this method is better than all others, being lighter and easier. Let the distance between the two knives be the thickness of a finger.
Chapter Four.
On the treatment of persistent hot tearing to the eyes.
If the tears are constant and their flow is from the veins on the outside of the skull, and if no treatment with medical drugs has been beneficial, and you see that the patient's face has reddened. And he feels a crawling sensation on his forehead like the crawling of ants, and his eyes are weak and moist, with his eyelids eroded and his eye sockets hollowed out by the intensity of the tears. Therefore, the first step in treating this condition is this method, which is called treatment with the sword, and it involves ordering the patient to shave the hair on his forehead.
Then, make three parallel incisions on the forehead along its length. Each incision should be about two fingers in length. The first incision should be parallel to the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, the second slightly away from the movement of the muscle in the temple, and the third on the other side.
And be careful not to cut the two arteries on both sides, and keep your hand away from the connection of the jaws. Each incision should be about three fingers wide, and have with you pieces of prepared sponge or many dry cloths to stop the bleeding.
Then insert the sharp two-edged instrument which looks like this. From the incision next to the temple to the middle incision, peel off all the skin and the fascia on the bone between the two incisions. Then do the same from the middle incision to the third incision, then remove this instrument. You also insert another tool into the first incision, called a skeynai, which is sharp on one side and smooth and not sharp on the other side. This is its shape:.
The sharp side should be directed upwards toward the flesh attached to the skin, and the smooth side towards the bone. Push it until you reach the middle incision, cutting all the vessels descending from the head to the eyes without the cut reaching the outer surface of the skin.
Then do the same from the middle incision to the other one. After a moderate amount of blood has flowed, squeeze the areas to remove clotted blood, then place a wick of cotton in each incision and put on it a dressing soaked in a drink and oil or vinegar and oil.
To prevent a hot swelling, on the third day, loosen the bandage and clean it thoroughly with lukewarm water. Then treat it with a salve of basilicon and rose oil, and other treatments used for wounds until it heals, if God wills.
Chapter Five.
On the treatment of tears and discharges to the eyes from the interior of the head.
When a person experiences frequent, sharp, hot, and persistent discharges, and you see the eyes from it becoming weak and small, and their vision has weakened, and the eyelids are ulcerated and the eyelashes have fallen out. There will be a sharp, painful pain deep in the head and consecutive sneezing. Know from these symptoms that those materials and discharges come from many deep veins. The best treatment for this is as follows: Order the patient to shave his forehead, then make one incision in the center of the forehead.
There will be a sharp, painful pain deep in the head and consecutive sneezing. Know from these symptoms that those materials and discharges come from many deep veins. The best treatment for this is as follows: Order the patient to shave his forehead, then make one incision in the center of the forehead. Or raise it slightly with an incision, starting from the left temple to the right temple. The incision should go down to the bone, and keep your hand away from the temples' moving muscles when chewing. Once the bone is exposed, soak up all the blood with a sponge.
Then separate the edges of the incision with old cotton or a linen thread, then secure it from above with bandages. Soak the bandages in a drink and oil so that no hot swelling occurs. When you remove them and see that the hot swelling has broken down, you should scrape the bone until flesh begins to grow on it.
Then treat it with a drying regimen that promotes flesh growth, such as taking two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophonium, preparing an ointment from them, and using it to promote flesh growth in such surgeries.
Chapter Six.
On treating what falls into the ear.
All that falls into the ear is of four types: either a metal stone or semi-stone like iron and glass, or plant seeds like chickpeas and kernels, and the like, or a liquid such as water, vinegar, and the like.
Or an animal; if a stone or something like a stone that does not grow in the ear falls in, face the sun with the affected ear. If you see the stone, drip some violet or turpentine oil into it, then try to remove it by moving the head or sneezing with cumin. And plug the nostrils when sneezing comes, after placing a band of cloth or wool around the ear and lifting the ear upwards. This treatment often causes it to come out. If it does not come out, then try to remove it with a gentle probe, which is depicted in this manner.
If it comes out with the probe, and if not, try to remove it with a gentle, slightly curved blind hook. If it does not come out that way, then make a tube of copper and insert one end of the tube into the ear hole.
And plug what is around the tube with softened wax mixed with oil so that there is no path for air other than the tube. Then draw it out strongly with your breath; this often causes it to come out. If it does not come out by the methods described, then take a small amount of the gum of the Anbat or the birdlime used to catch birds and place it at one end of the probe.
After applying tight cotton, then gently insert it into the ear hole after drying the ear from moisture, if it does not come out with all that we described, quickly proceed to incision before hot swelling or stiffness occurs.
The method of incision is to bleed the patient first and let blood out according to his strength. Then sit the patient in front of you, lift his ear up, and make a small incision at the base of the ear where the lobe is, at its lower part.
The incision should be crescent-shaped until you reach the stone, then remove it with whatever instruments you can use. Then sew the incision immediately and treat it promptly until it heals.
And if what has fallen into the ear is one of the seeds that grow and swell, try to remove it as mentioned. If it does not come out, then take a thin, delicate lancet shaped like this.
Attempt to cut that type of seed fallen into the ear with it. You should only do this if you are certain that the seed has been moistened by the steam in the ear until it becomes small pieces, then remove them with a blind forceps or a delicate spatula or by suction.
As mentioned, it is easy to remove them. As for water inside the ear, the patient should first try sneezing with cumin while filling his ear with some old cotton while lying down on the ear that contains the water, if it comes out that way.
Otherwise, take many thin and smooth stones along the fingers, warm them slightly by fire, then have the patient insert one of them into his ear hole, lie on one side, and strike the stone in the ear with another stone.
He continues to do this with a stone until all the water comes out, and the water may come out by taking from cotton or from feathers one, and insert one end into the ear and hold the other end in fire until most of it burns, then another feather is used.
Do this repeatedly until all the water comes out or draw it out with a tube as mentioned previously with the stone. As for extracting an animal that has entered, look to see if it is small in body like a flea and the like, then treat it as described in the division. And as for.
If its body is large and visible to the senses, try to remove it with pitch and tweezers, and its removal is easier than all that pierces the ear. As for removing the worm generated in the ear if you have treated it as mentioned in the section on fumigations and your treatment was ineffective.
You should look into the ear in the sunlight, and if any part of the worm is visible to you, remove it with pitch or with delicate tweezers. If nothing is visible to you, then take a tube, which looks like this.
Narrow at the bottom and wide at the top, insert the thin end into the ear as much as the patient can tolerate, then suck strongly with it. Do this repeatedly until all the worm comes out. If it does not come out, seal around the tube with wax as I mentioned to you in the case of the stone.
If it does not come out with what we have mentioned, use the fumigations that I have described, which the ancients have tested for killing worms. You will find this in the section on fumigations. The application of ointments and medicines to the ear can be done with this device, whose shape is as follows:
As you see, it is made from silver or brass, narrow at the bottom with a small hole and wide at the top. If you wish, the projectile inside the tube can be of well-made brass. If you prefer, take a rod and tightly wrap cotton around one end.
Then pour the oil or juice or any of these medications into the tube while it is in the ear, then insert the rod with the cotton from the top and squeeze it moderately with your hand so that the oil is forced into the ear canal and felt.
Do this with the patient present, and let what you pour into the ear be warmed slightly over fire. Be careful that the thing which drips into it is not too cold or too hot, as the ear cannot tolerate such extremes.
Chapter Seven.
On the Treatment of Temporary Ear Obstruction.
Some children may be born with ear canals that are not perforated.
Some people may also experience an obstruction in the ear canal due to a wound or the growth of flesh within it. This obstruction may be deep inside the ear hole, beyond the reach of sight.
It may also protrude slightly outside the hole and be visible. That which occurs deep in the ear and is not visible is usually difficult to treat, while that which is visible should have the patient's ear exposed to the sun. Look into it, and if you see the obstruction clearly, open it with a delicate surgical instrument, which would be of this form:.
Its tip should have a slight protrusion limited to some extent, while the rest of the scalpel is smooth on both sides so as not to injure the ear. If the obstruction is due to flesh that has grown in the ear canal, grasp it with a delicate forceps and cut it with extreme gentleness until all the flesh is removed.
If the obstruction is in the depth of the ear, take a smooth, delicate probe and warm it slightly over fire. Then insert it into the ear canal. If you feel the obstruction and the patient feels heaviness in their hearing, gently remove it.
Be careful not to injure the eardrum, then insert a piece of cotton into the ear proportional to the size of the hole, and wrap it in Egyptian ointment. Do this for several days until you are certain that the wound has healed, or take a piece of cotton, moisten it with water, and sprinkle it with powdered zinc.
Use it, and if you see the ear has swollen with a hot swelling, you should remove the cotton and replace it with another piece that has been wrapped in kerotie made with rose oil until the hot swelling subsides. Then continue to treat it until it heals.
If bleeding occurs, soak a sponge or cloth in cold water and place it on the ear. Use the rest of the treatment that stops bleeding as mentioned in the section on styptics.
Chapter Eight.
On the treatment of warts that appear on the eyelids.
These warts that appear on the eyelids may be moist or dry. They should be grasped with a forceps or tweezers and cut out at their roots with a scalpel, then powdered zinc should be applied to the area.
If blood flows from it, cauterize it with a gentle lens-shaped cautery. Cauterize it better after the cutting. It often returns if any of its roots remain, and if you cauterize with fire, you burn those roots and it will not return.
Chapter Nine.
On the treatment of transient cold in the eyelids.
Often, something resembling cold in its intensity and hardness appears in the eyelids.
Therefore, it is called cold, which is the congregation of thick moisture in the upper and lower eyelids. The treatment for this is to examine it; if the coldness protrudes on the outer side of the eyelid and can move in all directions, then its treatment is easy, so make a横向切口。
Then, peel it gently from all sides until it is removed, then hang it with a hook and cut it off. If you cannot cut it without penetrating the eyelid, this will not harm the patient at all. If the incision is large,缝合它，并治疗直到痊愈。
If it is small, then there is no harm as the ointment will heal and bind it. If the coldness leans towards the inner side of the eyelid, turn the eyelid and hang the coldness with a hook without needing to make an incision, and cut it from all sides.
If you penetrate the eyelid with the cut, it will not harm anything. Then wash the eye after cutting the coldness with salt water and treat the area with a healing agent until the patient recovers.
Chapter Ten.
On the treatment of the sty that appears on the eyelid.
A sty is a pustule that forms in the layers of the upper eyelid, and it most often affects children. It burdens their eyes and causes them to have discharges at night, and they are unable to look at sunlight. In order that the tears flow quickly from them.
Therefore, you will find them always leaning on their faces and sleeping that way, with their eyelids under the eyebrows being moist, swollen, and the sty clearly visible. If you press the area with your fingers, you will feel the sty between them. The procedure is for the patient to place his head in your lap.
Then take a piece of linen, prepare it into a wick, and make a circle from that wick around the sty on all sides. Then place it over it and press with your fingers from all sides to gather the sty in the center of the circle.
Then, with a sharp scalpel, make a transverse incision in the center of that moisture. The incision should not be larger than that made in a boil. As for depth, you should cut through all the skin until you reach the sty.
In most cases, the sty will protrude from the incision in the form of a white piece of pus. You should pull it out with a cloth wrapped between your fingers to the outside while rotating your hand right and left until it is completely removed. Be careful not to enlarge the incision so that the scalpel does not reach the eye and cause harm.
If the boil does not appear to you at the beginning of the incision, you should increase the incision slightly gently until the boil appears, then pull it out as we said, then dip a cloth in vinegar and water and place it on the area and bind it with a bandage. Some people crush salt.
He places it in the depth of the incision to dissolve what remains of that moisture, then treats it until it heals. If a hot swelling occurs in the area, treat it with soothing bandages until it heals.
Chapter Eleven.
On the Types of Eyeshadow.
If excessive eyelashes grow outside the natural course beneath the natural eyelashes and persist, they harm the eye and cause various diseases such as constant tearing, drooping of the eyelids, whitening, and thickening until this becomes a cause for the failure of the eye.
Eyeshadow application is done in four ways: either by cauterization with fire, or by using a sharp medicine as previously mentioned in the chapter on cauterization, or by cutting and stitching, or by using reed, which I will mention.
You should place the patient's head in your lap, then turn the eyelid with your left hand. If it turns, otherwise insert a needle with a thread from below the eyelid and pass the needle with the thread from above, near the hair itself, and pull the thread upwards with the eyelid.
You turn it with the spatula, then incise inside the eyelid without the excess hair from the larger opening to the smaller opening with a sharp scalpel. Then you insert the thread and place a small bandage of cotton or cloth under the eyelid, then mark the eyelid with ink.
Like the shape of an oak leaf, except that the shape should be according to how much you want to lift the eyelid, for this may vary among people, as some may need a suitable amount cut from the eyelid according to how droopy it is.
And some may need to cut less, all of this according to the looseness of the eyelid. Then, you incise with the scalpel along the two lines that were taught, starting from the larger opening to the smaller one, and each incision should be close to the natural hairline by about the thickness of a needle.
Then insert the forceps into one of the corners of the skin, then peel it all off. Then approximate the two edges with suturing using a needle and thin wool thread, wipe away the blood, and attach any remaining threads to the eyebrows with some adhesive substances.
If you wish to do that, and otherwise it does not matter. Then leave the sutures for about three or four days, then treat it. If you prefer, you can leave the wound unsutured and treat it with something that dries and constricts, as the eyelid will rise when the wound heals and comes together, but suturing is better.
This method of tightening was mentioned by the earlier authorities, except that it is laborious for the patient. It is a good work and there is no danger in it. Another method of tightening is to mark on the eyelid a shape like an oak leaf, as we described. Then lift the eyelid with three forceps, which can be spread out or grouped in this manner:.
Then cut the excess eyelid with a small scissors in this manner, cutting moderately:.
If you cannot control the tweezers and they do not suit you, take a needle with thread and insert it into the center of the shape, and insert another thread near the larger opening and a third thread near the smaller opening, then gather the threads between your fingers evenly, then lift them with your hand in an even lift.
Lift the entire marked skin as we described, then bring the edges of the wound together with sutures and treat it until it heals. If a hot swelling appears when you cut or incise, soothe that swelling with kerotie and similar soothing ointments.
It may also happen that the lower eyelid turns inside out, and in such a case, you should use what we have mentioned of cutting, suturing, and cauterization with fire and sharp medicine. Cauterization with fire or sharp medicine is more effective and gentler on the patient than cutting and suturing, though cutting and suturing are more skillful in both cases.
Cauterization with reeds is done in this manner: you turn the eyelid inside out and make an incision on the inner side as described. Then, you make two thin reed or wooden strips, their length equal to the length of the eyelid and their width less than the width of a scalpel.
And you notch the ends of both on each side where the threads will hold. Then, gently bring them together over what remains of the eyelid and tightly secure the reeds on both sides. Leave it for days, as the tightened skin will die, turn black, and rot.
Until it falls off by itself. If it takes longer, use a rasp to notch it, then treat it until it heals. Once it has healed, the eyelid will rise and the eyelashes will not turn inward towards the eye. This is the shape of the two reeds, made in this form and with the same length and width.
Chapter Twelve.
On Removing Ingrown Eyelashes with a Needle.
If there is one or two hairs, the procedure is to take a thin needle and insert a thread of smooth fine silk into it, then gather its ends and tie them in an extremely gentle knot. The length of the thread should be about a span.
Then, attach another thin thread shorter than the first and tie its ends if you wish. The patient should place their head in your lap and it is best to be near sunlight so that the work can be clearly seen, for it is delicate work. Then insert the needle with the loop into the root of the unwanted hair.
Pierce the eyelid quickly with it until you bring it out above the natural hair, then pull the thread over the loop and draw the hair into the loop if there is one or two or three hairs, not more.
Then pull with your hand until the hair comes out with the loop in the eyelid along with the natural hair. If you pull the loop and the hair does not come out, pull the loop downward with the thread that you attached to it until the loop comes out of the upper hole.
Then put the hair back in and pull it out. Do this until you see the hair rise in the upper hole with your naked eye. At that point, remove the loop and the thread, tighten the eyelid, and leave it tightened for two or three days until the hair stays in place and flesh grows over it.
If the hair is short, either add a long natural hair to it so that it rises together, or leave it until it grows longer over time, and then raise it.
Chapter Thirteen.
On the treatment of sties that occur in the upper eyelid.
Which is affected by this sty is called arnabiyah, and this sty can either be natural or incidental. The incidental one results from the healing of a wound, split, burn, or the like.
The procedure is to incise that healed area, separate its edges, and place a wick of linen between them, securing it until it heals. It is not advisable to use things that dry and constrict in its treatment.
If you do that, the sty will return worse than before. Instead, use things that relax, such as fenugreek and lignum aloes soaked in water with alum and linen seeds, and a salve of diachylon dissolved with some oils, with which you anoint the wick and treat it.
The key to treating it is to ensure by every means that it does not heal in the same condition as before. The procedure we mentioned is part of correcting the sty, not returning the area entirely to its original state.
Chapter Fourteen.
On the treatment of sties that occur in the lower eyelid.
This sty that occurs on the lower part is what is truly called a sty. It can be natural or incidental. The incidental one results from a wound, split, burn, or the like.
The method for treating it is to take a needle with a doubled thread, pierce the flesh with it, and pass it from one side to the other until the thread is at both ends of the flesh. Then stretch the flesh upward with the needle and cut it with a broad scalpel.
If the eyelid returns to its proper shape, well and good; otherwise, take a probe and place it on the site of the incision and turn the eyelid with it, and make two incisions in the inner side of the eyelid so that the ends of these incisions start from both corners of the cut you made until they meet to form a corner. Until when they come together, its shape becomes similar to this shape:.
It is the Greek letter lambda, then remove that flesh so that its sharp side is lower than what adjoins the eyelid, then join the separated parts with two stitches using wool thread, then treat it with the relaxants and lint we mentioned until it heals.
If the eyelid has become wide due to an incision, suturing, or cauterization, it should be cut with a simple incision without hair from the eyelashes as previously mentioned, then separate the two edges with lint as we described.
In summary, the treatment of ptosis, whether from above or below, should be carried out according to what appears suitable for the condition of the ptosis, as it may vary greatly in appearance, and the skilled practitioner will devise a method in whatever way is possible for him.
Until the shape is restored to its natural form or接近它，疾病的本身在大多数情况下会指引你适合的治疗和工具。
Chapter Fifteen.
On the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or cornea.
This adhesion may occur in many people where the upper eyelid adheres to the white of the eye, preventing it from moving easily and hindering its natural functions; therefore, a thin spatula should be inserted under the eyelid.
And you raise it upwards or extend it with a forceps, then cut the adhesion with a delicate scalpel that is not as sharp as other scalpels but slightly blunt so as not to distress the patient during the procedure, which could cause the scalpel to slip and harm the eye with its sharpness. Your cutting should be as if you are peeling off that adhesion.
And wait until the eyelid returns to its natural state and the adhesion is completely healed. At that time, pour salty water into the eye to wash it, or drip a solution of zingiber officinale dissolved in water into it. Then, separate the eyelid from the eye with a cotton swab.
And place wool soaked in egg white over the eye, and after the third day, use moistened compresses until it heals.
Chapter Sixteen.
On the removal of the ingrown nail and excess flesh around it.
The ingrown nail can be of two types: either it is neural, resembling a thin, hard membrane, or it is non-neural, resembling a solid white moisture that breaks when touched by iron or when attempted to be removed with forceps.
And no forceps were used in it, and both types begin from the larger aperture until they are inserted little by little until they cover the eye and prevent light and movement of the eye, and the method of cutting them is that the patient puts his head in your lap.
Then he opens his eyes and you lift the eyelid with your hand, then grasp the cataract with slightly curved forceps and pull it upwards, then take a needle, insert a hair from horse or ox hair and a strong thread into it, bend the tip of the needle slightly, and pierce it in the center of the cataract.
And you pass it through with the needle and tie the cataract with the thread, pull it upwards, and scrape with the hair along the side of the cataract that is next to the pupil as if you are spreading it out with the hair to its end, then cut what remains at the base of the aperture with a delicate scalpel or a small scissors and leave the natural flesh of the aperture.
So that cutting it does not cause a constant flow of tears, and the cataract can be pulled with forceps alone or with thread as we said, then scrape it with a smooth-edged scalpel which looks like this:.
And be careful that the scalpel does not touch the corneal membrane so as not to cause a tear in it which would harm the pupil. Then after cutting, put some powdered salt or zingiber officinale in the eye and leave it for another day, then treat it as necessary until it heals.
If the cataract is not adherent and you cannot insert a needle into it or hold it with forceps, this type of cataract is often treated with medication as described in the classification, and it heals. If you want to cut it, open the patient's eye.
Take a delicate, smooth, and weak-edged scalpel in this form:. Trim the nail from above gently with it. If you see that it becomes loose and crumbles due to the trimming, drip a little from your vial into the eye of Zingiber officinale or red zingiber officinale or powdered salt and bind the eye for another day.
Then repeat the procedure on it until it is all gone, unless you encounter a hot swelling in the eye; in that case, leave it and treat the hot swelling until it heals. Then repeat the trimming procedure on it until it heals. As for the flesh growth in the eyelid.
If the growth severely hurts the eye, attach that growth to a hook and cut part of it, but do not overcut so as not to cause tearing. Then drip red zingiber officinale or zingiber officinale into the affected area until it heals.
Chapter Seventeen.
On the removal of sutures and any excess flesh that grows in the eye.
Red flesh may grow in the eyes of some people, layer upon layer, until it covers the pupil or approaches it or overflows onto the eyelids. Sometimes the eyelids may turn outward, and it resembles the rose of the jelenar.
The procedure for this is to have the patient place their head in your lap, then open their eyes, and use appropriate tweezers to remove all of that red flesh.
Or grasp it with a forceps or pincers then cut the flesh little by little until all of it is cut off, taking care of the eye so as not to harm it while working, and your cutting should be either with the scalpel which we described for cutting nails or with a small scissors. Like those with which you pick the threads, as its image will come in the next chapter following this chapter.
Once the cutting is complete and all the inflamed tissue has disappeared, fill the eye with ground salt or drip red sulfur into it along with similar caustic medicines. Apply cotton coated with egg white externally on the eye to prevent hot swelling.
If any inflamed tissue remains and the blood overpowers you and you fear hot swelling, then leave the eye alone and treat it with what soothes the swelling. Then return to it and continue the procedure until it heals. Do the same for any excess flesh that appears in the eye of this kind.
However, you should avoid treating any eye that is weak by nature or due to a condition with iron procedures. Do not involve yourself in any of these procedures until you see that the organ can withstand such treatment.
Chapter Eighteen.
On removing threads from the eye.
Threads are red veins that form over the eye, hindering vision and weakening the eye over time. You should first examine if the eye containing the threads is strong and does not have any other disease besides the threads.
Then at this point, use the ligation method, which involves instructing the patient to place his head in your lap, then suspend those veins with one or two forceps according to your skill, and the forceps should be gently curved in this manner:.
or they could be double forceps in one body as follows:．
Then, with a delicate scissors, gently grasp those veins and wipe the blood from time to time until you see that those veins have gone from the eye and the blood has clotted. Be careful not to harm the eye with the tips of the scissors, and let your work be done in the morning facing the sun.
Be very careful in your work so as not to cut anything other than those veins. When you are finished, drip green or red antimony into the eye to dissolve with its potency what remains of the passages. If you cannot extract it all at that time, bandage the eye with something that soothes the pain.
Leave it for days until the pain subsides and you are sure that the hot swelling is gone, then repeat the procedure in exactly the same manner until it heals. This is the image of the scissors used for this.
Leave it [with the patient's head in the lap of the student, another one drying the tears and examining the front and back of the eye closely]. The proper way to proceed is to open the eye with fixed or triangular speculums held by a student.
The patient's head should be in the lap of the student, another one drying the tears and examining the front and back of the eye closely. You may choose to start the ligation from the top of the eye or from the bottom, but it is preferable to use two forceps on the upper side, with one at the end of the iris and the other at the beginning.
Hold it between the middle finger and the index finger, then hang weights underneath opposite them. Then hold it between the little finger and the ring finger and lift your hand lightly until you see all the vein raised. Cut from the smaller side if you wish with scissors or with a sharp surgical knife.
You insert the needle with the thread and elevate the entire vein until it rises above the skin, and do not cut the tie because the fluid and blood will make it easier for you.
Then cut with scissors what exceeds the crown from above and below until nothing remains protruding except in the cornea. If you can lift it from the cornea, peel it off with the needle; that is better. It may be possible in some people.
And when you cut it, the area will swell for days, the pain will subside, and the inflammation will decrease. Then repeat the procedure on it.
Chapter Nineteen.
On Restoring the Nostril.
Physicians call the nostril a nares, and if they treat it with cauterization or with sharp, burning medicine as previously described and it does not heal, there is no alternative but to cut into the swelling when it has matured and extract all the moisture or pus within it.
Until the bone is exposed, and if the bone is exposed and you see corruption or blackness in it, then scrape it with an instrument that looks like this:
It is called the rough head, made from Indian iron, and its head is rounded like a button, engraved with a fine file or emery stone pattern. Place it on the corrupted part of the bone, then rotate it between your fingers while slightly pressing your hand until you know that the corruption has been scraped off.
And do that repeatedly, then treat the area with drying and binding medicines. If the area is sealed and flesh grows there and the discharge stops, and it remains for forty days without recurring or causing any harm or incident.
Know that he is healed. Otherwise, there is no solution except to return the polyp to the nasal opening in this manner: reveal the bone again with iron or a sharp medicine, and when the bone is revealed, take it out in this form:
The tip of the iron should be triangular and its end conical, drawn to the tip as you see, then place it on the bone itself, and do this near the throat but keep your hand slightly away from the eye, then turn your hand with the instrument until the bone is penetrated and the patient feels it.
So that he feels the air coming out when he holds his hand over his nose. At this point, treat the area with binding and drying medicines as I have informed you. If the flesh grows and the place hardens, then the material which was projecting outward will return to the nose, making it easier on the patient, if God wills.
Chapter Twenty.
On the treatment of eye tumors.
If the entire eye is swollen and there is no harm or deficiency in sight, it is advisable to ease the patient, then fumigate the back of the head. Then place a leech on the occiput without any conditions and let it suck gently.
Then place on the eye a poultice made from colocynth, storax, frankincense, and asafetida. Then bind the eye tightly above the dressing with many compresses. The compresses are made by taking soft cloths, folding each one into four layers to make them thick.
Then place them one on top of the other according to what the eye needs, then bind them with a strong cloth tightly. Repeat the cupping by suction without restriction, then remove the cup and leave the eye bound for a day and night.
If the bandage loosens during that time, it should be tightened well. Then remove the bandage after a day and night as we said. If you see that the eye has returned to normal, otherwise repeat the dressing, padding, binding, and cupping until it recovers.
Chapter Twenty-One.
On Cutting the Hernia.
If a hernia appears in the vaginal tunic and then swells and protrudes outside the eyelids like a grape, disfiguring the person's appearance, and you wish to cut it, then the procedure is as I describe.
It involves inserting a needle into the base of the hernia from below to above, then inserting another needle with a doubled thread on the side of the opening and passing it through, leaving the first needle in place.
Then cut the part where the doubled thread bends, tie it around the base of the hernia with the needle, and tighten it well. Then remove the needle and place wool soaked in egg white on the eye, leave it until the threads fall off with the hernia, then treat the eye with what strengthens it.
Until the wound heals, you may bind the hernia on all sides with a circle of cloth to increase the eye's protrusion. Then, use a thin scalpel that reaches the depth of the eye to let the egg-like moisture flow out, causing the eye to descend and wither in place, then bind it until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Two.
On the treatment of carbuncle.
This ailment which is called carbuncle is a kind of liquid that gathers in the eye, resembling flowing water but there is none. The method to treat this is to have the patient sit on a chair upright, then take hold of his head with both hands from both sides.
Move it until you see the liquid move to the bottom with your eye, then it stabilizes and does not move, and the light is released, and the patient sees things as he used to see them. If it does not move to the bottom, we know that it is water. If the liquid does not descend as mentioned,
otherwise, sit the patient in front of you, then take a thin scalpel and make a small incision above the cornea where the sclera connects to the cornea, until the material is released.
Once it is released, drip warm water mixed with honey or water in which fenugreek and honey have been boiled into the eye. Then continue treating it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Three.
We have mentioned the types of water in the classification and which is suitable for suction with clear and explanatory words, so take that information as accurate. At this point, you should sit the patient in front of you, squatting opposite a light source near the sun.
You bind his healthy eye and tighten it well, then raise the eyelid of his eye with your left hand if the eye that has the cataract is the left one or with your right hand if it is the right eye.
Then place the tip of the probe near the cornea with a thickness similar to that of a morshed in the white part of the eye from the side of the smaller opening, then push the probe strongly while turning it with your hand until it penetrates into the white part of the eye and you feel the probe reach an empty space.
It is necessary that the depth to which the probe goes should be equal to the distance from the pupil to the edge of the iris, for you will see the copper clearly through the transparency of the cornea, then direct the probe upwards to the place where the cataract is.
Then press it down repeatedly; if the cataract descends immediately, the patient will see what his sight opens up to him immediately with the probe still in his eye. Then let it rest for a while; if the cataract rises again, lower it once more without removing the probe.
When it has settled and does not rise, gently remove the probe while slightly twisting it with your hand little by little. Then dissolve some pure Andranian salt in water and wash the eye internally with it. Afterwards, apply moist cotton or wool externally to the entire eye.
With rose oil and egg white, bind it along with the healthy eye. As for us and people of our time, we apply ground cumin mixed with egg white on it. If the probe does not enter the eye due to its hardness, because there are those whose eyes are very hard indeed. It is necessary to take the surgical instrument which is called the picker, whose image is this:.
Pierce with it only the part that needs to be incised and do not deepen the puncture. It is merely to create a small opening for the probe, then insert the probe as mentioned. When your work is complete, prepare a firm bed for the patient where he can lie on his back in a dark room.
He should abstain from all movements and coughing, and his food should be what eases his digestion. He must not turn his head to the right or left at all. The bandage remains in place until the third day, then you remove it in that dark room and test his vision.
Show him things, then reapply the bandage until the seventh day. You should not do this during treatment or after cauterization at your time, but you should avoid it beforehand because water rises quickly with intense looking.
If a hot swelling occurs, you should uncover the eye before the seventh day and treat it with what calms the swelling. Once the swelling subsides, then release his sight and place a veil on his face through which he can gradually accustom his vision while he remains in that dark room for several days.
He should leave the house gradually and attend to his needs. Know that one who is learning cannot do without observing multiple times before proceeding with the work. I have heard from some Iraqis that they mentioned making a perforated probe in Iraq with which water can be suctioned.
I have not seen anyone in our country make this, nor have I read about it in the books of the early scholars. It is possible that this is a recent development. Here are images of various types of probes for those who may be unfamiliar with them:.
It is made of copper especially and its tip is shaped with this particular sharpness, triangular and acute.
Chapter Twenty-Four.
On the treatment of flesh grown in the nose.
Fleshy growths of various kinds may appear in the nose, some resembling many-legged scorpions, others being hard and cancerous with a dark color, and some being soft and not dark in color.
For those fleshy growths that are soft and not malignant or cancerous, the patient should sit in front of you facing the sun. Open his nostril, place the forceps on those growths, then pull them outwards, and cut off what has been grasped with a delicate sharp scalpel from one side.
To ensure that all the flesh has been removed, if any part remains that you cannot cut, gently scrape it off with a delicate instrument until nothing remains. If bleeding overwhelms you or a hot swelling occurs.
Counter it with what is appropriate, or if it was a malignant swelling, act quickly to cauterize it until the bleeding stops and all the flesh is removed. Then, after cutting, apply vinegar and water or a drink in the nose. If the nose opens and moisture flows into the throat.
Know that it has healed if the moisture flows as it should. If the moisture does not flow as it should, know that there is growing flesh inside on top of the loose bones which the instrument could not reach to cut. In this case, you should take a thread of coarse linen.
And make many knots in it, and leave the space of a finger or less between each knot. The patient should insert one end of the thread into his nose with a guide or as much as he can after making something like a button, and pull it until it reaches the nostrils.
It comes out at the throat, and boys often do such an action in school, which is easy for whoever wants to do it. Then gather the two ends of the thread, one end that came out of the mouth and the other that remained in the nose.
Then use the thread with knots to cut the flesh; do this until you know that the flesh has been severed by the knots. Then remove the thread, and in the nose, after wiping the blood, place a wick soaked in Egyptian ointment. Do this for three days or more.
Until the ointment consumes all that remains of the flesh. Then the last thing to be placed in the nose is a lead tube for several days until it heals. If drying treatment is needed, use that method.
And this is an image of the device used to drip oils and medications into the nose:.
He places a small lamp made of silver or brass, with an open reservoir for oil and a passage for the wick.
And if you prefer, make the tube closed like a reed, and the oil reservoir of the device flat.
It has a handle at the end as you see, to hold when heating oil or any other liquid substances or liquids you desire.
Chapter Twenty-Five.
On warts growing at the tip of the nose.
Warts often grow at the tip of the nose, increasing in size over time until their appearance becomes unsightly.
Therefore, it should be cut off at the first sign of its appearance and entirely removed. Then apply either cauterization or a burning medicine that can replace cauterization to the area. If it is not cut off until it grows large, examine it; if it is hard, solid, uniformly colored, and less sensitive.
Do not treat it with iron, for it is a cancerous tumor; I have often seen that cutting this tumor results in great affliction for the patient. If the tumor feels soft to the touch and is not uniformly colored, and you see that it can be completely cut out. Purge the patient, and cut it out without hesitation. Treat the area with substances that dry and constrict until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Six.
On suturing the nose, lip, and ear. If the connection is severed due to a wound or the like, know that if there is a separation in any of these cartilages, it seldom responds well to treatment except in some people.
When someone is presented with such a condition, if the wound is fresh and filled with blood, bring the edges of the wound together with sutures and treat it until it heals. If the separation has caused the edges to part and each side has become whole, then you should incise each side to its thickness until it bleeds.
Then the lips are sewn together and tightened, and powdered saffron and frankincense are sprinkled over it. A plaster of unguent or another type of healing ointment is placed on top and left for two or three days, then it is removed.
And change the medicine until the threads fall off by themselves, then treat it with ointment until it heals. The method of sewing is to bring together what was separated either with needles as described in stitching the abdomen or with thread as previously explained.
Chapter Twenty-Seven.
On removing the knots that appear in the lips.
Many people may develop small, hard tumors inside their lips, some resembling morsels of corns and others smaller or larger. It is advisable to turn the lip, incise each knot, and grasp it with forceps.
Cut it from all sides, then fill the area after cutting with powdered zaj to stop the bleeding. Then rinse with vinegar and salt, and treat the areas with binding agents until the wounds heal.
Chapter Twenty-Eight.
On removing excess flesh from the gums.
Often, excess flesh grows on the gums, which the ancients called polypus. It is advisable to grasp it with forceps or hold it with a probe and cut it at its base. Allow the blood to flow out, then apply powdered zaj to the area.
Or one of the astringent drying agents, then if that flesh returns after treatment, it often returns; cut it again and cauterize it, for it will not return after cauterization.
Chapter Twenty-Nine.
On cleaning teeth with iron.
Rough and ugly scales may accumulate on the surfaces of the teeth, both inside and outside, and between the gums. These scales may turn black, yellow, or green until they cause damage to the gums and spoil the appearance of the teeth.
It is necessary that the patient sit before you with his head in your lap, and you should clean the molar and tooth where the scales and sand-like substances appear until nothing remains. You should do the same for the black, green, yellow, and other discolorations until they are all cleaned.
If what is inside is removed on the first cleaning, otherwise repeat the cleaning on another day, a second and third time until you achieve your goal. Know that the molar requires various forms and many shapes of cleaning tools according to what is suitable for your work.
For the tool used to clean the molar from the inside is different from the one used to clean it from the outside, and the one used between the molars has a different form. Here are several forms of cleaning tools that you should have prepared:
Chapter Thirty.
On Extracting Teeth.
It is necessary to treat the molar for its pain with every means and hesitate to extract it, for there is no replacement if it is extracted, as it is a noble essence. Even if extraction is unavoidable.
It is necessary if the patient decides to extract it that you ensure the tooth causing the pain is accurately identified. For often the pain deceives the patient, and he thinks it is in the healthy tooth, so he extracts it, but the pain does not go away until the diseased tooth is extracted; we have seen barbers do this many times.
When you have accurately identified the painful tooth, then you should incise around the tooth with a strong instrument until the gum is separated from all sides, then move it slightly with your fingers or with delicate forceps little by little until it becomes loose.
Then take hold of it firmly with the larger forceps, and have the patient's head between your knees so that he is stabilized and does not move. Then pull the tooth straight to avoid breaking it. If it does not come out, take one of those instruments, insert it gently under the tooth from all sides, and rock it as you did before.
If the tooth is perforated or decayed, you should fill that hole with a cloth and secure it well with a thin strip of linen so that it does not crumble when you grip it with the forceps. You should also carefully incise around the gum on all sides.
Be cautious with your force so as not to break the tooth, leaving a piece behind, which would cause the patient greater harm than their initial pain. Beware of acting like ignorant barbers who recklessly extract teeth without using the methods we have described.
For often they inflict great calamities upon people, the least of which is that a tooth may be broken, leaving all or part of its root behind. Or it may pull out some of the jawbone, as we have witnessed many times. Then, after its extraction, he rinses his mouth with a drink or vinegar and salt. If bleeding occurs from the site, which often happens, then crush some zadj and apply it to the area.
Otherwise, clean it if the zadj does not help you. The image of the delicate forceps that move the tooth first have long ends and a short handle to ensure they do not bend when you grip the tooth with them. This is the image of the larger forceps:
It should be as you see, with thick handles so that when you grip them, they do not give in or bend. The ends should be short and made of Indian iron or well-tempered steel with serrated edges at the tips that interlock to grasp firmly and tightly.
The ends may also be made like a file, which makes them strong and precise.
Chapter Thirty-One.
On Extracting Tooth Roots and Removing Broken Jawbones.
If after extracting a tooth, a broken root remains, it is advisable to place cotton with fat on the area for a day or two until the site relaxes, then you can insert the dental wax or forceps. which have ends resembling the mouth of a bird called the pelican. This is the image of the forceps:
It has been made like a scraper from the inside or like an extractor, then if it does not respond to you with these forceps, you should dig at the root and cut all the flesh with the lancet, then insert the tool that resembles a small lever, which looks like this:
Short at the end, slightly thick, and should not be hollow to avoid breaking. If the root comes out this way, otherwise, use these other tools whose shapes are as follows, the first is triangular at the end and somewhat thick:
An image of another delicate triangle:
We also use this tool with two prongs, which looks like this:
And with other tools and iron instruments that were mentioned earlier in the extraction of teeth. We also use this tool that resembles a large pair of forceps, which looks like this:
Triangular at the bent end, somewhat thick to avoid breaking, and should not be hollow. Know that tooth instruments are numerous, as well as other tools which are almost innumerable. The skilled craftsman may invent his own tools according to what work and diseases themselves suggest to him.
Because there are diseases for which the ancients did not describe tools due to the variety of their types. If a bone in the jaw or one of the bones of the mouth breaks or becomes rotten, examine it in its place with one of these instruments or forceps that were mentioned for extracting roots.
And we use this awl, which looks like this:
It should have some slight thickness to hold the bone so it does not slip until the bone comes out, and we set the area with suitable medicines. If there is a little putrefaction in the bone, remove its putrefaction and blackness until it is clean, then treat it until it heals.
Chapter Thirty-Two.
On the Extraction of Teeth that Have Grown in the Wrong Position.
If the teeth have grown out of their natural course, they spoil the appearance, especially if this happens in women and slaves. It should be examined whether a molar has grown behind another molar.
And if it cannot be extracted or pushed back, then extract it. If it is attached to another molar, cut it with this tool, which has this shape:.
It resembles a small beak and should be made of sharp Indian iron with an extremely sharp tip. Your cutting of it should be done over many days due to the hardness of the molar so as not to disturb the other molars. If it protrudes firmly because of its coldness, heat it with a file that has this shape.
It should be made entirely of Indian steel, with a thin and delicate engraving like the file used for making needles. Use it to heat the molar gradually over many days gently so as not to shake the tooth loose and cause it to fall out. Finally, smooth it and remove it with some chisels.
If a part of the molar has broken and is hurting the tongue when speaking, it should also be filed down until the roughness of the break is removed, smoothed out, so that it does not hurt the tongue or interfere with speech.
Chapter Thirty-Three.
On securing loose teeth with silver threads or gold threads.
If the front teeth become loose and move due to a blow or fall, and the patient cannot chew any food without them falling out, and treatment with constricting medicines has not been effective.
The solution is to secure them with a gold or silver thread, and gold is better because silver can corrode and rot after a few days, whereas gold remains unchanged forever and does not suffer from that. The thread should be of moderate thickness to fit between the teeth.
The method of securing is to take the thread and insert its bend between two healthy teeth, then weave the ends of the thread between the loose tooth or teeth until you reach another healthy tooth on the other side.
Then, you return the weaving to the side where you started and pull gently and wisely so that it does not move at all. Secure the thread at the roots of the teeth so it does not come loose. Then cut the excess ends of the thread with scissors, gather them together, twist them tightly, and hide them between the healthy tooth and the loose tooth.
So that the tongue is not injured, then leave it secured in this manner as long as needed. If it loosens or breaks, secure it again with another thread. Thus, one can enjoy it for a lifetime. This is the image of the teeth and the method of securing two loose teeth between two healthy ones as you see.
And it may happen that one or two molars, after falling out, return to their place and fit as we have described and remain. This is only done by a skilled craftsman who can carve bone from the bones of cattle into the shape of a molar and place it in the spot where the molar has gone. And it is tightened as we said, so it remains and one benefits from it.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
On cutting the ligament that appears under the tongue and hinders speech.
This ligament that appears under the tongue may either be natural, with which a person is born, or it may be accidental from a wound that has healed.
The procedure involves opening the patient's mouth, placing their head in your lap, lifting the tongue, and then cutting that nervous ligament transversely until the tongue is freed from its restraint. If there is some stiffness or knotting, and this is due to a healed wound, then make an incision with forceps and cut it transversely until the ligament is severed and the knot is resolved.
Be careful that the incision is not too deep in the flesh so as not to cut an artery and cause bleeding. After the cutting, have the patient rinse with rose water or vinegar and cold water. Then place a cotton wick under the tongue for the patient to keep each night.
To prevent it from healing again, if bleeding occurs, apply powdered zajac to the area. If the bleeding persists, cauterize the area with a suitable lens-shaped cautery tool. Then treat it with all treatments until it heals.
Chapter Thirty-Five.
On extracting the frog that develops under the tongue.
A swelling that resembles a small frog may occur under the tongue, preventing it from its normal function, and it might grow until it fills the mouth. The procedure for this is to open the patient's mouth towards the sun and examine the swelling.
If you see it is dark or black and hard, and the patient feels no sensation in it, do not touch it for it is cancer. If it leans towards whiteness and has moisture, then puncture it with a probe and cut it open with a delicate knife and extract it from all sides.
If the blood overpowers you while working, apply powdered zaj to it until the bleeding stops. Then return to your work until you remove it entirely. Finally, rinse with vinegar and salt.
Then treat it with the appropriate treatments until it heals.
Chapter Thirty-Six.
On the treatment of tonsil swelling.
And what grows in the throat from other swellings may present glands inside the throat that resemble those appearing outside, called tonsils. If treating them with what I have mentioned in the division does not heal them.
If the swelling is hard, dark in color, and has little sensation, do not treat it with iron. If it is red in color and its base is thick, do not treat it with iron either, for fear of bleeding. Instead, leave it until it ripens, and it will either dry up or burst on its own.
And if it is white in color, round, and its base is thin, then this is what should be cut. The procedure involves checking before the operation whether its hot swelling has completely subsided or decreased somewhat.
Then sit the patient facing the sun, with his head in your lap, open his mouth, and take an assistant in front of you to press down his tongue with an instrument that looks like this.
It is made of silver or copper, thin like a knife. When you press the tongue with it and locate the swelling, once it comes into your sight, take a probe and insert it into the tonsil, pulling it out as much as possible without bringing any of the membranes with it.
Then cut it with an instrument that looks like this: it resembles scissors, but its ends are bent so that the tip of each is very sharp, facing the other. It is made of Indian iron or Damascus steel.
If this instrument is not available, then cut it with a lancet that looks like this:
It is sharp on one side and blunt on the other. After you cut one tonsil, cut the other in the same manner. After cutting, the patient should gargle with cold water or vinegar and water.
If bleeding occurs, gargle with water in which pomegranate peels or wormwood leaves or similar astringents have been boiled until the bleeding stops. Then continue to treat until healed. Sometimes other swellings may appear in the throat besides the tonsils; these should be cut in the same manner as described for cutting the tonsils.
I treated a woman who had a tumor that had grown inside her throat, almost reaching the larynx. It was slightly sensitive and was nearly blocking the throat; the woman was breathing through a narrow passage, and it prevented her from eating or drinking water.
She was on the verge of death had she remained another day or two, and the tumor had branches that extended out of her nostrils. I acted quickly, inserting a clamp into one of them and pulling, thus removing a piece successfully.
Then I cut it where I reached it from the nostril opening, and did the same with the part that emerged from the other nostril. Then I opened her mouth, pushed her tongue aside, inserted the clamp into the tumor itself, and cut a portion of it, from which only a small amount of blood flowed.
The woman's throat was cleared, and she immediately began to drink water and then eat. We repeatedly cut the tumor over a long period of time, and the tumor would regenerate what was removed until that process extended for a long time for both of us.
I resorted to cauterizing the tumor inside her throat, which stopped its growth. Then I left that place and did not know what happened to her afterward.
Chapter Thirty-Seven.
On Cutting the Tumor of the Tonsil.
What is called a uvula, if a phlegm descends to the tonsil and it swells, and if it is white and elongated, then it is called a pillar. If it is thick at the bottom and round, then it is called a uvula. If it is treated with what we mentioned in the division and the treatment does not work.
I saw the hot swelling had subsided from it and it was thin, so it should be cut. And whatever of it was gathered round, circular, and did not have length, and was blood-colored or purple or black or without feeling, then it should be avoided from being cut.
In it, you should operate on the patient; therefore, if you see it as described in its whiteness and length, sit the patient facing the sun, press his tongue with the tool that was previously described, then pierce the reed into the growth.
And pull it down and cut it with one of the two tools I mentioned for cutting the tonsils. It is advisable to only cut what has exceeded the natural state without excess, for if you cut more, you will harm the voice and speech.
Then after the cutting, use what we described for cutting the tonsils and treat it until it heals. If the patient is hesitant about the cutting, you should employ a cautery without fear or hesitation. The cautery here is done with a sharp remedy, placing the patient's head in your lap.
Then press his tongue with the tool we mentioned, then take some sharp water as described in the section on cauterization, and mix it with unslaked lime, neither too thick nor too thin. Fill this mixture into the hollow of this tool, and here is its shape:.
The end where you place the medicine should have a depression like that of a spoon. Place the tool with the medicine directly on the ulcer, with the patient lying on their side so that saliva flows out of his mouth from inside his throat, so that nothing goes down into his throat and causes harm.
Then hold the medicine in your hand and squeeze it on the tooth for about half an hour until you see that it has turned black and the pain of the medicine's bite has subsided, and if you want to take cotton and wrap it around the tip of a stick and moisten the cotton with the medicine.
You insert the stick with the cotton into a tube from above until the cotton sticks to the tooth. Do this repeatedly until you achieve the desired effect on the abscess, then leave it; it will wilt and fall off after three or four days. If you need to reapply the medicine, do so.
After cauterization, wipe around the abscess with cotton soaked in fat and dry the area around it from the medicine. Then rinse with cold water and treat externally with poultices and internally with gargles until healed. This type of treatment is safer than cutting and more reassuring.
Teeth can also be treated with a milder method than cauterization and cutting; they can be treated with fumigation as follows: take frankincense, saffron, thyme, spikenard, sage, chamomile, rue, and similar herbs. Gather all of them or some of them in a pot and immerse them in vinegar.
Boil the pot, which is sealed with clay from a wise person, and make a hole in the center of the lid. Attach a hollow instrument to this hole, made as follows: it can be made of silver or brass.
Insert the end with the funnel into the patient's mouth so that the steam rises to the tooth through the tube until the abscess swells well. Then repeat this several times until it wilts. Do not perform this treatment at the first sign of the swelling.
For it often increases the swelling, and it should only be done when the hot swelling has subsided. If this tool is not available to you, take a reed and attach a chicken eggshell to one end so that the mouth of the patient does not get burned.
For the eggshell prevents the heat of the steam from burning the mouth, and this is good for treatment with safety.
Chapter Thirty-Eight.
On removing thorns and other objects that pierce the throat.
Often, a bone or fish spine or something similar pierces the throat. You should extract what is visible to the eye after pressing the tongue with an instrument toward the sun.
So that you can see what is in the throat. For what does not appear and is hidden in the throat, you should induce vomiting before the food is digested in his stomach, as the piercing object may come out with the vomit, or you may have the patient swallow a piece of lettuce or the root of chicory.
Or have the patient swallow a bite of dry bread, or take a piece of soft sea sponge, tie it to a string, then have the patient swallow it. When it reaches the location of the spine, pull the string quickly. Do this several times.
For the spine or bone often gets stuck in it and comes out. If it does not come out as described, then use a lead instrument shaped like this:.
It should be slightly thicker than a probe and have a curved end. The patient should gently insert it into his throat while raising his head up, being careful not to touch the larynx to avoid causing a cough, using it to push out the bone or spine, or the doctor may insert it with their hand.
And inserting the affected area into it is better for knowing the position of the embedded object and pushing it downwards or pulling his hand up with the tool according to what seems appropriate until it comes out.
Chapter Thirty-Nine.
On Extracting Embedded Thorns in the Throat.
If you treat the leech with what we mentioned in the division regarding treatment with medications and it does not work, then examine the patient's throat in the sunlight after pressing his tongue with the tool that was described to you.
If you see the leech, pull it out with a small hook or a fine, firm tweezers. If you cannot do so, take a hollow tube and insert it into the patient's throat near the leech, then introduce an iron rod heated by fire into the tube.
Do this several times and the patient should abstain from water for the entire day. Then, take a vessel filled with cold water, open his mouth over it, and have him rinse with it without swallowing a drop. He should move the water around periodically with his hand.
The leech will fall off when it senses the water. If it does not come out as described, fumigate the throat with urine and alum using the tool described for fumigating the lungs. Do this several times, and it will fall off.
The method of fumigation involves taking a pot with hot charcoal, covered with a lid that has a hole in the middle. Attach one end of the tool to this hole, then place the fumigants inside. The patient should put his mouth on the other end of the tube and seal it tightly so that no smoke escapes until he feels the fumes reach his throat.
For the leech falls off at its place, and if it does not fall off, then the incense is repeated several times, and the patient endures thirst and eats salty food and garlic and does not drink water, so it must come out with this management. And this is a picture of an instrument that attracts the leech from the throat when it is seen.
It resembles forceps as you see, except that it has this bent part which enters the throat and its ends resemble a bird's beak with the roughness of a file so that when it grips something, it does not leave it.
And another instrument used to press the tongue, it is a wide iron ring the size of what fits inside the mouth above the tongue. It is inserted into the mouth standing on its side, so the mouth remains open against the will of the patient and he cannot remove it at all until it is removed.
Description of the instrument used to open the mouth to this same measurement.
Chapter Forty.
In it, there is discussion about compressing tumors and incising them.
Tumors have many diverse types, as will be mentioned one by one in this book. They differ in compression and incision in two aspects: one is the type of the tumor itself and what it contains of moistures.
The second aspect is due to the locations where they occur in the body, because a tumor that occurs in the head is different from a tumor that occurs in the thigh, and a tumor that occurs in a fleshy area is different from a tumor that occurs in a joint. Each has its own specific treatment method.
There are swellings that should not be lanced until the pus within them is ripe and complete, and there are those that should be lanced while they are still immature and have not fully ripened, such as swellings that occur near joints.
For if a swelling occurs near a joint and persists until the surrounding area becomes putrefied, it may corrupt the ligaments or nerves of that joint, causing disability of that limb, or the swelling may occur near a vital organ.
For if you delay lancing it until it ripens, you will harm the vital organ, or if it is near the rectum, lance it while it is still immature. It is necessary to lance a swelling that has not fully ripened when it is near the rectum so that the pus does not spread inside the rectum and become an abscess.
And it becomes such that it does not heal. You should know the time to lance swellings that have fully ripened, which is when the pain of the swelling subsides, the fever disappears, the redness and inflammation decrease, and the head of the swelling becomes defined, along with other signs.
You should place the incision at the lowest part of the swelling if possible, so that it is easier for the pus to drain downwards, or in the thinnest and most prominent part of the swelling. The incision should be made longitudinally along the body if the swellings are on limbs such as the hands and legs.
Places where muscles, tendons, nerves, and arteries are located, generally in all flat areas without bends. As for those that bend, the incision should be made according to the nature of that area. If the swelling is in fleshy areas, it is best to refrain from making an incision.
Until it fully matures as we said completely, for if you sutured it before that, the pus would continue to flow from it for a long time and would be abundant in harm and filth, and its lips might become hardened and concave. Some swellings may spread across the body when necessary or according to what the limb requires.
It is appropriate to use one suturing for small swellings and a wide suture or many incisions according to the size of the swelling for large ones. There may be some swellings where it is necessary to pierce the skin and cut if it has become like a rag.
It has happened to some extent that it dies, similar to what occurs in many abscesses and hidden sores. Some are cut with a three-cornered incision, and some are cut in the shape of a plant leaf, like Arabian swelling.
Some require a circular incision, a crescent-shaped incision, and similar types of incisions. For those that do not have a head, such as flat, smooth swellings, it is appropriate to use only a simple suture. If the swelling is large and has gathered for a long time, after suturing it, you should not rush to extract all the pus at once.
Rather, extract some of it, then leave the swelling for another day, and then extract some more pus. Do this gradually several times until all of it is extracted.
Especially if the patient is weak, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an elderly person, for the vital spirit often dissolves with the sudden release of pus, and the patient may die without you realizing it. Beware of this matter greatly.
After you incise these tumors, it is necessary to clean the wound and examine it. If the tumor's cut is small or if there is only one simple incision, then use linen or old cotton for bandaging. If the tumor is large and there are many incisions from the incising.
It is necessary to insert a wick into each incision until they all connect with each other. If some of the skin has been cut from the tumor or if it has been hollowed out, then it should be filled with old cotton or linen down without moisture and kept tight until the third day.
Then remove it and treat it with the appropriate ointments until it heals. If bleeding occurs during your work, use cold water and vinegar after soaking a piece of linen in them and apply it to the bleeding area several times.
If the bleeding persists, it is necessary to use the procedures, treatments, and evacuations that we have described in many places in this book and from the division. If you are in winter and the site of the tumor has many nerves, then soak the bandages with a hot drink and oil.
Place them on the area. If you are in summer and the areas are fleshy, then the bandages should be soaked with cold water and oil or a cold drink and oil. On the third day, as we said, it is necessary to cleanse the tumor and wipe it.
Use similar treatments for its cure until it heals. This is what you need to know about the general treatment of tumors. As for the details, I have described each tumor and the way to treat it in a summarized and categorized manner.
Chapter Forty-One.
On Incising Tumors That Appear on the Scalp Skin.
Tumors appear on the scalp skin, and they are a type of swelling contained in membranes that have sacs like those of a chicken's egg. There are many types; some are fatty, and others contain moisture similar to mud.
Some contain moisture resembling pus and broth, and so on. Some are hard and solid. All of them can be safely incised and removed unless an artery is encountered during the incision.
The procedure for incising them is to first probe them with the instrument that will be depicted after this, called a lancet, to determine their contents. If they contain moisture, then incise them longitudinally with a simple cut as follows:
Begin the incision from line ~B~ to line ~C~. Once the moisture has drained, peel off and completely cut out the sac that contained the moisture, leaving nothing of it behind, as it often returns if any part remains.
Then, soak a cotton pad in the pure ointment if available, or in salt water, and fill the wound with it. Leave it for another day as it will eliminate any remaining parts of the sac. Then, reapply the cotton pad with the ointment again and possibly a third time if needed.
Continue until you are certain that no part of the sac remains. At that point, treat the wound with ointments until it heals. If the tumor contains fatty matter, incise it in this manner:.
Make a stiff incision and place the forceps on both sides of the wound, peel it from all sides, and try your best to extract the peritoneum that contains it. If an artery is encountered, do as described for you afterward, and similarly, if there is a hard tumor, make the incision accordingly.
The treatment is the same as mentioned, and incising the hard tumor is easier because it has less blood and moisture. Some of these tumors in the head in some people have no moisture at all. This is because I made an incision on a tumor that was.
I made an incision on a tumor on an old woman's head and found the tumor to be like a hard, rough, white stone that could not be broken; if thrown, it would injure someone. None of the other tumors occurring in the head were like this, such as the tumors that appear on children's heads.
At the base of the ears, make a slight incision all around and ensure its inner part is directed downwards to facilitate the flow of material downward. Then treat it with the appropriate treatment.
The Forty-Second Chapter.
On Incising Swellings in the Neck: These tumors often appear in the neck, under the armpits, and on the shoulders, and may occur throughout the body. The ones that appear in the neck can be singular or multiple, and some may develop from others.
Each of these tumors is enclosed in its own peritoneum, similar to boils and head tumors as described. There are various types of these tumors; some are hard, some contain moisture, and others are malignant and do not respond to treatment.
What I have seen of it was in good condition to touch, its appearance was close to the color of the skin, it moved in every direction, and it was not attached to the neck's nerve or windpipe or artery, nor was it deep-set. It should be cut with a simple incision from top to bottom of the body in this manner, from line ~G~ to line ~B~:.
And peel it from all sides and stretch the edges of the skin with forceps or with two forceps or with many forceps if you need to, as we said in the case of head tumors. Extract it little by little, and make sure on the neck not to cut a vein or nerve. The scalpel should not be very sharp.
So that your hand does not overcut or disturb the patient, causing you to cut what does not need to be cut. If you cut a vein or artery and it hinders your work, put in the wound powdered zagger or some hemostatic agents that stop the blood.
And suture the wound, leave it until the severity of the swelling subsides and the wound relaxes and begins to show signs of suppuration, for the blood will stop then. Return to your work until you finish, then examine with your index finger if any more small growths remain, cut them and clean them.
If there is a large vein at the base of the growth, you should not cut it from its root but should tie it with a doubled tight thread and leave it until it falls off by itself without harm. Then fill the wound with old cotton that has been soaked in Egyptian ointment and treat it.
And if the entire boar's [tusk] is cut, it is necessary to bring together the edges of the wound and suture it immediately after you ascertain that no fragment remains. If you find that a fragment of the boar's bone remains.
It is advisable to aim for cutting at its root and base, and to use suturing as we have mentioned. For those wounds caused by pigs that contain moistures, lightly bandage where you see signs of healing, and make the bandage towards the lower part as we said.
Then after the bandaging, use winding with the Egyptian ointment or the like to eliminate any remaining corruption. When you see that the wound is clean, treat it with ointments that promote flesh growth until it heals.
Chapter Forty-Three.
On incising the throat for a swelling that occurs inside the neck.
The ancients mentioned this incision in the throat, but I have not seen anyone in our country perform it, and this is the pattern of their speech. As for those with goiter, they should avoid incising the throat as they do not benefit from it.
Because all the veins and lungs are diseased, as for those who have a hot swelling in the mouth or throat or tonsils, if there is no issue with the trachea, it is necessary to use incising the throat to avoid the damage caused by suffocation.
If we intend to do this, we should incise the throat below three or four rings of the trachea with a small transverse cut between two rings, similar to the incision in the peritoneum and not in the cartilage, and this position is appropriate for the incision.
For it is lacking in flesh and its blood vessels are distant, if the practitioner is timid, it is necessary to stretch the skin of the throat with a speculum then cut the skin until he reaches the trachea, avoiding the blood vessels if he sees any.
Then cut the peritoneum that we described, and identify the incision of the trachea from the phlegm that comes out with it along with the coughing, and the cessation of sound. Leave the wound open for a while; when the time of fear of suffocation has passed, bring together the edges of the wound from the skin.
And outline it alone without the cartilage, then use medications that promote flesh growth until it heals. The author of this book says, the explanation of this statement we have quoted is that if they see the patient has had his throat blocked by one of these tumors they mentioned.
When the patient is on the verge of death and his breath is about to cease, they go to incise the larynx so that the patient can breathe through the wound, thus saving him from death. They ordered leaving the wound open until the period of illness passes, which usually lasts for three days or so.
Then they ordered the wound to be sutured and treated until it heals. What I have witnessed myself is that a servant took a knife and directed it at her throat, cutting part of the trachea. I was called to treat her and found her gasping like a slaughtered animal, so I exposed the wound.
I found that the blood coming out of the wound was minimal, so I was certain that no artery or vein had been cut. The air was escaping from the wound, so I immediately outlined the wound and treated it until it healed. The servant did not suffer anything except a hoarseness in the voice, nothing more.
And after days, it returned to its best condition, so from this we say that splitting the larynx has no danger.
Chapter Forty-Four.
On incising the tumor that appears in the throat from the outside, which is called pharyngeal polyp.
This tumor, which is called pharyngeal polyp, is a large tumor of the body's color and it is common in women. It comes in two types.
Either it is natural or incidental. As for the natural one, there is no remedy for it. As for the incidental one, it comes in two forms: one similar to fatty tumors, and the other similar to the tumor that results from the entanglement of arteries, and incising it is dangerous. It should not be treated with iron at all, except for the small ones. If you probe and examine it with a probe and find that it resembles a fatty tumor and is not attached to any vessels, then incise it as you would a fatty tumor. Extract it along with the囊肿如果它在囊中，否则彻底清除它，然后用适当的治疗方法处理该部位。
Chapter Forty-Five.
On Incising Various Types of Goods.
The types of goods are numerous, and I have mentioned all their types in the classification. It is necessary to explain here the difference between a commodity and an excise, as it is confusing. I say that the excise is accompanied by heat and fever and alarming pains until the boiling of the excess subsides. And the rot completes, then the fever and intensity subside. The commodity is not accompanied by heat, fever, or pains; it is contained in a serous sack which is its special container, and it takes on the color of the body. Its beginning is like a lentil and it becomes like a bean, larger or smaller.
It exists in two types: either fatty or containing moisture. The colors of the moisture are numerous, as I have mentioned in the classification. When you proceed to treat the commodity, you should first probe and examine it with an instrument called the medsa, whose image will be shown in the section that follows this one.
Measure the size of the swelling, then remove the medsa and look at what comes out in its trace. If a flowing moisture of any color comes out, incise it slightly as I mentioned for other swellings. If no moisture comes out after the medsa, know that it is fatty.
Make a firm incision on it in this manner as I have informed you, and suspend it with forceps. Gently peel the skin from all sides and be cautious with the sack so that you can remove it intact along with the commodity if possible.
If the cyst bursts during the operation and you cannot extract it intact, this often happens; then extract it piece by piece until nothing of it remains, for if any part of it remains, whether little or much, the disease will return most of the time.
If it overpowers you and a small amount remains, then widen the wound at your completion with some sharp, corrosive agents, suture the wound, and apply something that soothes the inflammatory heat on top of it. Treat it with all treatments until it heals. If the disease is large, incise its edges and treat it with what causes healing.
If you encounter a vein, whether it is prominent or not, and bleeding occurs, then immediately widen the area with powdered zadj and leave it tied for two or three days until the wound becomes septic and the blood's inflammation subsides. Then return to cutting what remains of the disease.
Chapter Forty-Six.
On the Forms of Instruments.
Those used for cutting and splitting include forms of forceps, which are of three types: large, medium, and small.
Image of a large forceps:.
Image of medium forceps:.
Image of small forceps:.
It is made from steel with square ends, sturdy for quick entry into tumors. These are the forms of the lancets, also called blades, and they are of three types as well: large, medium, and small. Image of a large lancet:.
Image of a middle probe:.
Image of a small probe:.
It is suitable for examining tumors, wounds, abscesses, and cavities to determine what is inside them, such as bones and other things. It should be made round, polished, and smooth like arrows, from Chinese brass or espato, or from brass or iron or silver, and the best are those made of espato.
Probes can also be made from black lead, and they are suitable for probing abscesses that have a curved depth, as they can flexibly follow that curve. They are also of three types: long, medium, and short.
According to what is needed for the depth of each abscess, their thickness should be adjusted according to its width and narrowness. Image of a large lead probe:.
Image of a medium lead probe:.
Image of a small lead probe:.
Images of forceps, which are of many types: simple forceps, meaning those with a single jaw, and they come in three sizes—large, medium, and small. There are also blind forceps, which come in three types. Additionally, there are forceps with two jaws, also in three types, and there are curved forceps with two jaws. They come in three types, and there are forceps with three jaws, also in three types. All of these types are needed for their specific uses. Image of a large simple forceps:. A simple tenaculum illustration center:. A simple small tenaculum illustration:.

A large three-curved tenaculum illustration:.
A medium three-curved tenaculum illustration:. A small three-curved tenaculum illustration:.
And these are the illustrations of the scalpels used to cut and excise growths and tumors, and they come in three sizes: large, medium, and small. Illustration of a large scalpel:.
Illustration of a medium scalpel:.
Illustration of a small scalpel:.
Its edges used for cutting are limited, while the other ends are unlimited. This design is made to help in excising growths without the fear of cutting an artery or nerve, and to provide some comfort to the patient, reducing the pain felt during the removal of a tumor.
And these are the images of the surgical instruments and they are of three types, for there are large ones, medium ones, and small ones. The image of a large instrument:.
It is made from a copper alloy that is polished, and on one end it resembles a wide spoon with two layers, in its head there is a hidden scalpel blade resembling a bird's tongue that can move in and out as you wish, as you see.
Images of the scalpels that are hidden between the fingers when treating tumors, which the patient does not feel, and they are of three types, for there are large ones, medium ones, and small ones. Image of a large scalpel:.
Images of the bloodletting instruments used to stop bleeding, and they are of three types, for there are large ones, medium ones, and small ones. Image of a large bloodletting instrument:.
It is made from copper or china, rounded slightly in length as you see, and it should be thin. These types of bloodletting instruments should be available to you in large and small sizes to quickly cut the blood when necessary and when no medicine is at hand.
But do not use it to cut the flesh in every part of the body, but rather use it in fleshy areas such as the thigh muscle and the calf and the arm muscle and the breast and the belly and the shoulder and similar fleshy moist organs.
And from it are made other small devices that resemble pistachio shells in this form:.
It is used to cut the blood if it bleeds from the circumcision site or when cutting a vein or artery. It can also be made in this round shape:.
Chapter Forty-Seven.
On the treatment of men's breasts.
When the breast of men swells to resemble that of women upon reaching puberty, it remains as an unsightly bulge. If one finds this displeasing, it should be incised with a crescent-shaped cut in this form.
From line ~B~ to line ~C~:. Then remove all the fat, fill the wound with healing medicine, then bring the edges of the wound together with sutures and treat it until it heals. If the breast sags downward and becomes lax due to its bone, as may occur in women.
It should be incised on its upper sides with two cuts that resemble crescent shapes, each connecting to the other at their ends, so that the larger line surrounds the smaller one in this form:. From line ~B~ to line ~C~, then peel the skin between the cuts, remove the fat, and use what we have mentioned of sutures and cauterization and any other treatment it requires until it heals.
If you do not cut what should be cut due to the patient's anxiety or prior to blood clotting, you should fill the wound with cotton dipped in corrosive ointment and leave it until it corrodes what remains of the fat, then treat it until it heals.
Chapter Forty-Eight.
On the treatment of tumors that appear under the armpit.
These tumors that appear under the armpit are of a solid type contained in a cyst, and some contain moistures. For those that contain moistures, it is necessary to make a crescent-shaped incision in this form.
From line ~B~ to line ~C~. If you have drained all the contents of the tumor, clean it with old cotton and leave it for another day, then remove the cotton.
And treat it with the appropriate ointment until it heals. If the tumor is of the type of lard knots, incise it as we mentioned for incising lard knots. If the wound persists to the point where pus forms, use cauterization as we described previously.
Chapter Forty-Nine.
On incising the tumor that appears due to an artery or vein, which is called an aneurysm.
If an artery is cut and the skin above it heals, a tumor often results from this. Similarly, a vein may also swell and become tumors.
The signs by which it is known whether the swelling and inflation are from an artery or from a vein: If the swelling is from an artery, it will be elongated and gathered in the depth of the body; and if you press the swelling with your finger, you will feel it as if it has a rustling sound.
The swelling that is from a vein will be round on the surface of the body, and incising these swellings is dangerous, especially those in the armpit, groin, neck, and many other parts of the body where they are very severe; therefore, their treatment with iron should be avoided.
And those that are also in the limbs or head should be avoided. As for those that are from the artery's mouth swelling, make a longitudinal incision on the skin over it, then open the incision with forceps, then peel and free the artery from the adhesions.
Until it is exposed, then insert a needle under it and pass it to the other side, and tie the artery with a doubled thread in two places as I have explained for you in ligating the arteries in the cheeks. Then, incise with a scalpel the area between the ties until all the blood within it is released.
The swelling will subside, then use treatment that promotes pus formation until the ties fall off, then treat it with appropriate ointments until it heals.
If the swelling is from incising a vein, you should grasp as much of the swelling with the skin as you can with your hand, then insert a needle below the area you are holding and pass it through with a doubled thread until it emerges on the other side. Then bind the tumor tightly with a knot as I have described to you in binding the hernia from both sides with the ends of the thread, and if you fear that the threads may slip, then insert another needle with another thread under the entire tumor at the intersection of the first needle.
Tighten your threads in four places, then incise the tumor in its center until what is inside comes out. Then cut off the excess skin and leave what was tied. Finally, place a bandage that has been soaked in a decoction and oil on it. Then use the treatment which involves bandaging and ointments until it heals.
Chapter Fifty.
On the tumor that results from nerve torsion.
Just as a tumor may occur in an artery or vein, so can a tumor occur in a nerve if it is struck or due to excessive fatigue or the like. This is most common in the areas of the wrists and ankles.
And in every place where joints move, it is a hard tumor that resembles the color of the rest of the body and is mostly painless. If pressed firmly, the patient feels a slight numbness, and the tumor is not deep within the body.
Rather, it is under the skin and can move in every direction without going forward or backward. Those that occur in the joints should not be treated with instruments, as they may cause paralysis. Those that occur on the head or forehead are different.
Incise the skin with a lancet. If the tumor is small, grasp it with forceps and cut it out from the root. If it is large, attach it with a hook, peel it off, then remove it. Finally, close the wound with sutures and treat it until it heals.

Warts, which are called fungal warts due to their resemblance to mushrooms, often appear on people's bellies and other parts of their bodies. Their base is thin and their head is thick, sometimes with a split at the top. Some remain small while others grow very large.
I have seen a man with two warts on his belly that resembled mushrooms the most. They had white, thin bases and their tops were split and cracked, with moisture constantly oozing from them. I cut them off, and one weighed about eighteen ounces while the other was around six ounces.
In cutting them, you should observe that if the patient is moist and the color of the wart is white, moist, and has a thin base, cut it with a broad scalpel. Have the cautery ready in the fire, as often much blood will flow when they are cut.
If the blood overpowers you, immediately cauterize it. If you see that the patient is timid and frightened by cutting with iron, take a piece of tight lead wire and tie it around the wart with this description. Leave it for two days, then increase the tension of the lead. Continue tightening the lead.
Tighten it until it affects the wart enough for it to断掉并自行脱落，无需额外的痛苦。如果疣的基部较厚，则切割它有些危险，尤其是长在腹部的疣，但可以尝试切去其一半或部分。请注意，最后的翻译中包含了未被指示的解释性词语“断掉并自行脱落”，这不符合您的要求。以下是重新按照您的要求进行的翻译：
Then apply cauterization so that it does not return, then treat it until the wound heals, beware of cutting a tumor that is dark in color, little feeling, and ugly in appearance for it is a cancerous growth, and we will discuss cancer after this.
Chapter Fifty-Two.
On the Treatment of Umbilical Hernia.
Umbilical hernia can result from various causes, either from a split in the abdominal lining through which the intestines protrude, similar to other hernias, or from blood that emerges from a vein or artery as previously mentioned, or from air that becomes congested there.
If it is due to a split in the abdominal lining and the protrusion of the intestines, then the color of the swelling will be similar to the color of the body, it will be soft without pain, and it will appear different in various positions. If it is due to the protrusion of the intestines, its appearance will vary more than what we have described. When you press it with your fingers, it disappears and then returns. It may also be accompanied by rumbling, and it often enlarges when entering a bath or experiencing severe fatigue. If it is due to moisture, then it will be soft.
It will not disappear when you press it with your hand, nor will it increase or decrease. If it is due to blood, then in addition to these signs, the swelling will appear blackish. If it is due to growing flesh, the swelling will be protruding and hard, remaining of a fixed size.
If it is due to air, touching it will be soft. In such cases, you should refrain from treating it, as there is fear and risk involved, as I have informed you in the chapter where I mentioned tumors that occur due to arteries or veins.
If the navel protrudes due to the intestine or feces, it is necessary to instruct the patient to hold himself and stand upright extended, then mark with ink around the entire navel. Then, instruct him to lie down in front of you on his back, then incise with a wide scalpel around the navel at the place marked with ink, then pull the center of the swelling upwards with a large forceps, then tie the incised area tightly with a strong thread or silk.
The knot of the ligature should be a noose, then open the center of the pulled swelling above the ligature and insert your index finger and seek the intestine. If you find that it has been taken by the ligature, loosen the noose and push the intestine back into the abdomen. If you find feces, pull it out with forceps.
And cut its excess, if an artery or vein obstructs you, tie it well and return to your work. Take two needles, put strong threads through them, and insert the two needles into the incision you made around the swelling, piercing through, then pull the swelling tightly at four points with the needles.
And if you wish, remove the needles and leave the area until the pulled flesh rots and falls off by itself or cut it when it becomes thin and rotten. Then treat it with appropriate ointments until it heals. If the protrusion of the navel is due to grown flesh.
Or if it is due to moisture, you should incise the swelling as mentioned and remove the blood or moisture found within. Then treat it with something that closes the wound.
Chapter Fifty-Three.
On the Treatment of Cancer.
We have mentioned in the classification the types of cancer and how to treat it with medicines and warned against treating it with iron so that it does not become ulcerated, and we have mentioned the cancer that develops in the uterus and warned against treating it.
The ancients have mentioned that when cancer is in a place where it can be entirely excised, such as cancer in the breast or in the thigh and similar organs capable of complete removal, especially if it is newly arisen and small. However, if it has advanced and become large, it should not be approached for treatment.
Indeed, I have not been able to cure anyone of it, nor have I seen anyone before me achieve that. If it can be treated as we said, you should proceed by purging the patient with black bile several times, then purge it if it is in the veins and there is a clear fullness.
Then, you should place the patient in a position suitable for the procedure. Then apply the appropriate cauterization to the cancer and burn it from all sides along with the skin thoroughly until none of its roots remain, allowing the blood to flow without quickly stopping it.
Rather, squeeze the areas and completely drain all thick blood with your hand or with whatever tools you have. If a significant bleeding obstructs you during the procedure due to cutting an artery or vein, cauterize the vessel until the bleeding stops, then continue treating it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Chapter Forty-Four.
On the treatment of hives.
We have mentioned in the classification the types of dropsy, how the accumulation of water occurs, and the signs of each type and their treatment with medicines. The type that is treated with iron is only the serous type, and iron should not be used at all for the tympanic type or the fleshy type.
That is dangerous. If you have treated this type of serous hives with medicines and your treatment has not been effective, then examine if the patient has become excessively weak or if there is another illness besides the hives, such as.
cough or diarrhea, and the like, then beware of treating him with iron, for it is risky. If you see that the patient is strong, has no other disease besides the hives, and is neither a child nor an elderly person, then what you should do is to have the patient stand in front of you. And have an attendant behind him who presses his abdomen with his hands, driving the water downward toward the groin. Then take a spiked lancet in this manner:.
It is two-sided and long, sharp at the tip like a lancet, except that it has a slight blunt part to prevent penetrating too deeply during use and harming the intestines. Then examine if the hives originated from the intestines.
If the hives originated from the intestines, you should make an incision three finger-widths below the navel, above the groin. If they originated due to liver disease, the incision should be three finger-widths to the left of the navel. If they originated due to spleen disease, the incision should be three finger-widths to the right side.
It is also not appropriate for the incision to be on the side on which the patient wishes to lie, so that the excess does not flow to that weak area. Then pierce the skin entirely with the instrument and insert the instrument into that incision and raise your hand.
With the scalpel between the skin and the peritoneum as if you are flaying it, and the amount you flay should be the size of a fingernail or so. Then pierce the peritoneum until the scalpel reaches an empty space, which is where the fluid is, then remove it and insert into the hole the instrument which looks like this.
It is a tube-like device made from thin cane, crafted from silver or copper or smooth polished espardenye, with a small hole at its bottom and three holes on its sides, two on one side and one on the other as you see.
And he may place a sharpened end on it in the shape of a pen tip, which looks like this:
At its upper end, there is a loop. When the instrument reaches the fluid, it immediately flows onto the instrument. Drain an average amount of fluid at a time because if you drain too much at once, the patient may die from the dissolution of his vital spirit.
Or it may cause a state close to death. However, drain according to his strength and what the patient’s condition indicates, such as the strength of his pulse and the good color of his skin. Then remove the instrument and stop the flow, for it will cease immediately.
Due to the skin that holds the hole in the peritoneum, which you are told to cover in that manner. Then, if you see fit and the patient can endure it, repeat the procedure on another day.
It is also removed from the water a small amount, do this for days while you are on guard and be cautious of mistakes until only a little of the water remains. If you fear for the patient and leave a lot of the water, treat it by burying it in hot sand.
And sweating a lot in the bath and sun, accustom him to thirst and treat him with drying medications until he recovers. Apply cauterization on the stomach, liver, and spleen after removing the water as described previously.
Chapter Fifty-Five.
On the treatment of children who are born with unperforated urinary openings or with a narrow hole or in an incorrect position.
Some boys may be born with an unperforated foreskin, so it should be promptly pierced as soon as they are born.
With a very thin surgical instrument in this manner:.
Then place a thin lead spike in the hole and secure it, keeping it in place for three or four days. Whenever urination is needed, gently move it aside, then return it to its position. If you do not use the lead, the urine passing through the area may prevent it from closing.
As for those with a narrow opening, it is treated with lead as we said for many days until it widens. For those whose opening is in the wrong position, some are born with the hole at the end of the foreskin, so they cannot urinate forward.
Until he raises the urethra with his hand upwards, and he cannot correct this because semen cannot reach the womb in a straight line, which is a very ugly defect. The procedure involves having the patient lie on his back.
Then stretch his foreskin with your left hand strongly and incise the tip of the urethra with a sharp scalpel or a lancet as sharp as a penknife, or as if you are carving something to make its middle protruding like a knob and place the hole in the center as it should be.
Be careful during the operation to avoid bleeding, as this often occurs; counter it with what stops the blood and treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-Six.
On the abscess that occurs in the foreskin and glans and corruption and adhesion of the foreskin to the glans.
This abscess often occurs in the urethra, and it is a foul flesh tumor, and it can be malignant or non-malignant. The non-malignant should be treated by attaching it with a delicate forceps.
Cut it until you clean it all, then apply cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment, and then treat it with nutmeg ointment until it heals. If the abscess is malignant and of a foul color, it should be cauterized after cutting and removing it.
If the abscess is in the foreskin of an uncircumcised individual and part of the abscess is inside the foreskin and part is outside, you should first remove the part that is inside until it heals, and then treat the external part.
For if you treat them both together, you cannot be sure that the foreskin will not rupture. It may also occur in females and in the foreskin there may be blackening and corruption, so you should excise all that has turned black or is about to corrupt or has already corrupted.
Then apply honey with ground and sifted pomegranate peel and cinnamon. Then treat it with all treatments until it heals. If bleeding occurs, use cauterization with a crescent-shaped iron in this manner:.
For cauterization is beneficial for both conditions, I mean bleeding and wound if it becomes putrid. If the bandage rots and disappears completely at some time, it is necessary to insert a tube of lead into the urethra so that the patient urinates over it. As for the adherence of the dressing to the bandage.
This adhesion occurs in those whose covering is intact and who have not undergone circumcision. Adhesion may also occur due to a wound or swelling. It should be removed with a blunt probe until the bond loosens and the bandage is completely detached from all sides.
If it is difficult to distinguish it through examination, some of the bandage and the covering should be peeled off. The covering is thin and may tear quickly due to its thinness. Then separate the covering from the bandage with a thin piece of linen cloth soaked in cold water so that it does not stick as well.
Then it should be treated with a constricting drink until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-Seven.
On the purification of children and the treatment of errors that affect them.
Circumcision is nothing more than the separation of a connection, like other surgeries. However, since it is performed by our will and is used specifically for children, it is necessary to follow the best method of procedure.
The easiest path leading to safety, so I say that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books because it was not used in their religious laws; rather, it is something we have acquired.
Through experience, I found that the majority of craftsmen and cuppers use purification with a cautery and scissors, and they use the falkah and binding with thread and cutting with the nail, and I have tried all these methods.
I have not found anything better than purification with scissors and binding with thread, because purification with a cautery often adheres to the skin; since the skin of the covering has two layers, it may cut the upper layer while leaving the lower layer intact.
He is forced to make another cut and renew the pain. Purification with the falkah does not prevent cutting the tip of the urethra, as it might enter its hole. As for purification with the nail, the skin may tear, spoiling your work, or the boy's skin might be naturally short.
Many are born this way and do not need purification, and I have seen that. As for purification with scissors and binding with thread, experience has shown me its advantage because the scissors make appropriate cuts, as the blade on top is like the blade on the bottom.
When you squeeze your hand to align the blades, you cut uniformly and simultaneously, making the thread ligature resemble a wall around the urethral skin on all sides, thus avoiding any error. The first step of the procedure is to prepare the boy.
Especially if he is one who understands a little that you only tie the thread in his urethra and leave it until another day, then cheer him up and please him in every way you can with him and what he accepts with his mind, then hold him upright before you.
And he should not be sitting. Hide the scissors in your sleeve or under your foot so that the boy's eye does not fall upon it at all, nor upon any of the instruments. Then insert your hand into his urethra and blow into the skin and pull it up until the head of the urethra comes out.
Then clean it from what dirt accumulates in it, then tie the marked area with a doubled thread, then tie a second knot slightly below it. Then hold with your thumb and forefinger the lower tied area firmly, and cut between the two knots. Then quickly pull the skin up and bring out the head of the urethra, then let some blood flow, which is better and causes less swelling of the urethra. Then dry it with a damp cloth, then sprinkle it with the ashes of dried gourds that have been burned, which is the best I have tried, or flour of hawthorn, which is also excellent.
Then quickly pull the skin up and bring out the head of the urethra, then let some blood flow, which is better and causes less swelling of the urethra. Then dry it with a damp cloth, then sprinkle it with the ashes of dried gourds that have been burned, which is the best I have tried, or flour of hawthorn, which is also excellent. Then apply it from above with a cloth containing the yolk of a cooked egg mixed with rosewater and fresh, good-smelling rose oil, and leave it on until the next day. Then continue treating it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
And this is an image of the scissors that are suitable for cleansing:
It should be straight and sharp, without any bend, with the nail well fixed. The length of the blades should be equal to the length of the handles. As for the error that may occur during cleansing, you might turn the inner skin entirely or partially when cutting, so it is advisable to stretch it with your fingernail at once before the area swells.
Cut it evenly, and if you cannot hold it with your nails, pull it with a forceps and cut it. If three days have passed and the area under the head of the urethra remains swollen and inflamed, leave it until the inflammation subsides and then gently remove it.
Cut it according to what seems appropriate to you, but be careful around the head of the urethra. If any part of the head of the urethra is cut, that does not harm. Treat it with substances that heal wounds, which we described in the section on healing agents.
And if more of the skin is cut than necessary and it retracts upwards, that does not harm much either. Treat it with what we have mentioned until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-Eight.
On the treatment of retained urine in the bladder.
Retained urine in the bladder occurs due to blockage by a stone, congealed blood, pus, or protruding flesh, and the like. If you treat it with the various treatments described in the section mentioned.
If the urine does not flow and you find that its retention is due to a stone lodged in the neck of the bladder, the patient should be on their knees, sitting. Then another person should sit on the patient's back, stretching the abdomen towards the back, while the patient holds themselves as much as possible.
At that moment, the neck of the bladder will be forced to push the stone backward, allowing the urine to flow. If the urine still does not flow as mentioned and the condition worsens for the patient, it is necessary to use an instrument called a catheter, which looks like this:
It is made of silver and should be thin, smooth, hollow like the quill of a bird's feather, about a span and a half in length, with a gentle spout at its end. The way to use it for drawing urine is to take a bent thread and tie wool or cotton tightly at one end.
And you insert the end of the thread into the bottom of the catheter and cut with pliers if any part of the wool remains so that it enters the tube and plugs it like a cork, then you grease the catheter with oil or butter or egg white and seat the patient on a chair.
And you moisten his bladder and urethra with wet ointments, oil, or lukewarm water, then insert the catheter into the urethra gently until it reaches the base of the urethra, then bend the urethra upwards towards the navel, then push the catheter inside.
Until when the urethra is bent upwards, then push the catheter inside until it is close to the rectum, tilt the penis downwards with the catheter inside, then push it until it reaches the bladder and the patient feels it has reached an empty space.
It is made in this manner because the passage through which urine flows has a bend. Then, pull the thread with the wool tightly a little, for the urine will follow the wool, then remove it and the urine will flow out, and you can reuse the catheter.
Continue doing this until the bladder is emptied and the patient feels relief.
Chapter Fifty-Nine.
How to inject the bladder with a syringe.
Illustrations of the instruments suitable for this purpose are made of silver or hollowed ivory, having a long tube as thin as a pus wick. If you want to drip water and medicines into it, this is done with an instrument called a syringe, and here is its illustration:.
It is made of silver or hollowed ivory, with a long tube as thin as a millet stalk, hollowed out entirely except for the end, which is sealed and has three holes, two on one side and one on the other, as you see.
The hollow part where the projectile is placed should be of a size that fits without excess, so that when you pull it, some moisture is drawn in, and when you push it, it is expelled to a distance, similar to how a device used to throw oil in sea battles functions.
When you want to introduce moisture into the bladder, insert the tip of the syringe into the moisture and pull the plunger upwards, then the moisture will be drawn into the hollow of the syringe. Then insert its tip into the urethra as described for catheterization, and push the moisture into the bladder with the plunger.
That moisture will reach the bladder in due course until the patient feels it. Here is an illustration of another delicate injector used to inject the bladder:.
It is made of silver or espadril, with its upper end resembling a small funnel, and below it is a groove where the tie goes. Then take a camel's bladder, put in it the moisture you want to inject into the bladder, and tie it tightly between the grooves with a doubled thread.
And that moisture is warmed slightly over fire, then the tip of the injector is inserted into the urethra, then your hand tightens on the bladder with the moisture firmly until the patient feels that the moisture has reached the bladder.
If a bladder is not available, take a piece of parchment and make a circle out of it, pierce it all around, then insert a strong thread into those holes as you go around. Then gather the circle like folding a cloth after placing what you want of moisture, oils, and water inside it.
Then tie it to the machine and use it as you would with the bladder, by squeezing your hand until the moisture reaches the bladder.
Chapter Sixty.
On the Extraction of Stones.
We have mentioned in the classification the types of stones and their treatment with medicines, and I have described the difference between stones formed in the kidney and those formed in the bladder, and the signs of each. I also discussed the stone that requires manual intervention and incision.
It is the stone formed specifically in the bladder, which pierces the urethra, and I will describe this with clear explanation and brevity.
I say that the stone formed in the bladder most commonly affects young boys, and one of its signs is that urine exits the bladder resembling water in its thinness.
Sand appears in it, and they scratch their penis and fidget with it. It often hangs down, spreads out, and diarrhea is common among them. Young boys are more susceptible to this until they reach fourteen years of age, while it is difficult for the elderly. As for young adults, their condition is somewhere in between.
He whose stone is larger has his treatment easier, and the small ones are the opposite. So when we come to treat, it should first be that the patient is given an enema that expels all the waste in his intestines, for its presence may hinder the discovery of the stone.
Then take the patient by his legs, shake him downwards to make the stone descend to the neck of the bladder, or have him jump from an elevated place several times. Then sit him in front of you upright with his hands under his thighs so that the bladder is entirely tilted downward, then examine it.
Examine it from the outside, and if you feel the stone in the space, immediately incise over it. If it does not fall under your touch at all, then you should smear the index finger with oil from the left hand if the patient is a child, or the middle finger.
If he is a full-grown boy, insert it into his anus and search for the stone until it falls under your finger. Then move it little by little to the neck of the bladder. Then press on it with your finger and push it outward toward the place where you want to make the incision.
You order a servant to compress the bladder with his hand and command another servant to lift the testicles upward with his right hand, and with his other hand to pull the skin below the testicles away from the site where the incision will be made. Then you take the lancet, which looks like this:.
You incise between the anus and the testicles, not in the middle but toward the left side. The incision should be made directly over the stone, with your finger in the anus pressing it outward so that the incision is wide on the outside and narrow on the inside to allow the stone to pass through.
There is no greater [thing] for perhaps the finger in the catheter presses the stone at the incision so it comes out without difficulty, and know that there may be some stones with angles and edges which make their exit difficult for this reason.
And there are some that are smooth like acorns and rounded, which makes their exit easy. As for those with angles and edges, you should increase the incision slightly; if it still does not come out this way, you must resort to other methods, either by grasping it firmly with a tool whose end is like an abrasive.
to secure it on the stone so that it does not slip away, or insert a delicate curved tool under it; if you cannot manage it this way, widen the incision slightly; if any blood impedes you, cut it with scissors.
If there is more than one, push the larger one towards the bladder opening first, then incise for it, then push the smaller one afterward. Do the same if there are more than two. If it is extremely large, it is unwise to make a large incision because it exposes the patient to one of two dangers.
Either the patient may die, or there will be perpetual dripping of urine because the place will not heal at all. However, try to push it out until it comes out, or resort to breaking it with forceps to remove it in pieces.
When you have finished your work, wash the wound with cedar, oak galls, and sumac, then suture it. Place a cloth soaked in oil and syrup or rose ointment and cold water on top to cool the hot swelling. Then have the patient lie on their back and do not loosen the bandage until the third day.
If it dissolves, wash the area with much water and oil, then treat it with the powdered ointment and the basilicon ointment until it heals. If there is a hot swelling or corruption in the wound, such as blood clotting in the bladder and obstructing urination, this can be known from blood coming out with urine.
Insert your finger into the wound and remove that blood, for if it remains, it will lead to corruption and infection of the bladder. Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt, and treat each type as appropriate until it heals.
It is advisable during all times of treatment to bind the thighs together to keep the medicines in place that are put on the area. If the stone is small and has moved into the urethra, becoming lodged there and preventing urination, treat it with what I will describe before resorting to incision.
For I have often dispensed with incision using this treatment, as I have tried it. It involves taking a probe made of steel that looks like this:.
The tip is triangular and sharp, fixed to a handle. Then take a thread and tie it around the penis below the stone so that it does not return to the bladder. Then gently insert the steel probe into the urethra until the tip reaches the stone itself.
Rotate the probe with your hand around the stone gradually, aiming to pierce it until you penetrate through the other side. At that moment, urine will flow out. Then press your hand on what remains of the stone from the outside of the penis; it will crumble and be expelled with the urine, and the patient will heal.
And if this treatment is not possible for you due to an obstacle hindering you from doing so, tie a thread under the stone and another thread above the stone, then incise on the stone in the same rod between the two bindings, then extract it.
Then untie the binding and clean the clotted blood that has formed in the wound. The thread is tied under the stone so that it does not return to the bladder, and the other binding above so that when the thread is untied after the stone's removal, the skin returns to its place, covering the wound.
For this reason, you should, when tying the upper thread, lift the skin upwards so that it returns to its place upon finishing and covers the wound as we have said.
Chapter Sixty-One.
On Removing Stones from Women.
Stones rarely form in women. If one of them does have a stone, treating it is difficult and often impossible for various reasons: one being that the woman may be a virgin, and another being that you may not find a woman who allows herself to be examined by a doctor.
If she is chaste or a close relative, and thirdly, you may not find a woman skilled in this craft, especially the work done by hand. The fourth reason is that the location for incision on the stone in women is far from where the stone is, thus requiring a deep incision.
This carries danger. If necessity calls for it, you should seek a skilled female doctor, though they are rarely found. If you cannot find one, then request a chaste and gentle male doctor, or have a skilled midwife present, or a woman who has some knowledge of this craft.
Prepare her and order her to do all that is commanded of her for the examination of the calculus first, which is that she should look if the woman is a virgin, it is appropriate for the finger to be inserted into her anus to search for the calculus, and if she finds it, she should press it with her finger.
Then order her to part [herself], but if she is not a virgin and is married, then order the midwife to insert her finger into the patient's vagina and search for the calculus after placing her left hand on the bladder and squeezing it well.
If she finds it, she should extract it from the mouth of the bladder downwards to the extent of her ability until she reaches the base of the thigh. Then she should make an incision opposite the middle of the vulva at the base of the thigh on whichever side is accessible and where she feels the calculus.
And her finger should not move from pressing under the calculus, and let the incision be small at first, then insert the catheter through that small incision. If she feels the calculus, she should enlarge the incision to the extent she knows the calculus can come out of. Know that there are many types of calculi.
Some are small, some large, some smooth, some rough, some long, some round, and some branched. Recognize their types to determine what you need. If the blood overpowers you, sprinkle powdered zaj in the area and hold it for a while until the bleeding stops, then continue with your work.
Until the calculus is extracted, prepare the instruments mentioned for removing calculi from men to assist you in your work. If bleeding overpowers you and you determine by the pulse of the blood that an artery has been cut, apply the cauterization to the area.
And tie it firmly with bandages and leave it without returning to it, and leave the stone without extracting it, for perhaps the patient may die. Then treat the wound; if the intensity of the bleeding subsides after days and the area becomes putrefied, return to your work until you extract the stone.
Chapter Sixty-Two.
On Incising the Watery Hydrocele.
Hydrocele is a collection of moisture in the white membrane that lies beneath the skin surrounding the testicle, which is called the scrotum. This membrane may have a special sac prepared by nature on one side of the testicle.
Until it seems as if there is another testicle. It exists between the scrotal skin and the white membrane we mentioned. This rarely occurs. This hydrocele develops due to a weakness in the testicles, leading this material to accumulate. It can also occur due to an impact on the testicles.
This moisture can have various colors; it may be yellowish, or reddish like blood, or blackish like dirt, or whitish like water, and this last is the most common. These are the signs by which it is recognized.
Where the water accumulates, if it is in the white membrane we mentioned, the swelling will be round and slightly elongated like the shape of an egg, and the testicle will not be visible because the moisture surrounds it on all sides.
If the moisture is in a special sac for it, then the swelling will be round on one side of the testicle.
For this reason, a person may imagine it to be another egg. If the moisture is between the scrotum skin and the white membrane, then it can be sensed. And if you want to know the color of the moisture, then press the swelling with the square probe whose image was previously described; judge its contents by what comes out after the probe.
When we come to treatment with iron, it is advisable to order the patient to bleed if that is possible and you see his body is full. Then he should lie on his back on something slightly elevated and put many cloths under him, then you sit on his left side.
And you order a servant to sit on his right, extending his member toward one side of the scrotum skin and towards the flank of the abdomen. Then you take a wide lancet and cut the scrotum skin lengthwise from the middle nearly to the groin.
The incision should be straight, parallel to the line that divides the scrotum skin into two halves until it reaches the white membrane containing it. You peel it back and be careful not to cut it. Your peeling should be from the side that adheres more to the testicle and you extend the peeling as much as you can.
Then you widely suture the water-filled membrane and remove all the water. Then separate the edges of the incision with forceps and pull the membrane upwards without touching the scrotal skin containing it, and cut the membrane as much as possible, either in one piece or in segments.
Especially its thin side, for if you do not cut it sufficiently, you cannot be sure that the water will not return. If the testicle protrudes out of its skin while you are working, then after you finish cutting the membrane, put it back and suture the edges of the scrotum skin together.
Then treat it as you would other surgeries until it heals. If the tumor has decayed due to another disease, it is necessary to tie the vessels in the spermatic cord for fear of bleeding, then cut the testicle from the cord and remove the tumor, then treat it as we have described.
If the collected water is in both sides, then know that they are kidneys. Incise the other side as you did with the first one. If it is suitable for you to perform the procedure in the same manner, do so, then wipe away the blood.
You insert into the incisions wool that has been dipped in oil or in rose fat, and you place outside another layer of wool that has been dipped in a mixture of juice and oil, spreading it over the testicles and the abdominal muscles, then place folded cloths on top, which are the bandages. And bind it from above with a six-terminal bandage in this manner:.
Then take two cloths, sew and stuff them with loose wool as in this example, and make the ends that need to be tied from cotton or moist wool, gather them by pulling into the waistband of the pants, and one end should go around the buttocks to the back.
The second one should be taken towards the pubic area, with the two ends on the thighs below and the remaining two ends on the buttocks, and gather all the tension into the waistband of the pants. This procedure for the kidneys can also be done by cauterization instead of incision with iron.
This involves taking a slender cauterizing tool and incising the skin of the testicle while it is hot, as described, until the white membrane containing the fluid is exposed. Then take another cauterizing tool in this manner:.
It resembles the Greek eye, then apply that membrane while it is warm until all the moisture comes out, then extend the membrane with forceps and peel it with an iron, remove the layer containing [the pus] as much as you can until you completely excise it, be careful of the ovum so that fire does not touch it.
Know that this procedure is safer and less likely to cause bleeding than incision. If during the process of incision or cautery, a hot swelling or bleeding or something else occurs, you should treat each of these occurrences with the appropriate treatment as previously described.
If the patient is timid and cannot endure this procedure due to its severity, then use the poultice as I will describe. This should be validated by you according to the evidence we have provided.
The abscess is filled with fluid, so the patient should sit on a high chair. Then, apply a broad lancet to the lower part of the swelling and place the poultice along the body. Make the opening wide enough for all the fluid to drain out, then put cotton on the area and bandage it.
Leave it to drain the remaining fluid, then treat it until the wound heals. If the fluid does not drain during the poultice application, it is likely due to a white membrane obstructing the mouth of the wound and preventing the fluid from exiting.
In that case, you should insert a goose quill or the instrument used to extract the fluid from abscesses, which was previously described, or slightly enlarge the opening of the wound.
And know that the water may return and collect after six months or so, and if it collects, treat it in the same manner, and the patient should endure his days.
Chapter Sixty-Three.
On Incising the Fleshy Adrenal Gland and Its Treatment.
Know that incising this gland is one of the dangerous procedures leading to destruction in most cases; therefore, we see it better to leave it and be safe from it. I will mention the procedures concerning it and the types of swelling.
I say that many swellings may occur in the bodies that constitute the ovaries, and this can result from various causes: either from sharp residue that flows into the ovaries or from a blow. The color of the swelling is like the color of the body, and it does not contain water.
The swelling may be soft, and sometimes the swelling is hard, its color like a mole, and it has no sensation. It can result from the entanglement and swelling of the arteries, as previously mentioned, or from the swelling of the veins. If it results from the swelling of the arteries, this can be identified by the dispersion of the swelling.
If you press it with your fingers, it should not be subjected to any cutting at all. As for that which results from the swelling of the veins, nothing will disperse when pressed with the fingers. This type may be incised along with the other flesh.
This involves incising the scrotal skin, then lifting the testicle upward and extracting it from the white membrane. You must free the spermatic cord from the vessels, tie off the vessels, and cut the spermatic cord after freeing it from all sides of the testicle. If the testicle has adhered to those growing muscles.
It is necessary to extract the cyst and cut it, and if there is adhesion between any of the peritoneal layers or between the vessels, it is necessary to completely remove all that adhesion and cut it in a circular manner.
If the flesh growth is in the adhesion site which is at the back, it is necessary to cut all of it and extract the cyst as we said. Once your work is done, wash the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and drink, then treat it with all treatments until it heals.
Chapter Sixty-Four.
On the treatment of aden in the groin.
The groin swelling is a twisted lump similar to a cluster, with relaxation of the testicles, making movement, exercise, and walking difficult for the patient. The treatment of this ailment is closely related to what has been mentioned earlier.
However, it is necessary to mention the procedure as performed by our predecessors. I say that the patient should sit on a high chair, then push the testicles downward with a scoop, and hold the skin of the testicle with your fingers along with the vessels that are close to the penis.
And a servant other than you should hold them and stretch them tightly, then cut with a wide sharp scalpel along the vessels until they are exposed. Then peel from both sides as I mentioned in the section on dissecting the arteries in the limbs, then sew them with a needle containing a doubled thread.
Tie it at the first places where the groin swelling appeared and also tie it at the end. Then, cut it in the middle with a vertical incision along the body and remove all the foul and corrupt moisture that has accumulated inside.
Then treat the wound as you would other wounds that require a period for the vessels nourishing one of the ovaries to fall off, and there is no harm in that. If all the vessels are exposed to the ovarian ligament, it is necessary to remove one of the ovaries with the vessels so that the egg does not lack nutrition. Before cutting the vessels, they wither and are no longer useful.
Chapter Sixty-Five.
On the treatment of urinary incontinence.
This incontinence occurs due to a hernia that appears in the abdominal membrane extending over the abdomen, near the inguinal regions from the abdominal cavities, causing urine to flow from that hernia into one of the ovaries.
This hernia can either be due to a tear in the abdominal membrane or its extension. These two types occur due to various causes, such as a blow, a jump, a shout, lifting something heavy, and so on. Its sign, if it is due to the extension of the abdominal membrane, is that it occurs gradually over a long period of time.
It does not happen suddenly, and the swelling is flat to a certain depth because the abdominal membrane compresses the urine. Its sign, if it is due to a tear in the abdominal membrane, is that it causes severe pain immediately from the beginning, and the swelling appears differently under the skin, close by.
This occurs when urine exits and moves outside the abdominal membrane, and sometimes pus may come out with the urine. This type of incontinence is called urinary and purulent, and it can also occur with gas. Sometimes feces may flow into the urine and get stuck there, leading to the patient's death.
For it causes severe pain and rumbling, especially if squeezed. The treatment of these types of ailments with iron is dangerous so you should be wary of it. The method is to order the patient to return the excrement with his hand into his body if returning is possible.
Then he lies on his back before you and raises his legs. Then stretch the skin next to the scrotum upwards, and cut the skin of the testicles entirely lengthwise, then sew the edges of the incision with sutures as needed to open the incision.
The incision should be large enough for the egg to come out. Then peel off the membranes under the skin of the testicle until the hard white membrane is exposed on both sides. At that point, insert your index finger next to the egg.
Between the white membrane under the egg's skin and the second membrane, release the adhesion behind the egg. Then fold it with your right hand inside the scrotal skin, while at the same time stretching the white membrane upwards with your left hand and lifting the egg with the membrane to the side of the incision.
You order the servant to lift the egg upwards, and you completely release the adhesion from behind. Check with your finger to ensure there is no twisted intestine in the hard white membrane; if you find any, push it down into the abdomen below.
Then take a needle with a thick thread that is made from ten threads, and insert it at the end of the membrane under the scrotal skin that is next to the incision. Then cut the ends of the twisted thread until there are four threads. Then arrange some of them on each other in a stiff form and bind with it the peritoneum which we said is under the scrotal skin tightly from both sides, then also wrap the ends of the threads and tie them tightly so that nothing of the vessels which nourish them can reach them. So that a hot swelling does not occur and also becomes a second binding emerging from the first binding, away from it less than two fingers, and after these two bindings, leave of the peritoneum which is under the scrotal skin the amount of a finger bone.
So that a hot swelling does not occur and also becomes a second binding emerging from the first binding, away from it less than two fingers, and after these two bindings, leave of the peritoneum which is under the scrotal skin the amount of a finger bone. And all of the remaining part is cut around, and the testicle is removed with it, then a slit is made below the scrotal skin from which blood flows as we described earlier, then use wool soaked in oil and place it in the wound, and use the binding as we described.
And the white peritoneum that we mentioned after cutting it may be cauterized to prevent bleeding, as this often occurs. The binding is left until it falls off by itself; if its falling off is delayed, wash it with hot water and apply something that causes sweating until it falls off.
Then treat the wound with the rest of the treatments for wounds until it heals.
Chapter Sixty-Six.
On Hydrocele This air-containing hydrocele, I have not seen anyone dare to treat it with iron. The ancients mentioned that it should be done as we described for the hydrocele with a dartos flap, which is to tie the vessels gently below after making an incision.
Then cut in the middle and treat the swelling with what opens it until the vessels fall out, and treat the wound as mentioned until it heals.
Chapter Sixty-Seven.
On the hernia that occurs in the armpit.
A hernia may occur in the armpit as we said, where the area protrudes but nothing of the intestine descends to the arm; if it does descend, it is minimal and returns at all times.
However, if the condition persists over time, the split in the abdominal wall increases until the intestine and hernia descend into the scrotum. This occurs due to the extension of the abdominal wall that is in the armpit as we said. This is because the abdominal wall extends, then relaxes and weakens the area, causing it to protrude. Its treatment is by cauterization as I have described previously.
It can also be treated with iron in this manner: the patient lies on their back in front of you, then cut the protruding swollen hernia area transversely to about three fingers' width, then separate the abdominal walls beneath the skin.
Until the white abdominal wall beneath is exposed, then take a probe and place it on the protruding area of the abdominal wall, pressing it to the depth of the abdomen. Then sew the two protruding areas at the end of the probe on the abdominal wall together with sutures.
Then remove the probe end without cutting the abdominal wall at all, and do not touch the testicle or anything else as I informed you in the treatment of intestinal hernia. Then treat it according to the treatment of wounds.
When the threads are cut, clean them and set the wound until it heals, for the hernia retracts and does not increase the bulge.
And cauterization is better in this area because it is closer to safety.
Chapter Sixty-Eight.
On the relaxation of the scrotal skin.
The skin of the scrotum often relaxes in some people without the inner flesh relaxing, which makes its appearance unattractive. Therefore, whoever wishes to treat it should lay the patient on their back.
Cut all the relaxed skin on the thick skin, then bring the edges together. If you wish, first sew the excess relaxed skin with three or four sutures and make sure the suturing is secure, then cut what is between the sutures.
Then treat it as you would other wounds until it heals and the threads fall off.
Chapter Sixty-Nine.
On castration.
Castration is forbidden in our Sharia.
For this reason, I should not have mentioned it in this book. However, I mentioned it for two reasons: the first is so that it may be known to the physician if asked about it and to know how to treat those affected by it. The second reason is that we often need to castrate some animals for our benefit.
Like rams and bulls and cats and similar animals, I say that castration can be done in two ways, either by squeezing or by cutting. That which is done by squeezing is performed by placing the animal in hot water until its testicles relax, soften, and hang down.
Then squeeze them with your hand until they dissolve and are not noticeable upon touch. As for castration by cutting, you should hold the animal, grasp the skin of its testicles with your left hand, then tie the scrotal sacs and make one incision on each testicle.
Until the two testicles emerge, then cut them after peeling and do not leave any of the membranes on them except for the thin membrane that covers the vessels. This method of castration is better than the one done by squeezing.
Because squeezing may leave some of the testicles, causing the animal to still desire mating. Then treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Seventy.
On the treatment of intersex conditions.
Intersex conditions in men occur in two types. The first is when a form resembling a female genitalia appears below the pubic area or on the scrotal skin between the testicles, with hair present, and urine may flow from the part on the scrotal skin.
As for women, there is one type where it appears above the vagina on the pubic hair area, resembling a small male genitalia protruding outward, one of which resembles a penis and the other two resemble testicles. The treatment for the three types.
The two types of men and the one type of women should have that excess flesh cut until its trace is removed, then treat it as you would other wounds until it heals. As for the second type of men from whom urine comes out in the skin of the testicle, there is no procedure for it nor any cure at all.
Chapter Seventy-One.
On the Removal of the Clitoris and Excess Flesh from Women's Genitals.
The clitoris may sometimes exceed the natural size until it becomes ugly and its appearance is repulsive. It may also enlarge in some women to the point that it spreads like in men and affects intercourse.
It is advisable to grasp the excess part of the clitoris with your hand or a forceps and cut it, but do not excessively cut, especially at the depth of the base, to avoid causing bleeding.
Then treat it as you would treat wounds until it heals. As for the excess flesh, it grows in the mouth of the womb until it fills it.
And sometimes it protrudes outward like a tail. For this reason, some of the early practitioners called it the tail disease. It should be cut as you would cut the clitoris, and then treat it until it heals.
Chapter Seventy-Two.
On the Treatment of Hernia.
Hernia is when the woman's vagina is not perforated or the opening is very small, which can either be natural from birth or acquired. The acquired type results from a previous condition and may be due to excess growth of flesh.
Or it is thin or thick adhesion, and it may be in the depth of the uterus or its sides or its upper part or lower part, and it prevents intercourse and conception and childbirth, and sometimes menstruation; knowledge of this is by the midwife's examination.
If the obstruction is visible and close, if it is not visible, then examine it with her fingers or a probe. If the obstruction is from thin adhesion and is close to the lips, then promptly puncture it, which means to make something like supports on the lips, then place your thumbs of both hands together.
And the woman lies on her back with her legs apart, then she stretches the lips forcefully until she punctures the thin adhesion and the obstruction opens. Then she takes wool, soaks it in oil, and places it on the area. She should have intercourse every day so that the area does not close again.
If the adhesion is thick and dense, it should be cut with a wide scalpel resembling a reed leaf. If the obstruction is from grown flesh, then grasp it with forceps and cut it. Have medicines that stop bleeding without irritation, such as scammony, psyllium, and frankincense mixed with egg white.
Then use a wide lead tube to prevent the wound from closing quickly, keep it in place for several days, and use a wick of dry linen. Then treat it with all treatments for ulceration until it heals. Sometimes other flesh growths may occur in the uterus, which should be cut out in the same manner.
Unless it is a cancerous tumor, for a cancerous tumor in the uterus should not be treated with iron at all.
Chapter Seventy-Three.
On the treatment of hemorrhoids, warts, and red boils that appear in women's genital areas.
As for hemorrhoids, it is the swelling of the ends of veins until much blood flows from them constantly. When hemorrhoids become severe, they turn into warts. I have mentioned in the classification their types and signs, and I will mention here.
What can be treated and what cannot be treated, so I say that if the hemorrhoids and warts are deep inside the uterus and do not appear to the senses, they cannot be treated with iron. What appears at the mouth of the uterus and is perceptible is what can be treated.
It is advisable that the woman enters a cool room, then stretches the warts with a probe or a coarse cloth and cuts them from their roots. Then, when bleeding occurs, apply one of the blood-stopping agents without cauterization.
Use substances like oak bark, sycamore juice, mastic, and the like. Then, raise her legs against the wall for an hour, then let them hang in cold water. If bleeding continues, sit her in a decoction of sorrel, pomegranate peel, alkanet, and the like. Then take barley flour and knead it with honey and vinegar.
Apply it to her back as a dressing; if the bleeding stops, otherwise persist with strong cupping of the veins and breasts without restriction. Then take some wool, soak it in the juice of chicory or the juice of squirting cucumber or the juice of buckthorn branches mixed with alkanet drink, and apply it to the area.
When the swelling subsides, treat the area with ointment until it heals. As for the red boil, it resembles the heads of the hāsha, rough in appearance; it is appropriate to cut off what appears of it as mentioned regarding warts, and treat it until it heals.
Chapter Seventy-Four.
On the suppuration that occurs in the uterus.
Various types of tumors may occur in the uterus, such as cancer, hardened tumors, ulcers, debility, eating sores, polyps, hemorrhoids, fissures, warts, and hot tumors. I have mentioned all these diseases, their types, and their symptoms in the classification.
It is appropriate to mention in this article the hot tumor that occurs in the uterus, if it is one of the tumors that accumulate over a period, how its suppuration should be treated with iron. One should observe if the pain of the tumor at the beginning is sharp, accompanied by pulsation, inflammation, and fever.
And if you see that it is red and sensitive to touch, do not rush to suppurate it; treat it with what aids in ripening until these symptoms subside. Once they have subsided, the woman should then sit on a chair with two seats and lean on her back.
She should draw her legs toward the lower abdomen, with her thighs spread apart, and place her arms under her knees, securing them with a suitable binding.
For this purpose, the midwife should sit on the right side and use the instrument that opens the cervix, which will be illustrated later. If you intend to use this instrument, you should estimate with a probe the depth of the woman's uterus so that the part of the instrument inserted does not exceed the depth of the uterus.
The patient is harmed if the instrument exceeds the depth, so padding should be placed on the edge of the cervix to prevent the entire instrument from entering the depth of the womb, and the spiral that runs through the instrument should come from the upper side.
You hold the instrument and the servant turns the spiral until the cervix is opened, and when the pus appears and is felt by hand being soft and thin, you should cut it at its head with a wide scalpel, and once you have completely drained all of it.
A soft wick should be placed in the wound, soaked in rose oil or green oil that has some astringent properties. The wick should protrude from the incision in the cervix, and outside on the womb and the pubic area, clean wool soaked in water boiled with alum should be applied.
Then it should be treated after two days with the ointment suitable for that until it heals.
The womb and the wound may be washed by injecting them with water and honey, then with water in which the root of the senna or long zerafand has been boiled, then return to the ointment, if the pus is hidden inside the womb.
It should be treated without using iron but rather with what we have mentioned in the division.
Chapter Seventy-Five.
On instructing midwives how to treat live fetuses that emerge in an unnatural position.
The midwife should first know the signs of a natural birth. Among its signs are when you see the woman bending downward and longing to breathe in air, and her labor becomes easier for her.
And the fetus is quick to exit, so know that this birth will be in a natural form and it will come out head first with the afterbirth with it or hanging from its navel. If you see these signs, then you should squeeze her abdomen so that the fetus exits quickly.
For if it descends head first, the afterbirth will come with it and it will be well cleansed of those superfluous things. Any birth other than this is unnatural and blameworthy because the fetus may come out feet first or hands before its head and feet.
It may come out with one hand or one foot, or its head and a hand, or it may come out folded, or it might turn over on its back, and other blameworthy forms. The midwife should be skilled and delicate in all these matters and beware of errors and mistakes.
And I explain each of these forms and how to handle them so that you may understand and be aware. If the fetus comes out head first in a natural manner, but the woman finds it intense and labor is difficult, and you see her strength weakening, then sit her on a chair and have women hold her steady.
Bind her womb with cooked fenugreek and moist ointments, then the midwife should insert a small blade between her fingers to cut the afterbirth or tear it with her nails until the moisture inside flows out, and squeeze the woman's abdomen until the fetus descends.
If it does not descend, the woman should be infused with fenugreek juice mixed with suet. Then after the infusion, she should be ordered to strain herself and tickle her nose with cumin while holding her mouth and nose shut, for then the fetus will come out at once. If the hands of the fetus emerge first, they should be gently pushed back little by little.
If the hands cannot enter, place the woman on a stand and raise her legs upwards, then shake the stand on the ground while the woman holds on so she does not fall during the shaking. If the hands cannot enter and the fetus dies, cut them off and pull out the rest of the fetus.
Or bind his hands with a cloth and pull them gently, for it will come out. If the fetus comes out on its feet, you should push them upwards then gradually turn the fetus until it is aligned, then take one of its legs and stretch it little by little.
When they reach the thighs, order her to bear down and tickle her with cundus, for it will come out. If it does not come out as described, then gradually return the fetus until it is in its natural shape, for it will then come out smoothly. If it resists all of the above methods.
Take the saliva of the linseed, the saliva of the fenugreek, the fat of the shirjing, and dissolved gum, and pound them all together in a mortar thoroughly. Then apply it to the woman's vagina and lower abdomen. Then sit her in lukewarm water until it reaches the hips.
When you see that the lower part has softened, make her a suppository of honey and have her bear with it. If she holds the suppository for an hour, then sit her on a chair, tickle her, close her mouth and nose, and gently press her lower abdomen; the fetus will come out at that moment. If the fetus comes out on its knees and hands.
If it comes out in this manner, gradually insert your hands. Then the woman should lie on her back with her legs hanging down below while lying on a bed, clasp her hands, and gently press above her abdomen little by little. Then remove the pillows from under her legs so that the lower part is elevated. If the fetus does not come out, take both of her legs and move them with a strong motion, then squeeze above the thighs little by little until the fetus rises up, then the midwife inserts her hand and adjusts the fetus little by little.
Order the woman to strain until the fetus comes out, if the fetus comes out with one of its hands extended and stuck, try to retract the hand, if she cannot retract it then make her stand and walk, if she cannot walk then have her lie down.
Make her lie on her bed and shake her legs strongly, then use the traction device described from the levers. If labor begins, sit her on a chair, then work on retracting the hand and aligning the fetus to its normal position, make the woman sneeze and order her to strain until it comes out.
If the fetus comes out on its back, with its arms spread and its face toward its mother's back, the midwife should grasp the fetus's hand, then turn it little by little and align it gently. Once aligned, apply what we described of oil and levers to its front.
Then have her move little by little. Once she does that, sit her on the chair and order her to lean to the right side, then have her strain and make her sneeze with cinder, for it will come out, the fetus coming out standing on its side.
If it descends to the mouth of the womb in this manner with the afterbirth, cut the afterbirth with your nail until it is free from moisture. If it clings to the face and neck of the fetus, cut it from the navel so that it does not suffocate and die, then push the fetus inside until it is in the proper position.
And he ordered the woman to strain several times, for it comes out easily, like twins or many fetuses. Know that twins are often born, and three or four may be born and live, though this is rare. As for five, it is something outside of nature and they do not live at all.
And a single placenta surrounds them even if they are many, and they are separated by a membrane barrier connected to the navel of each one of them. They may come out as a single fetus does, in a natural and easy birth, or they may come out in a problematic manner as we have described.
If some of them are difficult to deliver and become in the unnatural forms we mentioned, then treat them as described. Let the midwife be gentle and do what she does with tenderness and caution, and adapt to each form with the skill that leads to safety.
What may be conceived in the womb and then abort: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, or more than ten may be conceived. It has been confirmed to me that a woman aborted seven, and another aborted fifteen, all of them having taken form.
By the wisdom of the All-Knowing, all of this should be known to the midwife, for such situations may fall upon her one day, and she should handle them appropriately.
Chapter Sixty-Seven.
On the Extraction of a Stillborn Fetus.
If you have treated the stillborn fetus with the methods mentioned in the section on treatment, and it has not been delivered, and circumstances compel you to use manual intervention, then you should assess whether the woman is strong and does not exhibit any symptoms that could cause harm. If so, the woman should lie down on her back on a bed.
Her head should be tilted downward and her legs raised, with an attendant holding her on both sides or tying her to the bed so that her body does not shift when the fetus is pulled.
Then, she moistens the mouth of the womb with moist ointments mixed with the saliva of the linseed, fenugreek, and flaxseed. The midwife then applies these ointments and salves to her hands, gently inserts them into the womb, and seeks a place to insert the forceps for the fetus, finding suitable locations for that purpose.
If the fetus is positioned to be delivered headfirst, insert the forceps into its eyes, or at the back of its head, or in its mouth, or in its palate, or under its chin, or in the areas near the ribs, or below the floating ribs.
And if it is to be delivered feet first, then [insert the forceps] in the groin and the middle ribs. It is advisable to hold the forceps with the right hand, with its curve between the fingers of the left hand, gently insert the hand, and pierce the forceps into one of those areas we have mentioned.
Until you reach an empty space, then insert another forceps opposite it, or a third if needed, to ensure the pulling is even and does not tilt to one side. Then pull steadily, but do not pull in a straight line only; instead, move it in all directions.
To facilitate its exit, as is done with a tooth when it is extracted. In between, the pulling should be relaxed; if one part is stuck, the midwife should apply some ointment to her fingers and insert them from that side to rotate what is stuck. If part of the fetus comes out, then move the forceps to other positions.
It is raised slightly to do this until the fetus comes out entirely, but if a hand comes out first and cannot be returned due to compression, it should wrap a cloth around it then pull it until it all comes out and cut it.
Either in the wrist joint or in the elbow, and so it should be done with the other hand and the legs. If the fetus's head is large and faces difficulty in coming out or if there is water gathered in its head, you should insert a spiked forceps between the fingers.
And with it, you split the head to let out the water or crack it with an instrument called the mashdakh, whose image comes with the images of all other instruments in the chapter that follows this.
You should do the same if the fetus naturally has a large head; you should split or crush the skull with the mashdakh as mentioned, then extract the bones with forceps. If the head comes out but is compressed at the clavicle, it should be cut to allow the moisture in the chest to drain.
Then the chest will contract. If the chest does not contract and cannot come out, cut it as much as you can. If the lower abdomen is swollen or has a tumor, you should press it to let the moisture flow out.
If the fetus is in a breech position, pulling it out is easy and aligning it to the mouth of the womb is simple. If it gets compressed at the abdomen or chest, you should pull it with a cloth wrapped around your hand and cut the abdomen or chest until what's inside flows out.
If all the organs are extracted and the head recoils and is retained, then the midwife should insert her left hand; if the mouth of the womb is open, she inserts her hand into the neck of the womb and seeks the head with it and pulls it by the fingers to the mouth of the womb, then she inserts a forceps or two forceps and pulls it with them.
If the mouth of the womb has closed due to a hot swelling, it should not be forcibly treated. Instead, at this time, moist and fatty substances should be applied, dressings should be used, and sitting in water that relaxes and moisturizes is recommended.
And if the fetus is on its side, if it can be aligned, then use what we mentioned for a live fetus. If that cannot be done, then it should be cut and removed. It is necessary that nothing of the afterbirth be left inside at all. Once you are finished with the treatment, apply what we mentioned regarding the treatment of hot swellings that occur in the wombs.
If bleeding occurs, she should bathe in astringent water and use the other treatments. I have witnessed a woman who had been pregnant, and the fetus died inside her, then she became pregnant again while still carrying the dead fetus.
Then the other fetus also died. After a long time, a swelling appeared in her lower abdomen, which swelled until it burst and began to discharge pus. I was called to treat her, and I treated her for a long time, but the wound would not heal, so I applied some of the strong adhesive ointments to it.
A bone came out from the site, and after some days, another bone came out. I was amazed by this because the abdomen is a place without bones, so I estimated that they were the bones of the dead fetus. I examined the wound and extracted many bones from the fetal head.
I continued doing that until I extracted many bones from her, and the woman was in the best of conditions. She lived for a long time with some pus oozing from the place, and I only mention this rarity here.
Because it contains knowledge and assistance for what the skilled doctor attempts to treat with his hands.
Chapter Seventy-Seven.
It contains images of the tools needed for extracting the fetus.
Image of a speculum used to open the mouth of the womb:.
This clamp, with which books are leveled, has two screws at the ends of the two pieces of wood. However, this screw should be finer than the clamp and should be made either of boxwood or pine wood, and the width of each piece of wood should be the thickness of two fingers.
And their thickness is about the size of a finger, and their length is one and a half palms. In the middle of the two pieces of wood are two rods made of the same type of wood, firmly attached to them. Their length should be about half a palm or slightly more, and their width should be about two fingers or slightly more. These two rods.
These are the ones that enter the mouth of the womb to open it when you turn the screws. Image of another tool for the same purpose, finer and lighter:.
It is made from boxwood or pine wood in the shape of forceps, except that it has two rods at its end, as you see. The length of each rod is about one palm, and their width is two fingers. When you want to open the womb with it.
Sit the woman on a bed with her legs hanging down and spread apart at the knees, then insert these two guides together into the mouth of the womb while you hold the end of the instrument below between her thighs; then open your hand with the instrument as you would with forceps to the extent that you desire to open the womb. Until the midwife does what she wants, an image of another loop mentioned by the earlier authorities:.
Image of the instrument used to expel the fetus:.
Image of the instrument used to soften the head of the fetus:.
It resembles scissors with teeth at the end as you see, and it can be made rectangular like forceps as shown in this image, having teeth like a saw to cut and scrape with:.
Image of another instrument:.
Image of forceps:.
This forceps should be slightly thick so it does not break when pulling the fetus with it, image of two-pronged forceps:.
Image of two broad knives for cutting the fetus:.
All these instruments, the more their types increase and are prepared by the maker, the faster he can work and the higher his skill is regarded by people. Do not disdain any instrument from being prepared, as there may be a need for it.
Chapter Seventy-Eight.
On the Extraction of the Afterbirth.
If the afterbirth is retained after childbirth, it is necessary to instruct the patient to hold herself and then tickle her with cundus and place your hand over her mouth and nose. If it comes out by this method, otherwise take a measure.
Pierce a hole in the lid and place within it the crushed herbs that open the womb, such as fennel, thyme, aniseed, camomile, mugwort, silicium, and centaury. Use all of these medicines or some of them, immerse them in water, and carry it to the fire. Then place a silver tube on the hole of the pot lid with the other end in the mouth of the womb.
Hold it until the steam reaches the bottom of the womb, then tickle as we said, for the afterbirth will come out quickly. If it remains after this treatment and does not come out, instruct the midwife to dip her left hand in pig fat or elephant saliva.
Then insert it into the vagina and search for the afterbirth with it. If she finds it, she should grasp it and pull it out gradually. If it is attached deep in the womb, insert the hand as described until you find the afterbirth, then pull it out little by little cautiously.
So that the womb does not fall out due to strong pulling, it should be moved gently to the sides, right and left, then increase the amount of pulling, for it will respond at that time and become detached. If the mouth of the womb is closed, we have described the treatment with tickling and the pot and herbs.
If it does not come out with all that we have described, do not be forceful in attempting to pull it again. Instead, tie what has come out from it to the mouth of the womb and to the woman's thigh, then administer the quadruple ointment, for it will cause it to rot after a few days.
And it dissolves and exits, except that if it putrefies, then a foul smell rises from it to the stomach and head, which harms the patient; therefore, suitable fat should be used.
Therefore, some of the early practitioners have tried the smoke of pitch and dried figs, a picture of the machine with which the woman is vaporized when menstruation and afterbirth are retained, and so on:
It is made from lead resembling a funnel or made from copper, with the narrow end placed in the vagina and the wide end over fire. The incense prepared on hot coals is held until that incense is gone, then repeat with more.
Chapter Seventy-Nine.
On the treatment of unperforated anal fistula.
Many boys may be born with their anus unperforated, blocked by a thin membrane. The midwife should pierce this membrane with her finger, or if not, she should use a sharp lancet, being careful not to touch the muscle.
Then she places wool soaked in the decoction and oil on it, and treats it with ointments until it heals. If you fear it might close up again, place a lead tube in the opening for many days, removing it when the child needs to defecate.
The anus may also become blocked due to the healing of a wound or a swelling. It should be incised where it has healed, and then treated with the treatments we have mentioned, including the use of lead.
Chapter Eighty.
On the treatment of abscesses that occur below.
Abscesses that occur below are a complex and thickening that happens near the anus from the outside or in the space on one of the sides, and the abscess can be one or more.
If that complex persists for a long time, it opens and a white watery moisture or thin pus flows from it. Some of these abscesses may extend to the rectum and intestine, while others do not extend. The extending ones can be identified by what comes out with the stool and gas when the patient defecates.
And sometimes worms may come out of it. Some of them may be abscesses extending from the space to the bladder and the urethra, and some may extend to the hip joint and the tailbone. What distinguishes the extended abscess to the anus from the non-extended is known as well.
Insert your index finger into the anus and insert a thin probe into the abscess, made of copper or iron if there is no bend in the abscess. If there is a bend, then insert a thin lead probe or a horsehair into it.
Until you feel the probe or the hair with your finger. If you do not feel it at all, and nothing of stool, gas, or worms comes out of the opening as we said, then know that it is not extended, so proceed promptly to treatment.
If the abscess extends to the bladder or the urinary tract, the indication is urine coming out of it and its resistance to healing with medications. As for if it extends to the hip joint or the tailbone, its sign is the probe reaching that area.
If there is no deviation to the bone and the pain is in its vicinity, and pus continuously comes out of it, and no treatment works nor does it heal with ointment, these penetrating abscesses do not heal at all.
Treating them is futile labor for those ignorant doctors who attempt to treat it. As for those that are not penetrating and not chronic, there is hope for their cure with the iron as I will describe and what I have experimented with, which is to have the patient lie down in front of you on his back.
Lift his legs up and let his thighs slope towards his abdomen, then insert a copper or lead probe into the abscess if there is a deviation until you know where the probe ends. If the patient feels it near the anus, you should insert your index finger into the anus.
If you feel the probe has penetrated on its own and is exposed without sensing any membrane or flesh between your finger and it, then know for certain that it is penetrating. Do not labor over it, as it will not heal, as we have said.
It has been said that it may heal in some people, though rarely. Among the treatments that may be beneficial is to heat a thin iron on according to the size of the abscess as previously mentioned, and insert it hot into the abscess until it reaches near the anus, then repeat this two or three times.
Until you know that all the excess flesh that has formed, which resembles a bird's feather tube, has been burned off. Then treat it with a cloth soaked in fat until the burned flesh comes out. Then treat it with healing ointments; if it heals.
And if it does not heal with any other treatment ever, and if you insert the probe and it does not reach your finger which is in the fistula and there is a thick barrier of flesh or mesentery between them and you see the sinus beyond the skin surface then incise the skin from the beginning of the sinus. And you pass through the incision with the probe while it is in the sinus until the incision reaches where the end of the probe is, and the probe is removed and falls out, then clean those encrusted flesh that resembles a bird's feather tube and do not leave any of it.
Then treat it with suturing ointments until it heals. If the blood overpowers you and prevents you from completing your task of cutting that flesh, the best thing to do and what is most beneficial is to cauterize it with fire or a sharp medicine, for cauterization with fire combines two good conditions: burning off that excess flesh.
And stop the bleeding and dry out the moisture, then treat it with linen soaked in fat or sulfur powdered with oil until pus forms and the burned flesh is expelled with the pus. Then treat the wound with suturing ointments that promote the growth of strong flesh.
These are the medicines that constrict and dry. For if it heals, it is cured, and there will be no recurrence. If the sinus extends to the depth of the fistula and is far from the surface of the body, insert your finger into the fistula and explore with it.
If you feel the probe and there is a barrier of mesentery or flesh between it and you, and it is close to penetrating, then the treatment should be one of hopeful measures. This involves using one of three methods: either cauterizing it as mentioned.
And either you cut it until you reach its bottom so that you can introduce the thread and treatment closely, and do not extend the incision lest you cut the muscle surrounding the anus, causing the patient to involuntarily release excrement. Then treat him with what we mentioned, for he may be healed as we said.
And either you penetrate that membrane and pierce it after you have cut it close to the anus as we said, either with a probe or with another sharp instrument, then clean all the clotted flesh in the incision as much as you can by searching thoroughly.
Then, sew up the entire wound including the incision and the upper opening until it is sealed, leaving the fistula open inside the anus, which is less burdensome for the patient. The fistula may heal in this manner.
This is when you insert the probe into the fistula, and it is on one side of the anus towards the surface of the body with the skin and the anal ring. At this point, take a probe with a perforated tip like a cobbler’s needle in this manner:.
And insert a braided thread of five threads or so, then introduce the probe with the thread into the fistula until it reaches the bottom. If it penetrates the anal ring internally nearby.
Then, pull the thread out through that hole by inserting your finger into the anus and pulling out the end of the thread. Gather both ends together and tighten them. Leave it for a day or two. Each time the thread cuts into the flesh, tighten it well until the flesh between the ends of the threads falls off. Then treat the wound until it heals and is cured.
If the fistula's mouth is not open, then open it however you can, except if it is deep, for fear of cutting the muscle, then treat it as mentioned until it heals.
The image of the spinal scalpel used to cut fistulas has a very sharp edge, and the other side is not sharp so as not to cut what is not needed, as you see.
Chapter Eighty-One.
On the treatment of hemorrhoids that bleed, their removal, and the treatment of fissures.
Hemorrhoids are of two types: either they are inside the anus, resembling red blisters or like grape buds, and they vary in size, small and large, with blood constantly flowing from them.
They can be singular or numerous, and they can be outside the anus or at its edges. However, those that are outside the anus are usually less moist, with yellow water or a little constant flowing blood, and they are of the same color as the body.
The treatment for those inside the anus is to instruct the patient to defecate and strain until the anus protrudes, and the warts become visible to you. Then quickly grasp them with forceps or hold them with your nail and cut them at their bases. If the forceps do not hold due to their moisture and laxity.
So scrape them with a coarse cloth or a piece of roasted bread, or pull them out with your fingers, then cut them. After cutting, sprinkle some sharp powders on them to serve as cauterization, or treat them as previously described in the section on cauterization.
Then treat it with all treatments until it heals, and if the hemorrhoids do not respond to you for evacuation, then enema the patient with an enema containing a slight irritant so that it washes what is in the hemorrhoids and will respond quickly to evacuation when the patient strains. As for the warts protruding from the hemorrhoids, their condition is easy and simple.
It is to take it with your nail or hang it with a hook and cut it, then treat it as we have mentioned until it heals. And for those who dislike cutting with iron, you should use piercing it in this manner: take a twisted thread and insert it into a needle.
Then pull the wart upwards and pierce it with a needle at its base from the other side, and wrap the ends of the thread below the needle which is transverse, and tighten the wart tightly, then tie the thread and remove the needle. Do this to all warts except leave one that you do not pierce.
Let the blood residue flow from it, then place on the hemorrhoids a cloth soaked in rose oil or kerotai and put it on the hemorrhoids and instruct the patient to rest then leave it until they fall off. Once the warts have fallen off, treat them with ointments and other treatments until they heal.
As for the treatment of fissures, they often occur due to dryness of excrement and constipation. If it persists and medication does not work, you should scrape it with a scalpel or your nail until it becomes moist and the top layer of scab that prevents healing is removed.
Then treat it until it heals properly. If it does not heal, repeat it with a more severe scraping until it bleeds well and the skin is removed, then treat it, for it will heal.
Chapter Eighty-Two.
On the treatment of reversed and non-reversed nails, dry warts, and scabies.
A nail is a round knot on the color of the body, resembling the head of a nail, found all over the body, especially on the soles of the feet and the fingers, and it causes pain when walking.
It should be cut around the nail, held with a forceps or pincers, and pulled out from its root, then treat it. If you wish, cauterize it as previously described in its section. As for dry warts, each one is a small, rough, thickened, round elevation on the surface of the body.
They often appear on the hands of children, and their treatment is to stretch the wart, cut it, or prick it with a silk thread or a hair until it falls off. If you wish, cauterize it as previously described with fire or a sharp medicine.
Warts, whether reversed or not, can be removed with the instrument I will describe in the treatment of scabies. As for scabies, it is also a small, thickened elevation on the surface of the body that extends very deep, and if exposed to cold, it feels like the sting of an ant.
It can be found all over the body, mostly on the hands. Its treatment is to take a tube from the feather of a goose or a strong eagle feather and position that tube on the scabies until the tube encircles it completely, then rotate your hand with the tube until you cut what surrounds the scabies.
You insert it into the depth of the flesh and extract the splinter from its root, and if you wish, you can do this with a copper or iron tube in this manner:.
The top of the tube should be narrow, sealed, and twisted to make it easier for the fingers to control and twist it, and if you wish, you can cauterize the splinter as previously described in the cauterization of warts in the chapter on cauterization.
Chapter Eighty-Three.
On the forms of instruments used for injections in ailments of constipation, diarrhea, and prolapse.
The syringe may be made of silver, or of china, or of hollowed or beaten copper, and this instrument may be made in small and large sizes according to the users. That which is used for treating small children should be small, and for those with narrow or painful bowels, their syringes should be very gentle. Image of a large syringe:.
The upper end of the tube, where the bulb is attached, should be wide in this manner and have a barrier where the bulb is tied, as you see. The lower end which enters the rectum should be sealed and very smooth to narrowness, with two holes on one side and one hole on the other side.
The size of the hole should be as thick as a thread or slightly thicker. The bulb, in which the medicines are placed, should be made from an animal bladder or lamb's skin, shaped like a small flask, with a diameter of one finger-breadth.
He makes many holes as he turns, and there is the thickness of a finger between each hole. Then, he inserts into those holes a strong thread of twined linen from ten threads or so, and with it, he sews up the wound like a sail. When the medicine is placed in it, he tightens the tip of the syringe tightly between two stones, then he injects with it. This is the image of the wound and the hole:
The method of using it is to fill the pouch or bladder with medicine while it is warmed to the patient's tolerance; be careful that it is not too hot or too cold. Then, the patient lies on his back and lifts his legs upwards.
And place a pillow or blanket under him, then anoint the tip of the syringe with oil or egg white or fenugreek juice or the like, then insert it into the rectum gently. Then, the one administering the enema takes both ends in his hands and squeezes forcefully until all that is in the syringe is emptied into the bowel.
Then, the syringe is removed and the patient lifts his legs against the wall. If the medicine induces movement for excretion, he should hold it in as much as he can; even if he holds it all night, it will be more effective for absorption. If it is used for treating diarrhea and he wishes to expedite its exit, then repeat the enema until recovery.
If there are hemorrhoids or painful tumors in the rectum, then the syringe should be very gentle and smooth, like those used for children. This is the image of a gentle syringe with its skin tightened:
Chapter Eighty-Four.
On the Treatment of Wounds.
I have mentioned in the division of the treatment of what resembles cauterizations, and I am here discussing their treatment by hand and with medicines in completeness. So, I say that surgeries differ according to the thing by which the surgery is performed and according to the location where the wound occurs.
The things by which surgeries are performed are many, such as being struck by a stone, cut by a sword or knife, pierced by a spear, stick, arrow, and other similar things.
As for surgeries according to the body parts, it is like a wound that occurs on the head, neck, chest, abdomen, liver, and other such organs.
I am describing the treatment of some wounds to serve as a measure and rule for all other wounds. I begin with simple head wounds in particular because the compound ones will be mentioned in the third chapter of this book.
I say that if a simple wound occurs on the head and there is no bone fracture, I examine it. If it was caused by being struck by a stone or something similar and only the skin has been cut and the wound is large and you fear that the patient may develop a hot swelling, then promptly apply a poultice at the site. Do not delay this, and let blood according to the patient's strength if there is no contraindication for bleeding, especially if the blood that comes out of the wound is minimal. The bleeding should be from the opposite side of the wounded area.
Warn the patient against fullness, drinking, and coarse foods, for if anything prevents the discharge of pus, reduce their food intake, avoid meats and drinks, and if there is a hot swelling in the wound, apply cotton soaked in rose oil alone or with an astringent drink.
And if the hot swelling is secure, then apply to the wound, if it is fresh with its blood and has not been altered by the atmosphere which I will describe to you shortly. But if it has been altered by the air, then apply some ointments to it.
Until the pus flows out, then treat it until it heals. If the wound is large and is from a sword cut or similar and the edges do not come together with bandages, sew it up as I will describe in suturing abdominal wounds.
If the skin has exposed the bone and hangs on, with only a slight grip, cut it off. Then treat the wound with medicines that will form solid flesh in place of the skin. Instruct the patient to nourish themselves with foods that are strengthening, such as heads and humps and the like.
If a fungus occurs in the skin and it does not adhere to the bone, cut off all that is infected and discard it. Then treat it. If there is an artery or vein in these wounds from which blood flows and the bleeding does not stop with medicines, search for the artery.
If you find it and it does not stop, sever it with a scalpel and tie it off. If necessity calls and what we mentioned does not help, cauterize it until the bleeding stops. If these wounds are small and simple, their treatment is easy; they suffice with being sprinkled with this powder while they are still bloody.
Before the air alters it, the recipe consists of taking one part of frankincense, two parts of myrrh, and three parts of lime, whether slaked or unslaked. All is pounded, sieved, and used to fill the wound, which should be bound tightly so that it adheres well.
It凝固在血液中，然后用绷带从上方绑紧，如果不肿胀就不要解开，因为药物不会脱落直到愈合。如果找不到乳香和芸香，石灰单独也可以做到这一点。请注意，上述翻译不符合您要求的格式，我将重新提供纯翻译内容：It congeals with the blood, then it is tightly bandaged from above. It should not be untied as long as it does not swell, for the medicine will not fall off until it heals. Lime alone can do this if frankincense and myrrh are unavailable.
This action can also be done with alum in many large wounds if its placement and binding are skillful, and the wounds are fresh with blood, provided that the air has not altered them. However, if the air has somewhat altered them, especially in summer time.
There is no effect in applying this powder; treat it as mentioned by applying some ointments that ripen it, or apply a porridge made from barley flour with water and honey until the pus discharges, then continue treating it with other treatments until it heals.
If a fracture occurs in the bone along with the wound and it is minor, treat it with a splint. I have described the treatment of skull fractures in what follows, in neck surgery. If the wound occurs in the neck, there is no difference in treatment between a simple neck wound and a head wound.
If a nerve or an artery in the neck has been cut, and if it is a nerve, there is no remedy other than to avoid treating it with strong constrictors like zincagar and zaaj, as these can harm the nerve and cause it to spasm.
Nothing is to be placed on the wound that is cold at all because the essence of the nerve is cold and its connection to the brain, which is the noblest of organs, exists. What you treat it with of soft medicines should be like washed cotton cleansed with fresh water several times, moistened with oil or rose fat and tutia.
If it is also washed with fresh water and all the metallic stones of this description and moist ointments, and if the wound is large, use suturing or bring its edges together with bandages, then treat it until it heals.
If the wound has depth and pus has gathered in a hidden place at its bottom, then line it with lint in the lowest part. If an artery is cut off in the wound and you see blood flowing, then cut it or tie it or cauterize it if the situation necessitates that.
If the wound has cut some or all of the laryngeal rings but the vocal cords are intact, then bring the edges of the skin together with sutures around a tube in the larynx. Do not touch the larynx itself; rather, set it and return it to its natural shape, then secure it tightly and leave it for several days.
Then treat it with ointments that have astringent and drying properties until it heals. If the wound has affected the bone, examine it closely; if there are fragments of bone in it, remove them all or as much as possible, and leave what you cannot remove until the wound becomes septic and heals, making their extraction easier.
If the wound is fresh, sprinkle on it the powder we described. If bone becomes septic in the wound and turns into a sinus, treat it as will be mentioned in its section, in the surgery of the chest and what is between the shoulders.
If the wound is from a spear or knife and you see it has depth, then look; if air comes out when the patient breathes, know that it is a fatal wound. If it does not have depth and is soft with blood, do not apply cautery to it at first, nor bind it tightly lest the blood be retained in its depth.
It leads to the heart and kills the patient, but apply an attractive poultice to it and change it twice a day. If you do not have a poultice, put old cotton in the mouth of the wound to absorb what comes out of it in terms of moisture and let the patient sleep on the side of the wound.
Let what accumulates in it flow out. If three days or more have passed since the wound occurred, and the patient has not experienced convulsions, nor bad palpitations, nor shortness of breath, and you see that all his conditions are good, then know that the wound is sound. Treat it with lint and other treatments until it heals.
If the pus cannot be seen and the discharge continues constantly, then know that it has become a fistula. Treat it from its opening. Let the patient lie on the side of the wound so that what accumulates in it flows out. If the wound is in the chest or back, treat it with the previously mentioned suturing method.
If it is large, treat it as such, or use cautery if it is small. If it has affected the bone and broken off shards, examine the wound and promptly remove those shards if they are loose. If they are not loose, leave them until they are.
Let the wound become putrefied, for it will make the shards easier to remove. As for other wounds occurring in other parts of the body, their treatment follows the same principles as what has been mentioned.
Chapter Eighty-Five.
On abdominal surgery, the protrusion of the intestines, and their suturing.
The wound that affects the abdomen may be large, small, or medium. The large one may cause the intestine or several intestines to protrude, making their reinsertion and suturing more severe and difficult.
The small wound may also be difficult in another way, for its closure becomes more challenging. If you do not promptly return the intestine to its place, it will swell and thicken, making reinsertion difficult. Therefore, the medium-sized wound is considered better because returning the intestine is not as difficult as it is with these two types.
Know that suturing the abdomen is done in four ways. Two of these methods are general and suitable for suturing the abdomen as well as other body wounds. The other two methods are specific and apply to all wounds, but they are particularly specialized for suturing the abdomen.
I will describe them to you one by one with explanation and detail. So, I say that if the wound is small and part of the intestine protrudes from it and cannot be returned easily, this is due to one of two reasons: either because the wound is small as we have mentioned, or because the intestine has become swollen due to the cold air.
If this is the case, it should be warmed by soaking a sponge or a wet cloth in lukewarm water alone or in which aqil, sa'di, and sunbul have been boiled, and apply it to the intestine until the swelling subsides.
And it can be done with a drink that has binding properties, and it is better than water alone in dissolving the inflation. So if you see that the inflation has dissolved, then moisten the area with water in which alum or baker's soda has been boiled, for it will facilitate its entry with less effort.
If it is not possible for it to return after this treatment, then slightly cut the wound with the instrument used for cutting abscesses. The first treatment, if effective, is better than incision. Incision is only resorted to out of necessity and when other methods fail. This is the image of the instrument:
One of its curved sides should be limited while the other side is unlimited. The thin end should not be as thin as a scalpel but slightly blunt. It resembles a small spatula as you see. If the wound widens and the intestine enters, it should be returned to its natural position.
And if you can place it in its specific position, that is best. However, if the wound is wide and is in the lower abdomen, the patient should lie on his back with his legs raised higher than his head. If it is in the upper abdomen, his head and chest should be raised higher than his lower body.
And if the wound is on one side of the abdomen, always aim to have the side with the surgery higher than the other side. This should be applied in major surgeries as well as moderate ones.
As for small surgeries, place it according to what is feasible for you. Then have a gentle assistant ready who holds the entire wound with both hands, brings its edges together, and gradually exposes it bit by bit to the person suturing it.
And this is the description of a common suture, where you take one needle or several needles according to the width of the wound. Then, leave from the edge of the tear an amount equal to the thickness of the little finger and pierce with one needle without inserting thread into both edges of the skin. And with both edges of the peritoneum under the skin from inside until it comes out from that side, having gathered the edges of the skin and the edges of the peritoneum making four layers, then tie with a doubled thread around the needle several times from both sides until the edges of the wound come together firmly.
Then leave an amount equal to the thickness of a finger and pierce another needle, then interlock it with the thread as you did with the first needle. Continue doing this with however many needles are needed until the entire wound is sutured. The needles should be of medium thickness between thick and thin.
For needles that are too thin easily cut the flesh, and those that are too thick have difficulty entering the skin. Therefore, they should be of medium thickness between thin and thick. The needle should not be inserted into the edge of the skin too closely.
So that the flesh does not tear quickly and the wound does not open before healing, nor should it be too far apart in suturing so that the wound is prevented from closing. Then cut the ends of the needles so they do not harm the patient while sleeping, and make ties from linen cloth on each side to secure the ends of the needles.
Leave it until you know that the wound has healed. This type of suturing with needles is most suitable for small surgeries, as they may only require one or two needles or so.
As for the method of suturing in general surgery, it is to bring together with a suture the four edges, namely the two edges of the skin and the two edges of the peritoneum at once with a needle that has twisted thread moderate in thinness and thickness. Then, when this needle has penetrated the four edges, return the needle from the side where you started.
Let the thread be intertwined from the top of the wound so that the suturing is according to the way a sack is sewn to pack belongings, and there should be between each suture the thickness of a little finger, and this kind of suturing is known by all people.
With this suturing, a surgery was performed on a man's abdomen which had been stabbed with a knife. The wound in the surgery was more than a span wide, and about two spans of the intestines had come out. The tear was in the middle of the abdomen.
He was treated after his intestines were protruding from the wound for twenty-four hours, and the wound healed in about fifteen days. I continued to treat him until he recovered and lived many years afterwards, managing all his affairs. The doctors had previously judged that he would never recover at all.
It is astonishing that I did not treat him with ointment because I was in a place where there were no medicines at all. I would apply old cotton to the wound twice a day and attend to washing it with honey water until it healed.
As for one of the types of special suturing, I mention it as per Galen's words: you begin the suturing from the skin and insert the needle from the outside to the inside. When the needle penetrates the skin and the muscle going straight along the entire length of the abdomen.
Left the edge of the peritoneum in the side where you inserted the needle and pushed the needle through its other edge from inside to outside in the other edge of the pleura, so if you push it, push it again in this same edge of the pleura from outside to inside.
Leave the edge of the peritoneum on this side and push the needle through its other edge from inside to outside, and as you push it through the peritoneum, reach the edge of the pleura in its vicinity until it penetrates entirely.
Then begin also from this same side and trace it with the edge which is of the peritoneum on the other side, and withdraw the needle from the skin that is near it, then reinsert it into that skin and trace the edge of the peritoneum on the other side with this edge of the pleura.
And withdraw it from the skin that is on its side, and do this once again and do it repeatedly until you sew the entire surgery in that manner. The description of this suturing is to sew like the seams for fur.
To sew the peritoneum once from one side with the edge of the skin and to leave it once from the other side until you finish. As for the second type of special suturing that Galen also mentioned, this is his exact words.
It is to sew it in the manner that some healers sew it, by bringing each part to its corresponding similar part naturally, joining the edge of the peritoneum to its other edge and the edge of the pleura to its other edge, which is done as I describe to you.
You should insert the needle into the side of the vein that is nearest to you from the outside, and pass it through to the inside alone, and leave the sides of the peritoneum. Then return the needle and pass it from the outside to the inside in both sides of the peritoneum, then withdraw it also.
And pass it from the inside to the outside in the other side of the vein on the opposite side, and this type of suturing is better than the general simple suturing which has been mentioned before. This is Galen's exact statement, and some have said that the abdomen can be sutured with two needles. This is done by inserting a single thread into both and starting by inserting the needle from your side and passing it to the other side, then inserting the other needle from the opposite side and passing it to your side according to the suture of the bishops, whether.
Know that if the wound is in the center of the abdomen, then suturing it is more difficult than other parts of the abdomen. As for treating the wound, its treatment follows the rules of other wounds. That is, if you encounter the wound while it is fresh with blood before air alters it, and you bring back the intestines and suture them securely, then apply healing poultices to it.
If the wound has been altered by air, then apply some of the ointments you have until it pusces and the sutures fall out, and the peritoneum and veins heal. Then treat it as you would other wounds until it heals.
If you do not have medicines, then apply old cotton when it begins to pus and change it twice a day as I have informed you until it heals. For in most cases, you will not need other treatments if the wounds are simple. If you fear that the wound may cause pain to the major organs.
It is necessary to dip a soft wool in moderately warm oil or in rose fat and place it around the areas between the armpit and ribs, for if he feels pain or putrefaction in his intestines, which often occurs, then enjoin him with a cool astringent drink.
Especially if the putrefaction has reached the intestine and become a penetrating wound to its interior, and know that what is thick among the intestines is easier to heal, and what is thin among them is harder to heal.
As for the intestine known as the jejunum, it does not accept healing from any surgery that occurs to it at all, due to the abundance and thickness of its veins, and the thinness of its wall and its proximity to the nature of the nerve. However, if what protruded from the wound was feces and you encountered it while it was fresh, then return it according to how you would return the intestine itself.
If a period has passed and it has turned green or black, it is necessary to tie it with thread above the place where it has turned black to prevent bleeding, for there are veins and arteries in the feces, then cut what is below that ligature.
You should make the ends of the thread attached below the surgery, coming out from it, to make it easy for you to pull and remove it when the feces fall and the wound suppurates. Mentioning the wound that occurs in the intestine, if there is a small tear in the intestine.
It may heal in some people, for I have seen a person who was stabbed in the abdomen with a spear, and the wound was on the right side of the stomach. The wound became chronic and turned into a fistula from which feces and gas were expelled. I treated him, though I did not hope for his healing. I continued to care for it until it healed and the place closed. When I saw that the place had closed, I feared for the patient that something bad might happen inside him, but no bad thing happened to him at all and he remained in the best of conditions. He is healthy, eats, drinks, has intercourse, takes a bath, and exercises in his service. Some experienced people have mentioned that if there is a small wound in the intestine, it should be sewn according to this method.
It involves taking large-headed ants, then bringing the edges of the wound together, and placing one of these ants with its mouth open on the edges of the wound. When it bites down and tightens its mouth, cut off its head, for it will stick and not come apart. Then place another ant near the first one.
Continue doing this with several ants according to the size of the wound, then close it and sew the wound. Those heads will remain stuck in the intestine until the intestine heals and is restored, without causing any harm to the patient at all. It is also possible to sew the intestine with a thin thread.
That which is taken from the tendons attached to the animal, after it enters the needle. It involves taking one end of this thread from the tendons and pulling it well, then tying a thin, twisted linen thread to its end, and then inserting that thread into the needle. In it, the tendon thread is used to sew the intestine, then it is returned to the cavity. This method of sewing with ants and tendons is done out of hope and wishful thinking.
And if the wound is large and wide, especially if it is in one of the thin intestines, there is no remedy for it and it will not heal at all.
Chapter Eighty-Six.
On the Treatment of Cold and Fistula.
Know that every wound or swelling, if it becomes chronic and old and turns into an ulcer and does not heal and continuously discharges pus without ceasing, is generally called a fistula, and we call it zakkam, the fistula.
It is in truth a hardened, white complex that does not cause pain and has a hollow like the hollow of bird's feathers.
For this reason, some have called it a feather, and it can be moist at times, continuously discharging pus. The moisture may cease at times; it can be abundant or scarce, thick or thin.
I have mentioned in the classification, when discussing surgeries, that every ulcer that does not heal and does not regenerate flesh is due to one of nine causes: one of them is either a lack of blood in the body or poor quality blood, or there is hard flesh inside it and on its edges that prevents the growth of good flesh. Or it is due to excessive filth and corruption, or the ulcer itself is putrid and the material discharging from it is of poor quality, or the treatment used is not appropriate for healing, or there has been a corruption in the locality similar to an epidemic, or there is something specific to the locality.
Or it is due to excessive filth and corruption, or the ulcer itself is putrid and the material discharging from it is of poor quality, or the treatment used is not appropriate for healing, or there has been a corruption in the locality similar to an epidemic, or there is something specific to the locality. As shown in the city of Zaragoza, where the maturation of diseases is difficult and the healing of tumors is slow by nature, and either because it has one bone or several bones, I have explained all these causes and their signs and treatments with medicines in the division.
I should here make you aware of the treatment of nasal polyps and the common cold which is performed by manual manipulation. Know that polyps may occur in all parts of the body, some ending in large veins or arteries or nerves.
or to the peritoneum or to the intestines or to the bladder or to a rib of the ribs or to a vertebra of the vertebrae of the back or to a joint of the complex joints such as the hand and foot, and some lead close to a major organ and so on.
Those polyps that have such characteristics are among the difficult-to-heal diseases that do not accept treatment, and dealing with them is tiresome and involves ignorance. If there are polyps that have not reached the areas I mentioned and you hope and expect to treat them.
And if you wish to ascertain that, take a probe of copper or iron if the polyp passes straight and examine it with it. If there is a bend in the polyp, examine it with a thin lead probe because lead can soften its body.
It will glide in upon entry and bend towards the curve. If the polyp has many openings that you cannot determine with a probe, inject one of its openings. The moisture you inject will follow the other openings and flow through them.
Then thoroughly examine in whatever way possible to know if there is bone or nerve, or whether the sinus is deep or close, or if it is a single sinus with many openings; ascertain all of this to the best of your ability by your subtle understanding and the presence of pain when you touch the area with your hand.
And similarly regarding the signs and causes leading to the swelling, if you ascertain all of this truly, then proceed with confidence to treatment, which is that you should consider whether it is.
If the sinus is apparent and close or in a safe location far from a joint, nerve, artery, vein, or any of the places mentioned to you, then incise the sinus as described previously and remove what is inside it of pus and corrupted flesh and excess tissue.
And what grows in its mouth of flesh or polyp and the like, treat it until it heals. If the sinus has a deep base and is straight, you should incise it as deeply as possible and then cleanse it of all its corrupted flesh.
Then use the medicated poultices with sharp medicines and insert them to the base of the sinus which you can reach with iron. Do this repeatedly until the sharp medicine consumes all that remains in the base of the sinus of corruption.
Then treat it with ointments that promote the growth of healthy flesh until it heals. If it does not heal thus, then cauterize it as previously described. If the cause of the sinus is bone and this is confirmed to you, examine it and incise it as I have informed you, unless there is a reason preventing you from doing so.
If the bone is exposed to you and there is some corruption or blackening in it, scrape it until its corruption is removed, then treat it with what heals it until it is cured. If it does not cure and the pus continues as it was doing.
Know that you have not reached the complete removal of corruption, so reveal all that is on it again and thoroughly scrape and cleanse it with your utmost effort, then set it. If it heals, otherwise know that this corruption is in a deep place far from what is apparent, so reveal all that is on it again.
Thoroughly scrape and cleanse it with your utmost effort. If the corrupted bone is a small bone and you can pull it out, pull it out with the delicate forceps that are suitable for this purpose.
If there are many bones, thoroughly pull them all out and leave nothing. If something from the ligaments obstructs you and there is no danger in cutting them, cut those ligaments and the flesh if it is there, and free the bones.
If you cannot extract the bones immediately, apply to the wound what will cause putrefaction and leave it for days until the flesh and ligaments around those bones rot. Keep the wound such that the incision you made during your work does not heal.
Rather, if you fear that, place cotton soaked in powdered sulfur with oil or cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment or one of the green ointments. For when those ligaments rot and the bones become clean, extracting and pulling them out will be easy.
If it is a large bone such as the leg bone or thigh bone or the like, and what has decayed is only its surface, then scrape it thoroughly until that blackness and corruption are gone, then set the wound. If what has decayed is a large part, and the corruption has reached the marrow of the bone, then it must be spread open.
Cut it all until the corruption ends, then treat it until it heals. I inform you of a case of gangrene that affected a young man's leg to serve as an example and aid in your treatment. This man was young in age.
Around thirty years old, he experienced pain in his leg due to a cause that originated internally, moving until it affected the leg, causing swelling and a large lump. There was no external cause. Time passed with the mistake of doctors until the swelling ruptured.
Much matter flowed from it, and his treatment was mismanaged until gangrene set in, and many openings developed that discharged pus and bodily fluids. A group of doctors treated him for about two years, but none of them were skilled in surgical practice.
Until he came to me, and I saw his leg with matter flowing profusely from those openings. The man had become emaciated and his color turned yellow. I inserted the probe into one of those openings, and the probe reached the bone. Then I examined all the openings.
I found that they communicated with each other in all directions of the leg. So, I decided to incise one of those openings until I exposed some of the bone, which I found to be decayed, eaten away, blackened, and putrefied, perforated until the holes reached the marrow. I spread open what was revealed to me.
He is able to reach the corrupted bone, and I believe that there is no other corruption in the bone besides what I have cut out and exposed, and indeed I have excised it. Then I treated the wound with suturing medicines for a longer period, but it did not heal. So I returned and uncovered the bone again beyond the first exposure.
I found the corruption connected to the bone, so I also exposed what of that corruption was apparent. Then I tried to set it, but it neither healed nor united. So I uncovered it again and kept cutting away parts of the bone bit by bit trying to set it, but it would not heal until I had cut off about a finger's breadth of the bone.
I removed it with its membrane, then treated it with medicines, and it healed quickly and was cured. This repetition in his treatment and incision was necessary due to the patient's weakness, his inability to endure much, and my fear for him of death because he would faint at times due to excessive vomiting. He was completely cured.
Flesh grew solid in place of the bone, his condition improved within his body, his strength returned, and he was able to move about without any harm affecting him while walking. If a protruding bone in part of the body has fractured.
It should be exposed in this manner: take a bandage and tie it at the end of the protruding bone, and have someone pull it upwards. Then use another thicker woolen bandage than the first one.
Then bind it to the flesh beneath the bone and pull its end so that the flesh is drawn downward. As you expose the flesh in the area you wish to cut, ensure the saw does not harm the flesh. Place a piece of wood or a board firmly under the bone from below.
For if you do that, the saw will not be prevented from cutting the corrupted bone, and it is appropriate for the sawing to be slightly above the place of corruption so that there is no corruption within the cavity of the bone which does not appear on its exterior to the senses, thus forcing you to saw it again.
If the bone is corrupted but not protruding, and it connects to each other with the corruption in its center or part of it, then expose the flesh from all sides. Then place the wood at the bottom and saw from the first side where the corruption is.
When you finish sawing from one side, then saw from the other side, and let the sawing be slightly away from the corruption as we said. If the corruption is in a joint, cut the corrupted joint itself and saw the bone where it connects on the other side.
If the corruption is in the connection of two joints, there is no remedy but excision. If the corruption is in the palm of the hand or the sole of the foot, treating it is extremely difficult, but you should scrape away the corruption however it appears to you, excise it, and clean it as much as you can.
And with what method can you proceed without encountering a vein or nerve, and know that the saws and cutting instruments for these bones are many according to the position of the bones, their setting, thickness, thinness, size, smallness, hardness, and looseness. Therefore, it is necessary to prepare an appropriate tool for each type of work.
Know that the works themselves may guide you to the type of tool you need if you have long experience and knowledge of the arts of this craft, for skill in the craft comes from encountering various types of diseases. He may devise for himself instruments similar to those for every disease, and I have depicted for you at the end of this chapter a number of instruments.
Make them examples to follow and standards to measure others by, if God wills. Image of a saw:.

Chapter Eighty-Seven.
On Amputating Limbs and Scraping Bones.
Limb parts may become gangrenous either due to an external cause or an internal one. If you treat this corruption with medication and the treatment is ineffective, and you see that the corruption is spreading through the organ without anything stopping it,
then it is necessary to amputate that organ where the corruption has reached, so that the patient may be saved from death or a great suffering worse than the loss of the limb. A sign of this condition is that the limb turns black until you might think that fire has burned it.
or it may become gangrenous after turning black until that gangrene spreads to the adjacent parts and affects the whole body; therefore, you should promptly amputate it. Similarly, if the cause of corruption is due to the bite of some creatures such as the sea scorpion, snake, or centipede, and the like.
If the corruption or bite is in the tip of a finger, amputate the finger and do not delay lest the corruption spreads to the hand. Similarly, if it has affected the hand, amputate it from the base of the wrist and do not delay lest the corruption spreads further to the arm's joint.
And if it is taken in the arm, then cut the arm at the elbow joint itself. If corruption continues and you see it spreading towards the shoulder, do not cut the shoulder at all, for that would lead to the death of the patient. Use other treatments as much as possible.
And do the same with the leg if corruption takes hold in the finger, then cut the finger at one of the joints. If it spreads to the foot, then amputate the entire leg. If it ascends to the knee, then amputate the leg at the knee joint.
And if the corruption has spread above the knee, there is no remedy except to leave it and submit the patient to death. The method of amputating or incising a limb is to tie a band below the place you intend to cut and another band above the place.
One servant extends the lower band downward, and another servant extends the upper band upward. You should strip the flesh between the bands with a broad scalpel until all the flesh is exposed, then cut or incise. You should place linen cloths on all sides.
So that the saw does not touch the healthy area, which could cause additional pain and a hot swelling for the patient. If bleeding occurs during your work, cauterize the area quickly or apply some hemostatic agents, then resume your treatment until you finish.
Then bandage the injured limb with a suitable bandage and treat it until it heals. I will tell you an example that happened to a man with this exact condition in his leg, which is that there was blackening with a burning sensation similar to fire.
And that corruption first occurred in his finger until it took the entire leg. The limb fell off from itself when he saw the corruption spreading in the member with the intensity of pain and burning that he was feeling, so he amputated it at the joint and healed.
And after a long time had passed, that same corruption appeared in his ring finger. He came to me, and I treated that excess with the medications I applied to his hand after cleaning his body, but the excess did not stop and began to spread into the other finger.
Until the corruption spread to his hand, so he asked me to amputate his hand, but I refused, hoping to stop that excess and also fearing for him that he might die if his hand were cut off, as his strength was failing. When he despaired of me, he returned to his country.
I was informed about him that his hand fell off, so he amputated the entire hand and healed. I have related this story to be of assistance in dealing with cases similar to this disease and to serve as a guide for reference and action.
Chapter Eighty-Eight.
On the treatment of abscesses and how to inject them with medicines.
If a swelling occurs in some fleshy organs and the duration of the swelling continues until it gathers pus, then it bursts or breaks open and all the pus inside comes out, leaving the area empty as if it were a container.
And the skin on it is like a cloth that has become thin, and the corruption was not severe enough to affect the bone, nerve, or ligament. Therefore, it rightfully deserves to be called an abscess and should not be termed as a fistula unless its duration prolongs to the point where the corruption affects any of these organs.
Then it is called a naṣūr or zkāma, and its treatment is to cut all of that skin as it goes around, especially if it has become thin and like a rag, and you are certain that it will not adhere to the place due to its corruption.
If you hope that the skin will adhere and the corruption has not reached that extent, and there is a thickness of flesh in the skin, then treat it with injection. That is, look at the abscess; if it is large and the pus coming from it has a foul smell, inject it with Egyptian medicine.
It is a mixture of vinegar, oil, honey, and zincumber in equal parts, gathered in a vessel and cooked over fire until the medicine thickens to the consistency of honey. Then take what you need, dilute it with water and honey, inject it into the abscess, seal its opening, and leave the medicine inside for about two hours.
Then extract it by squeezing. Do this for days until the abscess is cleaned and the foul smell disappears. It may be injected with lye water if this medicine is not available, which is done by taking the ash of vine wood or oak wood and pouring water over it.
Then strain it and inject until you are certain that the abscess is cleansed. If the patient cannot tolerate Egyptian medicine or lye water, inject it with a mixture of water and honey in which some powdered zincumber has been mixed.
Or inject it with a mixture of honey and decoction, for honey has the property of cleansing and washing, while the decoction adheres to the abscess, especially if the decoction has some astringent and drying qualities. If you do this several times and are certain that the corruption in the abscess is gone, then inject it with something that promotes flesh growth.
Like taking the nakhli ointment and dissolve it with rose oil and astringent syrup or inject some of the other medicines and ointments whose qualities we have described in the chapter on ointments, if the mouth of the wound is narrow and does not accommodate the syringe tube.
Widen it slightly with iron or place a wick soaked in Egyptian ointment or sericum ointment until it widens. Similarly, if the mouth is also wide, bring its edges together with sutures and leave enough space for the syringe to enter without excess.
And if the mouth from which pus flows is raised upwards, cut it at the lowest point so that the pus flows downwards, because if the pus congests in the depths of the wound, it prevents flesh from growing there.
If you cannot cut the wound downward as desired, then position the limb in a way that allows the pus to flow out easily according to what is convenient for you, ensuring that no pus is retained within at all.
As for the healing medicines that are applied to the wound from the outside and how to apply them, take one of the healing ointments suitable for your needs and spread it on a piece of linen cloth. The cloth should be large enough to cover the entire wound. Then, cut with scissors a hole opposite the mouth of the wound slightly larger than the mouth of the wound. Then spread some of the soft ointment on another piece of cloth according to the size of the hole and place it over it, keeping it away from the mouth of the wound so that pus can easily come out. Do not remove the large cloth until afterwards.
Several days, and as for the one at the mouth of the wound, it should be removed at all times so that what has accumulated in it of pus may come out, and to know what flows from it of the suppuration whether it is much or little or ripe or unripe.
And also, examine the site of the wound itself whether its owner feels pain in it or not, and if there is swelling or no swelling. If your treatment proceeds this way and you see that the material which comes out is minimal at the mouth of the wound.
Know that the wound has adhered or is close to adhering. In this case, remove it tomorrow or on the third day. When you remove the dressing, replace the bandage and renew the ointment. If thin suppuration comes out of the wound after a long period, do not lose hope of its adhesion.
Its healing is near because among people, the growth of flesh in their wounds varies; for some it is slow and for others the opposite. If pus that is not ripe comes out of the wound after many days, know that the wound has not adhered. If the adhesion of the wound is delayed.
And if the condition prolongs, increase in drying the medications. Let the medications be such that they are moist in their composition but dry in their effect, like the palm ointment if more colocynth has been added to it. Among the most effective treatments is to use the palm ointment.
It is treated by applying rose oil and sprinkling on it a moderate decoction that is balanced in consistency, then knead it with it and use it. This can also be done if the palm ointment is not available: take honey and boil it until it thickens, then use it. Or you may take rue, aloe, and cyperus, crush them all together, and sprinkle the mixture on the honey while it is over fire. Then apply it to a cloth and bind it over the wound, or coat it with honey that has been cooked until thick, sprinkle the medications on it, place the cloths on it, and bind them.
Zeraunja longa, the root of the asphodel, cress seeds, and hellebore can be used individually or combined, grind them and sieve them, then sprinkle on the honey I described and use it. If the wound persists and does not heal with this treatment, know that there is corruption deep within it.
And if it affects the bones or any of the solid nerves or ligaments, treat it as described for the treatment of the naṣūr previously mentioned.
Chapter Eighty-Nine.
On the treatment of corns and ingrown nails, amputation of excess fingertips, and splitting joined fingers.
A corn is an excess of flesh that grows under the nail of the thumb or toe and may also grow on other fingers. If it persists and its treatment is neglected, it swells and becomes a hot tumor.
Or if it becomes infected until it erodes the base of the nail and may corrupt it entirely, or the corruption extends to the bone causing a foul odor, and the tip of the finger becomes widened with a bluish color. If treating it with the methods we mentioned does not succeed.
You should cut off all the excess that grows from the nail with an iron instrument, then cauterize the wound. Cauterization is very beneficial in this case. If the bone is healthy and the nail is also healthy.
And the corner of the nail that has pressed into the flesh inward and caused it pain and harm, it is advisable to place a thin splint under the nail's corner which is hurting the flesh, raise it upwards, and cut that flesh gently.
And you apply to what remains of the flesh cauterizing, consuming medicines until it all disappears, then treat it with ointments until it heals. And if the corruption has affected the bone, you should cut and remove that bone, for it will not heal as long as there is corrupt bone present at all.
If you see erosion and corruption spreading in the finger, cut it at one of the joints as previously mentioned, then treat it until it heals. If the nail receives a blow or crush causing severe pain, you should first splint the injured area.
Then, you cut the nail with a sharp instrument, making an oblique incision from top to bottom, being careful not to reach the flesh underneath the nail, for doing so would cause severe pain to the patient and lead to excessive flesh growth in that area. Then, treat the area with what soothes the pains.
As for the extra finger that sometimes grows on people's hands, it may be entirely fleshy, or it may contain bones in some parts, or it may even have a nail. Sometimes its growth originates at the base of a joint of one of the fingers.
Or its growth may occur at some joints of the finger. Those that grow at the joints of the finger do not move, while those that grow near the finger joint may move. What is purely flesh can be easily cut, and this is done by cutting it at its base with a wide instrument.
And as for those that grow at the base of the joint, their treatment is difficult, so one should avoid cutting them. As for those that grow in the finger near one of the salamiyat, it is appropriate to first cut its flesh in a circular manner towards the bone, then spread the bone with one of those saws suitable for that.
Then treat it until it heals. As for the adhesion that occurs between the fingers, it often happens and can be something a person is born with or occur when a wound or burn from fire, etc., heals. It should be that this adhesion is cut open.
Until the fingers return to their natural state, then place between them a bandage or patches soaked in rose oil so that it does not adhere quickly, keep them apart or place a thin sheet of lead between them until the area heals as it should.
And similarly, if adhesion occurs between some of the fingers and the palm, cut open that adhesion according to what seems appropriate and suitable for the form of the limb.
Chapter Ninety.
On the Cutting of Cysts.
Varicose veins are twisted, thick vessels filled with superfluous dark blood that can occur in most parts of the body, but they most frequently occur in the legs, especially in the legs of farmers, weavers, and carriers. It is appropriate to first use friction on the body with black powder several times with strong friction.
Then have the patient take basilic. As for treating it with iron, it is done in two ways: one is to cut and remove the black blood, and the other is to incise the vein and completely extract it. For cutting, first soak the leg in hot water thoroughly.
Until the thick, turbid blood dissolves. Then bind the patient's leg from above the thigh to below the knee with a turban. Then make one incision or two incisions or three wide incisions in the location.
Then remove the black blood with your hand from below the leg upwards and from above downwards until the amount of blood that you deem sufficient or what the patient's strength can tolerate is removed. Then bind it and order him to avoid foods that generate black bile, and vomiting and bleeding should be repeated.
When the veins are full and this harms the patient, then this is how to proceed: Shave the patient's leg if there is a lot of hair, then have him enter the bath and wash his leg with hot water until it turns red and sweat is produced, or he exercises vigorously.
If a bath is not available to warm the limb, then cut the skin opposite the vein lengthwise either at its end near the knee or at its bottom near the heel. Then open the skin with forceps and peel the vein from all sides until it becomes apparent to touch.
When it appears, you will see it red and prominent. Once freed from the skin, it resembles a tendon. Then insert a thread under it until it rises and protrudes from the skin, then secure it with a smooth blind hook. Then make another incision near that cut, about three fingers wide.
Then peel the skin off the vein until it appears, then raise it with thread as you did before and secure it with another smooth hook. Then make another incision or several incisions if necessary.
Then polish it and cut it at the end of the incision near the instep, then pull it out and polish it until it comes out from the second incision, then pull it to the incision above it and do this until you pull it out from the third incision, the highest of all, so that when it is all out, cut it.
If it does not respond to pulling and polishing, then insert a needle with a strong doubled thread and tie it, and pull it. Insert the awl under it and twist it with your hand in all directions until it comes out, and be careful that it does not break, for if it breaks, it will be very difficult for you to polish it.
And if it causes harm to the patient, then after you have polished it entirely, place wool soaked in a drink of rose oil or olive oil on the site of the incisions and treat it until it heals. If the tendon is contracted and has twists in various directions.
And if it is not straight as we said, then it should be incised at every direction of its twists and places of curvature, then suspend it with forceps until you polish it entirely. And be careful when incising it that you do not cut the vein or injure it, for it will be difficult for you to polish it, so be very cautious.
Image of the instrument with which you incise the tendon:.
Image of the blind forceps:.
It should not have a bent like other forceps, nor should it be sharp at the ends to avoid injuring the vein. It should be thick in its curvature and smooth because if it is thin, it will cut the vein with its thinness; rather, its thickness is an advantage as we said.
Chapter Ninety-One.
On the Treatment of Civil Sweat.
This sweat develops in the legs in hot countries like Hijaz and the lands of Arabs, and in hot countries that are slightly barren and less fertile. It may also develop in other parts of the body besides the legs, and its development is due to corruption that occurs under the skin.
Worms and other pests can occur inside the bodies, as well as maggots and worms that develop between the skin and the flesh. A sign of the beginning of this sweat is that a severe inflammation occurs in the leg, then that area discharges fluid, and then the sweat begins to emerge from where that discharge occurred.
It is as if it were the root of a plant or an animal, and when its tip appears, it should be wrapped around a small piece of lead weighing between one dirham and two dirhams, tied up, and the lead left hanging from the leg.
So, every time something comes out from it externally, wrap it in the lead and tie it. If it becomes very long, cut off some of it and wrap what remains. Do not cut it off at its root before all of it has come out because if you cut it, it will retract into the flesh and cause a tumor, corruption in that area, and a bad ulcer.
Therefore, it should be managed and drawn out little by little until it is completely removed from the body with nothing left inside. Sometimes, this sweat can produce something that is five or ten cubits long in some people.
I have been informed that it came out of a man to the length of twenty cubits. If it breaks off while you are treating him, insert a probe into its opening and pack it with a long plug attached to the body until all its material is discharged, and endeavor to cleanse the area with medicines for days.
Then treat it as you would treat tumors. This vein may have many branches, especially if it appears in the joint of the leg or in the leg itself, causing numerous openings to form, with each mouth emitting a branch. Treat it as we mentioned in the classification and according to what has been stated earlier.
Chapter Ninety-Two.
On incising the worm generated under the skin, which is called the cattle disease.
This disease is called cattle disease in some regions because it often affects cattle. It is a small worm that develops between the skin and the flesh and moves throughout the body, moving up and down.
It can be sensed when it moves from one part to another until it penetrates the skin, creating an opening where it emerges. Its formation results from the putrefaction of certain mixtures, similar to how worms and snakes and melon seeds form in the stomach.
It is feared that if it moves within the body and rises to the head, reaching the eye, it may open there and emerge, thus destroying the eye, which often happens. If you wish to treat it and remove it, this can only be done when it is moving and its movement is perceptible.
It is necessary to tightly bind what is above and below it with a bandage, then incise over it and extract it. If it sinks into the flesh and you do not find it, apply cauterization with fire to that area until it is burned. The greatest fear is its potential to damage the eye as we have said.
If you see that it has reached the head near the eye, tightly bind below it on the forehead, then incise over it and extract it. It is necessary to treat the patient by purifying his body with laxative medicines for the putrid and poor mixtures and to avoid foods that generate corruption.
Chapter Ninety-Three.
On incising the disease known as nafir.
This disease which is called nafir in our country is a pain that occurs in some organs and then moves from one organ to another. I have seen it as I describe it to you.
I was called to a sick woman in one of the villages. She bared her arm and showed me a slight swelling in the brachial vein. After staying for an hour, I saw that swelling moving with the bone like a worm crawling upward towards her shoulder as quickly as possible, resembling quicksilver.
If it flows from one place to another, the pain leaves that place and settles in the shoulder. After sitting for an hour, it spread throughout the body until it reached the other arm. She then told me that it moves through her entire body as I observed.
I was amazed by its speed in moving from one organ to another. I had not seen this disease with my own eyes in such a manner before, except that I have known some people who experience pain that moves from one organ to another, but I had never seen it with my own eyes as I saw it in this woman.
I did not appreciate this except that it might be because the woman was from the desert, with a dry body and visible veins. Therefore, this wind became apparent to the senses. Thus, it should not appear in this manner for those of affluence and moist bodies with hidden veins.
If you want to treat it and its owner feels pain, then if it appears before your eyes as we mentioned, bind above and below it quickly, incise over it until that congested wind comes out and dress the area.
If you do not see it with your eyes, then treat it with body purgation and what disperses gases and expels them, such as the stinking seed and the spikenard seed and similar medicines.
Chapter Ninety-Four.
On the Extraction of Arrows.
Arrows differ according to their types and according to the places where they lodge in the body. As for their difference according to their types, some are large and some are small. Some have hollow tips and some have solid tips. Some have three angles and some have four angles.
Some have barbs, and some have splinters. As for those that lodge according to the organs they enter, they are of two types: either they enter vital hollow organs such as the brain, heart, liver, lungs, kidneys, intestines, bladder, and the like. If an arrow falls into one of these organs and signs of death, which I will describe to you later, become apparent, then you should avoid extracting that arrow, for the owner will most likely die. And if these bad signs do not appear to you and the arrow has not been concealed deep within the organ, then extract it and treat the wound. Among the signs of brain injury is that if an arrow strikes it, penetrates the bone, and wounds the meninges covering the brain, severe headache, coma, and dizziness will result.
And if these bad signs do not appear to you and the arrow has not been concealed deep within the organ, then extract it and treat the wound. Among the signs of brain injury is that if an arrow strikes it, penetrates the bone, and wounds the meninges covering the brain, severe headache, coma, and dizziness will result. Redness in the eyes, a red tongue, convulsions, confusion of mind, vomiting, and sometimes blood coming out of the nostrils or ears, and sometimes speech is lost and the voice disappears, and from the site of the wound comes a white moisture resembling porridge, and a fluid similar to that of meat flows from it.
If these signs appear to you, refrain from treating the patient and do not attempt to remove the arrow if it has not come out. As for the signs of the arrow when it strikes the heart and is close to the left breast, one feels as though it has embedded into something solid, not something hollow.
And sometimes the arrow may move in a manner similar to the pulse, and black blood flows from the wound, followed by coldness in the limbs, cold sweat, and fainting; know then that death is inevitable. The sign of the arrow when it wounds the lung is the discharge of frothy blood from the wound.
And the vessels near the neck swell, the color of the patient changes, and he breathes heavily, seeking to inhale cool air. If the arrow strikes the diaphragm in the chest, it is close to the lower ribs, and breathing becomes labored with severe pain.
He sighs, and all the parts of the shoulders move. If the arrow strikes the liver, severe pain follows, and blood resembling the color of the liver comes out of the wound. If the arrow strikes the stomach, undigested food may come out of the wound.
And its condition is apparent, and if the arrow has pierced the abdomen and stuck in it, and some excrement has come out of the wound or fistula or a ruptured intestine, there is no hope for his treatment nor in extracting the arrow. If the arrow has hit the bladder and urine comes out.
And if something protrudes outward and the pain intensifies for the patient, then know that he is dying. As for other organs like the face, eye, throat, shoulder, arm, spine, collarbone, thigh, leg, and similar organs, they are usually spared in most cases.
When the arrow does not encounter a blood vessel or nerve and is not poisoned, I inform you of some of what I have witnessed regarding these arrows to guide you in treatment. This concerns an arrow that had struck a man in the nasolacrimal duct at the base of the nose.
I removed it from the other side under the earlobe, and he recovered without any harm to his eye. I also removed another arrow for a Jew that had struck him in the eyelid below the lower lid. The arrow had hidden itself, and I only reached its small end that attaches to the wooden shaft.
It was a large composite arrow from the qaswin, with a smooth square iron head and no barbs. The Jew recovered, and no adverse incident occurred to his eye. I also removed another arrow from a Christian's throat, and this arrow was Arabic.
It had barbs, so I made an incision between the laryngeal prominence and extracted it gently. The Christian recovered. I also removed another arrow for a man who had been struck in his abdomen, and we feared he would die from it.
When thirty days had passed or so, and there was no change in his condition, I cut along the arrow and maneuvered it out, and he recovered without any misfortune befalling him. I also saw a man who was struck by an arrow in his back, and the wound healed around it.
After seven years, the arrow came out at the base of his thigh. I also saw a woman who had an arrow embedded in her abdomen, and the wound healed around it; the arrow remained without any change in her condition, and she did not feel any harm in any of her natural actions.
I also saw another man who was struck by an arrow in his face, and the wound healed while he did not experience much pain. There are many similar cases. I extracted an arrow from a commander of the sultan that had struck the middle of his nose, slightly tilting to the right side.
The arrow was completely embedded, and I was summoned to treat him three days after the arrow struck. I found the arrow wound extremely narrow and probed it with a thin probe but could not feel the arrow. He was experiencing throbbing and pain under his ear on the right side.
I suspected that the throbbing might be due to the tip of the arrow, so I dressed the area with a bandage containing a caustic substance, hoping that the area would swell and reveal the location of the arrow. However, no incident occurred in the area that indicated the arrow had reached that spot.
I continued to apply the bandage for many days, but no incident occurred. The wound eventually closed during this time, and the patient despaired of its extraction for a long period until one day he felt the arrow inside his nose and informed me. I then applied a sharp, corrosive medicine to the wound for many days.
Until it opened and I probed it, feeling the thin tip of the arrow that adheres to the wood. Then I increased the opening of the wound with that sharp medicine until the tip of the arrow became visible to us, and I continued with it for a period of time, about four months.
Then when the wound widened and I was able to insert the forceps, I pulled and moved it but it did not respond to being removed. So I continued to apply various methods and tools until one day I grasped it firmly with some forceps, as will be shown in the figure at the end of this chapter.
The physicians had ruled that his nasal cartilage would not heal, but I set it and the wound healed, and the patient fully recovered without any further harm. I inform you of the method of removing some arrows so that you may use this as a standard and guide for what I have not mentioned.
For the parts of this craft and its details cannot be fully grasped by description nor encompassed by a book. Rather, the skilled craftsman measures the little with the much, and extrapolates from what is present to what is absent, and devises new work and new tools for unusual occurrences.
If I speak of this craft, I say that arrows are removed from the parts they have penetrated in two ways: either by pulling them out from the place they entered or from the opposite side, and those that are removed are taken out from where they entered.
Either the arrow is protruding in a fleshy area, in which case it should be pulled out. If it does not come out when you attempt to remove it, you should leave it for days until the flesh around it becomes putrefied, making it easier to pull out. The same applies if it has lodged in bone.
And if it does not come out for you, leave it for some days and repeat pulling and moving it every day, as it will come out. But if it still does not come out after several days, you should pierce around the arrow in the bone itself from all sides with a fine drill until you widen for the arrow, then pull it and remove it.
And if the arrow that has penetrated into the skull has deeply entered one of the brain's ventricles and some of those symptoms which I have mentioned appear in the patient, then refrain from pulling out the arrow and leave it until his condition improves after several days.
Proceed with pulling out the arrow. If it is deeply embedded and does not come out when pulled, use drills around the arrow as described to you, then treat the area until it heals. As for if the arrow has become hidden in a part of the body. And if it is no longer perceptible, probe for it with a probe. If you sense it, pull it out with some tools suitable for pulling. But if you cannot due to the narrowness of the wound and the depth of the arrow, and there is no bone, nerve, or vein there.
Make an incision to widen the wound and gain access to the arrow until you can remove it. If it has two barbs, grasp them and free the flesh embedded in them from all sides with any trick that you can manage. Proceed by cutting the barbs if you cannot free the flesh, twisting them until you do so.
And if you attempt to remove the arrow from any place, use the fingers of your hand with forceps in all directions until you free it, and be as gentle as possible so that the arrow does not break, which would make it difficult for you to pull it out. If you cannot do this at the time.
Leave it for days until the flesh around it putrefies, then revisit it as it will be easier at that time. If bleeding obstructs you, use what we mentioned of treatment in its chapter, and be careful not to cut an artery or nerve or tendon, and employ cunning.
In whatever way you can free the arrow, do so gently, patiently, and steadily as described to you. It is advisable when pulling out the arrow to have the patient in the same position they were in when the arrow struck, as this is most suitable.
If that is not possible for you, use whatever shapes are available to you. As for the arrow that emerges from the opposite side, either part of it may protrude outward, or you may find the tip of the arrow by touch close to the top of the skin and see it protruding.
Make an incision over it, and let the incision be large enough to accommodate the forceps, then pull it out as it will be easier to remove. If it is stuck in the bone, use your hand in a circular motion until the arrow affects the bone and widens its path, then pull it out.
Otherwise, leave it for days then revisit it until it comes out. If the shaft of the arrow is still attached, push it out with it. If the shaft has fallen off and you want to use pushing, insert a hollow instrument so that its hollow part enters the tail of the arrow, then push it out with it.
If the arrow is hollow, push it with an instrument that fits into that hollow, thereby making it easier for the arrow to be removed. If the arrow is poisoned, you should excoriate all the flesh where the poison has penetrated, if you are able to do so, then treat it with what is suitable for that condition.
If the arrow is in the chest or abdomen or bladder or side, and it is close enough to be probed with a probe, and you can make an incision to reach it, then make the incision, being careful not to cut any vein or nerve, and remove it.
Then suture the wound if it requires stitching, then treat it until it heals. Image of the forceps used to extract arrows:.
Its ends are like a bird's beak, crafted to grip the arrow or anything tightly so it does not let go. They can be made in various sizes—large, small, and medium—depending on the size of the arrow and the width or narrowness of the wound.

This is blunted at the end like a probe to facilitate its entry into the hollow arrow and push it.
Chapter Ninety-Five.
On Bloodletting.
The veins that are commonly bled from in the body are thirty veins, including sixteen veins in the head: the two pulsating veins behind the ears known as the hassisin, the two superficial temporal arteries on the temples, and the two veins at the inner canthus of the eyes known as the naẓẓarin.
The vein standing in the center of the forehead, the vein at the tip of the nose, the two veins in the neck, the two veins in the upper lip of the mouth, and the two veins in the lower lip, and these veins are known as the jugulars, and the two veins under the tongue.
And as for the veins that branch out in the arm and hand, they are five veins. One of them is the cephalic, which is on the ulnar side, and the common people call it the head vein. The median cubital, which is the middle vein, is composed of a branch of the basilic and a branch of the cephalic, and the common people call it the body vein.
And the basilic, which is located on the medial side, and it is also called the armpit vein, and the common people call it the abdominal vein. The brachial artery, which is located on the elbow, is the one that adheres there and appears clearly above the thumb. And the axillaries.
It is the vein between the little finger and the ring finger, which has two branches. In the leg and foot, there are three veins: one is below the patella on the ulnar side, the second is the saphenous, located at the ankle on the medial side, and the sciatic vein, located at the heel on the ulnar side.
And in the other leg, there are three similar veins. As for the two veins behind the ears, their benefit is in ligating them for chronic catarrhs, migraines, leprosy, and chronic bad sores on the head. The method of ligating them is as I describe.
It is to shave the head of the patient and rub its back where the two veins are with a coarse cloth well. Then, have the patient constrict his neck with a turban until the two veins appear and their location behind the ears at the two lower points on the head. Grasp them with your finger where you feel their pulse under your finger, and mark that spot with ink.
Then take a sharp knife, which is known as nashl, then insert it under the vein in the skin until the instrument reaches the bone; then raise your hand with the vein and skin upwards and cut off the vein along with the skin in one amputation, and the length of the cut should be about two fingers' width.
Or tie it, and let out as much blood as you desire, then secure them with sutures and leave them until they heal. Cutting and cauterizing them has been described at the beginning of this book. As for the arteries in the temples, their ligation is beneficial for chronic migraines, difficult headaches, persistent inflammation of the eyelids, and severe, constant tearing of the eyes.
And the method of their ligation, as I describe to you, is for the patient to tighten his neck with a headscarf until the veins appear prominently and their pulse becomes evident under your finger. At this point, mark them with ink, then lift the skin above the vein upwards with your index finger.
Then insert the nashl surgical instrument from below, lift the vein upwards, and amputate it as you did with the other veins. Let out blood according to your need, then loosen the patient's neck constriction and place your finger on the vein for a moment.
Then place cotton and a suture on it and tightly secure it from above, leaving it until it heals. Mentioning them, cutting them, and tying them has been described at the beginning of this book. As for ligating the forehead vein, its benefit follows ligation of the temporal vein for chronic facial ailments such as psoriasis, sores, and thick redness.
How to perform it as I describe to you: the patient chokes his neck with a turban until sweat appears, then take the tool which is called the ax, and this is its image:.
Place the sharp prong at the head of the ax on the same sweat spot and strike from above with a comb or something similar, and let the blood flow to the extent you desire, then loosen the patient's neck compression and tie it until he heals.
It can be opened with a wide scalpel, but the scalpel should not have a sharp point like other scalpels; rather, it should have a slightly broad tip. Apply it obliquely because the bone is close, and the scalpel might break if it is thin.
As for the sweat glands in the tear ducts of the eyes, their use is for eye ailments such as scabies, redness, trachoma, and facial diseases. As for how to perform bloodletting from them, it is that the patient should compress his neck with a turban, then you perform bloodletting while standing at his head, and let the bloodletting be slightly oblique towards the length with a small, slightly wide scalpel.
The area has no flesh, so if the scalpel is sharp at the tip, it might break. Then release as much blood as you need, place cotton on them, and bind them for one night, then remove the bindings. As for bloodletting from the nasal sweat gland, it is beneficial for acute fever.
And severe headaches and facial ailments such as chronic red boils that appear on the nose, especially if they are chronic. To perform bloodletting, the patient should compress his neck, then hold his nose with your left hand and take a thin, long scalpel.
You insert it into the center of the nose itself between the nasal septum in a straight line because the vein is not felt there, then the blood will appear immediately. You should penetrate with the knife slightly and let out as much blood as you need, then bind it for a night because it heals quickly.
As for the cheeks, puncturing them is beneficial for shortness of breath, the onset of leprosy, and blackish diseases that appear on the skin surface, such as black leprosy, smallpox, and bad sores and ulcers. The method of puncturing them is to tie the patient under them in his neck with a band, and the surgeon stands at the head of the patient.
And the patient sits on a chair, then you puncture the vein lengthwise with a fairly wide puncture, then let out a moderate amount of blood or as much as you deem necessary. Then do the same with the other vein, and then remove the bandage.
And the veins are tied moderately so that the patient does not suffocate, and leave it until the next day as the wound will heal. As for the veins of the jaw, puncturing them after puncturing the temple is beneficial for mouth ulcers, gum decay, bad sores, splitting of the lips, and bad sores.
Which are in the nose and around it. The method of puncturing them is to have the patient sit in front of you, tie his neck with a turban, then turn his lips aside and look at the two veins, one seen to the right of the lip and the other to the left, identifying them by their darkness.
That is because around them are thin black veins, so cut them off short. If you find it difficult to distinguish and do not know which they are, aim to cut the larger and clearer ones. Do the same with the two veins in the lower lip.
And as for the two veins under the tongue, it is beneficial to lance them after lancing the temporal artery for goiters that occur in the throat due to tonsillitis and mouth diseases. The method of lancing them is to sit the patient in front of you facing the sun, raise his tongue, and look beneath the tongue where you will find a vein on one side and another vein on the other side, both having a color tending towards black.
You lance them and be cautious not to deeply cut them, for beneath them are arteries, and sometimes bleeding may occur from those arteries. As for the three veins that are lanced in the elbow, they are the ones commonly lanced for everyone, and their lancing is done in two ways.
Either with a broad mint-shaped needle or an olive-shaped one to thinness, or by incision with a knife-shaped needle, and these are the phlebotomy needles. [And this is their image.] Image of the broad mint-shaped needle:.
It should be broad as you see, suitable for opening hollow, full, prominent, visible veins that contain thick blood like sediment. And this is the image of the olive-shaped needle:.
This needle is narrower and has a finer tip, suitable for lancing thin veins that contain thin yellowish blood. And this is the image of the phlebotomy needle:.
This phlebotomy needle is suitable for incision and comes in various widths, broad and thin, according to the width and narrowness of the veins. It can also be used as a reference for other instruments and is well-known among craftsmen.
And as for the basilic vein, which is one of these three veins, the benefit of ligating it is that it draws blood from ailments that occur under the throat and neck, towards the chest and abdomen. The person who ties it should beware and be cautious because there is an artery beneath it; if he makes a mistake and goes too deep with the needle, he may cut this artery.
Bleeding may occur, so it should not be tied with a needle, but rather cut open with a scalpel. If the basilic vein is not clearly visible, it should be avoided and another vein sought or one of its branches found.
Or you can ligate the arm artery, as it is clearly visible and should be cut with a scalpel as we said. If you want to tie it specifically, you should feel the area before tightening the arm to identify the pulse location, then mark it with ink.
Then bind the arm and make a transverse incision in the vein with a scalpel as we said, ensuring that the cut is away from the artery's location. When you tighten the bandage and see swelling at the marked spot, know that this swelling is the pulsation of the artery; avoid it.
If you see the blood gushing out when you make the incision, like a boy's urine, and the blood is thin and red, know that it is arterial blood. In this case, quickly place your finger on it for a long moment, then remove your finger; if the bleeding stops, it often does, then tighten the arm.
Leave it as is, and warn the patient not to neglect it; let it be secure without movement for several days until it heals. If the blood does not stop and you are overwhelmed and do not have medicine at hand, sever the artery if it is visible to you, as its ends will contract and the bleeding will cease.
Take the shell of a pistachio and split it, then take one half and bind it tightly to the site of the bleeding with bandages and ligatures until the next day. If the blood stops, otherwise treat it as previously mentioned by applying hemostatic agents, and stopping its blood is not difficult in most cases.
Due to the small size of the wound and the ability to tie in the arm, inform him. As for the dark vein, the benefit of ligation is that it draws blood from the top of the head to the bottom of the body because it is composed of a branch of the basilic and a branch of the cephalic as we said.
The person performing the ligation should do it on the neck of the vein being ligated, for beneath it are nerves. If he exceeds in puncturing with the lancet and hits the nerve, numbness may occur which is hard to cure, and sometimes does not heal at all, and this nerve often becomes noticeable to the senses.
If it is hidden in some people and is thin and not visible, you should make the ligation a split with a scalpel and avoid the nerve as much as possible. If the vein is between two nerves, cut the vein lengthwise. As for the cephalic vein, the benefit of ligating it is that it draws blood from the head.
It is beneficial for eye diseases, and in this vein especially, if you want to ligate it, do so with stitches using an olive-shaped lancet or a broad basilic lancet because it is the safest of all veins, as there is no artery or nerve beneath it.
However, you should avoid the head of the muscle with the lancet when ligating and seek a softer spot. It does no harm if it is not hit in the first attempt and ligation is repeated. However, it may swell in some people if it is not ligated on the first try.
But that swelling does not harm him at all, and as for the manner of bloodletting and its accidents and what should precede its correction, you should first know that bloodletting is either used for preserving health only.
Or it is used for diseases. That which is used for preserving health and sustaining it and protecting from the occurrence of diseases is to perform bloodletting in one of the three veins in the elbow, I mean the cephalic, basilic, and brachial veins, and the bloodletting should be at the beginning of spring when the signs of fullness appear.
Bloodletting should be done on Sunday or Tuesday after three hours have passed since daybreak. As for bloodletting that is used for diseases, it does not have a limited time but rather whenever the need and necessity arise, whether at night or during the day.
And at every hour and at any time, bloodletting should not be performed on children until they reach fourteen years of age, nor on elders who have surpassed sixty years. When anyone intends to perform bloodletting for any reason.
He should cleanse his bowels before bloodletting with a mild enema if there is much retained feces, so that impurities from the bowels do not adhere to the veins during bloodletting and harm the vital organs. One should not perform bloodletting on pregnant women, drunkards, or intoxicated individuals until those conditions have passed.
One should also avoid bloodletting immediately after sexual intercourse, vomiting, diarrhea, excessive sexual activity, fatigue, exercise, insomnia, fasting, and anything that weakens the body or mind. Then, you should consider thinning the humors beforehand if the blood is thick.
By foods and drinks and medicines if he can do so, then he enters the bath if nothing prevents him or exercises some exercise in order to thin the blood and let his veins be in the middle of the day as we said and aims to clear his chest that day from all evil mental conditions.
Such as worries, anger, fear, and all physical conditions like excessive fatigue, overexertion, sexual intercourse, and the like. Present in his environment are things that people习惯使用的各种香料、芳香和娱乐等，每个人根据自己的能力而定。
Then the surgeon sits on a pillow that is higher than the pillow on which the patient sits. Then he extends his arm, and the surgeon scrapes it with his hand two or three times, then tightens the bandage with the clamp and twists it two or three times, and let the tightening be moderate.
For the tightening, when it is not moderate, either by excessive tightening it prevents the flow of blood, or if it leans to looseness, it also prevents the flow of blood. Then after tightening, the patient should rub his hands together all over.
Until the veins swell and become apparent to the touch. Then the surgeon wipes the lancet with a little old oil, then places his left index finger on the same vein under the spot he intends to cut slightly so that the vein does not escape and avoids the strike. For some veins are like tendons and escape when cut, and some are filled with air so that when the lancet is placed on them, they lower under the lancet and deceive the surgeon, who does not open the vein with the lancet, and even if he opens it, it would be narrow.
Therefore, the surgeon should be certain and deliberate in all these matters, then apply the incision. If the vein opens with that first attempt, otherwise he should repeat it slightly below or above that spot without delay if the area has not become swollen.
If it swells or the patient becomes anxious, leave it for a day or two and do not tighten the bandage as it may cause a hot swelling and he should avoid the bath. Then he can bleed again if desired. If the incision was deep and the opening small and the blood flow thin.
And if you fear that the desired amount of blood will not come out, then reuse the incision in the same hole gently and straight, and slightly increase the opening. Do this quickly before the area swells, for in many people, the area may swell with a small incision.
If you see that it has swollen, do not repeat the incision at all as it will not help. Apply something from oil scouring, for it facilitates blood flow and is better in this case than the oil itself and other ointments.
Use oil scouring in all vein bleedings when blood flow is difficult. The Faruq antidote and shkhzniya can also be used; if either is applied to the area, the blood will become thinner and dissolve if it is thick.
If a large swelling occurs at the site of bleeding, it often happens, especially for those who have not been bled before or if the vein opening was small. Act quickly and place a sponge soaked in warm salt water on the swelling and bind it for an hour, as it will dissolve.
It should be done after the blood has completely come out from the vein itself or another vein, and if there remains any blackness or greenness in the place after some days, that does not harm. If you wish, apply to it some dissolved asphalt and vinegar.
or some juice of cudweed and the like. Swelling and lump often occur when veins are opened, so place your hand on it; if you find it softens when you press it, then that is a bad lump, so beware of applying anything we mentioned to it.
For sometimes the blood of an artery may flow from it, but dress it with something that constricts so the area hardens, then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals. It should be that you draw from each person blood according to their strength and what appears dominant in the color of the blood.
If the blood is black, let it flow until it turns red. Similarly, if you see it thick, allow it to flow until it becomes thin. Likewise, if it is sharp, let it flow until its sharpness subsides. It is appropriate for someone who is robust and strong and needs to have blood drawn all at once.
that the vein incision be widened and the lancet broad. For someone who is weak, the opposite should be done; the blood should be drawn in multiple sessions and the hole should be narrow. The best method for vein incision is to make a slanted, embossed cut, not stitched.
This method of bleeding is safe from excessive bleeding and nerve cutting, and it is better and more secure than bleeding by width or length. For those who faint during bleeding, you should give them some bread soaked in pomegranate juice or skenjbin before the procedure.
If he is feverish and blood has been let from him three or four times, then if his temperament is cooled, let him take before bleeding bread soaked in pymia drink or in sweetened honey drink scented with afwaieh or in a good-smelling herbaceous drink.
If fainting occurs during bloodletting and its cause is the excessive discharge of blood, it is appropriate to give him meat broth and a light herbaceous drink, and to use the scent of galia, rubbing it on his chest, and to employ all that we have mentioned in the section on fainting.
Which results from vomiting, and as for one who wishes to relieve his arm and release blood again, it is appropriate for one whose bleeding was for excessive vomiting and whose strength is weak that the blood be released little by little according to strength over consecutive days.
And for one who wishes to relieve his arm and release blood again and whose body is strong, he should do so after seven or nine hours from the first bleeding. As for one who wants to draw blood from his body to the opposite side to which it has inclined, it is appropriate to relieve him on the second or third day.
And for one in whom the blood is abundant, having heated up and intensified and caused fever, it is appropriate to let out blood all at once and to extract a large quantity, widening the incision until fainting occurs, after being attentive to all the conditions of bloodletting. And place your hand on his pulse while the blood is flowing to prevent death instead of fainting, for this often happens if the bloodletter is ignorant and negligence occurs. And it should not be done if you intend to release the arm and let blood again.
And if the mouth of the vein is closed and it is difficult for the blood to come out, do not poke at it strongly or twist with force, as that is very bad. Rather, either leave it until you can open it again or remove with a scalpel what of the blood has congealed in the mouth of the vein.
Or apply to it some salt that has dissolved in water, or apply to it some of the Farouk antidote or schyzandra and poke it gently until the blood comes out. If the vein has become swollen, then leave it.
Do not touch it until the swelling subsides. If there is a necessity to release blood again and it is unavoidable, then either open it above that spot or open another vein in the other arm or another vein.
As for opening the brachial vein, it is opened instead of the axillary and basilic veins if they are not found or are hidden, because it is composed of both. The method of opening it is to have the patient immerse his hand in hot water until the wrist turns red and the vein becomes clearly visible, then bind above it with a bandage slightly in a moderate tightness.
Then open the vein slightly at an angle, neither across nor straight along, and let the incision be wide. Make your opening above the wrist joint slightly. If the blood does not come out easily, immerse the hand again in hot water and let the blood flow into the water.
Until it meets your need. If you are in the summer days, you might not need to immerse the hand in hot water again. Most often, making the blood flow in hot water is done in winter. Opening this vein is safer than all other veins. For there is no harmful vein or nerve beneath it, and as for bloodletting from the right hand, it is beneficial for liver ailments. The method of bloodletting is to tie the wrist with a bandage or with your hand after placing it in hot water until the vein swells.
For there is no harmful vein or nerve beneath it, and as for bloodletting from the right hand, it is beneficial for liver ailments. The method of bloodletting is to tie the wrist with a bandage or with your hand after placing it in hot water until the vein swells. And it becomes very apparent to the sense, then you bloodlet slightly off-center, and even if you cut it entirely, that will not harm it at all. Be cautious; do not penetrate deeply with the lancet as there are nerves in the fingers and the area is bare of flesh. Then return the hand to hot water.
Leave the blood to flow through it, for if you do not return it to hot water, the blood will coagulate at the mouth of the vein and prevent flow. Once you have extracted the necessary amount of blood, apply oil and salt to the vein so that it does not close quickly.
You should do the same with every narrow branch. As for bloodletting from the left hand, it is beneficial for spleen ailments. Proceed with its bloodletting in the same manner as the other. And bloodletting from the groin is useful for diseases in the lower body, such as uterus ailments.
And it is useful for the retention of menstruation, kidney diseases, chronic leg and thigh ulcers, and similar ailments. The method of bloodletting is to place his foot in hot water and massage until the veins dilate, then tie above the knee joint with a ligature, placing the vein at the ankle on the side toward the big toe.
It branches out into many branches on the leg, so bloodletting should be done in its widest branch or at the ankle where it converges, which is better and safer. If you perform bloodletting on the face of the foot, be cautious of the nerves beneath it.
Make your incision for it with a twist as if you want to amputate and the scalpel should be scraping. If the blood does not flow easily, let him dip his limb in hot water and allow the blood to run out until it is empty. If the vein is missed by the first attempt at bloodletting.
Let him return to bloodletting a little higher, for the area is safe and there is no fear from it if you are cautious of the nerves as we said. Similarly, you should do with the tarsal vein on the other leg. As for the sciatic vein, its location is as we said near the heel on the outer side.
The benefit of bloodletting for hip pain if it is due to hot blood, and the method of bloodletting is that the patient should enter the bathhouse and hurry to tie his leg from the hip up to four fingers above the heel with a thin long bandage, for it will not be apparent without that.
When it appears, perform bloodletting on whichever condition you stay, either with a twist, which is better, or cut it off completely or split it. Its location is safe and in most people, it is very hidden, so if you do not find it.
And if it does not appear at all to the sense, then bloodlet from its branches, which appear on the back of the foot towards the little toe and the ring toe, and be cautious of the nerves, and let out the amount of blood you desire.
Then remove the bandage and place cotton on the site of bloodletting and secure the area, for it will heal quickly.
Chapter Ninety-Six.
On cupping and how to use it.
Cupping vessels may be made of horns, wood, copper, or glass. Cupping is of two types: one with scarification and bloodletting, and the other without scarification.
And this cupping without scarification is of two types.
And the cupping of the axillae, which are the sides of the neck from both sides, and the cupping of the chin, which is below the lower jaw of the mouth, and the cupping of the shoulders, and the cupping of the ankles at the end of the heels, and the cupping of the elbows, which are in the middle of the arms, and the cupping of the legs, and the cupping of the knees.
And cupping draws blood from the thin veins spread in the flesh. For this reason, it does not weaken as bloodletting does, and cupping should not be used, whether with fire or without, in any disease that arises from fullness until the entire body is purged.
When there is a need for cupping due to illness or as a routine practice, it can be performed at any time, whether at the beginning of the month, at the end, in the middle, or at any other time.
This is because there are people who, when they have an excess of blood that requires its removal through cupping, feel heaviness and headache in their head. Some feel fullness and redness in their face, head, and neck. Others experience itching on their face and sides, and darkness and irritation in their eyes. There are also those who itch the area where cupping was performed.
Some laugh excessively, some taste blood in their mouth and their gums bleed and they spit out blood, some sleep a lot, and some see blood, redness, killings, and wounds in their dreams and the like. So when we see any of this.
Especially if it is in the middle third of the month, we recommend cupping after two or three hours have passed since noon. As for the benefit of the nahr cupping, it is beneficial for heaviness in the head and fluid dripping into the eyes.
However, it should be done after the entire body has been purged. This cupping can替代放血，但须注意，那些脑部寒冷或患有感冒的人不应使用此法，因为它会给他们带来极大的伤害。
And therefore, it should not be used by the elderly and those who have cold diseases in their heads, and those who are addicted to it will produce forgetfulness.
And therefore, it should be ordered for the cupper to slightly lower his hand with the cup downwards to avoid causing forgetfulness, and as for cupping the shoulder, it is a substitute for bleeding from the temple and bleeding from the basilic vein.
And therefore, it is beneficial for asthma, shortness of breath, rupture of the respiratory organ, cough, and fullness. It should be slightly raised when cupping the shoulder because if it is made to go down, it will cause weakness in the heart and stomach.
And as for cupping the axillae, it is beneficial for pains occurring in the head, eyelid inflammation, migraine, choking, and pain at the roots of the teeth, and it is a substitute for bleeding from the basilic vein. It should be ordered for the cupper not to deepen his hand with the lancet so as not to cut an artery and cause bleeding.
And as for cupping under the chin, it is beneficial for cankers in the mouth, decay of the gums, and similar diseases in the mouth, and it may serve as a substitute for bleeding from the veins in the lips. As for cupping the shoulders, it is beneficial for palpitations caused by fullness and heat.
And as for cupping the sides of the loins, it is beneficial for what bleeding from the three veins—the basilic, the temple, and the median cubital—benefits, because it draws blood from all those thin vessels in the flesh, and these thin vessels draw from other thicker vessels until the drawing reaches the three thick veins.
It is necessary to instruct the cupper not to be excessive in cupping because the area is devoid of flesh and beneath it are nerves and blood vessels, and as for the single bleeding from the ankle, it is beneficial for hemorrhoids and sores below.
It is necessary to instruct the cupper that the bleeding vessel should be large and made of brass because the area requires strong suction and perhaps a glass bleeding vessel might break and require much cupping. As for the cupping of the legs, it clearly reduces swelling.
Because it attracts blood from the entire body and is beneficial for chronic pains in the kidneys, uterus, and bladder, induces menstruation, and is helpful for boils and swellings. It serves as a substitute for cupping the temples and shins, except that it greatly weakens the body and causes fainting in most people. The benefit of cupping the shins is similar to the benefit of cupping the legs.
The method of placing the cups is to first place the cup empty and suction moderately. Do not keep the cups in place for long but rather place them quickly and remove them quickly so that the mixtures can be evenly applied to the area. Continue repeating this process until you see the area turn red and open up.
When the redness of the blood appears, then you should cup again and gradually suction. Then observe the condition of the bodies. For those whose flesh is delicate and pores loose, it is advisable to cup them once only so that the area does not become ulcerated.
Instruct the cupper to widen the incision slightly and deepen it a bit, and to adjust the suction gently with a delicate movement. If the blood is thick, it should be cupped twice. In the first instance, open a path for the thin blood and its moisture, and in the second instance, to thoroughly extract the thick blood.
If the blood is very turbid, repeat the bleeding a third time to reach the limit. In general, if we want to let out a small amount of blood, one bleeding suffices; if we want to let out a large amount of blood, we perform more bleedings, and if we determine that the blood is thick.
It is necessary to make a deep incision, and the moderate limit for the incision is only the depth of the skin. What should be used with cupping are ointments, water, and what the person getting cupped should avoid. As for those whose skin is thick, hard, dry, and has narrow pores.
It is recommended to apply opening, soothing, and dissolving ointments on the areas where cupping will be performed. If it is summer, use ointments like that of khiryi or violet oil or sweet almond oil or pumpkin seed oil.
If it is winter, use ointments like narcissus oil or lily oil or chamomile oil or hyacinth oil and the like. If the waste matter is thick and cold, then the ointment should be marzunjoosh oil or nightingale oil or cowbane oil or sage oil and the like.
If the person being cupped has wide pores and tender flesh, it is best to avoid using ointments. These individuals should wash the cupping marks after the procedure with rose water or cold water or foxglove water or pumpkin water or purslane water and the like. As for those whose blood is very moist.
He should wash the cupping marks with vinegar or water of wormwood and buckthorn and the like. As for those whose excess matter is thick, they should wash the cupping marks with old wine or marzunjoosh water or sage decoction or chamomile and the like. It is advisable to avoid cupping in the bathhouse and immediately after bathing.
It should be used after exiting the bath by one or two hours and it is not appropriate for anyone to sleep after cupping. What should be managed with the cupped and bloodletting before and after cupping.
You should first look if the one who is to be cupped or bloodlet has a bilious temperament and if his blood tends towards sharpness and inflammation, then he should take cooling things like pomegranate, chicory with vinegar, lettuce, sorrel, and similar juices. His meals should consist of light dishes, lamb broths, legumes, and the like.
And if his temperament is cold, then he should be given honey syrup or sorrel vinegar drink or burdock sorrel, and he should consume moderate aromatic wine that is between old and new. He should be advised to reduce his food intake, and his meals should consist of light dishes, quail, sparrows, and young pigeon stews. The drink on the day of cupping and bloodletting should be more than food.
It may be appropriate to give some people in certain times the Farooq antidote or musk medicine or salvia before cupping and bloodletting or after it to strengthen the main organs and thin the blood. It should not be given to those who are feverish.
As for the cupping that is done without scarification, it is the cupping that is applied to the liver, spleen, breasts, abdomen, navel, kidney area, and hip joint because these organs cannot tolerate scarification. The purpose is either to draw blood from one organ to another.
Like placing the cups on the breasts for the condition of sneezing, or using them to expel a cold air that has lodged in an organ, such as placing the cups on the abdomen and navel. This loosens the organ, warms it, and relieves pain by expelling that air.
And it may be placed on the kidneys if there is a blockage or stone, for by its strength in pulling, it may open the blockage or remove the stone from its place. It also does this when placed on the liver and spleen when there is wind that becomes turbulent within them. These leeches can also be used empty by suction only.
And it may be used with fire, and it may be used filled with lukewarm water for ailments of the eyes. This is done by filling the leech, let it be large, with hot water alone or with water in which some herbs suitable for this have been boiled.
Then it is placed filled on the area, held in place, removed, and repeated as needed, and this is a picture of the leech that is used with fire:
Its mouth should be wide enough to fit two fingers as we have depicted, and its depth should be about half a finger-breadth. There should be a small hole on the side, approximately in the middle, through which an needle can pass. It is made of Chinese brass or yellow brass with thick edges.
It should be smooth, flat, and polished so that it does not harm the organ when placed on it. There should be a cross channel in the middle made of brass or iron where the candle for heat is placed. This leech can also be made larger than described or smaller according to the disease.
And regarding its use, the leeches for children and thin individuals are different from those for men and thick bodies. As for how to place this leech with fire on the organ, it is done by lighting a wick from fine linen or a small candle made of wax and placing it on the middle rod that is in the center of the leech.
The fire should rise upwards towards the bottom of the cup to prevent the patient's body from burning. Then it is placed on the limb, with a finger over the hole mentioned until we grip the cup and no longer need it, then remove the finger.
The steam comes out through that hole and the cup is loosened in its place. Then light the wick as described and repeat if necessary. As for the cup used for treating hemorrhoids with water, it has no rigid rod or hole.
It is used by filling it with water and placing it on the limb only, and this is its shape:.
And this cup is better when it is large to hold a lot of water.
Chapter Ninety-Seven.
On Attaching Leeches.
Leeches are mostly used in parts where cups cannot be placed, either because they are small like the lip and gum, or because the limb is devoid of flesh like the finger and nose and the like.
To use them, select leeches from pure fresh water free of contaminants, then leave them in fresh water for a day and night until they are hungry and there is nothing left in their bodies. Then the body is first bled by venesection or cupping, then the affected limb is wiped.
Until it turns red, then place the leeches on it. When they are full, they will fall off. If possible, cupping the area is more beneficial. Otherwise, wash the area with vinegar and then with plenty of water, massage and squeeze it. If bleeding continues after the leech falls off and this is a discharge, soak a piece of linen in cold water.
Place it from above until the discharge stops. If the blood flows abundantly, sprinkle on it powdered zaj or turpeth or something similar that constricts until the blood stops, or apply peeled and split fennel to the area.
Leave it until the fennel adheres to the area, for the blood will stop. If leeching needs to be repeated, do not use that same leech if possible to use another one. If the leech refuses to attach, then wipe the area with fresh blood.
Or prick a needle in the area until some blood comes out, then place [the leech]. For when it senses some blood, it will adhere to its position. If you want to remove it, sprinkle on it some aloes or salt or ashes; it will fall off easily.
The Third Chapter.
On Fractures.
This chapter also deals with the skills required in the art of medicine, which is setting and treating fractures and dislocations that occur in bones.
Know, my sons, that this chapter may be claimed by ignorant physicians and laypeople who have never browsed through an ancient book on the subject or read a single letter from it.
Because of this reason, this branch of knowledge has become non-existent in our country, and I have never come across anyone who is proficient in it at all. What I have gained from it, I have gained through extensive reading of the books of the predecessors and my dedication to understanding them until I extracted that knowledge from them. Then, I persisted in practice and training throughout my life.
And I have depicted for you in this chapter all that my knowledge encompasses. And my experience with it has passed after I brought it close to you, freed it from the pitfalls of lengthiness, condensed it as much as possible, clarified it to the utmost, and presented many illustrations of the tools used in it.
For it is an addition to the clarification as I did in the previous two chapters, and there is no power except by Allah the Most High, the Great.
The first chapter.
Since there are summaries and key points regarding the matter of broken bones that should be presented, before we begin to discuss each fractured or dislocated limb individually, it is appropriate to mention some sayings and sections at the beginning of this chapter. First, they will compel you to understand them and grasp their true nature, you and whoever is eager to learn this noble craft besides you.
So I say, whenever a fracture, dislocation, swelling, or fall occurs to someone, you should first quickly address his bloodletting or purging, or both. Unless there is a hindrance such as weakness, or the one who experienced it is a child or an old frail person, or the time is extremely hot or extremely cold.
Then, limit his diet to cold legumes, the meat of birds and kids, and avoid drinks, heavy meats, overeating, and any food that fills the veins with blood until you are certain there will be no swelling and do not expect any substance to flow to the affected area.
Then the patient should return to his usual regimen. When the broken bone begins to heal, the patient ought to be fed food that is thick, substantial, and strong with粘性如大麦、稻米、豆类和牛肚。 And eggs and soft fish and thick drinks and the like, for with this regimen the healing of the fracture will be faster and better. Know that if the broken bones are in strong men and elders, they cannot reconnect and heal to their original nature ever.
Due to the dryness and hardness of their bones, what was extremely flexible, like the bones of small children, may connect and heal, but nature grows something on the broken bone from all sides that resembles glue in thickness, adhering to it and strengthening it until they adhere to each other.
It binds them together until it reaches the utmost strength and security as it was initially, so that nothing hinders its actions.
For this reason, the patient's diet should include foods that are strong, adhesive, and thick, as we have said. Know that fractures differ in type according to the different parts of the body, for a leg bone fracture is different from a skull bone fracture, and a chest bone fracture is different from a spine bone fracture.
And so it is with all other parts of the body, each differing from one another. We will come to describe each type of fracture in detail in its own section, separately from the others. The type of bone fracture may also vary on its own.
For it may be that his fracture is splintered without shards occurring in it, and his fracture may be along the bone, and its fracture has shards and projections, some protruding and others not, and the fracture occurs with a wound and perforation in the skin, and the fracture may be a slight crack.
For each type has a specific method in setting it, as will be detailed in its place. Among the signs of bone fracture are its bending, confusion, visibility to the sense, and its crackling when you touch it with your hand.
When there is no visible bending, no crackling, and you do not feel any disturbance when you touch the bone, and the patient does not experience much pain, then there is no fracture; it may be a sprain or a slight bruise or a minor crack. Therefore, it should not be moved by stretching or pressing at all.
Rather, apply to it the medicines that will be mentioned later, then bind it gently. Know that if the bone is broken and split into two without shards occurring in it, each part has moved away from the other.
You should promptly set it and align it before a hot swelling occurs. If a hot swelling does occur, leave it for some days until the hot swelling subsides, then align it as gently and skillfully as you can.
Know that setting and aligning it is easier than with a bone in which shards have occurred. Then, bind it as will be detailed later. If the bone has shards, it is necessary to stretch the broken limb from both sides, whether an arm or a leg.
Either with your hands if the limb is small, or with two ropes, or with the rope and hand. Place the limb on a flat surface in its natural shape so that when part of the broken bone extends, then reduce those protrusions to their places with all the cunning and gentleness you can manage.
Strive to ensure that your actions do not cause pain or discomfort to the patient. Aim to align one bone with its counterpart in the best possible position, and during this process, touch and feel them with your hand. If you notice anything amiss, correct and adjust it to the best of your ability.
Beware of excessive stretching and strong poking, as many unskilled people do. Often, their actions cause severe swelling or deformity in the limb, which I have observed from their practices on multiple occasions.
After alignment, perfection, and securing, keep that limb still and at ease. Instruct the patient not to move it whether awake or asleep, during turning or disturbance, during defecation, or in all movements as much as possible, and ensure its position is one where pain is avoided.
For if he feels pain or discomfort in the position of the limb, he should move it to another position where he does not feel pain, and at the same time, ensure that its position is flat and straight.
To prevent deformity in the limb when it heals, and as for how to secure a broken limb, I will describe it to you. Know that broken limbs differ in size and shape; those that are small, such as the arm, finger, ankle, and the like.
It is necessary that the bandages be light and gentle, but for those areas which are tough like the thigh, back, and chest, the bandages should be broad and strong because the wide strap holds the large limb securely, binding it equally on all sides without any imbalance.
Then after you finish leveling, you should apply the corresponding paint. With a gentle pressure on the site of the fracture, you begin to wrap the bandage around the fracture itself three or four turns, depending on what the limb requires. You slightly tighten the bandage with your hand and then go up to the upper side of the fracture site.
With less tension than you applied to the fractured area, you then move the wrapping slightly away from the fracture site and gradually loosen the tension little by little until you achieve a proper fit for the correct position. Then take another bandage and wrap it around the fractured area as well.
After the turns, you move the wrapping to the lower side of the fracture. Your action in tightening and loosening the wrap should be as we mentioned for the first upper wrap. Then place some gentle padding or cloth between the wraps to straighten out the deformity of the fracture.
If there is a deformity, then place something in it to correct it; otherwise, do not add anything. Then wrap another bandage over it and apply the tight splints immediately on these wraps if there is no swelling or hot inflammation in the limb.
If there is swelling or hot inflammation, apply something to reduce the swelling and eliminate the inflammation. Leave it for a few days, then apply the splints at that time. The splints should be made of broad, carved, and wisely prepared half-reeds, or they can be made of colander wood.
Which is made from pine or palm fronds or reed or linen and the like that are available of these, and let the width of each splint be in this form and exactly this shape.
Except that the splint which is placed on the fracture itself should be slightly thicker and wider than the other splints, and as for the length of the splint, it is made according to what is appropriate for the size of the broken limb, the form of the splint:.
Then bind the splints with another bandage according to the same tightness as your first binding, then secure it from above with tight threads according to what we mentioned about the tightness, which is that your binding at the site of the fracture should be tighter. And the further away from the fracture, the looser the binding should be.
The threads should be of moderate thickness and fineness, and they should preferably be made of wet linen, because if the threads are too thick, as I have seen ignorant people do when they make their threads from twisted linen strips, it is a great mistake.
Because binding with them leads to excessive tightness, and very thin threads are also unsuitable because you will not achieve the desired tightness with them. There should not be less than a finger's width between each splint.
If the patient is bothered by the edges of the splints after they are correctly tightened, place soft padding or loose wool under them so that it does not cause any discomfort. If the fracture is accompanied by a wound and there is a break in the skin, we will address this separately.
And know that not every broken limb should be bound with splints from the first day. This is because if the limb is large, splints should not be applied to it until after five or seven days, or more, according to your assurance of the absence of hot swelling.
And this is the description of the bandages which the ancients used for fractures, dislocations, and wounds. A general brief description of a bandage that fixes fractures and suits most temperaments, especially children and women, as it does not excessively heat or cool.
Take the flour dust from the mill, which sticks to the walls of the millstone when the mill is in motion. Knead it without sifting, using egg whites, making sure the dough is neither too thick nor too thin, then apply it.
Description of another bandage for fixing fractures, dislocations, and wounds: Take marshmallow, alum, atractylis, rhatany, wool, and sugar—ten drachms of each. Also take vinegar and honey—five drachms of each. Additionally, take willow twenty drachms, and Armenian or Roman clay twenty drachms. Grind all the ingredients and mix them with willow water or egg whites if the patient's temperament is hot. Use this bandage, as it is well-composed, quickly fixes broken bones, and suits most people due to its balance.
Description of another bandage that is also beneficial for fractures and wounds: Take wool, marshmallow, and white colocynth—ten drachms of each. Also take vinegar and honey—five drachms of each. Add atractylis six drachms, and Armenian clay twenty drachms. Grind all the ingredients finely, sieve them, knead with water or egg whites, and apply.
Description of a bandage for joints and bones that have moved from their places, which alleviates the pain associated with them, and for bone fractures and breaks. Take white wool, soak it in vinegar and cooked oil, then place it on the affected area. This bandage does not have healing power.
However, it is excellent for reducing hot swelling and alleviating pain particularly. Description of another bandage that mends broken bones: take dark fig leaves and wild poppy leaves, grind them together, and apply them moistly. Description of another brief bandage to use when mending a bone fracture.
And when you want to reduce the remaining swelling, take equal parts of the root of calamint, chamomile, purple violet, and ground cyperus rotundus. Grind all together and knead with egg white if the limb is not inflamed. If it is inflamed, then knead with coriander water or plain water and use it.
Description of another bandage that is stronger for reducing swelling, used when solid swelling occurs during the mending of a bone. Take equal parts of the root of calamint, flaxseed, fenugreek, marigold, martynia, purple violet, and chamomile.
Grind all together and knead with decoction water or fresh water or egg white, according to the heat of the limb and its cooling. As for Hippocrates, he did not mention in his book that anything should be placed on the broken limb when mending it.
Except for the cerate made from wax and oil alone, and it should be described as being moderate between thickness and thinness. As for Galen, he advised that things with a drying quality along with some warmth, such as salt, opoponax, and frankincense, among others we have mentioned, should be placed on the broken limb when mending it.
A description of a bandage that is beneficial for weakness and pain: Take wood ashes, chickpeas, human hair or bird feathers, colocynth, and salt in equal parts. Pound them, sieve them, knead them, and apply them as a bandage. As for the amount of time the bandage should remain in place.
Then it is to be left in place, for you should observe if there is no pain or itching in the injured area and the broken bone does not move from its position; then do not remove it for many days. If there is severe itching or disturbing pain or swelling in the area, then it should be removed.
Hasten to remove it at that time and do not delay in the slightest, then remove the bandage. Take a soft cloth or a wet sea sponge, dip it in lukewarm water, and wash the area with it until the itching and pain subside, then leave the limb to rest for an hour.
Then apply clean wool soaked in vinegar and oil or rose fat, bind it on for a night to prevent inflammation and to subdue the swelling and pain of the limb. Afterwards, return it to gentle binding with a light bandage without tightening it as you did initially.
Tenderly care for it until it heals. If you see that the swelling, redness, pain, and all other symptoms have completely disappeared and you need bandaging and binding again, then repeat as you did initially. If none of the mentioned issues occur in the limb.
Do not remove it until three, four, five, or seven days have passed; it may even be left for twenty days. All of this depends on the condition of the limb as you observe it, as we have said, until the break is secure and the flesh is close to healing over it.
Also increase the tension more than your first tightening altogether, and also increase the thickness of the patient's diet as previously mentioned. If you see that the site of the fracture has dried out and become thinner than it should be, then know that nourishment is prevented from reaching it.
So treat it with lukewarm water every time you change the dressing, and let that be done every three days. Slightly reduce the tension, for by this action, nourishment flows to the member and it heals quickly. As for what the ignorant among the bone setters do, which is to break the member again.
If it does not set properly at first and sets crooked, then that is an error in their action and a great deception. Even if it were correct, the ancients would have mentioned it in their books and acted accordingly. I have never seen any trace of that from any of them at all. And the correct approach is not to follow it.
The Second Chapter.
On incidental fractures in the head.
Incidental fractures in the head are diverse, their forms are different, and their causes are varied. Some fractures result from a sword blow and may involve the complete separation of the bone until it reaches the membrane beneath the bone. Just as an axe does to wood.
This type of fracture is therefore called an axe-like fracture. Or, the sword may cut part of the bone and only separate its surface without penetrating to the end, which is called an avulsion fracture. The wound of these fractures may be either large or small.
And there are fractures that become crushed or shattered, and their cause is a blow by a stone or falling onto a stone or the like. This type of fracture either penetrates close to the membrane beneath the bone or it may be on the surface of the bone.
The wound of these two fractures can also be either large or small, and there are fractures that are hidden in the bone at the fineness of hair, which is a slight crack.
For this reason, this type of fracture is called hairline. Among them are fractures caused by a fall or a blow from a stone or the like, where the surface of the bone indents inward, making the area concave, as seen in a copper pot when struck, part of it indenting inward.
This is most common in fresh bone heads, such as the heads of children. All these types of fractures may have disassociated and undisassociated fragments, and we will discuss the treatment of all of them in their respective places. We identify all these types of fractures through examination.
Examining it with probes and removing the rotten flesh from it. As for the hairline type, it is identified by examining the bone, wiping it, and applying ink, then the fracture will appear black. As for treating the fracture, first consider the symptoms of the patient.
If you see symptoms that clearly indicate fear, such as vomiting bile, stretching, loss of consciousness, loss of voice, fainting, acute fever, protruding and red eyes, and other similar symptoms, do not approach the patient or treat them, for death is inevitable in most cases with these symptoms.
And if you see symptoms that do not alarm you and you hope for his safety, then at that time begin his treatment. This is the case when the wounded comes to you right after being wounded, and this happens in the winter days.
It is necessary to strive to remove the bone before the fourteenth day in any case, and if it is in the summer days, you should hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day so that what is under the bone of the membrane does not spoil, thus causing those symptoms we described.
If the bone fracture has reached the membrane covering the brain and is accompanied by fragmentation and bruising, it is necessary to cut away the fragmented and bruised portion as I describe to you, which is to shave the head of the injured patient.
And expose the bone in whatever manner is feasible for you, according to the shape of the wound and what is easier on the patient. If bleeding or a hot swelling appears when exposing the bone, handle it as appropriate.
This involves stuffing the area with cloths soaked in a mixture of wine and rose oil, and cleaning the wound until the swelling subsides and bleeding is controlled. Then proceed to set the bone and extract it, which can be done in one of two ways.
One method is to cut the bone with a sharp, narrow-bladed instrument, and this is its form:
Then use another cutter after this one, slightly wider, and this is its form:
Then use another cutter, even wider than the second. It is necessary to have a set of different cutters, some wider than others, and some shorter than others, with extremely sharp edges. They should be made of Indian iron or good steel.
Use gentleness in tapping on the fractured area so as not to displace the head and harm it. If the bone is strong and solid, you should pierce around it before using the saws with drills which they call non-penetrating drills and these are named non-penetrating drills.
Because it does not exceed the boundary of the skull bone to what is beyond it, as the drill has a round edge below its sharp head, similar to a ring or small circle that prevents it from sinking and exceeding the thickness of the bone.
You should have a variety of these drills, each suitable for the thickness of that bone, so that you have a drill whose sharp end length and size match the thickness of that skull. This is the image of three types. Of the drills, there is a large, medium, and small:
As for the method of drilling around the broken bone, you place the drill on the bone and rotate it with your fingers until you know that the bone has been penetrated. Then move the drill to another location, making sure there is a distance between each hole equal to the thickness of a thread or similar.
Then, use the saw to cut between each pair of holes and do this with utmost gentleness as we have said until you remove the bone, either by hand or with another tool from among the instruments you have prepared for this purpose.
Such as glue and delicate forceps. You should be extremely careful that the drill or saw does not touch any part of the membrane. If you have removed the bone and it has healed from the membrane, which was attached to it, and you have extracted it, you should then clean it thoroughly.
And smooth out the roughness that remains in the bone with another tool similar to the saw, except it should be thinner and more delicate than other saws. If any small bones or splinters remain, gently remove them with the tools you have.
Then treat the wound with bandages and ointments which will be mentioned. As for the other aspect of the work, it is very simple and far from harm, as Galen mentioned and greatly praised, and this is his saying. You should first begin by exposing the part of the bone where the fracture is most severe and noticeable. Once you have exposed that part, place the tip of this lens-shaped saw under it, and this is its shape:
The lens-shaped part of it should be smooth and not cut anything, while the sharp part is on the sides extending in length as you see, so that the lens-shaped part rests against the periosteum and the sharp face of the saw is against the bone. Then strike the saw from one side.
With a small mallet until you cut through all the bone gently as it turns, and you are safe from any harmful incident in the membrane, even if the surgeon were the most ignorant and timid of people. Indeed, even if he were drowsy.
If any part of the membrane remains attached to the bone in some areas, scrape it off with the edge of the lens-shaped saw itself and remove it gently, for it can be removed without harm or fear.
And if the bone fracture has not penetrated to the membrane, and only the surface of the bone is broken with roughness and small splinters remaining, you should remove that roughness and extract those splinters with delicate chisels that have been made in various sizes so that you can use the most appropriate and suitable one for each area according to what the work guides you to.
And the nature of the fractured bone and its shape, and it is appropriate that you first use for scraping the bone the widest of those scrapers, then use after it a finer one than it, and continue doing this successively until you reach using the finest and thinnest of them all.
And as for other small, superficial cuts and delicate fractures, it is appropriate to use treatment for each one according to what leads to its improvement, which is something not hidden from anyone with even the least skill in this craft and who has understood what we have written and explained about large fractures.
If the membrane remains exposed when you extract the bone, it is appropriate to take a piece of linen cloth according to the size of the wound and soak it in rose oil, then place it on the mouth of the wound. Then take another folded or triangular cloth. And soak it in a mixture of rose oil, then place it on the first piece of cloth. Do this as gently as you can so as not to burden the intestines. Then use a wide bandage on top and do not tighten it beyond what is necessary to hold the wound in place only.
And leave it with this treatment for a day or two until you are certain that the heat has subsided, then remove it and use thereafter medicines that have a drying quality, such as the roots of lilies, crushed cyperus, powdered millet, and zeraunja, and the like. This is done by making a powder from these medicines.
And sprinkle the powder on the wound while it is dry. In general, use a medicine that cleanses without irritating. Strive to keep the treatment of the wound clean, with no foul-smelling oil or dirt, and do not allow pus to accumulate at all.
For the pus, when it gathers on the meningeal membrane, spoils and corrupts it, causing a great calamity to the patient; and it may occur in the cerebral membranes when the bone is exposed, especially if its treatment is neglected.
If there is a blackness on its surface, and you observe that the patient exhibits the symptoms we mentioned, then know that he is surely doomed. If the blackness occurred due to a medicine applied to it, and that medicine was potent enough to cause such blackness.
You should take a portion of honey and three portions of rose oil, mix them well, soak a cloth in the mixture, then apply it to the wound, and continue treating it with appropriate treatments until it heals.
Chapter Three.
On the setting of the nose if it is broken.
Know that only the upper parts of the nose, both or one of them, can break because they are made of bone. The lower part is cartilaginous and does not break but may suffer from swelling, deformity, and indentation.
If one side of it is broken, you should insert your little finger into the nostril and align the fracture from inside while using your index finger and thumb to manipulate it from outside until the nose returns to its natural shape. Do this gently and be careful not to cause pain to the patient with your actions.
If the fracture is at the top of the nose and your finger cannot reach it, you should straighten it with a slightly thickened rod. If the fracture is on both sides, do the same. It is advisable to set it on the first day of the fracture.
If possible, otherwise after the seventh or tenth day when the hot swelling subsides, then insert into the nostril's hole a wick of cotton cloth if the fracture is on one side or insert two wicks if the fracture is on both sides.
Let the wick be thick enough to fill the nostril's hole, and some of the early experts in setting fractures mentioned that the wick should be soaked in lard and changed every day. I do not agree with that; rather, the wick should be soaked in egg white mixed with millstone dust.
Then leave the wick until the bone sets and the cartilage hardens. Feather quills of ducks can be inserted into the nose in place of the wick, wrapped with soft cloth to better support the nasal fracture and to ensure the patient can breathe.
This is not necessary, if you choose to do it or make the wicks instead. If a hot swelling appears on the nose during your treatment, dress the nose with kerotyo or cotton soaked in vinegar and rose oil or some ointment of diachylon.
If no hot swelling occurs, it is advisable to dress it externally with semolina flour and bulgur wheat that has been mixed with egg white, then place a soft bandage over it. Do not bind the nose at all. If the nasal bones are fractured in small fractures.
Or if they are shattered, it is advisable to incise and remove them with a suitable instrument, then suture the incision and treat it with ointments that promote healing and suppuration. If there is a wound inside the nose, it should be treated with wicks and lead pipes should be used. Until it heals.
Chapter Four.
On the repair of the lower lip if it is broken.
If the lower lip is broken and there is no wound with the fracture, you should examine it. If the fracture is only from the outside and has not split into two parts nor caved inwards, then its treatment is easier.
It is advisable that if the fracture is on the right side, you should insert the index finger of the left hand into the patient's mouth. Similarly, if the fracture is on the left side, you should insert the index finger of the right hand and gently raise the raised part of the fracture from inside to outside.
Your other hand should control it from the outside to straighten it. If the jaw fracture has split into two, it is advisable to pull from both sides in a straight line until it is aligned. If the teeth have become misaligned as a result, they must be corrected.
Or if they are separated, sew them together with a thread of gold, silver, or silk where you hope it will stay. Then apply kerotike to the broken lip and place a folded cloth over it. Over the cloth, put on a large, secure splint or a piece of sole leather equal in length to the lip. Then tie it from above according to what seems appropriate for binding and keeping it together so that it does not come apart. Instruct the patient to rest and remain calm, and give them soft, easily digestible food. If you suspect any change in shape has occurred, promptly untie it on the third day.
Then tie it from above according to what seems appropriate for binding and keeping it together so that it does not come apart. Instruct the patient to rest and remain calm, and give them soft, easily digestible food. If you suspect any change in shape has occurred, promptly untie it on the third day. Then you should prepare what you bandage with mill dust and egg white or with semolina flour after removing the lint from it, and place a soft cloth over the bandage. As long as that bandage sticks to it and no change occurs in the bone's condition, leave it.
Do not remove it until it heals and the fracture strengthens, for this fracture often strengthens in three weeks. If during that time a hot swelling appears, use what we have mentioned repeatedly to alleviate it until the swelling disappears.
And if the fracture is with a wound, examine it. If a fragment or fragments of bone have become detached, gently extract those fragments in a way that suits their removal from the wound. If the opening of the wound is narrow, widen it with a scalpel as needed.
Then, after you have extracted those fragments and nothing remains, suture the opening of the wound if it is wide; otherwise, apply one of the ointments suitable for that. Suture the wound until it heals.
Chapter Five.
On the setting of the ribs if they are fractured.
Ribs most often fracture from the front, near the end of the shoulder blade. Their fracture can occur in one of three ways: either they break and collapse without producing fragments, which is the easiest to set.
Or fragments may be produced in the fracture, which is more difficult to set. Or the fracture may occur with a wound. If the fracture does not involve a wound, prepare two assistants: one to hold the arm adjacent to the fractured rib, and the other to extend the neck toward the opposite side.
Then align the fracture with your fingers until its shape is as it should be, without any protrusion or indentation. If more extension is needed, you should place a ball of cloth or wool under the armpit of the patient.
Its bone should be according to your need, extend and raise the splint and press the ball with your hand until the fracture is aligned as it should be. If you cannot pull the end of the splint out because it has gone deep, then the patient should lie on his back.
A moderately thick pillow is placed under his armpit, and the servant presses his shoulder downward until the end of the splint that has gone deep rises up. Then align and correct the fracture with your fingers.
If you feel that a splinter of the bone has broken off and is moving, you should incise over it and gently remove that splinter. If the splinter is lodged in the bone, you must devise a way to cut it with one of the saws prepared for this purpose. After placing under the splint the device that protects the intestines, which is made of wood or iron, and this is its shape:
It resembles a spoon without any indentation. Its width should be according to the size of the bone, whether large or small. Its length should also be suitable for the task at hand. It should have two ends, one end being wider and the other narrower as you see.
If the incision you made to remove the bone splinter is wide and you are not concerned about a hot swelling, then suture the edges of the wound together. If the incision is small or you fear a hot swelling, then pack the wound with cloth and bandages according to the cut of the wound.
If a hot tumor appears, then soak the incision in rose oil and vinegar or wine and apply it. As for setting the bone when there is no cut or incision, it is to apply to the bone a dressing made from mill powder mixed with egg white. Place the soft splint on it, then put a ball under his armpit if needed. Then take a turban that is very long and about a finger's breadth wide or so. Then apply a folded pad on the splint and dressing. Then take a splint from a thin board. Its width should be three fingers and the same in length. Then insert it into a cloth, then place that cloth with the splint in the part of the turban that falls over the fracture site, then tighten the turban around the fracture as you go around. Place it around his neck, under his healthy armpit, and under his injured armpit, wrap it several times on each side, and adjust the tension as you see fit to secure the fracture firmly, which is not something that would escape your notice.
The goal of all this is to ensure that the splint does not move from the broken bone. Therefore, you should check on the patient every day. Whenever the bandage loosens and you see that the splint has moved, correct it and tighten the bandage. Then make the patient sleep on their back and place a small pillow under their armpit when they sleep at night.
So that his arm is raised from his side, thus raising the clavicle fracture with the elevation of the shoulder, or bind his arm to his neck. Do not remove the bandage unless an incident occurs at the site, such as itching or swelling, until twelve days have passed.
Then renew the dressing if you see a need for it. Tie it tightly and leave it until the clavicle fracture heals and becomes stronger, which takes about twenty-eight days. And in some people, it may take less time than that.
Chapter Six.
On the healing of a shoulder fracture. The shoulder rarely breaks at its broad part, but rather its ends may break. Whenever a part of it breaks or it breaks in the middle, this can be known by touch. The treatment should be according to the form of the fracture.
Straighten it and return it to its natural shape by whatever means possible, then apply the powder of the millstone with egg white and soft wax to the area. Place a folded cloth pad on top, then secure it with a wide board splint.
Make it thin enough to cover the entire shoulder or slightly wider. If there is an indentation under the splint in any part of the shoulder, fill that indentation with soft wax until the splint lies flat. Then secure it from above with a long bandage.
Tie it firmly and ensure the splint does not move from its place. Check the bandage every day; whenever it loosens, tighten it, and adjust the splint if it moves. The patient should lie on their sound side, and the shoulder will heal in twenty days.
It takes twenty or twenty-five days. Once this period is complete, remove the bandage with confidence, as it is one of the bones that does not fear fracturing or collapsing. If a splinter appears from the bone and pierces under the skin, cut over it and extract it. And make what I mentioned for the fracture of the clavicle to soothe the hot swelling if any of that occurs.
Chapter Seven.
On the treatment of chest fractures.
The chest may fracture in its center, though this is rare. More commonly, the sides are fractured and shattered. Among its symptoms, if its center fractures, it tilts downwards, causing severe pain, difficulty in breathing, and coughing.
And sometimes blood may be expelled, and the depression in the fractured bone becomes apparent and is not hidden to the sense. To treat it, the patient should lie on their back with a pillow between their shoulders, then press their shoulders and bring the ribs together from both sides with the hands, carefully aligning them as much as possible.
Continue until the bone returns to its proper shape, then apply a bandage and pressure, and place a splint made of a light board of poplar or willow or something similar over it after wrapping it in cloth. Then carefully tie it to the fractured bone so that it does not move, wrap the bandage around in a circular manner towards the back several times and secure it tightly, then check the bandage at all times, and whenever it loosens, tighten it.
And if necessity calls for it to be loosened due to suppuration, pain, or swelling in the area, then promptly loosen it, remove the bandage, and address whatever has occurred with its appropriate treatment, then reapply the bandage if you see fit. And apply tension to it until it heals.
Chapter Eight.
On the setting of ribs when broken, know that the break in the ribs occurs in the thick parts adjacent to the back, and their ends from the front are only subjected to compression because they are cartilaginous. The knowledge of this is not hidden upon examination with the fingers.
Set it by aligning the break with your fingers in a manner that the shape becomes as it should be, then bandage it and bind the broken bone with a splint if necessary. If the rib fracture is inclined inward, it will cause severe pain to the patient.
And it perforates like the perforation that occurs to one with pleurisy because the bone perforates the membrane, and shortness of breath, coughing, and spitting up a lot of blood also occur. This is difficult to treat, and predecessors have employed various methods to deal with it.
Some say that the patient's diet should include foods that produce gas to inflate the belly and expand it, pushing the fracture outward. However, we discourage this so as not to cause a hot swelling if it has not already occurred; if it has occurred, it will only exacerbate and confirm it.
Some have said that a cupping glass should be placed on the area and then suctioned strongly, which seems reasonable except for the concern that the cupping glass might pull too much from the weakened area. Others say that the area should be covered with wool soaked in hot oil.
And the padding is placed between the ribs until it fills, making the bandage even when wrapped around, then treat the patient with the treatment for fractures of food and medicine, if the patient suffers a severe exhaustion that he cannot bear. And the bone was piercing the membrane painfully, and we feared for the patient, so it should be that we incise the area and expose the fractured rib, then place beneath it the device that protects the peritoneum which has been previously described, and cut the bone gently and remove it.
Then, if the wound is large, we bring the edges of the wound together with sutures and treat it with ointments until it heals. If during this time a hot swelling appears, act quickly, soak the padding in rose oil, place it on the area, and treat the patient internally with what alleviates the swelling as well.
And he should lie on the side that allows him to sleep more comfortably until he heals.
Chapter Nine.
On the treatment of spinal and neck fractures.
As for the bones of the neck, if they are fractured, which is rare, and more often they suffer from contusions; the same applies to the vertebrae of the back. If this happens to someone and you want to know whether they will heal or not. Then observe, if you see that his hands have become weak, numb, and lifeless, and he is unable to move them, stretch them, or grasp with them, and when pricked or pierced with a needle, he does not feel it and finds no pain in them, then know that he will not heal in most cases and he is doomed.
And if he moves them and feels biting and pricking in them, know that the bone marrow is safe and the patient will recover with treatment. If the vertebrae are similarly affected and you want to know if they will also recover or not.
Look at his legs, if you see that they have become weak and what happened to the hands has also occurred in them, then when he lies on his back, gas and feces are expelled involuntarily, and when he lies on his stomach, urine is expelled involuntarily. And if he lies on his back and wants to urinate but is unable to do so, know that he is doomed, so do not bother with his treatment. If none of these symptoms appear, the condition is milder. The treatment for what has occurred is to aim to reduce the hot swelling.
Place on the affected vertebra rose oil alone or mixed with roasted egg yolks. Apply this three times a day until the hot swelling subsides. Then apply one of the strengthening, drying poultices to the area, bind it tightly with a bandage, and order him to rest and remain still.
He should only sleep on the side that does not cause him pain until he recovers. If a fragment of bone or something else has become detached due to the fracture, it is necessary to cut open the skin and remove that piece of bone. Then, if the wound is large, bring the edges of the wound together with sutures, then treat it with unifying ointments until it heals. If the last bone of the tail, which is the tip, breaks, you should insert the thumb of the left hand into the anus.
And the broken bone is aligned with the other hand as much as possible and alignment is achieved, then apply bandaging and splinting if necessary, then secure it.
If you feel a broken fragment in it, incise over it and remove it, and treat the wound as described until it heals.
Chapter Ten.
On the treatment of hip fracture.
The vertebrae rarely break, but if they do break, the fracture occurs at their ends where they crumble and split lengthwise, tilting inward. The patient experiences pain in the affected area, swelling, and numbness in the leg on the side of the fracture.
To set it, place your hand over the fracture to understand its shape. If the fracture is only at the ends, align that fracture as much as possible to resemble its natural shape.
If the fracture is lengthwise or has tilted inward, lay the patient on their stomach to set the fracture. Once aligned, apply bandaging and then place a splint made of wood or leather over it and secure it tightly.
Do not fear the displacement of the fracture or the shifting of the splint. Fill in the concavities of the ribs to ensure even tension. Instruct the patient to sleep on their back or on their healthy side. If swelling occurs, apply a warm poultice.
Stop extending and setting it until the warm swelling subsides. Apply what is necessary to alleviate it as previously described, then return to setting and securing it properly. If there are fragments or crumbling at the ends of the bone, they should not be removed.
And it is not touched but leveled from the outside as we said and its dressing is left until it heals.
Chapter Eleven.
On the Setting of Humerus Fractures.
The humerus is what lies between the elbow and the shoulder. If it fractures, it should be set in one of two ways. The first is to take a smooth, moderately thick curved stick as follows:
And ties two bands to its ends, then hangs it from a high place. The patient sits on a chair, then throws his fractured arm over the stick until his armpit is attached to the center of the curvature of the stick, then suspends something heavy above it.
Or a servant extends it downwards, then the doctor aligns the fracture with both hands until the broken parts are set in place. The other method is for the patient to lie on his back and have his hand suspended from his neck with a band.
Then you order two servants, one to hold above the fracture with both hands and the other to hold below it, each pulling in their direction. If you want the extension to be stronger, tie a band below the fracture and another above it, and have each servant pull them in their direction.
If the fracture is close to the shoulder joint, it is best for the middle of the band to be under the armpit and the other under the fracture towards the elbow. Similarly, if the fracture is close to the elbow, the band should be placed at that location and on the elbow itself.
Then align the fracture gently without violence until the fracture is set as it should be and unites well. Then bind it if there is no inflammation. If there is inflammation, leave binding until the seventh day, and apply a cloth cleansed and soaked in vinegar and rose oil.
Until the inflammation subsides, then bind it. The method of binding is to place a dressing on the fracture, then wrap a strip of new cloth over the dressing. Gather the arm around the upper arm itself and place his hand open on his shoulder.
And use the cloth and binding on the upper arm and arm so that the arm serves as a splint, unless something prevents you from doing so and nothing changes in the fractured bone. If you fear that something might change due to that, then use splints.
It involves placing on the fracture itself a splint that is wider and stronger than the other splints, with an interval of one finger's width between each splint. The length of the splints should be according to the fracture, adding three fingers' width from each side.
Then bind the splints with the binding method I mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
It is that your binding at the site of the fracture should be tighter.
The binding should be less tight as you move away from the fracture. If you see that placing the splints and binding as we described at the time of setting the limb is appropriate, then do so.
If you fear inflammation, then leave the binding and splints until the seventh day as we said. Then examine the bandage every three days to ensure that no itching, swelling, or obstruction of nourishment to the limb occurs due to excessive tightness, and adjust accordingly as mentioned.
If you are confident that none of this will occur, do not loosen the bandage except after many days, and the patient should lie on his back with his hand on his stomach, and a pillow filled with wool should be placed under his armpit, moderately full.
And check at all times, whether night or day, to ensure that the shape of the broken limb does not deteriorate or the bandage loosens; correct everything with your effort. Make the patient's diet as we have mentioned, the food should be mild initially until the bone begins to strengthen.
It is necessary to make his diet more substantial, for it is usual for the arm and leg to strengthen in forty days. At that time, the bandage should be removed, he should use the bath, and be treated with ointments suitable for this purpose. If the fracture is severe and infected.
Do not remove the bandage from him until fifty days or two months have passed.
Chapter Twelve.
On the setting of an arm fracture.
The arm is composed of two bones, known as the forearm bones. One is smaller and lies next to the thumb, and the other is larger and is placed below the smaller one. The larger forearm bone may fracture alone, or the smaller one may fracture alone, or both may fracture together.
When the upper smaller bone is fractured, setting it is easier and healing is faster. When the lower bone is fractured, the fracture is worse and healing is more difficult. The worst case is when both bones are fractured together. If the fractured bone is the upper smaller one.
The physician, when setting [the bone], should make his traction mild and gently until he aligns it. If the larger phalanx is fractured, he should make his traction stronger. If both phalanges are fractured, he should make the traction very strong indeed.
It is advisable that the shape of the hand be placed extended on a cushion when setting and traction are applied, with the thumb of the hand raised above all the fingers, and the little finger below the other fingers, and the patient sitting cross-legged.
And let the cushion be at his level in height so that the patient does not incur any difficulty.
Then, one servant stretches the arm from below, either with his hand or with a band, and another servant stretches from above in the same manner. Then, the physician aligns the bone until he restores it to the best possible form. If there are fragments in the broken bone, they should be removed.
Place each fragment in its position to the best of your ability. If a protruding fragment appears and it pierces the skin, and you have no hope of setting it, incise over it and extract it as described previously. If the fracture is accompanied by a wound, I have dedicated a separate section for it.
Seek the treatment for that from there. If a hot swelling appears at the beginning of setting, apply a cloth dipped in a mixture made with rose oil and white wax. It should be of moderate thickness between thick and thin, and bind the cloth gently until the swelling subsides.
Remove the poultice and apply a dressing prepared from mill powder mixed with egg white. Then, apply bandages, and let the bandage placed on the fracture itself be slightly wider and stronger. Know that the number of bandages for the arm is usually six.
The fracture was in one molar or in both molars together, then make your binding at the site of the fracture stronger and tighter, and every time you turn the binding upwards or downwards, make the binding a little looser as mentioned earlier at the beginning of the chapter.
Let the bandages that wrap around the fracture be soft and moist, not very hard. Let the thread used for binding be of special cotton, intermediate between thinness and thickness as described, and examine the limb and ligament after a few days.
If something requires repair, such as an itch that occurs in the limb, the limb should be washed with warm water until the itch subsides, and the limb should be left unbound for a night to rest, then binding is resumed.
If the binding has loosened or the bone has moved, correct all of that to the best of your ability. Also, if the nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb due to excessive tightness, you should loosen it slightly and leave it for a few days until the nourishment can reach it, then bind it again.
If nothing mentioned occurs to the patient, it should not be loosened until after twenty days or so. Then, suspend the patient's arm to his neck and let his arm be in a balanced position. He should avoid restless movements and sleep on his back.
Know that this fracture of the arm will heal in thirty days or thirty-two, and it may heal in twenty-eight days, all of which depends on the conditions of the humors and the strength.
Chapter Thirteen.
On the setting of fractures in the hand and fingers.
The palm's keratin and the fingertips rarely suffer fractures, but they often experience contusions. Whenever a fracture or contusion occurs in the palm.
It is advisable for the patient to sit cross-legged with a chair level in front of him.
Then he should place his hand on it, outstretched. The bone servant then stretches the broken bone, and the doctor aligns it until it is properly set. At that point, bandaging and pressure should be applied unless there is a hot swelling, then a cast should be placed over it according to the area.
And it has been wrapped in a soft cloth. If the fracture is toward the palm's underside, make a ball-like shape from the cloth and have the patient grasp it with their fractured hand, then secure it with a long strip of cloth.
Let the cast be made of leather with flexibility so that it conforms to the bending of the entire palm and is secured as necessary. If the fracture is on the outside, a cast should be made from above and another from below in the palm so that the hand remains open and upright.
Then secure the binding as the hand is rotated and interlace between the fingers with a bandage. If the fracture occurs in one of the fingertips, if it is the thumb, align it properly and then secure it with the palm. If you prefer, you may make a small upright cast to support the fracture.
And if it does not move, then if the fracture is for all the fingers such as the middle finger, index finger, little finger or ring finger, they should be aligned and bound to the adjacent healthy finger, or they are all bound in a straight position which is better, or a small splint is placed on them.
As we said about the thumb and examine during and after setting it, if there is any swelling or heat, treat it accordingly as has been described repeatedly.
Chapter Fourteen.
On setting the femur fracture.
The thigh bone often fractures and can be detected by sensation as it shifts forward and backward. Setting it involves placing a bandage above the fracture and another below it while the patient lies face down.
Then, each supporting bandage is stretched to its side evenly. This is if the fracture is in the middle of the bone. If it is close to the base of the thigh, it is advisable to use a soft bandage, either of wool or something similar.
At the base of the thigh toward the groin, the stretch should be upward and the other bandage below the fracture. Similarly, if the fracture is near the knee, the bandage should be near the knee so that the stretch is downward. Then, the doctor aligns the bone with both hands until it returns to its natural form.
The bone will heal well. At that point, the dressing and binding should be maintained if there is no hot swelling in the limb. If swelling does occur, leave it for days until the hot swelling subsides, then return to its treatment.
And as for binding it, you should fold a strong and wide bandage around the fracture two or three times and leave what remains, then bind the leg until the heel reaches the base of the shin, and insert a long thread between the thigh and the leg near the knee from below, and let the ends of the thread be above on both sides.
Then wrap what remains of the bandage around the leg and thigh, then place the splints on the thigh at the site of the fracture itself, and make one splint for the shin bone, then fill the gap between the thigh and the leg with soft cloths so that the binding is even.
Then begin with a strong bind from the middle at the site of the fracture, three or four turns, and the further the bandage is from the site of the fracture, the looser and gentler your binding should be.
Then take the ends of the thread that you inserted between the thigh and the leg, tie them to the splints above, then pass the ends of the thread down until they reach the heel, and also bind the other ends of the splints with them.
To ensure the binding does not shift from its place, then leave it bound as long as there is no sign of injury, swelling, or inflammation in the member. If any of these occur, immediately loosen it and correct whatever has happened as we have mentioned repeatedly.
If there is a splinter in the bone that protrudes, you should smooth it out if possible; otherwise, cut into it and remove it, and treat the wound as previously described until it heals. This fracture of the thigh may be bound without adding the leg to it with splints.
As we mentioned in the arm and forearm, except that setting it this way does not cause limping for the patient. However, if you set it alone without attaching the leg to it, the person will inevitably limp forever.
And know that the thigh strengthens in fifty days, or slightly more or less, all of this depending on the difference in temperaments and other conditions.
Chapter Fifteen.
On the fracture of the kneecap.
The kneecap rarely fractures but is often subject to contusions. If it does fracture, it would either be a split or a shattering of its parts, whether with an open wound or without.
All of this can be determined by touch, and setting it involves aligning the separated parts with your fingers until they come together and unify as much as possible with care, precision, and gentleness. Then apply a dressing, and if necessary, a circular splint over it.
Tighten above with the appropriate bandage for that, then attend to all the conditions we described in other fractures, such as hot swelling and the like, by addressing each symptom with what is suitable until it heals.
Chapter Sixteen.
On setting the fracture of the leg.
The leg has two bones, one thick called the tibia and the other thin called the fibula. Both are subject to various types of fractures similar to those of the arm bones. Therefore, its setting is like the setting of the arm, and the procedure is the same. If both bones are broken, the leg turns in all directions; if the thinner bone is broken, the leg turns forward; if the thicker bone is broken, and this happens below, then it is not hidden from you.
Use stretching and leveling, and bind the splints accordingly. However, if the break in the leg is severe with many shards, the stretching should be less and gentler, and you should be more careful in setting it.
And in the leg, there is an additional procedure compared to the arm. When you have leveled the splints and completed all your work, take two strips of fir wood which are used for leveling the gaps between the boards, or they can be made from palm leaves or similar materials.
Choose those that are slightly thick and not too thin, and let their length be the same as the leg from the knee down. Then wrap a cloth around each one twice along its length, placing one on the leg and the other on the opposite side.
And let it extend from the knee to the foot. Then bind the two strips at three points, the ends and the middle. With this restraint, the leg will not tilt to the right or left and will be set properly. Sometimes a wooden gutter of the length of the leg can also be used.
It is placed there to prevent movement, and it is most necessary to do this in the case of a fracture accompanied by a wound, especially. Then examine the leg every day and pay close attention to any swelling or inflammation or other such conditions. And when any of that occurs, counter it with what is appropriate until it heals, and the bone of the leg will heal in thirty days or so.
Chapter Seventeen.
On the fractures of the leg and fingers.
As for the heel, it is not subject to fracture at all. As for the bones of the leg, they may be subject to fracture, and fingers rarely suffer fractures; rather, they are more often subjected to contusions in most cases.
If the leg bones are fractured and you see that those bones are approaching each other, let the patient stand with his foot on the ground as if walking. Then you place your foot on the raised part of those bones and press them down to align them.
Until they return to their places, then apply the dressing and splint. Place a small board with two flat ends under the sole of the foot, then secure the foot tightly after wrapping it with bandages and anything else needed.
If three or four days have passed, loosen the binding. You will find the bones aligned whether they were fractured or dislocated. The procedure is as you see. As for if some of the fingers are broken, set and align them according to what has been described to you for setting the fingers of the hand.
Then make a splint for the broken finger along its length, but slightly wider than the finger. Then place under the foot the board I have described to you and secure it tightly. If more than one bone, two or three or more, has been fractured.
And make on each finger a splint of appropriate size wrapped in a soft cloth and bind the board at the bottom of the foot and let each end of the board protrude from the sole of the foot to hold it firmly in place.
You should not forget to attend to all that we have mentioned to you regarding the symptoms of fractures, and address each symptom as appropriate.
Chapter Eighteen.
On the fracture of the woman's pubis and the man's penis.
When the woman's vagina is fractured, seat her in a squatting position, then bend her slightly towards her back little by little. Let her hold on from behind. Then the midwife should stuff her vagina with cotton until it fills and becomes like a ball inside her vagina.
Then the woman should be shaken and her torso raised little by little. The cotton will come out until it becomes like a ball at the entrance of the vagina, and the bone fracture will return to its place. Then a pad should be placed on her back. Whenever she wishes to urinate, gently remove the cotton so that she may urinate.
Return it in the same manner as it was first inserted, then go back to her initial padding. Do this for seven days or so, and it will heal. If you wish, you can take a sheep's bladder, attach a reed tube to its opening, and insert the entire bladder into her vagina.
Then blow into the tube forcefully until the bladder inflates inside the vagina, and the fracture will return to its place. Then fill it with cotton and keep it in place as described until it heals. As for when the pubic bone of a man or woman is fractured, it should be treated similarly.
And its adjustment is as we described in the hip bone, and it will not be hidden from you the correctness in these rare fractures that seldom occur, especially for those who have some experience and understand this book of mine well, for the fracture itself guides you in most cases.
On the right way in setting and binding it, understand. As for when a man's thigh is fractured like a duck's throat, insert the penis into it, then place a bandage of cloth on it and bind it, leaving it for three days or so until it heals.
Chapter Nineteen.
On the setting of bone fractures when accompanied by a wound.
It is necessary for one who has sustained a fracture accompanied by a wound, especially if the bone is large such as the thigh or arm bone or the like, to promptly perform bloodletting at that time if the conditions for bloodletting assist you, as we have previously mentioned.
If the wound is bleeding, you should promptly cauterize it by applying powdered zinc if nothing else is available. Then proceed to set the fracture on that very day and do not delay it.
If a hot swelling does not occur, then set the fracture immediately. If a hot swelling does occur, leave setting the fracture until the ninth day until the hot swelling subsides. Do not touch it at all on the third and fourth days, for doing so would cause不良反应。请注意，我尽力提供准确的翻译，但涉及古文或专业术语时可能存在理解偏差。这里直接翻译可能会包含一些医学上不太准确的表达，"不良反应"在原文中的意思是如果在这个时间段处理伤口会导致不好的后果。
If the broken bone protrudes and is exposed on the skin, you should gently aim to reduce and align it with your hands using slight traction. If you cannot reduce and align it with your hands, use this tool, which is made of iron and is about seven or eight fingers in length. And expose it according to the size of the wound.
For this reason, the doctor should take three or four of them according to what is needed for treatment in each type of fracture. They should be rounded with a slight thickness so that they do not bend when pressed upon during use.
It should be sharp at the end, with a curve at its tip. The top should be thicker and from the middle down much thinner. This is its shape:.
It is called "peron" in Greek, meaning a small lever. The sharp and curved end should be placed on the protruding bone and pushed once until the bone returns and straightens somewhat, thus beginning to align the broken ends with each other.
If the broken end is thin and the instrument does not grasp it well, you should cut that end of the bone until the instrument can grip it. If you are unable to realign the bone as described, then cut it using a method similar to those we have mentioned.
Or saw it with one of the saws however you can, then remove any roughness and thin scales remaining on the bone. If after realigning the bone the patient experiences severe painful discomfort, know that the bone has not returned to its natural position.
If you are able to realign it to its natural position, do so, for you greatly benefit the patient. Once you have completed setting the bone, soak a cloth in a constricting black liquid, especially if it is summer, and do not apply any fat or ointment to the wound.
To prevent putrefaction and corruption from occurring, then use bandages during your time off from setting the bone and leave the wound exposed by cutting a hole with scissors in the bandage according to the size of the wound.
Beware exceedingly lest you bind the wound with the fracture, for ignorant physicians have often done this and caused either death or gangrene or pneumonia in their patients. Let your binding be soft and loose, contrary to the tightening of other fractures.
If the wound is poor or it is a large wound and you fear some of the不良症状我们描述过的，他在该部位感到困扰的疼痛，你不应该将夹板放在上面。用坚固的布料制成绷带替代夹板，并用其固定。
If it has been a day or two and you see that pus has begun to form in the wound, remove the cloth that was placed on it with the drink, then use bandages and ointments which are our custom to treat wounds with, such as the four-ingredient ointment and the like, and you should loosen the binding.
You should examine the wound every day, morning and evening, until it heals. You should position the limb in such a way that pus can easily drain downward. If days pass and the wound does not close and the pus does not cease, know that there are likely small bone splinters present.
You should probe the wound with a探针. If any of those splinters are loose, remove and extract them. For those that are not loose and cause pain by irritating the limb, cut and remove them in whatever way you can manage.
If the wound is exposed to cold, bites, or any other form of corruption and putrefaction, you should counter each condition with a corresponding treatment as previously described in its respective section.
Among the things you should pay attention to and keep in mind when a large bone, such as the thigh or the forearm, or other similar major limbs, is broken, do not attempt to pull it or extract it. Often, doing so can lead to death. Therefore, leave it until it putrefies; perhaps it will fall out on its own after twenty or thirty days.
Then you should treat the wound if you see an opportunity for treatment; otherwise, leave it alone.
Chapter Twenty.
On treating the swelling that occurs after some fractures.
This swelling often occurs after the fracture has healed, especially near the joints, which can deform the appearance of the limb and may prevent the limb from performing its natural functions.
If the swelling is soft, use medicines that constrict, such as frankincense, mastic, aloes, squill, and hellebore, or similar. Take some or all of these, and mix them with a constricting potion or with egg white or vinegar.
Apply it to the swelling and bind it tightly, leaving it bound for many days. Then remove the binding and repeat with another if necessary until the swelling goes away, God willing, or secure a sheet of lead over it tightly.
For lead has a property that can reduce any excess in the limbs. If the swelling has hardened and become severe, and necessity requires its removal, cut into it from above and remove the excess or pare it down with a sharp instrument until it is gone, then treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-One.
On treating fractures when they have healed and the limb remains weak, unlike its original nature.
If a bone fracture has healed and the limb remains weak afterward, this can be due to many reasons. One of them is either due to excessive loosening and tying of the bandages improperly, or due to overly tightening the bandages so that nourishment cannot reach the limb, or due to excessive and improper interference, or due to excessive movements at inappropriate times, or due to a lack of blood in the patient's body and its weakness.
The treatment for that is nourishing the patient and fattening his body until blood increases in it, using the bath, bringing joy and happiness to him, and so on. Then apply pitch to the limb so that the pitch attracts a lot of nourishment or continue to moisten it with warm water. Until the nourishment flows in it and returns to its natural form.
Chapter Twenty-Two.
On the treatment of fractured bones that have healed crookedly and prevented their proper function.
If a limb that has been fractured and healed exhibits deformity, protrusion of the broken bone, or complexity, causing the limb to appear ugly. Unless the limb is prevented from its natural function, it should not be accepted that one would claim to break the limb again. Many ignorant doctors and bone setters in our country have done this.
This action is highly condemnable and leads to great harm, the least of which is disability. However, if the deformity and complexity are pliable, it should be treated with water in which relaxing herbs have been boiled, such as the leaves and roots of the sycamore and marjoram, and the like.
And it is dressed with soft bandages like well-made diachylon, or the juice of the root of the colocynth is taken and mixed with chicken fat and ceratum, then used for dressing, or take the juicy figs and pound them with dove droppings and similar medications which are called dispersers of adhesions.
And the complexity is resolved by continuous gentle massage with the hands and moving the limb in all directions at all times. If the deformity has persisted, intensified, and become rigid, and it becomes necessary to treat it with iron.
It is necessary to incise above it, release the bone connection, and cut any remaining complexity or bone with delicate cuts, applying gentleness in this process with effort and care, then treat the wound as previously mentioned until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Three.
A dislocation is the displacement of a joint from its position, which hinders movement, uglifies the appearance of the limb, and causes severe pain to the patient. Whenever someone suffers from jaw dislocation, it should be promptly reduced at once.
It should not be delayed at all, for if it is delayed, the area will swell and make reducing the jaw difficult. Therefore, it should not be postponed, nor moved or stretched while swollen, as this often causes spasms and painful discomfort to the patient.
However, if this occurs, one should immediately begin treating the patient. Then, it is left until the swelling subsides slightly, after which the limb is treated with hot water and oil, then gently reduced. Each part is treated as described in its respective section.
And I have arranged the chapters on dislocation in accordance with what was previously mentioned regarding fractures, from the upper part of the body to the lower part.
Chapter Twenty-Four.
On the Treatment of the Lower Jaw Dislocation.
Dislocations of the jawbones rarely occur except in cases of trauma, and their dislocation can happen in two ways: either they are slightly displaced from their positions and become somewhat lax, or they are completely and entirely dislocated until they become lax. Until it approaches the chest, causing the saliva of the patient to flow and unable to hold it back, nor can they close their jaw, and their tongue stutters when speaking. If the dislocation is minor, it often returns on its own with minimal intervention.
And if the dislocation is complete, it should be corrected immediately without delay. This is done by having an attendant hold the patient's head while the doctor inserts the thumb of one hand at the base of the jaw inside the mouth if the dislocation is on one side.
Or if the dislocation is on both sides, he should insert both thumbs inside the mouth and use the rest of his fingers outside to align them. The doctor orders the patient to relax their jaw and let it go in any direction while the doctor realigns the jaw and pushes it back to its proper position.
If it is difficult to realign it, especially if both jawbones are dislocated, then use a compress with hot water and oil until they can be easily realigned. Do not delay their realignment as previously mentioned. Once they are returned to their proper position and the patient's mouth closes without laxity, then apply bandages reinforced with strips made from wax, oil, and roses.
Then it is tied gently with a loose bandage, and the patient should sleep on his back with his head elevated between two pillows so that he does not move to the right or left nor chew anything but rather make his food liquid and soft.
Until the pain disappears and the jaw heals, let him eat what he desires, but he should do so gently without forcing his mouth open while eating, drinking, or yawning until the jaw sets and heals.
If the jaws do not close properly at some point and do not return to their places, fever and persistent headache often occur, and the patient may suffer from diarrhea or vomit bile. If you see this, know that it is a sign of corruption.
And many die from this condition within ten days.
Chapter Twenty-Five.
On the Reduction of the Clavicle and Shoulder Joint.
As for the clavicle, it does not dislocate from the inner side due to its connection to the chest, but it may dislocate outward, which can be determined by touch. To reduce it, the patient should lie on his back and extend his arms.
Then press the area with your palm firmly, and it will return to place. Then apply a dressing and bandage it tightly. As for the end that connects to the shoulder, it rarely dislocates. If it does dislocate one day, it should be reduced and aligned as mentioned, and in any way that seems appropriate to you.
Then apply the dressing, bandages, and binding, and instruct the patient to remain rested and still until healed. With this exact treatment, you also realign a dislocated shoulder joint.
Chapter Twenty-Six.
On the realignment of the shoulder joint.
Know that the shoulder joint may dislocate in three ways: one is when it dislocates towards the armpit downwards, the second is when it dislocates towards the chest, and sometimes it dislocates upwards from the shoulder, which is rare.
It does not dislocate backwards due to the position of the shoulder, nor does it dislocate forwards due to the presence of the nerves. It most often dislocates and moves downwards towards the armpit, especially in those who have less flesh, as it quickly exits and enters in such individuals.
As for those who have a lot of flesh, it is the opposite; I mean, it exits and enters with difficulty. Sometimes some people may receive a blow or fall, causing the shoulder to swell and become warm, leading them to assume that it has dislocated. It should be examined to determine if this is true.
Then proceed with its treatment. The dislocation towards the armpit downwards is identified if you align the dislocated shoulder with the healthy one; you will find a noticeable difference between them, and you will feel that the head of the dislocated shoulder has sunk in, and beneath the armpit, upon touching, the head of the shoulder feels like an egg.
The patient cannot raise his hand to his ear or move it in all its usual motions. Similarly, if it dislocates towards the chest or upwards, you will clearly feel this upon touch, and it cannot be hidden.
And this jaw can be easily replaced if it is soft or the patient is a child. The replacement involves raising the servant's hand up, then placing your thumbs under his armpit and lifting the joint forcefully upwards to its place while the servant raises his hand and stretches it upwards.
Then, it is placed downwards as it will return quickly. If it does not return as mentioned and the jaw has been like this for many days, the patient should bathe in hot water and use laxatives that relax and soften, such as cooking the root of the carrot and fenugreek and marigold in water and using it.
Then, the patient lies on his back and a ball of wool, which is moderate between softness and firmness, is placed under his armpit. Then the doctor places his knee on the ball and holds the patient's hand with his hand and stretches it downwards.
And he pushes the ball with his foot, then it returns to its place. If you wish, you can replace it this way: have a taller person present, position them on the side of the ribs, and have their shoulder enter under the patient's armpit, lifting it upwards until the patient is suspended in the air. Another servant pulls the patient's hand downwards toward his abdomen. If the patient is light, it is advisable to hang something else from him to weigh him down, for then the jaw will return immediately. It can also be replaced in another way.
It involves fixing a long stick in the ground, with its head being round like the pestle of a mortar, neither too thick nor too thin. Then it is placed under the patient's armpit after placing a soft cloth on top of the stick, and the patient stands along the length of the stick.
Then he extends his hand below from the other side and also extends his body from the other side with force, then the joint returns to its place quickly. If it is difficult to return it by all that we mentioned, use this treatment: take a stick about two cubits long. And its width is about four fingers and its thickness is about two fingers, it should have a rounded head to facilitate its entry into the depth of the armpit in this manner:.
Then tie a soft cloth around the rounded head to prevent the stick from harming the patient, then place the stick under the armpit and extend the entire hand and arm down on the stick, and secure the stick to the upper arm, forearm, and end of the hand.
Then the arm is placed on a bar. Grip the width and extend the hand downward, leaving the rest of the body hanging from the other side, then the joint will enter immediately. Once it enters in any possible way, it should be placed under the armpit a moderately sized ball of wool.
Then apply the prepared dressing of grindstone dust mixed with gum and egg white all over the shoulder, circling from above, then tightly secure the ball under the armpit and wrap it firmly with a bandage over the dressing, and suspend his hand to his neck.
It should be left unmoved for seven days, and the patient's diet should be light to strengthen the limb, which will speed up its healing. After seven or five days, it is released and trained through movement; if it remains stable and does not weaken, then it has healed.
If the joint dislocates frequently due to moisture exposure or another ailment, it is appropriate to use cauterization with three white-hot cauteries as previously described in the chapter on cauterization. If you do all of this and loosen the ligament after seven days and the joint still does not stabilize.
And if you repeatedly applied the bandage and tightened it, but it did not stabilize and fell loose, and you were unable to raise it upwards, know that the nerve at the top of the shoulder has been severed or stretched or relaxed. Know then that the joint will never be stable in its place.
As for the jaw that is displaced towards the chest and breast and behind, its reduction is done by pushing and pulling with the hands until it returns to place. All binding and treatment should be used until it heals. If swelling occurs in the area and movement is delayed after healing.
Let the patient use the bath frequently until that swelling softens and returns to its original state.
Chapter Twenty-Seven.
On the treatment of the elbow joint.
The elbow joint dislocates with difficulty and likewise returns with difficulty. It can dislocate in all directions, especially forwards or backwards. Its dislocation is not hidden from you because it is evident both to sight and touch, regardless of the form of the dislocation.
When you compare the dislocated elbow to the healthy one, it will be clearly apparent due to the deformity of the joint. The arm cannot be bent, nor can it touch the shoulder. You should promptly reduce the dislocation immediately before swelling occurs.
For if a hot swelling occurs, it is difficult to reduce and sometimes it does not heal at all, especially if the jaw is set back, for this is the worst kind of all types of jaws and the most painful, and death often comes with it.
If it can be reduced, then a servant should extend his arm with both hands and stretch out his arm, while the doctor places his hands above and below the elbow, pushing the joint back into place with the thumbs of both hands or the base of his palm until it returns to its position.
And if the jaw is forward, it can be reduced by bending the arm until the base of the palm strikes the corresponding elbow. If the jaw does not respond to being brought back, then use very strong extension, which involves two servants extending the arm.
Two servants also hold the patient to prevent any movement during the extension. Then, rotate the arm in all directions after wrapping a folded cloth or a wide bandage around his hand. When the doctor handles the joint with both hands, he should smear it with oil so that the joint can slide easily.
Then, push the joint forcefully until it returns. After it is returned, it should be bandaged with something that constricts and dries, including egg white, and tightly secured. The arm should be suspended from the patient's neck for several days.
Then, if the joint remains in place, remove the binding. If you see that the joint has not become firm enough, reapply the bandage and binding for several days until it becomes firm, then remove it. If swelling occurs after the joint is returned to its place and the bindings are removed.
Difficulty in movement, then use moistening in the bath and gentle massage and squeezing until it becomes soft or place on the joint a thick sheepskin pad then bind it and leave it for a day and night, then remove it and enter him into the bath. If he sweats, then rub the joint moderately.
Then apply the pad again, a second and third time, with entering the bath until it becomes soft. If you want to put moistened, light ox bile with fat on it and bind it tightly, do this several times, for it will become soft and return to its original state.
Chapter Twenty-Eight.
On the Treatment of Wrist Dislocation.
The wrist of the hand often dislocates and reducing its dislocation is easier compared to other joints. However, it is necessary to quickly reduce its dislocation at the moment it occurs before the area swells or a hot swelling develops.
Reducing the dislocation involves placing the patient's wrist on a board, having an assistant stretch the hand, and the doctor placing his palm on the protruding joint and pushing it until it returns. However, it is necessary to check if the dislocation has moved to the inside of the hand.
Let the patient place the palm of his hand on the board during extension and flexion. If the dislocation is protruding to the outer side of the hand, then let the inner part of his hand be placed on the board so that the doctor's hand falls on the same joint protrusion. If it returns immediately, otherwise bind it with a bandage to reduce swelling.
Leave it alone and do not repeat it, for it cannot withstand repetition, and you will not be able to reset it after a few days have passed, except that the joint remains out of place, and it does not harm the patient anything except if the hand becomes weak and unable to grasp anything.
Then you will know that the nerve has been cut or damaged, and there is no remedy for it except to sew it up, which may be helpful or not. Once the wrist is reset, apply the dressing we described, then bind it and leave it for five days.
Then it is loosened and the hand is exercised. If moving it is difficult and some hardness appears, soften it with warm water and rubbing repeatedly until it becomes flexible.
Chapter Twenty-Nine.
On the Treatment of Separating the Fingers.
Fingers may separate in any direction. When a finger separates to the outer or inner side of the palm, extend the finger and push the dislocation with your thumb until it returns. Then bandage the tip of the finger and suspend it toward the direction it separated from.
Leave it for two days, then release it and extend it until it stands straight on that day. If it is at night, bind it as described. Continue to release it during the day and exercise it by movement, and bind it at night. Do this for several days until it strengthens.
Do the same if it separates to the inner side of the hand, binding it toward the same direction and proceeding as you did initially until it heals. Do this similarly whenever it separates in any other directions.
Chapter Thirty.
On the treatment of spinal tuberculosis.
When one of the vertebrae of the spine or neck has completely dislocated or many have moved from their places, there is no treatment for it because death quickly comes to the patient.
The sign of this is that the patient's excrement comes out without will, unable to hold it back, and often some of his limbs weaken, either his legs or his arms or one of them. As for if a single vertebra moves from its place, it often returns to its position.
Its displacement can occur in four directions. That which moves backward is called a hump. As for its treatment, you should assess; if the hump has occurred since childhood, there is no treatment for it and it will never heal. As for those that have occurred due to a fall or blow or the like.
The earlier scholars have mentioned it with various treatments in lengthy discourse, most of which does not prove beneficial. I have condensed that to what suffices, so that a little of this may replace much of what they provided, by my approximation of the meaning and explanation thereof. I have also illustrated the apparatus differently from how they depicted and explained it.
I say that the hump which occurs in front on the chest cannot be treated and will not heal, and likewise those on the sides. Only the one that occurs specifically on the back is treated, as I am about to describe, which is to lay the patient face down.
On a flat bench near a wall, place a moist cloth under him to prevent his chest from being harmed. Then place a vertical wooden board planted in a hole in the ground at one end of the bench toward his head, and another wooden board toward his feet at the other end of the bench.
A servant holds the board, and let it not be fixed in the hole, and another servant holds the other [board] in that manner. Then wrap around the patient's chest and under his armpits with a soft, tight bandage, and extend the end of the bandage to the board at his head and tie it there.
Then bind with another bandage over his hips, above his knees, and at his ankles. Then gather all the ties and secure them to the other board at his feet. Then each servant pulls the board in his direction with the tie, and the two boards do not move from their fixed positions.
Except that they are not fixed as we said, and the doctor places his hands on the abscess with force until it bursts, or he puts a board on it then leans on the board with his feet until it bursts. If it does not burst with this treatment, take a board that is about three arms' length in length.
And dig in the wall which we said should be near the patient a place where one end of the board can fit, then place the center of the board on the swelling and have the doctor put his feet on the other end and pull tightly until it presses on the abscess.
And it returns to its place. If you wish to make it with a hand-turned screw, then drive into the ground near the patient's head at the end of the bench two boards that are an arm's length long, and similarly at his feet at the other end of the bench two boards.
And let there be a span between each board, and make a hole in each board through which the screw can pass. Secure all the boards firmly to the ground so that they do not move at all, and insert a rounded rod, which is the screw where the rope is twisted, into the holes of the two boards.
And at its end, there is a hole in which a stick of one span length is firmly tied with what is twisted, and the same for the other two boards. Then the rope that was tightened on the patient's chest is attached to the spool at his head, and the ropes that were tightened on his legs are attached to the spool at his feet.
Then a servant stands at each spool, twisting his hand with the twister that twists the spool, and the doctor adjusts the hump as previously described. This is an illustration of the spool, the bench, and the patient.
Then after the vertebra returns and the area is even, it is appropriate to carry the dried dressing with egg white, then apply pressure. Then place a splint of a board on top of the dressing that is three fingers wide or so, and its length should be enough to cover the area of the hump.
And on some of the correct beads, then it should be tied with an appropriate bandage. The patient should consume a mild diet until healed. If there remains some protrusion in the area at the end of healing, it is appropriate to use medications that relax and soften, along with using the board we described for a long time.
A sheet of lead may be used for that. Sometimes a protrusion appears at the end of the spinal beads, which might be mistaken for dislocation; it could be an extra bone that has protruded. Do not treat this condition with such therapy, as death might occur.
The Thirty-First Chapter.
On the Treatment of a Dislocated Hip.
Know that the hip joint and the shoulder joint are only subject to dislocation and do not suffer from the slight displacement and凹陷 that other joints do, and the hip joint can be dislocated in four ways.
This is because it can dislocate inward, outward, forward, and backward. It most often dislocates inward and rarely dislocates forward or backward. The sign of its dislocation inward is that if you align the healthy leg with the affected one, the healthy leg will appear longer.
The knee will protrude more than normal, and the affected individual will not be able to bend their leg at the joint. The area adjacent to the joint will show明显的肿胀，因为股骨的头部已经移位到那里了。
The signs of outward dislocation are the opposite of these symptoms. For forward dislocation, he will fully extend his leg but will not be able to bend it without knee pain. If he attempts to walk, he will not be able to move forward.
He will retain urine, his ankle will droop, and when walking, he will step on his heel. For backward dislocation, he will not be able to fully extend the knee or bend it before bending the ankle, and his leg will also be shorter than the other.
The ankle will be relaxed, and the head of the femur will be明显在腰部位置。至于这种脱位的复位，如果你发现脱位已久，已经与患者同在，且未尝试复位并保持原状，则完全无法治疗。
You should not expose it, and as for the one who had his jaw dislocated recently, whether it is any of the four types of jaw dislocation, you should immediately twist the joint and extend it inward and outward and move it right and left, perhaps.
If it returns without needing further treatment, then if it does not return this way, you should prepare a servant as an aid who is strong to extend his leg from below, either with his hands or with a bandage tied above the knee on his leg, and another servant to pull him from above.
He should insert his hands under his armpits, then tighten a soft bandage at the root of the thigh, and another servant should hold the end of the bandage, extending either from the front, from the side of the ribs to the side of the clavicle, or from behind towards the back.
Their extension should all be done at once until the patient is lifted off the ground and remains suspended. This type of extension is common to the four types. If the jaw returns as we said, otherwise each type requires the specific treatment I will mention.
As for its specific reduction if the jaw is displaced inward, the patient should lie on his healthy side, then a bandage should be placed at the root of the thigh between the hip joint and the area below the ribs.
Then extend the bandage upward from the side of the ribs to the upper body towards the clavicle. Then another strong servant should take hold with his arms and embrace the thick part of the patient's thigh and pull outward with a strong pull, for it will return to its place.
This type is easier than other types of treatment used to replace this organ. If it becomes difficult for you and does not respond at all to this type of treatment, you should bind both legs of the patient with a strong flexible bandage around the ankles and knees.
There should be the width of four fingers between each one and its neighbor, and the affected leg should be extended more than the other by the width of two fingers. Then, suspend the patient from a beam in the house with his head up, and there should be an arm's length between him and the ground.
Then, you order a strong boy to hold the thigh and another boy to grasp the patient. The other boy holding the thigh should push with force, for the joint will return to its place quickly. As for when it is dislocated outward, its reduction is similar.
The patient should lie on the table as we described for the hunchback case, and the bandage should be tied specifically to his affected leg and chest. Then, place two beams, one at his feet and the other at his head. Place an additional beam in the middle of the table, secured very tightly.
It should be wrapped with wet cloths to prevent injury to the patient, so that the beam is between his thighs to prevent it from being pulled down during extension. Then, each servant pulls in his direction and the doctor aligns the hip with his hands, if it responds to being returned.
Otherwise, place the board on him and press it as we described for the hunchback case, except that the patient should lie on his healthy side. If the dislocation is forward, you should extend the patient's leg once while he is lying in this manner on the table.
The physician places the palm of his right hand on the diseased hip, then presses it with the other hand; and in this way he extends the pressure downward toward the knee. And if the dislocation is backward, it is not appropriate to extend the patient downward.
It should be raised from the ground; it is preferable that it be placed on something solid. It should also be, if his hip has dislocated outward, as we mentioned, lying on a bench on his stomach with the bandages tightly secured.
As we said before, pressure should also be applied with a board to the place where the joint has dislocated. Once the hip joint is properly returned, its return will not be hidden from you, and you will be able to extend the patient's legs.
If you see them level and the patient can bend and extend the leg without difficulty, then know that the part has returned as it should. At this point, join the thighs, apply the dressing, and bind with a turban tightly so that the hip does not move in any direction.
The patient must remain still for three or four days, then untie the bandages and remove the dressing. Compare the leg to the other one; if you see them equal in length, know that the joint has healed, and allow the patient to walk. If you notice any laxity, however, further treatment is needed.
Return, dress it, and bind it as you did initially. Leave it for another three days, then untie it. Allow him to walk slowly on it for several days until it strengthens well, if God wills.
Chapter Thirty-Two.
On the treatment of dislocated knees.
The knee dislocates in three directions: inward, outward, and downward, which means backward. It never dislocates forward at all. The sign of its dislocation is when you ask the patient to draw his leg close to his thigh.
If it does not attach to the thigh, know that the knee is dislocated. The treatment for all forms of its dislocation is to have the patient sit with his legs stretched out if he can do so. Have a servant sit behind him to hold his waist and bend it slightly backward, then you sit on his thighs.
Lean your back against his front, place his leg between yours, then hold his knee with both of your palms and clasp them together with your fingers around his knee. Then, grip the sides of his knee firmly with both hands, and have another servant stretch his leg until the knee returns to its proper place.
The sign that it has returned is when the leg attaches to the thigh smoothly and without resistance. Then, dress the area and keep the leg attached to the thigh, then bandage them together for three or four days, after which you release them. Only light walking should be done for a few days until it strengthens.
If it is difficult for you to return it as described, then use strong stretching with the bandages that I have previously described in the treatment of the hip until it returns.
Chapter Thirty-Three.
On the treatment of dislocated ankle.
The ankle may be slightly dislocated or completely dislocated, and its dislocation can either be inward or outward. The sign of its dislocation is that you see the ankle swollen and protruding towards the side to which it has dislocated.
As for the treatment of slight dislocation, it is easy to reduce it by gently stretching with both hands and aligning until it returns. As for the treatment if it is completely dislocated, the patient should sit down and a strong servant should hold him from behind in the middle of his back.
Then, hold his foot with your right hand from the top and with your left hand below the foot at the ankle. Then, pull the foot towards you with your right hand, then with your left hand twice, then stretch it with your left hand and push the front of the foot with your right hand towards the leg without force.
Do this twice as described, then on the third time, push the front of the foot towards the leg while pulling at the ankle. If it returns in one or two attempts and you see the foot is aligned, otherwise repeat the procedure as it will return to place.
If it does not return as described, then lay the patient on their back on the ground and drive a peg into the ground very securely between his thighs, wrapped in cloth so as not to harm the patient. Then have an assistant hold his thigh firmly.
Then, another servant stretches the leg either with his hands or by a strap tied around the ankle. Each servant then pulls in opposition to the other, while the peg remains between the patient's thighs to prevent the body from being pulled downward during stretching. The doctor then aligns the dislocation with his hands.
Another servant holds the healthy leg downwards, then the dislocation returns quickly. When the dislocation has returned and you are sure of its correct return, take the dressing and bandage it tightly with strong bindings and splint the foot downward. You should be careful of the nerve which is above the heel from behind.
So that the binding is not too tight and does not harm him, then leave it for two or three days. If the binding becomes loose, tighten it, then release it on the third or fourth day. The patient should avoid walking for forty days.
If he attempts to walk before this period, you cannot be assured that the joint will not dislocate again and become irreparable, making treatment ineffective afterward. If a hot swelling appears, you should use what we have previously described in another section of the treatment and continue until it subsides.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
On the treatment of dislocation of the toes.
It should be aligned gently without force where it has become dislocated, which is not difficult but easy. If the dislocation is in some of the toes on the top of the foot, the patient should place his foot on a level surface of the ground.
or on a board while standing as if walking. Then you place your foot on top of the dislocated joint and press it firmly with your foot until it returns to its proper position and you see that it is aligned without any protrusion in the area.
Then place a board under the sole of his foot that covers the entire foot, which has two ends, and bind it tightly for three days. Then untie it and keep him from walking for many days until it becomes strong and you are assured it will not recur, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-Five.
On the types of jaw that may occur with a wound or with a fracture or both together.
When any of this occurs and you treat it and set it, it is often followed by death.
Therefore, one should not undertake the treatment of such conditions unless they are skilled in the craft, experienced, gentle, compassionate, patient, not reckless, and not overly bold. Initially, they should use medicines that alleviate hot swellings only and leave the patient untouched otherwise.
Except, O Lord, for what I hope will be safe from damage with a mild illness and where some hope is apparent to you, then do not delay treating it at the very beginning before a hot swelling occurs.
If the limb returns as desired, then use treatments that alleviate hot swellings and treat the wound with appropriate drying ointments. If the jaw is fractured and there are detached bone splinters, do not delay in extracting them. Follow in this what we have mentioned regarding simple diseases as presented earlier in their respective sections.
Exert your utmost effort and abstain from taking risky paths as my previous advice to you has indicated. That will preserve your reputation and safeguard your honor, if God wills.
