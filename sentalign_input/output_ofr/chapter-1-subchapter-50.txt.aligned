The treatment of chancre by cautery	On cauterization for cancer.	0.42821804
When a chancre appears at the beginning, and you want to stop it, cauterize it with a cautery that resembles a circle, all around the chancre.	When the cancer is in its initial stage and you wish to arrest it, burn all round the circumference of the cancer with the circular cautery.	0.7352177
and yet, this does not seem good to me, for I fear that it will be ulcerated and corrupted, and I have seen it happen sometimes;	This hardly seems right to me, for I should expect it to ulcerate out; which I have several times seen.	0.6231856
and it is more appropriate that it be cauterized around, with the cautery which is called "circular," as we have said about cauteries.	So it is correct to burn around the circumference with a circular cautery as we have said, or with multiple cauterizations.	0.61612475
