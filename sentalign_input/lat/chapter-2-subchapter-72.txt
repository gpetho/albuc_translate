On the treatment of Alratica, the condition of an imperforate vulva in women.
Chapter 72.
Alratica is a condition where a woman’s vulva is either imperforate or has a very small opening.
It is either congenital or acquired.
The acquired form results from a previous ailment and may occur due to excess flesh growth or a membrane that is thin or thick; it may occur deep within the womb, on its sides, at its upper part, or lower part, and it obstructs intercourse, impregnation, and childbirth, and sometimes even menstruation.
Diagnosis is made by a midwife’s examination if the obstruction is visible and close.
If it is not visible, then seek it out with your fingers or with a probe.
If the obstruction is due to a thin membrane and is close to the labia, then proceed quickly and rupture it.
This is done by placing small cushions on both labia.
Then place the index fingers of both hands together, while the woman lies on her back with her legs spread.
Then extend the two labia firmly until the thin membrane is ruptured and the obstruction is opened.
Next, take some wool, soak it in oil, and place it on the area; let the woman have intercourse daily to prevent the site from sealing again.
If the membrane is thick and dense, then you must cut it with a broad spatula shaped like a myrtle leaf.
If the obstruction is due to excess flesh growth, suspend it with hooks and cut it away, and have on hand medicines that stop bleeding without causing irritation, such as acacia, dragon’s blood, and frankincense mixed with egg white.
Then insert a broad lead tube to prevent the wound from closing too quickly, leaving it in place for a few days; apply a wick made from dry linen, then proceed with usual wound care until it heals.
Sometimes, new flesh growths arise in the womb. These must be excised as described here, provided there is no cancerous abscess; for a cancerous abscess in the womb, surgery with iron should not be performed at all.
