On the suturing of the nose, lip, and ear.
Chapter 26.
Be aware that when a separation occurs in the continuity of one of these cartilages, treatment is only sometimes effective, depending on the person.
Therefore, when an injury like this occurs, assess whether it is a fresh wound with blood present. If so, bring the two edges of the wound together with a suture, and then treat it until it heals.
If the edges of the wound have already separated and each part has healed, you must abrade each side until it bleeds.
Then bring the two edges together with a suture, tighten them, and sprinkle ground dragonâ€™s blood and frankincense onto the wound. Apply a piece of diafinicon plaster or another healing plaster over the powders, and leave it bound for two or three days.
Then unbind it and change the medicine; leave it until the stitches fall out on their own.
Finally, treat it with ointment until it heals.
The method of suturing is to bring the parts together either with needles, as we described in suturing the abdomen, or with thread, as I have taught you.
