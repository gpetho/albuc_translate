When, due to melancholy, the superfluities or humors are corrupted and the phlegm is thick, then cauterize them with such cauteries as we have described for one who has paralysis.
And if, due to melancholy, the superfluity is tending towards melancholy, and the patient's body is moist, then give him to drink something by which the brain may be cleansed, according to what is stated before in the division.
Afterward, shave the patient's head;
then make a compress of well-made linen, like a circle, and place it in the middle of the head;
and let the patient sit cross-legged and be well supported on all sides;
then present the ointment, and aged sheep butter is good;
and warm it moderately over a fire, so that the finger can tolerate it if placed within;
then empty the circle in the middle of the head, and let it cool;
and do this to the patient once a week with other good management, until he is healed.
Or if you want to cauterize it by making multiple points with the cautery.
This method of cautery softens the brain evenly;
and then apply cotton soaked in butter and chicken fat.
