Chapter Forty-Nine.
On Cauterizing Vitiligo.
If vitiligo becomes chronic and no medical remedy is effective against it, cauterize it with a slight depth, according to the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness disappears and its color changes.
Then treat it with lentil flour, rose oil, plantain leaves, and pigeon blood or swallow blood, one part of each, mixed together and spread on a cloth, and applied to the area until it heals.
