of migraine
When a chronic migraine occurs, and acute catarrh, due to the moisture of tears and heat in the temples and chronic raging dizziness and similar things, and it is treated by various medical treatments and all this is of no benefit, we should then open the arteries of the temples and cauterize them, as we have described. 
And the method of their extraction is that the patient should shave back the hair from his temples, and locate the artery that is visible in the temple, for it is easily visible by its pulsation, and is rarely hidden except in some people who are excessively cold; and if it is hidden, the patient should tighten his neck with some cloth, then rub the area with some rough cloth, and sprinkle the area with hot water until the artery appears clearly; then take the scalpel which has this shape:
then lightly score the skin until you reach the artery, then pull it up with forceps, and separate it well from the tissues that are underneath it on each side; and if the artery is thin, turn it with the point of a hook, then cut it from that side to the length of two grains of wheat.
For if it is not cut, the blood will not completely flow out.
And draw from six hundred to three hundred drops of blood; and if the artery is large, you must tie it in two places with a strong double silk thread, so that putrefaction does not occur before the wound heals, and bleeding occurs; then cut the excess between the two ties at that very moment, and then, if you wish, cauterize it with a bladed cautery down to the bone until the ends are cauterized; and this is the better practice, if the patient does not have a fever and he has a warm complexion.
For cautery helps to dry out moisture: therefore it is of greater use for moistures.
Or, for the extraction of arteries, it is necessary to fill the place with old cotton and put well-made tents on it; and when they are removed, it should be treated with dry medicines that promote flesh growth, and with tents, until it is healed; and if blood flows from the artery while you are working on it, hasten to cauterize it, or fill the place with vitriol and press it with your hand so that the blood is stanched; and if you do not have that available, put your finger on the place until the blood clots, and sprinkle the area with cold water until the bleeding stops, and compress it as needed; and what is better and easier in the extraction of the artery is that you cauterize the vessel with this cutting cautery on both sides, but the blades should be quite thick to retain their heat longer.
For when the instrument is too thin, it holds its heat less well.
And there should be a finger's width of space between the two blades, and then when you have marked the two places with ink, you put the burning iron on it until it reaches the bone, and cut the vessel in two places; and let there be space between the two ends for it is not completely sealed with this cautery; and this is the form of the cautery:
