On the Method of Cauterizing for Sciatica
Chapter 43
When pain occurs in the hip joint due to cold and moisture, and the patient has been treated with the methods described earlier, but no cure is achieved, and the pain becomes chronic, it is necessary to purge the patient of thick humors using fetid pills, artificial pills, or similar remedies.
Then proceed to cauterize the patient.
There are two methods for cauterization in this case: cauterization with caustic medicines or cauterization with fire.
Cauterization with fire can be done in several ways.
One method is to apply three triangular cauterizations over the hip joint, arranged in this form.
Make the cauterizations either deep or shallow, as necessary.
Allow a finger’s width of space between each cauterization, and use an olive-shaped cautery.
Sometimes, a single cauterization is also applied in the center over the head of the hip joint.
Thus, there will be four cauterizations in total.
If you prefer, you may use a circular cautery as described in the treatment for hip dislocation, forming a circle around the entire hip joint.
Burn through the entire thickness of the skin.
This is the method for cauterizing sciatica when the pain is localized in the hip and does not extend to the thigh or leg.
If the pain extends to the thigh and leg, apply two cauterizations on the thigh at the point indicated by the patient where the pain is located, and place another cautery on the ankle, about four fingers’ width toward the outside. Use a knife-shaped cautery.
Ensure the cautery penetrates to the full thickness of the skin.
If the patient indicates that the pain extends to the toes, apply three, four, or more point cauterizations at the points indicated by the patient, if necessary.
If the patient points to pain below the knee toward the leg, apply a single knife-shaped cautery there.
In all cauterizations, be cautious not to apply the cautery too deeply to avoid burning any nerve or major artery, which could cause severe harm or lead to contraction in the patient.
I have witnessed cases where practitioners cauterized above the ankle and applied the cautery too deeply, causing the leg to swell until the swelling reached the foot, leading to the entire foot becoming perforated and necrotic; following this, the patient experienced abdominal distress and ultimately died.
If the pain is present on both sides simultaneously, cauterize each side in this manner.
Certain learned practitioners have suggested the following method for hip cauterization.
Create a cautery tool from iron resembling a double samium. Its diameter should be half a palm's width, with an opening about the width of a date stone, or slightly less. Within it, place a third samium.
Ensure there is a space between each samium about the size of a thumb joint. These sami should be open on both ends, with a height of about one or two thumb joints. Attach an iron handle suitably fitted to the sami.
This is the design of the cautery tool.
Then, heat it in the fire until it becomes red-hot and emits sparks. Place it on the hip joint of the patient while they lie on their healthy side.
Thus, cauterize with three round cauterizations in a single session.
Afterward, leave the wound undisturbed for three days.
Then apply a butter-based plaster and leave the wound open for several days.
Finally, treat the wound with ointment until it heals completely.
Albucasis says, "My son, we have rarely used this type of cautery because of the intimidating appearance and the lack of patients willing to undergo it."
Nevertheless, it is one of the most effective cauteries for those who can endure it and whose condition warrants its application.
For cauterization with caustic medicines, make two small devices with a perforated ring through which a pivot made of brass or iron passes, the length of which is about two thumb joints.
There should be a space between the devices approximately the width of a finger, and they should be open at the top and bottom, aligning in this arrangement.
Place this over the hip joint of the patient as they lie on the healthy side.
Press firmly over the hip joint with your hand.
Then, pour warm water heated over a flame between the two rings, maintaining the heat for about an hour. The patient will feel a biting pain like fire, which they must endure until it subsides.
Afterward, remove your hand and the device, wipe away the hot water with fresh water, and leave the area undisturbed for three days.
Apply butter to the area until the burned skin turns black, and allow it to rest for several days, during which pus will begin to flow.
This process provides the most lasting relief.
Then, treat it with ointments until it fully heals.
If the pain extends to the thigh or leg, perform the same procedure with the water application on that area as you did on the hip.
This is the method of using hot water, as I have detailed in my treatise on refining medical treatments.
Take equal parts of alkali and quicklime, grind them thoroughly, and place them in a new pot with a small hole at the bottom, just large enough for a rod to pass through. Place a glass vessel underneath, then pour fresh water over the alkali and lime to cover them by about a finger's width. Press down firmly with your hand and allow the liquid to drain into the glass vessel below.
Collect all this liquid, pour it over a new portion of lime, and filter it to renew its potency.
This solution will be highly caustic and suitable for many medical applications, including cauterizing other parts of the body.
It effectively replicates the action of fire.
Other medicinal substances used for cauterizing the hip include tesesi, cashew honey, and lime mixed with soap, all combined for maximum efficacy.
Galen, recounting the treatment of an ancient man cured of hip pain and sciatica, highly praised this method.
He said that the man needed no further treatment and was cured after a single session, even claiming that the patient entered the bath in pain and emerged fully healed.
The treatment involves using fresh seitaragi (a specific medicinal plant), or, if unavailable, a dried, recent sample. Grind it thoroughly with some fat, apply it to the hip, leg, or thigh where the pain is located, then bind and leave it in place for about three hours or until the patient feels relief from the burning.
Then, have the patient enter a bath.
Once their body is perspiring, immerse them in a basin.
The pain will subside, and healing will occur.
Be aware that cauterization should not be combined with these treatments until the body has been purged.
Dioscorides stated that goat dung, when used to cauterize the sciatic vein, provides relief. The cautery is applied as follows:
Take some wool, soak it in old oil, and place it over the depression between the big toe and the arch, near the ankle.
Then take dried goat dung, ignite it in fire until it turns to charcoal.
Place this charcoal on the wool and let it burn out.
Repeat this process.
Continue this until the sensation extends along the pathway to the hip and the pain subsides.
This method is known as the "Cow Cautery."
