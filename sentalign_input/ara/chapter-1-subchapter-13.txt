Chapter Thirteen.
On Cauterizing Chronic Tears.
If the tears of the eye are chronic and continuous, and are from the veins and arteries that are on the surface of the head, outside the skull, and you are certain that it is from an excess of cold, thick, phlegmatic humors, then cauterize it with the same cautery that I described at the beginning of the falling water section.
One cauterization in the middle of the head, two cauterizations on the temples, and two cauterizations on the nape of the neck under the two bones. And if you need to increase it, cauterize one on each side of the corner of the eye at the edge of the eyebrow with a small cautery iron.
