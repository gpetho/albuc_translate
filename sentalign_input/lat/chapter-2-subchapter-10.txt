Â¶ On the Treatment of Axirnath of the Eyelids.
Chapter X.
"Axirnath" is a type of fat that develops in the membranes of the upper eyelid. It often occurs in children, weighing on their eyes, causing morning discharge, making them unable to look at sunlight, and inducing tears to flow, due to which they frequently lie on their faces and sleep on them. Their eyelids are moist under their eyebrows, covered by swelling, and the swelling of the Axirnath is visible, and when you press on the area with your fingers, you can feel the Axirnath between them.
The procedure is for the patient to place their head in your lap.
Then take a linen cloth, prepare a small bandage in it, and make a ring from this bandage according to the size that covers the Axirnath on all sides.
Place it over the area, and press with your fingers from all sides so that the Axirnath is gathered in the middle of the ring.
Then make a shallow cut across the middle of that moist area with a spatula, creating small incisions horizontally, no deeper than a vein incision.
Or you may need to cut through the entire skin until you reach the Axirnath, as in many cases, the Axirnath will come out from the incision in the form of a piece of white fat.
Then extract it with a cloth, which you hold between your fingers toward the outside; turn your hand to the right and left until it comes loose; and be careful not to deepen the incision, so that you do not reach the eye with the spatula and injure it.
If the Axirnath does not appear at the start of the incision, slightly deepen the incision gently until the Axirnath emerges.
Then extract it as we have described.
Then soak cloths in vinegar and water, place them over the area, and bind it with compresses.
Some people grind salt and place it in the hollow of the incision, so that any remaining moisture is dissolved.
Then treat it until it heals.
If a warm abscess forms in the area, then treat it with soothing plasters until it heals.
