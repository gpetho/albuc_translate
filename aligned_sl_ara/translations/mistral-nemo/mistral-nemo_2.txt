I composed this book for you, my sons, after completing it for you as a portion of the science of medicine in its entirety and perfection. Having reached the goal of clarity and explanation therein, I deemed it fitting to complete it for you with this section on manual work.
Indeed, the practice of manual work is esteemed in our land and time, yet it is entirely absent such that its science has nearly been forgotten and its traces have disappeared. Only a few sketches of it remain in the early books, having been obscured by careless hands and confused lines until their meanings have become closed off and their usefulness has diminished.
Thus, I saw fit to revive it and compose this section on it in a manner that is clear, detailed, and concise, and to include illustrations of various tools used therein, as this would serve to further elucidate the text and provide what is necessary.
The reason why there are no skilled craftsmen in our time is that the field of medicine is extensive, and its practitioner must first be content with the science of anatomy described by Galen. Such that he may understand the utilities of the members, their forms and natures, their connections and disconnections, and be knowledgeable about bones, nerves, muscles, their numbers, outlets, arteries, veins, and the locations of their openings.
Therefore, as Al-Qurait said, 'Many are physicians in name but few in deed,' especially those skilled in manual work. We have mentioned this briefly at the beginning of this book.
For whoever is not knowledgeable about what we have mentioned regarding anatomy will surely fall into errors that may kill people, as I have often witnessed many who claim to practice this art without proper knowledge or skill.
I once saw an ignorant physician who incised a swelling on the neck of a woman, thinking it was a goitre. He severed some of the vessels in her neck, causing her to bleed profusely until she died in his hands.
I saw another physician who attempted to remove a large stone from the bladder of a man who had been suffering from hematuria. He panicked and removed it along with a piece of the bladder. The man died about three days later, and when I was called to remove the stone, I saw how large it was and the state of his health, which I had not previously appreciated.
I saw another doctor who made a living with some leaders of our region in medicine.
The doctor, hastily and without knowledge, bound the fracture near the heel of a black servant with dressings and splints, binding them tightly together without allowing the wound to breathe.
He then abandoned him to his desires for several days and ordered that the bandage not be removed until his leg and foot swelled up and nearly killed him.
So I was called to him, and I quickly removed the bandage. He felt relief from his pain, but the damage had already spread throughout the limb and could not be reversed.
And the corruption continued in the limb until he died.
I saw another doctor who applied hot fomentations to a patient with cancer. He excised it after several days until the patient's condition worsened, for if a cancer is purely from black bile, it should never be cauterized with iron.
Unless it is in an organ that can tolerate its total removal.
So know this, my son: that manual work is divided into two kinds - work that is accompanied by safety, and work that brings damage in most cases.
And I have warned throughout this book about the work involving danger and fear; you should avoid it and reject it.
So that the ignorant may not find an opportunity for argumentation and criticism. Therefore, be cautious and careful with your patients, treating them gently and confirming their ailments.
And follow the best path leading to safety and favorable outcome. Avoid difficult and dangerous diseases as much as possible.
And keep yourselves away from what you fear may bring doubt to your religion and worldly affairs. It is better for your honor and will raise you in this world and the Hereafter.
Galienus said in some of his advice, 'Do not treat bad diseases so that you do not become known as bad doctors.'
This section is divided into three chapters.
Chapter One.
Chapter One: Cauterization with Fire and Strong Drugs - Arranged from Head to Foot, with Illustrations of Instruments, Methods of Cauterization, and Everything Necessary for Manual Work.
The Second Gate
In the chapter on incisions, cupping, venesection, bloodletting, surgeries, removing arrows and other such topics, all arranged in an orderly manner with illustrations of the instruments.
The Third Gate
In the chapter on dislocations and fractures, treatment of wounds and similar topics, all arranged from head to foot with illustrations of the instruments.
The First Gate
On Phthisis (Tuberculosis)
Before mentioning its use, it is necessary to mention its benefits and harms and in what temperament it is used.
I say that discussing the benefits and harms of cupping is a lengthy topic, a subtle science, and a secret art about which many wise men have spoken.
And they differed on it, but I have briefly summarized some of their words to avoid lengthiness.
I say that cupping is generally beneficial for all humors, whether with matter or without it, except for two temperaments: the hot humor without matter and the dry humor without matter.
As for the dry humor with matter, there is disagreement about it. Some said that cupping is beneficial in it, while others said the opposite, claiming that cupping does not benefit a disease that results from heat and dryness because fire has the qualities of heat and dryness.
It is impossible for a hot, dry disease to be treated with a hot, dry remedy. But the one who disagrees says that cupping with fire can benefit a hot, dry disease that occurs in people's bodies. For whenever you add the body and its moisture to the nature of fire, you make the body cold.
And I say with him because experience has shown me that, except for those who have perfected and practiced cupping extensively. And stood on the varieties of temperaments of people, the conditions of diseases in themselves, their causes, symptoms, and duration.
As for other temperaments, there is no fear of them, especially cold, moist diseases, as all physicians agree on the benefit of cupping in them.
Know, O sons, that the secret of treating with cupping by fire and its superiority over cupping with a burned drug is that fire is a simple substance whose effect does not exceed the member it burns, nor does it harm another connected member except for slight harm.
The application of cauterization with burning drugs may extend its effect beyond the intended area, and perhaps cause an incurable disease in the member, or even kill. Fire, due to its nobleness and precious nature, does not do this except when it is excessive.
And we have come to understand this through experience, from the length of our service, care in our practice, and discerning the truth of the matter.
Therefore, I have avoided lengthy speech; were it not for the inappropriateness of such a secret and mysterious recipe for cauterization and its effects on bodies, along with philosophical proofs that refute doubts, to this book.
Know, O my sons, that they have differed in the appropriate time for cauterization, and most favored it at the time of spring.
I say that cauterization is suitable in all times because the harm caused by time is outweighed by the benefit gained from cauterization. Especially if the cauterization is for severe, urgent pain that cannot be delayed, as there may follow something worse than slight harm caused by time.
O my sons, do not think like the common people and the foolish physicians that cauterization which cures a disease will never return.
This is not because you may think that cauterization is merely like a medicine that alters the temperament and dries up the humidity causing pain.
Rather, cauterization surpasses medication in speed of action, strength of effect, and power of control.
Disease may sometimes return, according to the temperament of the patient, their ability to recover, the strength of the disease, and other factors such as diet and habits.
God forbid that cauterization be used for a light disease in an organ with little moisture or humor. Such as tooth extraction for pain, etc., in such cases the pain may not return, and this is the least likely outcome.
As for the common people's claim that cauterization is the last resort of medicine, this is correct only to the extent that they believe nothing can be done after cauterization.
Indeed, the meaning of 'al-Kiyâ is the last resort in treatment' is that whenever we employ various remedies in a disease without success, then we apply al-Kiyâ and it works. Henceforth, al-Kiyâ is considered the last resort in treatment. However, this is not the meaning that has been generally understood or grasped by many ignorant physicians.
It was mentioned earlier that gold al-Kiyâ is better than iron al-Kiyâ. They said this because of the mildness of gold and its noble substance, claiming that it does not cause inflammation at the site of application, which is not true.
For I have tested this and found that it only works in some bodies, not others. Gold al-Kiyâ is indeed better than iron al-Kiyâ as they said, except that when you heat the iron with gold in fire, you cannot tell when it reaches the desired temperature for the redness of gold.
Because cold approaches it quickly, and even if you increase the heat, it melts in the fire and causes confusion for the smith. Therefore, iron al-Kiyâ is quicker and more accurate for us to use, Allah willing.
I have arranged this chapter on cautery into sections, from head to foot, to make it easier for the student to find what they need, Allah willing.
Chapter One.
There is one type of cautery for the head.
This cautery is beneficial for excessive dampness and coldness in the brain, which are causes of headache, frequent colds around the eyes and ears, heavy sleep, toothache, and sore throat. In short, this cautery is useful for all diseases caused by coldness, such as epilepsy, insanity, palsy, and similar illnesses.
The image of this cautery is that you should first command the patient to evacuate with a laxative purgative for three or four nights, depending on their strength, age, and habit.
Then, you should command him to shave his head with a razor and make him sit before you, kneeling, with his hands placed on his chest.
Then, place the base of your little finger on the base of his nose between his eyes. Where your finger ends, mark that spot with ink.
Then heat the brass cautery until it becomes red hot.
Reveal as much bone as a grain of barley or a lentil, then raise your hand and cover it with the same cautery or another if it has cooled. Until you see that much bone which I mentioned to you, then take some salt, dissolve it in water and dip a wick into it. Place this on the wound and leave it for three days.
Then place a wick dipped in oil on the wound and leave it until the inflammation subsides, then treat it with the four-ingredient ointment until it heals, if God wills.
It is said that the more a wound remains open and secretes pus, the better it is.
Some people mentioned that you should cauterize the skin to the bone and keep the cautery in place until some of the thickness of the bone is burnt, then remove it afterwards and treat it.
Others said that one should exaggerate cauterization until it strongly affects the bone, like a large ring or seal, and they claimed that this draws out the head's vapor from that spot and leaves the wound open for a long time.
Then treat it until it heals. I do not see these two types of cauterization except in some people, and I consider leaving it as better. Peace be with you, if there is healing, the head will harden when its natural connection is severed, as we have seen in other organs.
Especially if the patient's head is inherently weak, the first type of cauterization is safer and better in my opinion. Therefore, act accordingly, if God wills.
Chapter Two.
On Cauterizing the Head.
If the head has chronic pain that persists in the patient despite using medications, ointments, poultices and bandages, especially if they have been cauterized with a single cautery as described without any benefit, then examine. If the patient's head has strong structure inherently and is not weak, but feels severe coldness, cauterize again slightly above the previous one. Then, scrape on every horn of his head until the thickness of the skin departs and its bone becomes exposed, which we have described. And scrape gently at the back of his head in the place known as 'the nape,' and be gentle here lest you expose the bone, for this area causes severe pain unlike any other scraping on the head, and I will mention this scrape in its proper place.
It is preferable that the curette used for scraping the horns of the head and the nape be gentler than that used for the middle of the head, and this is its shape.
Chapter Three.
On the treatment of non-chronic migraines.
If pain occurs in a head wound accompanied by headache and extends to the eye, evacuate the patient with diuretics for the head and use other treatments mentioned in the sections on diseases. If this does not succeed, there are two scraping methods for it. Either scraping with a cauterizing medicine or with iron.
As for scraping with the cauterizing medicine, take one clove of garlic, peel it, cut off its edges on both sides, and then make an incision with a wide scalpel in the painful spot at the temple until there is enough space under the skin to fit the clove.
Insert it under the skin until it disappears, then tie it with a tight bandage and leave it for about fifteen hours. Then untie and remove the garlic, leaving the wound for two or three days before dressing it.
Wrap it with cotton soaked in oil until the wound oozes. Then treat it with ointment until it heals, if God wills. If you wish, you may do this with some cauterizing drugs mentioned in the eighteenth chapter on cauterizing drugs.
And as for scraping with iron, it is done as follows: Heat the curette of this shape:
It is called the 'screw-shaped' curette because its tip resembles a screw with some convexity, and it has a small groove in its middle.
Then place it on the painful spot, hold your hand firmly, and turn the iron gently until you cauterize about half the thickness of the skin. Raise your hand to prevent burning the artery below and causing bleeding, then soak a bandage in saltwater and apply it to the site for three days. Then carry the bandage with oil, then treat it with ointment until it heals, God willing.
If you wish, cauterize this sister [hemorrhoid] with the sharp end of the iron and preserve it from cutting the artery in this non-chronic case particularly.
Chapter Four.
On Hemorrhoids That Do Not Heal.
If you have treated hemorrhoids with the remedies mentioned earlier, and they did not improve, and you see that the condition does not respond to the first cauterization either with medicine or fire... You should heat the iron until it turns red, then press it on the painful spot for about half a finger's length or similar, and remove your hand once to cut the artery and reach near the bone.
But beware of touching the moving joint lest it burn the muscle or its tendon, causing stiffness.
And be cautious of the bleeding from the artery you cut, as there is danger in it. Especially for one who is ignorant and has no experience, and leaves the job to others.
The treatment of sudden bleeding from an artery will be mentioned in its place in this book, God willing. If you find that the condition does not improve with this cauterization...
And if the patient's body is susceptible to fainting, treat him with cautery in the middle of his head as described, and dress the wound until it heals, God willing.
If you wish, use the cauterization mentioned in the chapter on tying arteries with the double-edged iron; it is better and more effective than this one.
Chapter Five.
On Cauterization of Earache.
If ear pain occurs due to cold and is treated with laxatives and other remedies mentioned earlier without relief, heat the iron called "al-Nokta" which has this shape...
Then heat it and then prick it around the entire ear, as it rotates, or around both of them if there is pain in both. And keep away from the root of the ear slightly after marking the spot with ink, and the cautery should be about ten points for each ear or thereabouts, then treat the spots until they heal, God willing.
Chapter Six
On Cauterization.
The phlegm that is treated by cautery is of the type that occurs as mentioned in the sections on diseases.
And avoid cauterizing the type that occurs from bone and nerve spasm.
If you have treated this type of phlegm with irrigations, syrups, and ointments without success, it is not permissible to cauterize the patient three times. Once at the root of the ear, second below its tip slightly, and third where the lips meet.
Make your cautery on the opposite side of the affected area because relaxation only occurs on the healthy side.
And the shape of the cautery should be like this: one at the tip of the upper ear under the head's horn slightly, and another in the cheek, and its length should be about the length of a thumb.
Bring down your cautery hand until it burns through half the thickness of the skin. This is the shape of the cautery, which is a type of skillet that has been previously shown, though softer than that one, as you can see. The blade should have a little more thickness, then treat the spot with what has been mentioned until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Seven
On Cauterization for Chronic Paralysis.
If paralysis has persisted and you have treated it with what was mentioned without success, and there is no fever in the patient, cauterize four times. Once on each horn of the head, once in the middle of the head as mentioned before, and once at the back of the head as described.
Recipe for cautery as mentioned earlier; additionally, you can also cauterize once on the stomach's mouth to make it better, then treat with what has been mentioned.
Chapter Eight
In Case of Forgetfulness
For phlegm that causes forgetfulness, it is advisable initially to administer large quantities of Iris and powdered Mastic for the brain.
Then shave his entire head and apply a plaster of mustard seed paste on its back, carrying it for several times until it falls off. This is also one of the treatments for forgetfulness.
Do this on the specified vein mentioned earlier; if it does not work, then apply three ligatures to the back of his head, starting from the top and going down to the nape of the neck.
Leave a space of about half an inch between each ligature; then treat the forgetfulness as mentioned earlier. If you wish to increase the number of ligatures and the patient can tolerate it, then apply the middle ligature again.
If you wish to increase the treatment further, apply additional ligatures on his ears; then treat him until he recovers. The cautery should be made of bronze and have the shape mentioned earlier.
Chapter Nine
On Paralysis and General Flaccidity
It is advisable to begin by purging the head with Iris and other mentioned remedies; then shave the patient's head, and apply ligatures: one at the center of the head, one on each ear, and one on the back of his neck.
And three more ligatures on the cervical vertebrae; if you need to apply more in cases of general flaccidity and the patient can tolerate it, and the disease is strong and persistent, then apply four additional ligatures on his back. Inform the patient about the cautery until it burns most of the skin and causes blistering; then remove your hand and treat him as mentioned earlier until he recovers, if Allah wills. The cautery should be made of bronze.
Chapter Ten
On Epilepsy
Only cauterize an epileptic whose seizures are caused by phlegm; it is advisable initially to purge his brain with large quantities of Iris and other remedies mentioned in the previous sections, provided that the patient is capable of taking medications.
But if he is a child who cannot tolerate medications, then use only the remedies of Garрагir and Mamlacith for the brain for many days before cauterization, along with improving his diet.
Then he shaves his head and applies the first cautery iron in the middle of the head as previously described, and another in the back. And on each horn of his head, an iron is applied; if the patient is strong and able to tolerate it, then cauterize with the irons mentioned in the chapter on palsy and relax the body over the cervical and lumbar vertebrae, using a golden iron as previously described.
If the patient is a child, make the iron gentle like this:
Chapter Eleven.
In cautery for melancholia.
If the cause of melancholy is corrupt humors and thick phlegm, cauterize with the irons mentioned in the chapter on palsy.
If the cause of melancholy is an inclination towards black bile and the patient's body is moist and corrupt, then purify his brain as mentioned in the section on classification.
Then shave the patient's head and make a tight cap of linen like a crown. Then lower it onto his head while he is sitting cross-legged, holding it from all sides. Then take one spoonful of old sheep fat oil.
Then heat it gently on the fire until it is warm enough to tolerate being placed on a finger. Then pour it onto the patient's head within the crown and leave it until it cools. Do this once every week along with other good treatments until he recovers, if God wills.
If you wish, cauterize with many small punctures without holding the iron in your hand but rather applying it gently; this method moistens the brain moderately.
Then place a linen cloth soaked in sheep fat oil or chicken fat on his head.
Chapter Twelve
In cautery for water descending into the eye
If you find at the beginning that water is descending into the eye with the signs mentioned in the section on classification, then hasten to purify his head and warm him from all dampness. Make him sweat in the bathhouse for several days on an empty stomach.
Then pass a razor over his head and cauterize with one iron in the middle of his head. Then cauterize with two irons on the temples if the water is descending into both eyes at the beginning, or from one side only if it is in one eye only.
Then cut with the scalpel all veins and arteries underneath the skin; let the incisions be long and wide at the temples, and take care not to cause bleeding.
If you find any of it, cut it off at its source with whatever treatment is possible; we will come to the wisdom in tying off vessels and cutting them without causing bleeding.
Two deep incisions may be made beneath the bones of the occiput.
Chapter Thirteen.
On chronic weeping wounds.
If the tears of the eye are chronic and persistent, and previously there were veins or arteries on the outside of the head that have since become hardened and obstructed by thick mucus, then cut the incision I described at the beginning of this section with the eye. Make an incision in the middle of the forehead, two on each temple, and two beneath the occipital bones. If more is needed, make additional incisions on both sides of the eye at the outer edge of the eyebrow with a small scalpel.
Chapter Fourteen.
On incision for blocked nostrils.
If the treatment mentioned in this section does not prove effective, then proceed as follows: apply cupping to the temples three times; then shave his head and make a midline incision on the forehead using an oily scalpel. Then make two incisions above the eyebrows with the iron scalpel, just beneath the hair; be careful not to cut the artery. This is the shape of the incisions:
Chapter Fifteen
On incision for drooping eyelid.
If the eyelid droops due to disease or moisture, cut one incision in the eyelid using this crescent-shaped scalpel.
If you wish, make two incisions above the eyebrows on both sides, a little way from the temples; each incision should be as long as the eyebrow.
Do not cut too deeply with the scalpel; only burn away about one-third of the skin. The shape of the scalpel should be like this:
Chapter Sixteen
On incision for drooping eyelid.
If the eyelashes turn inward and irritate the eye, there are two types of incisions: Either cauterize with fire or cauterize with a burning drug, but if cauterizing with fire, instruct the patient beforehand to leave his symptoms undisturbed if he is among those from whom it will be removed until they become prominent and equal.
If it pains at the time of its growth, then tie his eyes with a bandage so that they do not move until it grows. When it has grown and become even, place the patient's head in a vice, then mark on the eyelid with ink a sign in the shape of an oak leaf.
Begin the mark near the symptoms, then place under the eyelid a cotton wool soaked in egg white or sparrow's saliva, and heat with a heated iron having this shape.
Then cauterize according to the shape you have marked a little at a time many times until the surface of the skin burns in the shape of an oak leaf entirely, particularly and a sign that your work is healthy is when you see the eyelid has shrunk and the hair has risen from the flesh of the eye.
Then raise your hand and leave him for three days. Then apply cotton soaked in oil until the scab falls off, then treat him with ointment until it heals if Allah wills. If any hair returns after some time and the eyelid becomes relaxed.
Then cauterize again on that place as you did at first. If the hair is on the lower eyelid, cauterize until it returns to its natural place without hurting the eye's hair. And cauterizing with a burning drug is that you instruct the patient to leave the symptoms undisturbed until they become prominent and even.
Then make from paper a shape like an oak leaf. Then take from ordinary soap and unslaked lime each one a weight of a dirham or similar, crush them both together thoroughly and do this quickly so that they do not dry out. Then spread it on the paper you made in the shape of an oak leaf and place it on one or both eyelids, then place under the eye cotton wool soaked in egg white and place the patient's head in a vice.
Then place your index finger on top of the drug and press it gently while moving it whenever the patient feels its sweetness like fire. Leave the drug when he stops feeling its sweetness, then remove it and wash the eye with water.
Observe, for if you find the eyelid raised as it is during cauterization with fire or cutting, except [raise it] with medicine until your work is complete and the eye is healed; then place cotton soaked in butter upon it until the burning sensation subsides.
Then treat it with the yellow ointment or another until it heals; and you must be extremely careful during treatment that nothing of the medicine falls into the eye, for if the eyelid relaxes after days and some hair enters the eye.
Prepare the medicine on that spot where the eyelid has relaxed, especially as you did at first; then treat it until it heals. This is the figure of the willow leaf.
Know that people's eyes differ in size and smallness, so let your cauterization be according to that. There is no other correct way for one who has experience in this craft.
Chapter Seventeen.
On the extraction of the nasal bone which protrudes at the eye socket.
If, after treating the nasal bone as mentioned in the sections on diseases, your treatment does not succeed, then cauterize it in this manner:
Order the patient to place their head in a vice and have an assistant hold their head firmly with both hands, ensuring that it does not move or shake.
Then place a cotton wool moistened in egg white or spittle on their eyes; then heat the cauterizing iron which has this shape:
Let it be hollow like the shape of a feather quill at one end, which is used for cauterization; if you wish, it can also have an open tip at the other end, or closed like a rod. However, this hollow shape is better for your work, if Allah wills.
Then squeeze the nasal bone if it is open and remove its discharge, then rinse it; or if it is not open, open it and remove its pus. Then immediately place the heated cauterizing iron upon it, holding it with your hand until you reach the bone.
Move your hand slightly away from the eye towards the nose when cauterizing, so that your hand does not accidentally touch the eye or disturb the patient, causing the iron to fall onto the eye's conjunctiva and damage it. If you reach the bone on the first attempt, otherwise repeat the cauterization if necessary.
Leave it for three days, then apply a bandage with butter and treat it with the dry plaster until it heals. If forty days pass without healing, apply the caustic drug until the bone is exposed, as will be mentioned in its chapter, if God wills.
Another method of treating nasal fistulas, mentioned by some early authors, involves making an incision at the site of the fistula and then inserting a thin funnel into the same incision. This is its appearance.
Pour into it half an ounce of molten lead, holding the funnel firmly with one hand while pressing it tightly against the wound. Keep the patient still to prevent the molten lead from entering their eye. It is preferable to place a cloth soaked in egg white or water over the eye.
If the lead cauterizes the site of the fistula and heals it with remarkable healing, then the nasal fistula will be treated by the methods mentioned above. Otherwise, it will be necessary to perform nasal cautery and reposition the nasal septum into its proper place, as will be discussed in a later section devoted to this procedure.
Chapter Eighteenth.
On the treatment of cleft lip.
Cleft lip, often referred to as "hare lip," is common, especially in infants. If treatment with the methods mentioned earlier does not prove effective, then heat a small, flat iron on this shape:
Heat it over the fire until its hollow side is red hot, then place it on the cleft while rotating it until the heat reaches the depth of the cleft. Then treat it with cupping glass until it heals, if God wills.
Chapter Nineteenth
On the treatment of nasal fistulas occurring in the mouth.
If a nasal fistula appears at the base of the teeth, palate or roots of the incisors and swells, then bursts and becomes discharging, and treatment fails to improve it, then heat an iron on this shape that fits into the fistula.
Insert it while hot into the nasal fistula and hold it until the iron reaches its depth. Repeat this once or twice, then treat it with the methods mentioned earlier until it heals, if God wills.
If the matter has been severed and there is no pus, then exploration of the site is necessary, and removal of the rotten bone according to what will come in its chapter, if Allah wills.
The twentieth chapter.
About loose teeth and relaxed ones.
If the gums have become loose due to moisture and the teeth have moved, even after treating them with medication without success, then place the root of the pestle in your armpit, then heat the bellows that will come later, having placed the tube on the tooth.
And insert the bellows with the heated spoon, holding your hand for a short while until you feel the heat of the fire reaching the root of the tooth, then release your hand and repeat this several times according to what you desire, then fill your mouth with salt water.
And hold it thus for a while and spit it out, for the loose tooth will become fixed and the relaxed gum will tighten, and the corrupt moisture will dry up.
The twenty-first chapter.
About toothache.
If the toothache is due to cold or there is decay and medication has not helped, then there are two methods: either cauterization with fat, or cauterization with fire.
As for cauterization with fat, take beef fat and melt it in an iron spoon or a seashell, then take some cotton, wrap it around the end of a stick, dip it into the melted fat, place it on the painful tooth quickly and hold it until it cools.
Then repeat this several times until the heat reaches the root of the tooth. If you wish, you can also dip a wick or cotton in cold fat and place it on the painful tooth, then put the heated iron on top of it until the fire reaches the bottom of the tooth.
And as for cauterization with fire, take a copper or iron tube with some thickness to prevent the heat of the fire from reaching the mouth, then heat the bellows that will come later and place it on the same tooth, holding your hand until the bellows cools. Repeat this several times.
If pain departs either on that day or the following one, then it is necessary to fill the patient's mouth with good oil and hold him thus for a moment before expelling him. This is the image of the press.
Press using whichever end you wish, on whatever side is possible; this is the picture of the tube.
Chapter Twenty-Second
In the pressing of pigs.
If pigs are due to phlegm and cold humors, and do not yield to ripening with drugs, and you wish a swift ripening, then use the hollow press whose image is shown here.
To extract smoke during pressing from the other end, place it protected on the same tumor once or twice if needed until you reach the depth of the tumor. If the tumor is small, adjust the press to its size.
Then leave it for three days, apply a linen cloth dipped in oil until what was burned by fire is gone, then treat with ointment and bandages until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Twenty-Third
On pressing for hoarseness of voice and shortness of breath.
If phlegm prevails over the trachea, especially if accompanied by coldness of temperament, then the patient should first expercate with softening drugs, then press at the notch of the neck at the base of the larynx in the depressed place.
But be careful not to press on the larynx itself, nor burn more than a bit of skin. Then apply another press at the junction of the neck at its prominent end, and let the press be made in the manner described.
Then treat as mentioned above until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Twenty-Fourth
On pressing for lung disease and coughing.
If coughing and lung disease are due to cold phlegm, without fever or rigor, and the illness is persistent, then press with two presses on the lower sides of the chest at the empty depressions near the armpits, and another press in the middle of the chest between the breasts.
The cauterizing iron should be made as depicted. If you wish, it can also be made into a pointed cautery called 'the point,' whose image has been presented in the case of earache. The points are thirty in number or thereabouts.
Then treat it with what has been mentioned until it heals. A cauterizing iron can also be made with three branches as shown in the image, which is useful for cauterizing three areas at once in a single application. This is an image of the cautery.
Chapter Twenty-Fifth
In case of sciatica.
If the head of the shoulder joint is dislocated due to slippery fluids or has not set properly and becomes habitual, it should be reduced gradually without forcefully returning it at once. Then the patient lies on their back or on the unaffected side. The skin within the armpit is then raised upwards with the fingers of your left hand if the joint has dislocated inwards.
Then heat the cautery with two points, as shown in this image.
Then cauterize the skin with it until it pierces through to the other side, forming four points of cautery. Alternatively, you can use a cautery with three points, resulting in six points of cautery, with the points placed gently on the muscle.
This is an image of the cautery with three points.
And one more may be added to this number, resulting in eight points of cautery. Then apply the powdered frankincense with salt to the wound. Have the patient remain at rest and avoid moving the limb until it gains strength. Dislocation upwards occurs infrequently.
Cauterize above the shoulder joint with a single large round cautery, or several pointed cauteries if necessary. This will strengthen the joint and remove excess moisture, allowing the patient to recover.
Chapter Twenty-Sixth
On stomachache
If coldness and excessive moisture in the stomach cause it to deviate from its usual state, leading to frequent attacks of vomiting despite treatment with various remedies without success, then the patient should lie on their back and extend their legs and arms. Then apply three cauteries. A triangle-shaped incision is made beneath the breastbone using an iron cautery and two such incisions are made on either side of the chest, each as deep as a third of the thickness of the skin.
With this picture and to this extent, no more.
If you wish, make one large incision in the center of the abdomen as shown in this picture.
And the cautery used to make this single incision should be circular in shape, as shown in this picture.
And the stomach may be cauterized in spots for those who fear this incision: learn to mark points on the stomach with ink at the desired interval, then cauterize them using a pointed cautery, and treat them with the medication mentioned until they heal.
Chapter Twenty-Seventh.
In Cold Liver Incision.
If the liver is afflicted with pain due to coldness and dampness or wind, such that it has deviated excessively from its natural state, despite treating the patient with what was mentioned in the previous sections without success. It is necessary for the patient to lie on their back, and three incisions should be marked with ink on this shape and size on the liver below the ribs where the human elbow ends.
And after each incision, another should be made as thick as a finger's width, and the incision should run straight along the body without pressing too hard with the cautery.
And burn only half the thickness of the skin, no more. The patient should stand on their feet; if they cannot stand, they should lie down with their legs extended and arms raised. This is an image of the cautery.
And you may cauterize these incisions with the scalpel cautery if you are skilled and careful, taking care not to overdo it and burn all of the skin, reaching the intestines, for the skin there is thin.
Chapter Twenty-Eighth.
In Abdominal Enlargement Due to Liver Tumor: Incision.
If a tumor appears in the liver and you want to know whether it is in the substance of the liver or in its capsule, then if it is in the substance of the liver, it will cause heaviness and pain without a fixed limit for the patient.
If the liver's surface is inflamed, accompanied by severe pain and leaving doctors at a loss for treatment, it is advisable for the patient to lie on their back. Apply cataplasm on the warm site using ink.
Then heat the iron in fire; this iron resembles an incline and has the following shape: And burn it with one stroke until all of the skin is scorched and the cautery reaches the liver's surface, so that all the matter comes out. Then treat it as a fistula until it heals.
And this cautery method should only be performed by someone who has extensive medical experience and has practiced it many times before, for it is better to leave it to them.
Chapter Twenty-Nine.
On Cauterizing a Hemorrhoid.
Among the first methods mentioned for cauterizing a prolapsed hemorrhoid is this: Take one long, dry root of asafoetida, about the thickness of a finger, dip it in oil, and heat it in fire. Then cauterize once between the neck and shoulder junction, two small cauteries below the ears slightly inclined towards the chin, and two large cauteries above the breasts between the third and fourth ribs.
And two more between the fifth and sixth ribs inclined slightly backward, one in the middle of the chest, another above the stomach, three behind the shoulders between the scapulae, and two below the elbow on the inner side of the forearm.
And do not penetrate deep with the cautery, but rather apply it superficially on the skin. Some authorities mentioned using an iron incline-shaped cautery that is heated and inserted between the buttocks until it reaches the prolapsed hemorrhoid.
And the matter will come out as mentioned in liver cautery. With this method, either the patient dies immediately or the site develops non-healing ulcers.
Chapter Thirty.
On Cauterizing the Spleen.
If you treat the spleen condition mentioned in the treatment section without success, then cauterize it on three sides, all of which are correct. One option is to cauterize three or four times along the length of the spleen.
Form the liver cauteries in the shape mentioned earlier, with each cautery being about the thickness of a finger or slightly more. The same cautery technique described for the liver should be used here, without pressing too deeply. The patient should be lying on their back.
The other method is at the elbow, raising the skin that faces the spleen where the left elbow ends. The skin should be raised to the width of the body so that the cauteries fall along the length of the body.
Then insert both needles deeply until they pass through to the other side. Remove the cautery, resulting in four cauteries. If you prefer, use the three-needle cautery.
Then treat the cauterization site after it has oozed pus for many days. This is the most effective of all treatments mentioned.
Chapter Thirty-One
On Treating Hydrocephalus
Cauterization is only beneficial for hydrocephalus with clear fluid. If treatment methods mentioned earlier have not been effective, cauterize around the fontanelle with four cauteries and one on the abdomen.
And one cautery on the liver, one on the spleen, and two behind the back between the shoulder blades, one facing the chest and the other facing the abdomen. The depth of the cauteries should be close to the thickness of the skin. Then leave the cautery open so that it can ooze pus for a long time.
The patient should not be deprived of other treatments after cauterization, as combining treatments expedites recovery. The shape of the iron cautery used for the back is as previously described, and the shape of the wax cautery used for the back is conical.
Chapter Thirty-Two
On Cauterization of Feet and Legs
If there is swelling in the foot and it fills with yellow water, it is necessary to cauterize on the back of the foot at the notch between the little finger and the ring finger.
Place your hand on the cautery iron, do not curve it, then raise your hand without replacing it because the yellow water will ooze out and the cautery iron will be shaped like this.
Then cauterize both legs twice on each leg, with the pointed end of the cautery iron and along the length of the leg once below the knee and another midway down the thigh and two on each buttock.
Leave the wound open without treatment for a long time until water drains from it, then treat it with the rest of what has been mentioned.
Chapter Thirty-Three
On Hemorrhoids.
If the diarrhea is due to cold and dampness, such that the strength of the retaining and digesting powers in the stomach and intestines has weakened despite trying various treatments, and you find the patient suffering from hemorrhoids with abundant strength, cauterize him with a large iron on his abdomen. As mentioned above, cauterize the stomach with a circular cautery iron and four cauteries around the navel with a fine pointed cautery iron, and one large cautery on the pubic region or two cauteries.
If you find that there is an abundance of dampness and the patient is suffering from it, cauterize him with one cautery on the pubic region and one cautery on each flank. You may add two small cauteries near the large ones on the abdomen if necessary. This treatment is successful and does not fail to be beneficial, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-Four
On Hemorrhoids of the Anus
If there are chronic and numerous hemorrhoids in the anus, or if it is a single one that is hard, cold, or caused by corrupted humors despite being treated with the methods mentioned earlier without success, cauterize the patient three times on the lower part of the sacrum below the waist, like this.
And one cautery below the navel, about two fingers' width. If you estimate that his stomach is cold and his food is not digesting well and his face appears bloated, cauterize him on the abdomen with a large cautery as mentioned above, and one cautery on his chest. Apply another with a heated iron and leave it open for some time then treat him until he recovers, if Allah wills.
The Thirty-Fifth Chapter.
In the case of a foreskin.
After cutting it, if the wen is cut off, heat the cauterizing iron that resembles a slope then insert it into the same wen that has been cut and press your hand until the iron reaches the mouth of the vein from which blood flows. Do this once or twice.
If the wens are many, cauterize each one as we have described then treat them with ointments appropriate for them until they heal. If the cautery is too large for cotton, it will be more effective.
The Thirty-Sixth Chapter
Concerning the treatment of hemorrhoids that occur in the anus and its vicinity.
If the patient does not comply with the incision and the procedure we described in its place and is reluctant to do so, perhaps he may recover by cautery. If one of the hemorrhoids swells and purulent discharge flows from it, the first thing you should do is measure it with a slender probe.
Then know its size by the probe, heat the cauterizing iron that resembles a slope, insert it heated into the same hemorrhoid on a line with its depth and the length the probe entered it, and apply the cautery until all those corrupt tissues are burnt once, twice or thrice according to your need.
And be cautious not to burn a nerve if there is one, or a large vein. And if the hemorrhoids extend to the bladder or rectum.
And be cautious from all these places, but do this only if the hemorrhoids are in a fatty location and you have assessed that they are not prolapsed. Then treat the area until it heals. If the place closes up and stops discharging materials and remains like that for some time, know that it has healed completely.
If the discharge does not stop, know that it is prolapsed or there is a large corrupt depth or something similar to what is mentioned in its place.
The Thirty-Seventh Chapter
On Kidney Stones
If pain occurs in the kidneys due to cold or sharp wind, and the patient experiences loss of desire [for sexual activity], then cauterize over both kidneys using the cautery iron that has been previously mentioned, or perhaps use a third one on the same table, so that there are three cauteries arranged together for greater effectiveness.
The Thirty-Eighth Chapter
On Cauterization of the Bladder
If weakness and relaxation occur in the bladder due to coldness and dampness such that the patient cannot retain urine, cauterize below the pubic region over the bladder where the pubic hair begins, and also cauterize on the right side of the scrotum and another on the left side.
And after cauterization from each side, according to the size of a thumb joint, also cauterize at the lower back or use two cauteries if necessary. Use the same cautery iron as previously mentioned.
The Thirty-Ninth Chapter
On Cauterization of the Uterus
If coldness and dampness occur in the uterus causing infertility, impairment of menses, or pain during intercourse, then cauterize three times around the scrotum as mentioned in the cauterization of the bladder. And cauterize once on the lower back or twice using the same cautery iron as before.
The Fortieth Chapter
On Cauterization for Dislocation of the Hip Joint
If erroneous mucus accumulates in the hip joint causing its dislocation, with symptoms including a lengthening of one leg relative to the other when their sides are compared and a hollow felt at the site of dislocations, then cauterize the patient on the actual hip joint using a circular cautery.
After tracing the joint with ink, cauterize at its center using the cautery iron depicted for cauterizing the stomach. If you do not have this instrument, use three large bronze cauteries instead.
Cauterize deeply to the thickness of the skin entirely, then treat it until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Forty-Four
In treating hemorrhoids.
If pain occurs in the hip area, caused by coldness and dampness, and the physician has applied the treatments mentioned earlier without success, then it is recommended for the physician to soften the thick humors with castor oil or Indian bdellium, etc.
Then cauterize and apply the cautery in two ways: either by cautery using burning drugs, or by fire cautery. The fire cautery has many forms; one of them is to cauterize three times on the actual hemorrhoid site in this manner.
Make each cauterization have a suitable depth, with about the thickness of a finger between each cautery. Use a spoon-shaped cautery, and if desired, cauterize once in the middle on top of the anus itself to make it four cauteries. If you prefer, you can cauterize using the circular cautery mentioned earlier for one hemorrhoid.
This is the description of cauterization for hemorrhoids if the pain is persistent and confined to the hip area without extending to the thigh or leg.
If the pain extends to the thigh and leg, cauterize twice on the thigh at the point indicated by the patient as painful. Also, cauterize once above the anus with a scalpel-shaped cautery about four fingers to the right side of it. The depth of the cautery should be equal to the thickness of the skin only.
If the pain extends towards the toes of the foot, cauterize three or four times, or more if necessary, at the point indicated by the patient using a pointed cautery. If the pain is beneath the knee and extending downwards towards the leg, cauterize once there using a scalpel-shaped cautery.
Be careful during all cauteries to avoid reaching and burning any large nerve or artery, as this would cause harm or disablement to the patient.
I have seen one or two cases where a cautery was applied too high near the anus, causing inflammation in the leg that reached up to the foot. The entire leg became swollen and decomposed, followed by diarrhea and death afterwards. If the pain is on both sides, cauterize in this same manner for both sides.
Some wise scholars have described this hip dislocation as resembling a cup made of iron, with its diameter being half a cubit. At its mouth, it should be slightly thicker than the stone of a date or even less so, and within that cup there should be another cup and yet another cup.
And the distance between each of these cups should be equal to the thickness of a thumb. The cups are open on both sides and their height is about one or two thumbs. An iron clamp is made for them, fitted precisely onto the cups.
Then it is heated in a fire until it turns red hot and the sparks fly off. It is then placed on the hip dislocation, with the patient leaning on their sound side, and three circular movements are made at once. It is left like this for three days, then smeared with fat and the wound is kept open.
And then it is treated with an ointment until it heals. The author of this book says that this type of dislocation is rarely used due to its severity and the horror of its appearance, but also because few people are able to endure it, except for those who have a good constitution and are willing to endure it in its proper place.
And as for reduction using burning drugs, it is done by making two cups similar to door hinges, made of copper or iron.
Their height should be about two thumbs or more, and the distance between them should be equal to the thickness of a finger. They are open at both ends, with one facing downwards and one facing upwards, and they fit together in this manner.
Then they are placed on the hip dislocation while the patient lies on their sound side. Press your hand firmly down, then pour hot nitric acid between the two circles and hold it for an hour or so until the patient can endure its burning sensation.
Until the burning sensation subsides, then lift your hand and wipe away the nitric acid from the hip with fresh water. Leave it like this for three days, applying fat to it until the blackness of the burn disappears, allowing pus to discharge until healed.
Then treat it with ointments until it heals, if the pain extends to the thigh or leg, make him a bandage that holds water according to what you did for the hip joint. This is the description of the sharp water and I have proven it in the book 'Reform of Medicines.'
Take one part of natron (soda ash) and one part of unslaked lime, grind them together, place them in a new pot that has been perforated at its bottom with a small hole according to the size of the wick, and put another pot underneath it.
Pour fresh water over the natron and lime until it covers them by a finger's breadth, after squeezing them with your hand. Leave the pot until the sharp water drains into the bottom of the perforated pot, then collect all that water and pour it onto another fresh batch of lime and natron.
And thus, at that point, it becomes very sharp and can be used for many surgical procedures and cauterization of various parts, as it has the effect of fire itself. Among the remedies that are also used to cauterize the hip joint is Thapsia, dates syrup, lime mixed with soap.
Galen claims a story about an ancient man who treated hip pain and sciatica, increasing his reputation greatly, and claimed that no other treatment was needed as it cured in one application.
Until he might have entered the bath paralyzed and exited cured. If fresh green Frankincense is not available, then take some recently dried one, pound it with a little bit of fat, and apply it to the hip joint where the pain is felt, or on the leg or thigh.
And bind it, leaving it for three hours or until the patient feels that the burning sensation has subsided, then enter him into the bath. If his body perspires, then enter him into the tub. The pain will go away and he will be cured, if God wills. If not cured, repeat the bandage after ten days.
If God wills, he will be cured. Know that none of these cauterizations should be used until after the body has purged itself. Dioscorides mentioned that burning goat hair is beneficial for treating sciatica.
He should be like this: wool is taken, soaked in old oil and placed on the deep space between the thumb and wrist, closer to the wrist. Then take dry donkey hide.
Kindle it with fire until it becomes a coal, then place it on the wool and leave it until it extinguishes. Then take another one, continuing this process until the pain reaches midway between elbow and hip, and subsides by God's will. This type of cauterization is called 'cautery of the hide'.
Chapter Forty-Two.
On cauterizing back pain.
The pain in the back may occur from various causes such as falls, blows, or excessive vomiting etc. The cold dampness of fluid matter accumulates there and cautery is only applied in this type.
If it is due to the accumulation of cold matter, after the patient has purged with hot remedies like senna etc., cauterize three rows across the width of the table at the place of pain. Mark each row with ink beforehand, placing five or more cauteries in each row depending on what you see as suitable for the patient's endurance and strength.
The cautery should be performed using a pointed iron, if desired use three or four cauteries with an intermediate-sized pointed iron on this form.
Chapter Three-Hundred-Forty.
On cauterizing the beginning of the spine.
This condition often affects young children. Its initial sign in a child is difficulty breathing upon standing or movement, and one finds that the last few vertebrae of the spine have protruded like beads, appearing more prominent than the others.
If you see this and wish to stop it, cauterize with an iron shaped like this circle: Place the cautery on each side of the vertebra evenly. If desired, use a pointed iron in two or three rows around the vertebra, with the points close together. Then treat the area until it heals as mentioned.
And beware of using cautery on a spine that is affected by nerve constriction,
Chapter Forty-Four
About gout and joint pain.
If the joint pains are due to cold humidities that settle in any organ of the body, if these pains occur in the legs, physicians usually call it gout specifically.
If the cold cause of gout is treated by various remedies mentioned earlier but the pains do not subside, then poultices are used to alleviate them. After urination, many warm poultices should be applied around the ankles and knees in this manner: use moderate-sized, oily poultices.
If it is necessary to cauterize the face, do so with a hot iron. If the pains ascend to the knees or other joints - which often happens - apply three or four such oily poultices on each side of both knees.
If more poultices are needed, apply them without pressing too hard with your hand, just enough to warm the skin slightly. If the pains ascend to the buttocks or back, use the poultices mentioned earlier for those areas.
If the pains are only in the hands, cauterize around both wrists like two rings. If the pains remain in the fingers, cauterize each joint and the palm of the hand. If the pains ascend after some days to the elbows or shoulders.
Apply poultices to both sides of each elbow and shoulder without neglecting good care and medication. If one has a good diet and evacuates phlegm, they will recover with these poultices, God willing.
Chapter Forty-Five
About cautery for hemorrhoids.
If hemorrhoids appear in the anus and some intestines or prolapse descend to the scrotum, especially if it is a recent onset, it is not advisable for the patient to fast that day. Instead, they should use mild laxatives to facilitate the evacuation of feces from the bowels.
Then, have the patient lie on their back in front of you. Order them to hold themselves up until the prolapsed tissue or intestines protrude, then push it back with your finger. Mark the location of the hemorrhoid under the anus using ink, resembling a semicircle with its ends pointing towards the upper body.
Then heat this iron to its shape.
Until it turns white and sparks are emitted, then return the pot or vessel to its center. Then place a servant's hand on the spot so that the pot does not slip out while the patient's legs are spread apart and placed upon a cushion. Another servant should then tie his legs together.
Another should hold him down by his chest, then lower the iron onto the same spot while keeping one's hand on it until it reaches the bone or repeat if not reached on the first try.
Be careful not to let the pot protrude while you move, lest it burn and cause either death or great harm to the patient. Know that if the heat does not reach the bone, your procedure has failed. It is advisable for children's pots to be of a size suitable for their bodies and likewise for adults.
Then treat the burned area with clarified butter three days later to remove its blackness, then apply other ointments until it heals. Let the patient lie on his back for forty days until the wound scars over.
It is advisable to make his diet soft during recovery so that the pot does not slip out during evacuation or urination. After forty days, if he wishes to rise, use a supportive bandage and keep it on for another forty days to reduce exhaustion from heavy food, drink, and loud shouting.
If this procedure is followed as such, God willing, the patient will recover completely. I will mention the treatment of hernias caused by incisions in their proper place, God willing. As for hernias that occur elsewhere on the abdomen and are beginning to develop, if you wish not to increase the size of the hernia opening, use a round iron of suitable size. Let what you burn be like two-thirds of its size, then treat it as mentioned earlier. God willing, it will not increase. Some predecessors have mentioned that hernias should be cauterized with a three-pronged iron shaped thus.
After drawing a line across the top of the hernia with ink and another line below it, place your hand in the middle using one smooth iron. The first iron is simpler and better if God wills.
Chapter Sixty-Four
On the Treatment of Goitre
If pain occurs in any organ due to a blow or injury, and that pain persists for a long time without responding to medicinal treatment, then cauterization with a branding iron should be performed. The size of the cautery must be determined according to the size, strength, and weakness of each organ.
If the pain and goiter are alleviated by this cautery, then no further treatment is necessary. However, if they persist, the cautery should be repeated because it is common for such pains to spread to nearby organs. Therefore, the cautery should be applied until the patient is cured.
Chapter Seventy-Four
On the Treatment of Leprosy
Leprous patients can greatly benefit from cauterization, especially those whose leprosy is due to corrupt phlegm and black bile.
If you wish to cauterize, and the leprosy is recent but has not improved with previous treatments and you fear that corruption will spread throughout the patient's body, then cauterize five times on the head. One cautery in the middle of the head, one below it towards the forehead at the end of the hair, two on the temples, and one behind on the nape of the neck. Press firmly with the cautery to slightly affect the bone.
Remove the scabs from him to facilitate the discharge of thick phlegm and cauterize once more on the same spot. If the leprosy has persisted in the patient and is clearly visible, then do not cauterize with these cauteries mentioned for the head. Cauterize once at the tip of the nose, twice on each cheek, twice on the glands of the neck, six times on the glands of the back, one large cautery on the coccyx at the base of the spine and another above it on the same level, and two cauteries on each armpit. Two cauteries on each knee, one on each, two on the hip joints, two on the elbows, two on the pectoral muscles, and cauterize at every joint of the fingers and toes. Also cauterize both heels and soles of the feet.
Be cautious of the nerve at the back of the heels, lest you burn them. There is one that extends to the pubic bone, another to the stomach's mouth, and another to the liver. Know that whenever you increase the quantity of the sinew, it becomes more beneficial.
Know that the patient does not feel pain in the sinew as the healthy person does, because his body is numb. It is necessary for the ligaments to be of a size large or small according to the members and joints mentioned earlier.
Then treat the sinew with powdered nard mixed with honey and other treatments until it heals, if God wills.
Chapter Eighty-Four.
In the case of numbness of a limb, if drugs and dressings have been applied without effect, then treat it with ligatures according to the size of the bone or its smallness. And take care that the skin is not too thick.
Then treat it with the ointment until it heals. And ligature may also be applied to some numbness that affects the hand or foot at the foramen of the spine where the nerve that moves that limb exits, which will relieve the numbness.
And let no one attempt this unless he is knowledgeable in anatomy and the exits of the moving nerves of the body.
Chapter Ninety-Four.
On the treatment of leprosy.
If leprosy has advanced and no medical remedy has been effective, then ligature it with a deep stitch according to the thickness of the skin until the whiteness disappears and its color changes.
Then treat it with chickpea powder mixed with almond oil, rosewater, and the blood of a dove or pigeon, each one part, mixed together and applied on a cloth to the affected area until it heals.
Chapter Fifty.
On the treatment of cancer.
If the cancer is at its beginning and you wish to stop it, ligature it with a circular band around it like a ring. Some sages have mentioned that a strong ligament should be tied in its center, but I do not recommend that because I expect it to become gangrenous, as I have seen happen many times.
The correct method is to suture around it in a circular fashion as mentioned earlier, or with many stitches.
Chapter Fifty-One.
On the treatment of boils.
If a boil appears and its healing is delayed, either due to excessive blood flow around it or because the patient is elderly with poor blood circulation or due to the time of year, use many small stitches placed closely together around it.
Then leave it alone; it will heal quickly. If you wish to cut it open, surround the area with a ligature as shown here.
And lower the ligature to the center of the boil until it penetrates the skin, making the stitch below the boil so that pus can easily flow out. Then treat it as necessary until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-Two.
On treating ulcers.
If an ulcer is present in a location suitable for cauterization with fire, surround it with many small and large iron stitches according to what is appropriate for that location.
Then cauterize it on all sides until the decay is completely removed, leaving no trace. Leave it for three days and then apply powdered sulfur mixed with oil to the cauterized areas to remove any remaining debris and decay.
Then treat it with flesh-germinating ointments. If after three days the flesh grows back healthy and free from decay, otherwise repeat cauterization on any remaining decayed areas. The ulcer can also be treated with harsh medicines.
This method is faster and more effective than cauterization with fire, although the treatment of ulcers using harsh medicines has been mentioned in the relevant section [Chapter 56].
Chapter Fifty-Three.
On treating inverted and non-inverted warts.
This condition often occurs at the bottom of the feet; it is a rough growth that troubles people. Its treatment can be by cauterization with fire or using caustic water.
If you wish to cauterize with fire, take a hollow iron spoon shaped like the feathers of a vulture, fitting around the screw on all sides and thin-edged. Heat it over the screw, then rotate your hand with the spoon around the screw until the spoon reaches the depth of the screw.
Leave it for three days until it festers, then dress it with fine, salt-ground bread and leave the dressing overnight. If it adheres to its base, treat the wound area with a flesh-generating ointment until it heals.
Often, boils appear on the surface of the body, especially on hands and feet. Therefore, take a tube made of copper or iron or vulture feathers, place it over the boil or pimple, then pour a little vinegar into the tube.
Hold your hand while rotating it, gently pressing the edge of the tube onto the boil's root to allow the vinegar to seep into its base. The patient should endure the sting for a moment.
Leave it thus until the boil comes off completely. Do this for each one, until all are removed from the body. Then treat the areas with flesh-generating ointments.
Chapter Forty-Five
On cauterization of hemorrhoids.
If hemorrhoids occur due to cold or fever lasting a quarter day or longer, cauterize four or five times between the buttocks, with one cautery mark per knot and one on the back. And cauterize once on his stomach using a golden spoon. This will alleviate hemorrhoids and speed up recovery from cold diseases.
Chapter Fifty-Five
On cauterization of boils appearing on the body.
When sudden, ugly boils appear on the body due to cold, hard, corrupt materials, cauterize each boil gently with a burning tip of an oak twig or a long red-hot poker or an iron spoon as soon as they emerge.
And let the bloodletting cease immediately upon this sign, lest its beneficial effect be diminished and dissipated; the patient will only recover from it once he has evacuated by cupping.
Chapter Fifty-Six.
On bleeding resulting from cutting an artery.
It often happens that blood flows copiously from a cut artery during an external wound, or when incising a tumor or evacuating an abscess, etc., making it difficult to tie off.
If this happens, quickly place your index finger at the mouth of the artery and press it tightly until bleeding stops completely, then heat some bronze forceps in fire until they become very hot.
Take one forceps, either small or large depending on the wound and location of the severed artery, and apply it to the artery itself immediately after removing your finger. Hold it until bleeding stops completely.
If blood gushes forth when you remove your finger from the mouth of the artery and the forceps cools down, quickly take another heated forceps from those prepared in the fire, continuing this process until bleeding ceases.
Be careful not to burn the tissues, causing further injury to the patient. Know that it is impossible to tie off a bleeding artery, especially if it is large, except by one of four methods: cauterization as mentioned earlier, or amputation if it has not already been severed. If the artery is ligated, its ends will retract and bleeding will stop; otherwise, it must be tied tightly with sutures or treated with medications that coagulate blood and compression bandages.
But attempting to tie off or compress an artery with cloth, hot objects, etc., will not stop bleeding except rarely. If this happens and there is no doctor or medication available, quickly place the index finger at the mouth of the wound as described earlier.
Press firmly until bleeding stops and blood coagulates around the finger. Keep it there with cold water continuously, even if it freezes your hand, until bleeding ceases completely. Meanwhile, assess what treatment is needed: cautery or medication.
The Second Chapter
In the case of the side (abdominal) wall, the belly, cupping, and surgeries etc.
Al-Khalaf mentioned earlier in the first chapter all diseases that are cured by cauterization with fire and burning drugs, their causes and reasons for occurrence, as well as their instruments and manifestations.
And I will follow this approach in this chapter to facilitate the student's understanding of the subject.
Before starting, you should know, O my sons, that this chapter contains more severe cases than those mentioned in the first chapter on cauterization.
Therefore, the warning in this chapter should be stronger because the operations involved are many and often lead to profuse bleeding, which is essential for life when opening a vein or an incision on a tumor, an abscess, a surgical treatment, or removing an arrowhead or an incision for extracting a stone. All of these cases involve danger and fear, and death may occur in many of them.
I warn you against being careless in matters that are doubtful for you, as there are various kinds of people in this profession with different types of illnesses. Some may be weary of their disease and desirous of death.
Due to the severity of his pain and the length of his illness, some may seem close to death. Others may offer you money in the hope of recovery from their fatal disease; however, it is not permissible for you to accept any payment from such people at all times.
Let your caution be greater than your desire and eagerness. Do not proceed with anything unless you are certain of its outcome through reliable knowledge. Always use the introduction of knowledge and warning in treating all your patients, explaining what ensures their safety.
For this, you will gain praise and glory, and be remembered with thanks. May God guide you, O my sons, to the right path and grant you success, for that is in His power. There is no god but Him.
This chapter has been arranged with sections from head to toe, following what was mentioned in the chapter on cauterization. May it be easy for you to find what you seek, if God wills.
The First Chapter
In treating water that collects in the heads of children.
This condition frequently occurs in newborns at birth if the midwife presses the baby's head too hard, and it may also occur for an unknown hidden cause.
And I have not seen this condition in anyone other than children, and all of those whom I saw quickly died from it. Therefore, I saw that it is better to leave it alone. I also saw a child whose head was filled with water, and the head swelled more every day. Until the child could no longer sit up due to the size of his head and the increase in fluid, and he died.
This fluid may accumulate either between the skin and the bone, or beneath the bone on the peritoneum. If it is accumulated between the skin and the bone, and the swelling is small, then a single incision should be made in the middle of the head, horizontally, about two fingerbreadths long, to allow the fluid to drain out. This is an illustration of the probe.
If the fluid has increased and the swelling is greater, then make two intersecting incisions like this:.
If the fluid is beneath the bone, its indication is that the fontanelles are open on all sides and water flows inwards when squeezed with the hand. This should not be concealed from you, and therefore three incisions should be made in the middle of the head like this:.
After the incision, all of the fluid should come out. Then close the incisions with bandages and compresses. After that, bathe him from above with vinegar and oil for five days. Then release the bandage and treat the wound with sutures and ointments. Do not tie the head too tightly and feed the patient dry foods that are not moist.
Until the organ is strengthened and the wound heals, another method of incision is to look where the bone of the swelling appears and where the water collects because it may be more in the back or front, or on the right or left side.
So aim for the incision where you see the swelling and the accumulation of water, make it as deep as you can, but be careful not to cut an artery so that there is no bleeding that causes death along with the discharge of fluid.
Chapter Two
Ligation of the two arteries behind the ears known as the "temporal arteries".
When a person has sudden severe pain in the eyes or chest, and this persists without being cured by medication, then informing treatment consists of ligating these two arteries.
It is necessary, if one wants to ligate them (the arteries), that the head of the patient be shaved with a razor, then the site be rubbed with a coarse cloth so that the artery becomes visible. Then, the neck of the patient should be extended by his garment, and look where the pulse appears and locate the two pulsating points behind the ears, for they are usually hidden except in some people.
Then mark them with ink, then cut them with a sharp scalpel until bone is reached. This should be done with the head of the patient raised. Alternatively, one may insert the scalpel underneath the artery and lift it upwards for the cut, which should be about two fingerbreadths long.
If the vessel is cut, blood will flow out pulsatingly like a fountain onto the cloth in front. If the artery cannot be felt, then measure three fingerbreadths from the ear, mark it with ink and cut down to bone. It is preferable that...
Then, tie off the wound with four ligatures. Some may require more or less depending on the strength of the patient and the fullness of their arteries. Then examine the wound to ensure that all of the peritoneum has been cut away from the bone.
So that no inflammation occurs, then close the wound with a bandage made of linen cloth and treat it with ointments until it heals.
Chapter Three
On ligation of the arteries in the ears.
If a person suffers from chronic headaches, sudden severe pain in the muscles of the ears, or persistent intense headaches due to hot and humid conditions, and various medicinal treatments have not been effective, then we have tried ligation of the arteries of the ears or their branches, as described.
The procedure for ligation consists of shaving the hair on the patient's ears, and then locating the visible artery in the temple, which can be felt pulsating. It may not be apparent in some individuals.
If you are suffering from intense cold, wrap the patient's neck with his cloth then rub the area with a cloth or apply warm water until the pulse becomes clearly visible. Then take the lancet that looks like this. Then gently cut the skin with it until you reach the artery, then insert a tweezers and pull it upwards until it exits the skin and remove any membranes underneath from all sides. If the artery is thin, use the tip of the tweezers to tie it. Then cut off a section equal to the distance between its ends and do not cause bleeding. If it does not bleed, remove six ounces of blood from three places.
If the artery is very large, then tie it in two places with a strong linen thread or catgut to prevent gangrene from occurring before the wound heals.
Then cut off the excess between the ties at that time or later. If you wish, cauterize it with a heated skinnер blade to burn its ends. This serves the same purpose or even better as mentioned before.
However, if the patient has a fever or is of irritable temperament, cauterization may not be beneficial as it dries out the body fluids. Therefore, after tying off the arteries, pack the area with sterile cotton and dress it properly. After healing, treat it with dry medicines that promote flesh growth and bandage it until it heals, if God wills.
If bleeding occurs during the procedure, immediately cut the artery either by cauterization or filling the site with powdered myrrh and pressing your hand until bleeding stops. If that doesn't help, apply pressure with your finger until bleeding ceases.
Then wash the area with very cold water to numb the pain and dress it properly. It is easier to cauterize veins than arteries using this skinner blade after marking the sites with ink.
I press firmly until it reaches the bone and the vein breaks at two points so that its ends are separated, for it will not adhere to this instrument. This is an image of the forceps.
The edges of the scissors resemble two small points except that they are much duller than a knife because if they were sharp like it, cold would come upon them quickly and the flesh would not be cut off quickly. Therefore, they should be heated with fire.
Cut the flesh quickly, for this action is better than all other actions and easier, and let there be between the scissors the thickness of a finger.
Chapter Four
In treating constant hot tears flowing to the eyes.
If tears are continuous and their flow is from the veins on the skull outside, without benefit from medicinal treatment of medicine, and you see the patient's face to be red. And he feels a crawling sensation on his forehead like that of ants, and his eyes are sunken and moist, with their corners inflamed and their eyelids sticking together due to the intensity of tears. Therefore, the first resort in treating this is to order the patient to shave the hair from his forehead.
Then, three parallel incisions are made on the forehead along its length. The first incision is about two fingers' width long, midway between the eyebrows and the tip of the nose. The second is slightly further away from the movement of the muscle in the temple, and the third is on the other side.
And be careful not to cut the two arteries on either side, and keep your hand away from the cheekbones. Leave about threefold fingers' width between each incision. Have with you prepared sponges or many dry rags to absorb blood.
Then insert a sharp-pointed probe like this one: From the incision near the temple to the middle incision, and scrape off all the skin and fascia that lies between them from the bone. Then do the same from the middle incision to the third one, and then remove this probe. And insert into the first incision another instrument called the sharp-edged scissor-like tool with one side sharp and the other blunt, like this:
Its sharp side should be turned upwards towards the flesh adhering to the skin, and its flat side towards the bone; it is pushed until it reaches the middle slit, cutting all vessels descending from the head to the eyes without the cut reaching the surface of the skin.
Then, do this from the middle slit to the other slit. After a moderate amount of bleeding has flowed, squeeze the places where the hardened blood was cut. Then, in each slit, place a cotton wick moistened with a mixture of rose water and oil or vinegar and oil.
Lest a hot swelling occur. On the third day, dissolve the suture with warm water and use copious irrigation. Then treat it with basilicon plaster mixed with rose oil and other wound remedies until it heals, if God wills.
Chapter Five
On treating tears and discharges to the eyes from within the head.
When someone has frequent, sharp, continuous, hot discharges that make both eyes appear bloodshot and small, weaken their vision, cause the eyelids to become inflamed and shed tears. And there is severe, painful headache and frequent sneezing. Know that these symptoms indicate that the discharges come from many deep vessels; the best treatment for this condition is as follows: Order the patient to shave their forehead, then make a single incision in the middle of the forehead.
And there is severe, painful headache and frequent sneezing. Know that these symptoms indicate that the discharges come from many deep vessels; the best treatment for this condition is as follows: Order the patient to shave their forehead, then make a single incision in the middle of the forehead. Or raise it slightly across, starting the incision from the left temple to the right, reaching the bone and keeping your hand away from the chewing muscles of the temples until the bone is exposed and all the blood is wiped off with a sponge.
Then separate the edges of the incision with a cotton pad soaked in rose water and oil or roll some linen threads between them. Then tie it from above with bandages. Moisten the bandages with the same mixture to prevent inflammation. If inflammation occurs, do not scrape the bone until flesh begins to grow on it.
Then treat it with the dry regimen that promotes flesh growth, such as making a plaster of two parts wheat flour and four parts colophony, applying it to promote flesh growth in wounds like this.
Chapter Six
On the treatment of what falls into the ear.
All that falls into the ear belongs to four types: either a metallic stone or something resembling stone like iron and glass, or a plant-like substance such as chickpeas and kernels, or a liquid thing like water and vinegar.
Or an animal, in which case if a stone or a type of stone falls into the ear that does not grow there, receive it with the ear facing the sun. If you see only the stone, rub some violet or sesame oil on it, then try to remove it by moving your head or sneezing vigorously while pressing on the tragus. And block the nostrils upon sneezing after placing a bandage made of cloth or wool around the ear and pulling it up towards the cheekbone. Many times, this treatment will remove it. If not, then try to remove it with the gentle hook whose shape is shown here.
If it comes out with the hook or not, then try to remove it with a gentle, slightly bent hollow tube. If it still does not come out, then make a tube of copper and insert its end into the opening of the ear carefully.
And seal around the tube with soft wax mixed with oil so that there is no way for wind except through the tube, then pull it out forcefully with your hook. Many times, this will remove it. If not as described earlier, take a small amount of Nabatian gum or prepared pitch used for birds and place it at the end of the reed.
After wrapping it tightly with cloth, then insert it into the opening of the ear gently after drying the ear from moisture. If it does not come out despite all that has been described, hurry to make an incision before inflammation or spasms occur.
The prescription for the incision: first, let the patient bleed from the vein of the forehead according to his strength, then let the patient sit in front of you and turn his ear upwards, and make a small incision at the base of the ear where it is fleshy on its lower side.
The incision should be crescent-shaped so that it reaches the stone, then remove it with whatever tools you can. Then stitch up the incision immediately and treat it until it heals.
If the object inserted into the ear is one of the tumors that grow and swell, try to remove it using the method mentioned earlier. If it does not yield for removal, then take a fine, sharp scalpel of this shape.
Attempt to cut that type of tumor inserted in the ear with it, provided you are certain that the tumor has become softened by the moisture of the ear until it becomes like small fragments. Then remove them using a syringe or a soft probe.
As we have mentioned, it is easy to remove them. As for water that has entered the ear, one should not attempt to blow their nose forcefully with a reed first and then plug the ear with some cotton wool while lying on the affected side until the water comes out.
If not, take many small, smooth stones along the length of the fingers, warm them over a fire slightly, and insert one into the ear while standing on one leg on that side. Then strike it with another stone.
Continue doing this with stone after stone until all the water comes out. Water may also be removed by taking a reed or feather, inserting one end into the ear while holding the other end in fire until it burns, then replacing the feather.
Repeat this several times until all the water is removed or drawn out using a syringe as mentioned earlier. As for removing insects that have entered, if they are small like lice, treat them with what was mentioned in the previous section.
If the body of the creature is large and visible to the touch, try to remove it using a probe and tweezers. Its removal is easier than any other thing that may enter the ear. As for removing worms produced in the ear, if they are treated with what was mentioned in the previous section on earwax but no improvement is seen,
It is not necessary to look into the ear in the sun. If you see any worms, remove them using a probe or tweezers. If nothing appears, take a syringe of this shape.
Insert the narrow end of the syringe into the ear up to a point that it can tolerate, then strongly suck with it several times until all the worms come out. If they do not come out, seal around the syringe with wax as mentioned earlier.
If the mentioned [disease] is not expelled, then use the collyria that we have mentioned and which earlier practitioners have tested for killing worms. You will find this in the treatise on collyria. Use this instrument to drip melted fats and medications into the ear. This is its appearance:
It appears to be made of silver or brass, narrow at the bottom with a small hole and wide at the top. If you wish, you may line the interior pipe with tightly fitting brass, or alternatively, take a reed and wrap its tip tightly with cloth.
Then place the fat or serum or desired medication into the pipe while it is in the ear. Then insert the reed with its cloth from above and squeeze gently until you feel that the fat enters the auditory canal.
While the patient is lying down, ensure that what you drip into the ear has been warmed slightly in fire. Be careful that it is not too cold or too hot, as the ear cannot tolerate this.
Chapter Seven.
On the Treatment of Sudden Deafness.
Some children are born from their mothers' wombs with unperforated ear drums.
It may also happen to some people that there is a blockage in the auditory canal due to an injury or flesh growing therein. This blockage may be deep within the ear canal and invisible.
If it extends slightly out of the canal and is visible, then the one deep within the canal that is not visible is usually difficult to remove. However, if it is visible, do not expose the patient's ear to sunlight. If you look into the ear and see a visible obstruction, open it with a gentle probe like this:
The tip should be slightly blunted to prevent injury to the ear. If the obstruction is flesh that has grown in the canal, grasp it with a gentle forceps and carefully pull it out until all of the flesh is removed.
If the obstruction is deep within the ear canal, take a smooth, gentle hook, warm it slightly in fire, and insert it into the canal. If you feel the obstruction while the patient feels heaviness in their ear, gently pull on it.
Take care not to injure the ear's artery. Then, insert into the ear a wick of suitable size for the wound's width, dipped in Egyptian mercury ointment. Do this repeatedly until the wound heals, or use a wick moistened with water and sprinkled with ground natron.
Use it. If you find the ear has become inflamed and hot, do not remove the wick but replace it with another one dipped in rose-oil ointment until the inflammation subsides, then treat it until it heals.
If bleeding occurs, dip a sponge or cloth in cold water and place it on the ear. Then use the rest of the treatment mentioned in the chapter on cauterization.
Chapter Eight.
In treating warts appearing on the eyelids.
These warts appearing on the eyelids may be moist or dry. Do not grasp them with forceps or pincers and cut them off at their roots, then apply powdered natron to the spot.
If bleeding occurs, cauterize it with a hot copper coin and press it firmly after cutting. It often grows back if some root remains; burning the roots with fire prevents its recurrence.
Chapter Nine.
In treating sudden inflammation of the eye's eyelids.
It often happens that something resembling coldness and stiffness appears in the eyelids.
Therefore, it is called 'coldness' – a thick dampness gathered in the upper and lower eyelids. If the coldness is prominent on the surface of the eyelid and moves to all sides, it is easy to treat by making an incision across it.
Then carefully scrape it off from all sides until it is removed, grasp it with forceps and cut it. If cutting cannot be done immediately, wait until the eyelid heals after cutting, then treat it until it recovers.
If it is small, there is no harm in leaving it alone as the ointment will dissolve and heal it. If the coldness is inclined towards the inside of the eyelid, turn the eyelid over and grasp the coldness with forceps without making an incision, then cut it off from all sides.
If the eyelid is cut through, no harm will come of it; then wash the eye after cutting the bridle with salt water and treat the site with a dressing that promotes healing until the wound heals.
Chapter Ten
Regarding the treatment of hemorrhoids appearing on the eyelid.
Hemorrhoids are fat that appears in the upper layers of the eyelid, especially among young boys. They cause heaviness of the eyes and frequent illnesses during summer and make it difficult for them to look towards sunlight. So that tears may flow quickly
Therefore, they are always seen leaning on their faces and sleeping with their eyelids beneath the eyebrows wet, swollen and disfigured by prominent hemorrhoids. When you press the area with your fingers, you will feel the hemorrhoids between them. The procedure is for the patient to place his head in a sling.
Then take a linen cloth, prepare from it a wick and make from this wick a circle around the size of the hemorrhoid on all sides. Then place it on the hemorrhoid and press with your fingers from all sides to gather the hemorrhoid in the center of the circle.
Then cut through the center of this wetness with a sharp lancet horizontally, making sure not to make the cut larger than a fisted wound. As for depth, do not cut all the way through the skin until you reach the hemorrhoid.
In most cases, the hemorrhoid will protrude from the cut like a white fat piece. Gently pull it out using a cloth wrapped between your fingers while turning your hand left and right until it is completely removed. Be careful not to increase the cut lest the lancet slips into the eye and injures it.
If the hemorrhoid does not appear in the first cut, do not increase it much gently until the hemorrhoid appears. Then remove it as mentioned before. Next, dip a cloth in vinegar and water and place it on the site while pressing gently. Some people use crushed salt instead.
Then place it in the cut to dissolve any remaining moisture. Treat the area until it heals. If inflammation occurs, treat it with musk powder until it heals.
Chapter Eleven
On Kinds of Eye Diseases
If superfluous eyelashes grow on the eye out of their natural course under the natural lashes and stick together, they harm the eye and cause diseases such as continuous tearing, drooping of the eyelids, opacity, and thickness to the point that this can lead to blindness.
Eye diseases occur in four forms: either by cauterization with fire or by applying sharp medicine as mentioned earlier in the chapter on cauterization; or by cutting and suturing, or by cauterizing with caustic.
It is necessary to place the patient's head in your lap and then flip the eyelid with your left hand. If it doesn't flip over, insert a needle with thread from below the eyelid and exit upwards near the lashes, then pull the thread up while holding the eyelid.
Then flip it with a spatula, then cut inside the eyelid without touching the excess hair using curved scissors from the larger angle to the smaller one. Then tie the thread and place a small cotton pad or gauze under the eyelid, then mark the eyelid with ink.
Like the shape of an ash leaf, but it should be according to how much you want to raise the eyelid as people vary in this regard; some may require cutting off a suitable amount from the eyelid depending on how droopy it is.
Some may require less cutting depending on how droopy the eyelid is. Then cut along the two lines you've marked using scissors, starting from the larger angle to the smaller one, making sure each cut is close to the natural hair line, like the thickness of a spatula.
Then insert the probe into one of the skin corners, then dissect all of it. Then stitch up both edges using a thin wool thread and needle. Clean the blood and stick the remaining threads on the eyebrows with some adhesive substance.
If you wish to do this, otherwise it does not matter. Leave the stitches and threads for about three or four days, then remove them. If you prefer not to stitch it up, let the wound dry and scar on its own, as the eyelid will raise upon healing and closing. Stitching is better.
This aspect of disfigurement has been mentioned by the ancients, except that it causes harm to the patient and is not beneficial. There is another aspect of disfigurement which is that one should teach the eyelid to assume a shape like that of an oak leaf as we have described. Then lift the eyelid with three sutures, arranged separately or grouped together in this manner
Then trim the remaining excess eyelid with small scissors in this manner, cutting carefully
If you are unable to tie the sutures and are not proficient in doing so, then take a needle with thread and insert it into the center of the shape, then insert another thread near the larger opening and a third one near the smaller opening. Gently gather the threads between your fingers, then raise your hand gently lifting them
Raise the skin taught over it all as described, then join the edges of the wound with sutures and treat it until it heals. If there is a hot swelling at the time of cutting or splitting, calm that swelling with iodoform or similar soothing ointments.
It may also happen that the lower eyelid turns inward, in which case it is preferable not to use cutting, suturing, cauterization with fire or strong medication. These methods are more harmful to the patient than beneficial.
Cauterization with a hot iron should be done in this manner: invert the eyelid, make an incision on its inner side as described, then fashion two thin rods of iron or wood, their length equal to that of the eyelid and width less than that of a lancet.
The tips of these rods have been cut from both ends where the threads will be attached. Then gather them gently over the remaining part of the eyelid and pull them tightly from both sides, leaving them in this manner for a certain period of time until the skin dies, blackens, and decomposes.
Until it falls off by itself. If this takes too long, cut it with scissors and treat it until it heals. When the wound has healed, the eyelid will elevate and the eyelashes will not be injured. Here is a diagram showing how to make these rods, their length and width are as follows:
The Eleventh Chapter
On Removing Foreign Bodies from the Eye with a Needle
If it is one or two hairs, then take a fine needle and thread through it a thin, smooth silk thread; gather its ends and tie them with a very small knot, let the length of the thread be about a span.
Then insert another thin thread through the knot at its end, attach one of its ends to it, then place the eye close to a source of light; for this is a delicate operation. Then enter the needle with the thread into the base of the superfluous hair.
Push it through the eyelid swiftly until it comes out above the natural hair, then pull the thread upwards and insert that hair into the needle if there are one or two or three hairs no more.
Then pull your hand gently until the hair comes out with the needle from above the natural hair, if you only pulled the needle and the hair did not come out, then pull the needle downwards with the thread that was inserted into it until the needle comes out of its upper hole.
Then put the hair back into the needle and pull both gently until it rises up in its upper hole and becomes visible to the eye, then cut the thread and remove it; keep the eyelid closed for two or three days until the hair is secured in place and flesh grows on it.
If the hair is short, either add a long natural hair to it so that it can be pulled up with it, or leave it alone until it grows longer, then pull it up.
Chapter Thirteen
On Treating Spasms That Occur in the Upper Eyelid
Some people are afflicted with a spasm in the upper eyelid, called "ptosis"; this condition is either natural or acquired. The acquired kind results from injury, inflammation, ulceration, or similar causes.
The procedure is to cut open that adhesion, separate its edges, and insert between them a cotton thread; tie it until healed. Do not use drying or constricting substances in treating it.
If you do this, the constriction will worsen instead of improving. Instead, use relaxing agents like fenugreek seeds soaked in a paste of lentils and linseed oil mixed with Diacillin ointment and some olive oil. Apply this mixture to the bandage.
And its treatment is to strive by all means not to return it to its original state. The procedure mentioned earlier is a method of correcting the constriction, not restoring the site to its original condition.
Chapter Fourteen
In treating lower eyelid entropion
This type of entropion, which occurs at the lower eyelid and is truly called 'straphismus,' can be either congenital or acquired. The latter may result from an injury, incision, or inflammation.
The procedure involves taking a needle with a double thread and inserting it into the flesh, passing from the left to the right, until the thread emerges at both ends of the flesh. Then, pull the flesh upwards using the needle and cut it with wide scissors.
If the eyelid does not resume its normal shape, take a probe and place it on the site of the incision. Then, invert the eyelid and make two incisions on the inner side of the eyelid, with their ends meeting at the points of the previous cut, forming an angle. So that when joined together, it will resemble this shape:
Then, remove the excess flesh at its sharp lower edge near the eyelid. Next, sew the separated parts together using two silk sutures with cotton thread. Then treat it with the relaxing agents and bandages mentioned earlier until it heals.
If the entropion is due to a previous incision or stitch, it is necessary to make a simple incision without hair at the inner canthus as mentioned earlier. Then separate the eyelids using bandages as described.
In summary, the treatment of entropion, whether upper or lower, should be performed according to its appearance. Entropion can have varied presentations, and a skilled surgeon will find a way to manage it accordingly.
Until the shape returns to its natural form or approximates it, and the same disease indicates what is suitable for it from work and tools in most cases.
The Fifteenth Chapter
In the adhesion of the eyelid with the mucus or the cornea.
It may happen to many people that the upper eyelid adheres to the white of the eye, preventing its easy movement and hindering its natural functions. Therefore, one should insert a sharp-pointed probe beneath the eyelid.
And lift it upwards or extend it with a hook, then cut the adhesion with a pair of scissors that are not sharp-pointed to avoid hurting the patient during the procedure and damaging the eye with their sharpness. The cutting should be like peeling off the adhesion.
And ensure that once the eyelid has returned to its natural shape and the adhesion is completely healed, you should apply a saline solution to wash the eye or administer eye drops made from camphor diluted in water. Then separate the eyelid from the eye using a cotton wick.
And place a wet cloth soaked in egg white over the eye, and after three days use medicated tampons until it heals.
Chapter Sixteen
On Cutting the Foreskin and Circumcision
The foreskin has two types: either it is nerve-like, resembling a thin tough membrane like the peritoneum; or it is non-nervous and resembles hardened whitish mucus that sticks to the iron when touched and can be cut with scissors.
And a probe cannot be inserted into either type. Both types start from the larger opening and gradually extend until they cover the pupil, preventing light and eye movement. To cut it, place the patient's head in a clamp.
Then open his eyes, lift the eyelid with your hand, grasp the foreskin with a slightly curved forceps and pull it upwards. Take a needle and insert a horse or cow hair thread into it, then bend the needle tip slightly and pierce it into the middle of the foreskin.
She pierces it with a needle and ties it with a thread, pulling it upwards. She scrapes the side of the lid that is near the eye, as if she were unrolling it with the shuttle, until she reaches its end, then cuts off what remains at the root of the eyelid with fine scissors or small forceps, leaving the natural flesh of the eyelid intact.
Lest there be a constant flow of tears from its severed part, for she stretches the lid alone with the needle or with thread as mentioned before, then scrapes it smooth with a rounded forceps like this:
And she should be cautious not to touch the corner of the eye with the forceps and cause a wound that affects the eye. Then, after cutting, she places some powdered salt or zinc oxide in the eye and leaves it for a day before treating it as necessary until it heals.
If the eyelid is not nerveless and she cannot insert a needle into it or fasten a thread, then often this type of eyelid is treated with medication until it heals as described in its section. If you wish to cut it, open the patient's eye.
Take a fine, smooth forceps with a weak grasp like this: And scrape the eyelid gently with it from above, if it becomes loose and crumbles under scraping, then immediately pour some zinc oxide or red lead or powdered salt into the eye and leave it for a day.
Then proceed with the procedure until it is all gone, except if you encounter a hot tumor in the eye, leave it alone and treat the hot tumor until it heals, then resume the procedure until it heals. As for the skin of the eyelid.
If the eyelash causes severe harm to the eye, tie that eyelash with a thread and cut off some of it without excessive cutting lest there be constant flow of tears. Then pour red lead or zinc oxide into the wounds until they heal.
Chapter Seventeen
On the Cutting of Warts and Excess Flesh That Grows in the Eye.
Some people's eyes may develop red flesh that is layered until it covers the visible part or approaches or overflows onto the eyelids, and perhaps the eyelids are inverted like a pomegranate flower.
The procedure is to place the patient's head on a support, then open their eyes and remove all that red flesh with appropriate tweezers.
Or grasp it with a forceps or needleholders, then cut off the first flesh first until all of it disappears by cutting, taking care not to harm the eye during the procedure. The cutting can be done either with the scissors we described for removing the prolapse of the rectum, or with small scissors. As those used to remove polyps as shown in the illustration in the following chapter.
After the cutting is complete and all the flesh has been removed, fill the eye with ground salt or drop into it red rose water and other suitable medications. Then hold cotton soaked in egg white against the eye from the outside to prevent inflammation.
If some flesh remains, bleeding is excessive, and there is fear of inflammation, leave the eye alone and treat it with medications to alleviate inflammation. Then resume the procedure once the inflammation has subsided until the eye heals completely. Do likewise for any excess flesh that appears in the eye of this type.
However, it is not advisable to perform this procedure on a weak eye due to illness or to attempt it visually without first ensuring that the eye is suitable for such an operation.
Chapter Eighteen.
On Removing Polyps from the Eye.
If polyps are red veins that grow on the eye, preventing vision and weakening the eye over time. Therefore, first examine if the eye containing the polyp is strong and free from other diseases besides the polyp.
Then proceed with the removal, which involves commanding the patient to place their head on a support. Then grasp those veins with one or two tweezers, depending on your skill. The tweezers should be fine and curved like this:
Or use two tweezers attached together in one body like this:
Then, carefully grasp those veins with fine forceps gently and wipe away the blood occasionally until you see the eye; for then those veins will have gone from it and the bleeding will have stopped. Be careful not to harm the eye with the tips of the forceps. Let your work take half a day facing the sun.
And be steadfast in your work so that you do not cut anything but those veins. For when you are finished, then cauterize the eye with green or red ointment to eat away any remaining vessels. If you cannot complete it all at once, then dress the eye with what alleviates its pain.
Leave it for a while until its pain subsides and the inflammation is safe, then resume this procedure with the eye until it heals completely from this distressing appearance of the forceps.
Leave it [and the patient's head should be on a cushion with their tears dried and the eyelids separated so that the eye is exposed], for the essence of the procedure is to open the eye using tweezers or a triangle held by an assistant.
And the patient's head should be on a cushion with their tears dried and the eyelids separated so that the eye is exposed. You may start with grasping from above or below the eye, but it is better to grasp two vessels in the upper eyelid, one at the outer end and the other at the inner end.
Grasp them with the middle and index fingers, then insert forceps underneath them. Hold them between the thumb and index finger and gently pull your hand until all vessels become visible. Cut them from the smaller lower end using scissors or a fine knife if you wish.
Tie the eyelid away from its corner and expose all vessels until they rise on the orbit without cutting the tarsus, for tears and blood will cloud your vision.
Then cut with the scissors what is beyond the margin above and below until nothing remains except at the canthus, if possible lift it from the canthus with a hook for it is better, but sometimes it may not be easy in some people.
And if you cut it, let its edges rest for several days until the pain subsides and the inflammation is alleviated, then resume work on it.
Chapter Nineteenth
In restoring the reed to the nose.
Physicians call the reed "nasa", if treated with cautery or a strong burning medicine as mentioned earlier, and it does not heal, there is no cure except to cut into the boil at its maturity and extract all the moisture or pus that is in it.
Until the bone becomes visible. If the bone becomes visible and you see decay or darkness in it, scrape it with this tool shaped like this:
And it is called the "coarse-headed tool", made from Indian iron, with a round head like the letter 'z'. Engrave the words 'al-Mubarrad' or 'aesculapius' on its surface finely. Place it on the decayed part of the bone and rotate it between your fingers while slightly shaking your hand until you know that the decay has been removed.
Repeat this several times, then tighten the area with dry constricting drugs. If the wound heals and flesh grows on it, and the duration has passed without recurrence or inflammation occurring in it after forty days, then:
Know that it has healed. Otherwise, there is no remedy except to replace the reed into its original position in the nostril like this: expose the bone again with iron or strong medicine. When the bone becomes visible, take a hook of this shape:
The tip of the hook is triangular and its shaft is conical and pointed towards the tip, as you can see. Place it on the bone itself near the nose and keep your hand away from the eye a little, then rotate your hand with the hook until the bone breaks and the patient feels it.
So that the patient feels wind coming out of it when he holds his hand over his nose. Then, apply dry constricting drugs to the wound as mentioned earlier. If flesh grows and the area solidifies, then the matter that was escaping outward will return into the nostril, making it easier for the patient, if God wills.
Chapter Twenty
On restoring prolapsed eyeball.
If the eye prolapses completely and there is no defect in sight or loss of vision, make the patient comfortable. Then separate him from the crowd and place a pillow behind his head without any restriction, then gently pull down the eyelids with tweezers.
Then you place on the eye a poultice made of onion, resin, frankincense and musk. Then you hold the eye from above onto the bandage with many benefits. The recipe for the benefits is that you take soft flaxseed and fold each cloth into four folds to make many of them.
Then you place one on top of the other onto what the eye needs then you tie it with a strong cloth tightly and repeat the cupping without any condition. Then remove the cupping and leave the eye tied for a day and a night.
If the bandage loosens during this time, it should be tightened again. Then remove the bandage after a day and a night as mentioned before. If you see that the eye has returned to its original state, otherwise repeat the bandaging, poultice and tightening until it returns.
Chapter Twenty-One
On Cutting the Thread Vein.
If a vein in the layer of the eye protrudes and becomes visible through the eyelids like a grape, causing disfigurement to one's appearance, one should desire to cut it off. The procedure for this is as I will describe.
It is done by inserting a needle into the base of the vein from below upwards, then inserting another needle with a doubled thread from the side of the eye and pulling it through. Leave the first needle in place.
Then cut the site where the doubled thread was inserted and tie some of the vein around the needle tightly, then remove the needle. Place a piece of wool moistened with egg white on the eye until the threads fall off along with the vein. Then treat the eye with something that strengthens it.
Until the wound heals, the vein should be tied tightly from all sides with a piece of cloth to make the eye protrude more. Then use a fine probe to reach the bottom of the eye and drain the egg white moisture until it falls onto its original site and dries up. Then tie it tightly until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Two
On the Treatment of Epilepsy
This condition known as epilepsy is when water-like drops gather in the eye without any cause. The procedure for this is for the patient to sit on an upright chair, then take their head in your hands from both sides.
Move it until you see the drop reach your eye, then fix it and do not let it go; light will be released and the patient will see objects as they were before. If it does not reach the bottom of the eye, know that it is water. If it does not settle as described,
Alternatively, seat the patient before you, then take a fine lancet and pierce it slightly above the corneal conjunctiva where it touches the limbus until matter comes out.
If it comes out, wash the eye with warm water mixed with husk or hot water with barley and husk, then treat it with other remedies until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Three
We have mentioned the types of water in the previous sections and which one is suitable for irrigation with detailed explanation. So take it from there on health, then seat the patient facing you near a light source like sunlight.
And bind his sound eye and pull it strongly, then lift the eyelid of the affected eye with your left hand if it is the left eye or your right hand if it is the right eye.
Then place the tip of the cannula near the limbus with some force in the same direction as the white of the eye towards the inner canthus, then push the cannula strongly while rotating it until you feel that it has reached an empty space.
The cannula should penetrate to a depth equal to the distance from the sclera to the limbus of the eye. You can see the cannula through the cornea due to its clarity, then bring it up towards the location where the water is present.
Then press it down repeatedly. If water flows out immediately, the patient will see clearly and the cannula will remain in the eye. If water rises, push it back down without removing the cannula.
If it settles and does not rise, gently remove the cannula while twisting it slightly with your hand, then dissolve some pure salt in water and wash the inside of the eye with it. Then apply a compress or damp wool outside the eye.
The flesh is red and white, and a healthy eye is tied to it. However, we and the people of our time use ground cumin mixed with egg white instead. It is necessary to take the lancet called the Brid which has this shape:
Pierce only the skin of the inflamed area with it, do not probe deeply. Rather, lightly touch the opening with the scalpel and then insert the probe as mentioned earlier. Once you have completed your task, prepare a patient to lie down comfortably on his back in a dark room.
The patient should refrain from all movements and coughing, eat only soft foods that agree with his nature, not move his head to the right or left at all. The bandage should remain in place until the third day, then it should be removed in that dark room and his vision tested.
Show him objects, then replace the bandage until the seventh day. It is not permissible to do this during treatment or immediately after probing; rather, avoid it before water rises rapidly due to intense looking.
If there is a hot swelling, do not remove the bandage before the seventh day. Rather, treat it with something that reduces the swelling until it subsides, then uncover his eyes and place a veil over his face to gradually accustom him to light while he remains in the dark room.
He should gradually leave the room and resume his activities. Know that the probe cannot be dispensed with without repeated observation. I have heard from some Iraqis that they use a hollow probe in Iraq through which water is sucked.
I have not seen anyone in our land make this, nor have I read about it in any ancient books. Perhaps it is a recent innovation. Here are pictures of various probes for reference:
It is made of copper, particularly, and its tip should be like this with three equal points.
Chapter Twenty-Four.
On the treatment of flesh growing in the nose.
There may grow in the nose different kinds of excess flesh, some resembling many-legged scorpions, others being hard and dark-colored cancerous growths, and still others being soft and not dark-colored.
If the flesh is neither tender nor cancerous, the patient should sit facing you towards the sun. Open their nostril and insert the probe into that flesh. Then pull it outwards and cut what was reached with a sharp, fine knife from one side only.
Know that all the flesh has been removed if there remains any part which you are unable to cut. Then scrape it gently with one of the gentle instruments until nothing remains. If blood gushes forth or a hot swelling appears, leave it.
Treat it as you would a malignant tumor. Quickly cauterize until bleeding stops and all flesh is destroyed. Then insert into the nostril water or liquid after cutting, ensuring the nostril opens and moisture reaches the throat.
Know that it is healed if moisture reaches as it should. If not, know that there remains hard flesh near the hollowed bones which the instrument could not reach. Then take a coarse cotton thread.
And tie many knots on it, keeping each knot about a finger's length or less. The patient should gently insert one end of the thread into their nostril using tweezers until it reaches the nasopharynx.
And bring out one end at the mouth and tie both ends together. Many children do this in schools, as it is easy for anyone who wishes to do so.
Then use the knots on the thread to scrape the flesh until you know that it has been cut by the knots. Then remove the thread and leave a wick soaked in Egyptian wax ointment in the nostril for three days or more.
Until the ointment consumes all remaining flesh, then insert a piece of lead tubing into the nostril until healed. If further treatment is needed to dry it out, use that method.
This is an illustration of the dropper used for instilling medicines into the nostrils:
A small open funnel made of silver or copper, like a lamp with an opening for its wick and channel.
If you wish, make the tube closed like a pipe and spread the linseed oil flat.
It has a handle at its end, as you see, to hold it when heating oil or whatever liquid or solid substance you wish.
Chapter Twenty-Five.
In the cases of warts on the tip of the nose.
It often happens that a wart grows at the tip of the nose, becoming large and inflamed over time until it becomes unsightly.
Therefore, it is advisable to cut it off at its first appearance and excise all of it, then apply either cautery or the burning medication that acts as cautery. If cutting off was delayed until it became large, observe if it is hard, solid, and dark-colored with little sensitivity.
Do not apply the iron cautery to it, for it is a cancerous tumor, and I have often seen this tumor cut off only for great ulceration to remain on the patient. But if the tumor is soft to touch, not dark-colored, cutting it off is possible in all cases. So discharge the patient and cut off [the wart] without hesitation or delay, then treat the site with something that dries and contracts until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Six.
On Sewing the Nose, Lip, and Ear. If detachment occurs from a wound or something similar, know that in such cases, the chances of successful repair are slim except for some people.
It is advisable that when any of these cases appears, observe if the wound is fresh with blood. If so, sew up the wound and treat it until it heals. But if detachment has occurred and both edges are dry and each part is sound, then scrape off all parts with a thick skin layer until they bleed.
Then sew up the edges and pull them together, sprinkle with fine linen and powdered wax, apply a bandage of healing plaster over it, and leave it tied for two or three days before removing it.
And change the dressing and leave it until the threads fall off by themselves, then treat it with plaster until healed. The stitching method for joining detached edges is either with needles as described in abdominal suturing, or with thread as explained there.
The Twenty-Seventh Chapter.
In the extraction of warts that appear on the lips.
It often happens to many people that small, hard tumors resembling currants appear inside their cheeks; some are smaller and others larger. Therefore, you should turn the cheek and cut around each tumor, then attach it with forceps.
And cut around them on all sides, then fill the wound with powdered zinc until bleeding stops. Then rinse with vinegar and salt, and treat the wounds with a compress until they heal.
The Twenty-Eighth Chapter.
On cutting excess flesh from the gums.
Often, excess flesh grows on the gums, which ancient physicians called 'apollis.' You should attach it with forceps or grasp it with tweezers and cut it at its base. Then let the time flow or the bleeding stop, then place powdered zinc on the wound.
Or one of the dry, tight bandages. If that flesh returns again after treatment, cut it off again and cauterize it, for it will not return afterward.
The Twenty-Ninth Chapter.
On scraping teeth with iron.
It often happens that rough, ugly scales accumulate on the surfaces of teeth both inside and outside between the gums. These can become blackened, yellowed, or greened to such an extent that decay reaches the gums and disfigures the teeth.
Therefore, have the patient sit before you with his head in your lap. Scrape off the tartar and scales from the tooth that appears rough like sand until nothing remains. Do the same for blackness, greenness, yellowness, and other impurities until it is clean.
If the first scraping does not remove all impurities, repeat it on another day and a third time until you achieve your goal. Know that molar teeth require different shapes of scrapers according to what is needed for your work.
For the scraper used to scrape inside a molar tooth is not the same as that used for outside, and one used for between molars has another shape. Have all these different shapes of scrapers ready at hand:
Chapter Thirty
On Tooth Extraction.
It is preferable to treat the tooth from its pain with all possible means and delay extraction as it has no substitute behind if extracted, for it is a noble organ; therefore, extraction should be resorted to only when unavoidable.
If the patient decides on extraction, make sure that you are able to clearly see and identify the painful tooth. Frequently, the patient may be mistaken about the source of pain and think that it is in a tooth other than the actual cause. They may have a healthy tooth extracted without relief from symptoms, as we have seen many barbers perform this error repeatedly.
Once you have correctly identified the painful tooth, you should then circumcise around it with a sharp knife, cutting through the gums on all sides until you can loosen and move the tooth slightly with your fingers or gentle forceps.
Then, firmly grasp the tooth with large forceps and stabilize the patient's head between your knees. Gently pull the tooth straight out without breaking it; if it does not come out easily, use one of the instruments to gently push it from different sides until it loosens and can be extracted.
However, if the tooth is decayed or root canal treated, it is necessary to pack the cavity with a gauze and plug it securely using a thin, rounded end of a probe before grasping it with forceps. Additionally, make sure to circumcise around the gums again on all sides afterwards.
Be cautious not to break the tooth while extracting, as this would leave a part of it in the patient's mouth, causing more trouble than the original pain. Avoid performing extraction recklessly like unskilled barbers who act hastily without following these instructions.
Many disasters happen due to the negligence of untrained practitioners, the most common being breaking the tooth and leaving some or all of its roots inside the patient's mouth. Some may also extract along with part of the jawbone, or cause bleeding after extraction. If bleeding occurs, apply pressure to the area and crush some gum tragacanth to pack into the wound.
If not, then cauterize it if the remedy does not help. The first kind of forceps should have long legs and a short handle to prevent bending while gripping the tooth.
The handle should be thick so that it does not slip from your grasp or bend. It should be made of Indian iron or steel, with well-smithied jaws that fit closely together for a firm grip.
The legs can also be made like an awl to make it strong and steadfast.
Chapter One Hundred And Thirty-Three.
In extracting the roots of teeth and removing broken jawbones.
If, when extracting a tooth, its root breaks off, you should place a wick of cotton soaked in butter on the spot for one or two days until it relaxes, then insert the forceps. This kind resembles the beak of a bird called the pelargus. This is its shape:
If it does not work for you to remove it with these forceps, then you should carve out the root and expose all the flesh using a scalpel, then insert this tool resembling a small lever. This is its shape:
Short and thick, but not hollow to prevent it from breaking. If the root comes out with this, otherwise use these other tools whose shape is like this, the first of which is three-pronged with some thickness:
Another pleasing three-pronged shape:
We can also use this two-tined instrument whose shape is like this:
And other tools and drills mentioned in the inventory of teeth, we can also use this instrument resembling a large awl whose shape is like this:
Three-pronged and curved with some thickness to prevent breaking, not hollow. Know that there are many kinds of tooth tools, as well as other tools, which cannot be numbered. A skillful craftsman may invent his own tools according to the requirements of the work and diseases themselves.
Since some diseases do not have specific tools mentioned by earlier authors due to their variety, if a jawbone or one of the bones in the face breaks or becomes infected, search for an appropriate tool among those mentioned above for extracting roots.
We rely on two figures like this:
Some thickness should be added to keep the bone in place so it does not slip out, and the location should be treated with appropriate medications. If there is a small amount of putrefaction, remove its foulness and darkness until it is cleaned, then treat it until it heals.
Chapter Thirty-Two.
On the removal of impacted teeth.
If a tooth has grown not in its natural course, it has ruined the figure, especially if this happens to women or children. It should not be left unattended if the tooth has erupted from behind another tooth.
And if it cannot be extracted nor pushed back, remove it. If it is attached to another tooth, cut it with this tool that looks like this:
This tool resembles a small beak, made of sharp Indian iron. Make many cuts over several days to break the hardness of the tooth without disturbing other teeth. But if it is protruding and movable, push it back using this tool that looks like this:
It is made entirely of iron, with a very thin edge like that of a needle made by this tool. Warm the tooth gently for many days without disturbing it until it falls out, then remove its roots using a forceps.
If a tooth has broken off some of its part causing pain to the tongue while speaking, it should also be polished until its roughness is gone and becomes smooth so that it does not hurt the tongue or interfere with speech.
Chapter Thirty-Three.
On binding loose teeth with silver or gold threads.
If the front teeth are loose due to an injury or fall and cause difficulty in chewing food without falling out, even after treatment with tightening medications.
The solution is to bind them with a silver or gold thread, with gold being preferred as silver tarnishes and decays over time. The thread should be of medium thickness, neither too thin nor too thick to fit between the teeth.
It is an image of intertwining that you take the thread and insert its twist between the two sound teeth, then sew with one end of the thread between the loose teeth until you reach the sewing to the sound tooth from the other side.
Then you repeat the sewing to the side where you started from and pull gently with wisdom so that it does not move at all, and your pulling of the thread should be at the roots of the teeth lest it slip away, then you cut off the excess ends of the thread with scissors and gather them together and twist them with tweezers and hide them between the sound tooth and the loose one.
Lest the tongue be harmed, then you leave it like this tied until it lasts. If it loosens or its tension breaks, tighten it with another thread thus forever. And this is an image of the teeth and their configuration in intertwining between two sound teeth and two loose ones as you see:
And the single tooth or both may return to their place after falling and intertwine as described and remain. Indeed, this is done by a skilled craftsman, and he may carve bone from cow bones to make a shape like the tooth and place it in the spot where the tooth went missing. And he pulls it as we said, so that it remains and enjoys it,
Chapter Forty-three.
In cutting the frenum that appears under the tongue preventing speech.
This frenum that appears under the tongue may be either natural, with which man is born, or accidental from a wound that has healed.
The procedure is that you open the patient's mouth and his head in your lap and raise his tongue, then cut this frenum crosswise until the tongue is released from its hold. If there is some stiffness and complexity and it was due to the healing of a wound, make an incision with a scalpel crosswise until the frenum is severed and the ties are dissolved.
And beware that the incision is not too deep lest you cut a vein there causing bleeding. Then rinse with rosewater or vinegar and cold water after the cutting, then place under the tongue a wick of cotton held by the patient every night.
To prevent it adhering again, if bleeding occurs, apply powdered gum arabic to the spot. If blood prevails, cauterize the place with a glass cup suitable for that purpose. Then treat him with all available remedies until he recovers.
Chapter Thirty-Five
On expelling the tongue-eating louse.
Sometimes under the tongue, there appears a tumor resembling a small toad that prevents the tongue from its natural function and may even fill up the mouth. To treat this, open the patient's mouth towards the sun and look at the tumor.
If it appears reddish or black and hard, not causing the patient pain, then do not treat it for it is cancer. But if it tends towards whiteness with moisture, pierce it with a probe and cut it gently with a fine scalpel on all sides.
If bleeding overtakes you during the procedure, apply powdered gum arabic until the bleeding stops, then resume your work until it is completely removed. Then rinse with vinegar and salt.
Then treat him with all appropriate remedies until he recovers.
Chapter Thirty-Six
On treating tonsillar swelling.
And any tumors that grow in the throat, including those similar to the tonsils that appear inside the throat, if treated with the methods mentioned earlier but do not heal
If the tumor is hard, dark red and not painful, do not treat it with iron. If it is red and its origin is thick, also do not treat it with iron for fear of bleeding. Leave it until it ripens, then either bursting spontaneously or incise it.
If it is white, rounded and its origin is thin, this is what should be cut. First look before operating to see if the heat of the tumor has completely subsided or somewhat decreased.
Then seat the patient facing the sun with his head in your lap, open his mouth and hold a spatula between your hands like this shape:
Make a spatula from silver or copper, thin like a blade. Use it to press down the tongue and locate the tumor. Then take a probe and insert it into the tonsil, gently pulling it out as much as possible without tearing any tissues.
Then she is cut with this instrument, whose shape resembles scissors but whose ends are bent inward so that each of its two sharp blades lies close to the other. This instrument should be made from Indian iron or Damascus steel.
If this instrument is not available, then cut it with these scissors whose shape is like this:
Sharp on one side and blunt on the other, so that after cutting one gland, cut the other in exactly the same manner. Then, after cutting, rinse the wound with cold water or vinegar and water.
If bleeding occurs, rinse with water in which pomegranate peels or fig leaves have been soaked until the bleeding stops. Then treat it until it heals. Sometimes other tumors may grow in the throat besides the tonsils; cut these as mentioned for cutting the tonsils.
A woman was treated for a tumor that had grown inside her throat, pressing on the soft palate and almost blocking the throat. She could barely breathe through a narrow passage and it prevented her from eating or drinking.
She was close to death and would not have lasted another day or two. The tumor had grown until two projections emerged from her nostrils, so she acted quickly and inserted a hook into one of them and pulled it out, removing a satisfactory piece.
Then she cut where it was reached from the nostril, and did the same with what protruded from the other nostril. She opened her mouth, held down her tongue, inserted the hook into the tumor itself, and cut off some of it; only a little blood flowed.
The woman's throat cleared immediately, and she began to drink water right away. She also started eating and gained strength gradually. We continued to cut off parts of the tumor for a long time, but it kept growing back in place of what was removed.
She burned the tumor inside her throat with cauterization, which stopped its growth. Then she traveled away from that place and I do not know what happened to her afterward.
Chapter Thirty-Seven.
On Cutting a Tumor on the Tongue
If it is called a uvula when it droops down to the throat and swells, being white and rectangular, it is called an 'axis.' But if it is thick at the bottom and round, it is called a 'uvula.' When treated according to what was mentioned in the division [of diseases], yet the treatment did not succeed.
I saw that the hot tumor had subsided and was thin, so it should not be cut. If it was gathered together, round but without length; if it was bloody or blackish in color or insensitive to touch, then it should be cut.
So, in this case, the patient should sit facing the sun and press his tongue with the instrument mentioned earlier. Then insert the needle into the uvula.
Pull it down and cut it with one of the instruments mentioned earlier for cutting tonsils. Do not cut more than necessary, as excessive cutting will harm speech.
After cutting, use the treatment mentioned for tonsillectomy until it heals. If the patient is hesitant to cut it, do not use any trick without caution; the only way is with a sharp medicine: put the patient's head in a sack.
Then press the tongue with the instrument mentioned earlier. Take some of the sharp water mentioned in the chapter on cauterization, mix it with uncooked flour to make a paste neither too thick nor too thin, and fill this instrument which looks like this:
The tip of the instrument for applying the medicine is like a spoon's cavity. Place it on the uvula with the patient lying on his side so that saliva does not flow back into his throat.
Hold the medicine in your hand and squeeze it onto the uvula for half an hour until it appears blackened and the burning sensation subsides. If you wish, dip a cotton swab in the medicine and apply it with a spoon.
Insert the spoon with the cotton swab into a tube from above until the cotton adheres to the uvula. Repeat this process until you achieve the desired cauterization. Leave it for three or four days, after which it will dry and fall off. If more medicine is needed, prepare it again.
After cauterization, wipe around the navel with a linen soaked in oil and dab around it to remove any medication, then rinse with cold water. Treat externally with bandages and internally with irrigation until it heals; this method is safer than cutting and far from frightening.
The tongue may also be treated gently without cauterization or cutting. It is treated with incense prepared in this manner: take equal amounts of fennel, saffron, savory, sage, chicory, and other similar herbs, grind them together into a powder, then mix it with vinegar and use for fumigation.
And heat the vessel over a gentle fire, using bellows to fan the flame. The cover of the pot should have a hole in its center onto which is placed the condensing tube made of silver or brass:.
Insert the end of the tube containing the burning charcoal into the patient's mouth such that the steam reaches the tongue through the tube until it becomes moistened, then repeat this process several times until the tumor subsides; but beware of applying this treatment at the very onset of the tumor.
For this method often increases the swelling; it is preferable to use it when the hot tumor has subsided. If you do not have this apparatus, take a reed and insert its end into the mouth, covering it with an eggshell at the tip to prevent burning of the patient's mouth.
Because the eggshell prevents the steam from burning the mouth; this is a good and safe method.
Chapter Eighty-Three
On expelling splinters and other foreign bodies lodged in the throat.
It often happens that a bone, fish spine or other object becomes lodged in the throat; one should remove what is visible by pressing the tongue down with an instrument held towards the sun.
Then examine the throat to see what is hidden there. If you cannot see it, do not make the patient vomit before his food has digested in his stomach, for the lodged object may be expelled by vomiting or the patient may swallow a piece of cloth or a stem of leek.
Or the patient may swallow a dry piece of bread or a piece of soft sea sponge tied to a thread, which he should then swallow; once it reaches the point of the spine, quickly pull out the string, repeating this several times.
Frequently the splinter becomes embedded or the bone comes out; if it does not come out as mentioned, then use an iron tool of this shape:
This tool should be slightly thicker than a straw and have a hook at its end, which the patient inserts gently into their throat while tilting their head back to avoid touching the windpipe and causing coughing. The doctor may also insert it with his hand,
Having the patient insert it is preferable, as they know better where the affected area is located. They can push it down or pull it up gently according to what feels comfortable until the splinter comes out,
Chapter Thirty-Nine
On removing a bone or splinter stuck in the throat.
If treating with medications as mentioned earlier does not help, then look into the patient's throat at sunrise after depressing their tongue with the instrument described above.
If you see the splinter, then extract it with a small forceps or gentle tweezers. If you cannot grasp it, then take a hollow tube and insert it into the patient's throat near the splinter. Then insert a red-hot iron into the tube.
Repeat this several times, with the patient enduring thirst throughout the day. Then give them a mouthwash of cold water without swallowing any of it, and move the water around in their mouth occasionally with their hand.
If the splinter does not come out, fumigate the throat with bull's urine or camphor using the instrument described earlier. Repeat this several times until it falls out.
The procedure for fumigation with incense involves taking a small amount of burning embers in a covered container with a hole in its center. Insert the tip of the instrument through this hole, then place the incense and cover the patient's mouth with one end of the tube to ensure that no smoke escapes until they feel the incense reaching their throat.
If the splinter does not fall out, repeat the fumigation several times while the patient endures thirst and consumes salt and garlic but avoids drinking water. It must come out this way. Here is an image of an instrument used to extract the splinter from the throat if it can be seen:
This is similar to a crab's claws, as you see, except that it has this curved end that enters the throat and its tips resemble a bird's beak; when it grips something, it does not let it go.
And another instrument with which the tongue is pressed down, it being a wide iron ring fitting the mouth above the tongue; when placed in the mouth standing on its side, the mouth remains open unwillingly and the patient cannot remove it at all until it is taken away.
Description of the instrument used to open the mouth precisely in this manner.
Chapter Forty.
In it, he speaks about speaking concerning (the nature of) tumors and their dissection.
The types of tumors are many and varied, as mentioned one by one in this book. They differ from each other with regard to two aspects: the nature of the tumor itself and what it contains of fluids.
The second type differs according to the locations where they occur in the body, for a tumor occurring in the head is not like one occurring in the buttocks, and a tumor occurring in a fleshy part is not like one occurring in a joint; each has its own ruling regarding treatment.
Among tumors, some should not be dissected until the pus in them has ripened and become complete. Others should be dissected while they are still fresh and have not fully ripened, such as those that occur near joints.
Because if a tumor occurs near a joint and its duration is prolonged until it becomes corrupt around it, it may spoil the ligaments or nerves of that joint, causing lameness in that limb. Or the tumor may be near an important organ.
For if you delay dissecting it until it ripens, that would harm the important organ nearby, or if it is near the buttocks, then it should be dissected while still fresh and unripe. However, a tumor that is near the buttocks must be dissected even if it is not completely ripe, so that the depths do not become putrid and penetrate into the intestines, causing perforation.
It is preferable to know the appropriate time for dissecting tumors that have fully ripened, which is when the tumor is at rest and free of pain, fever has subsided, redness and swelling around it have decreased, and the head of the tumor has become soft.
It is necessary to tie off the artery at a lower point from the tumor, if possible, so that it may be easier for the blood to flow downwards or at the thinnest part of the tumor and most prominent vein. Let the artery run along the length of the body if the tumors are near the hands or feet.
And in smooth places where there is no bend, the muscles, tendons, nerves and blood vessels are located. In places that bend, follow the artery accordingly. If the tumor is in fatty places, it is better to leave the artery alone.
Until the abscess is completely dried out, as we have mentioned. If you tie off its artery beforehand, copious amounts of pus will flow from it, causing much harm and filth, and perhaps its lips will become hard or its opening narrow. Some tumors may be tied off across the body when necessary or according to what the organ requires.
It is necessary to use a single tie for small tumors, and a wide tie or many incisions according to the size of large tumors. Some tumors may require excising the skin and cutting if it has become like rags.
And sometimes the skin may die, as seen in many books and manuscripts. Some tumors require an incision with three angles, while others are cut like the shape of an oak leaf or a scrotal tumor.
And some tumors require a round or crescent-shaped incision and similar ones. For tumors that have no head, like flat smooth tumors, it is necessary to tie off with a simple tie only. If the tumor is very large and has collected much matter, do not tie off suddenly so that all the pus does not come out at once.
Instead, remove some of it first, then tie off the tumor for another day, and remove some pus again. Repeat this process gradually until all of it is removed.
Especially if the patient is weak, pregnant, a child or an elderly person, for the vital spirit often dissipates with the sudden release of pus, and the patient may die while you are unaware. Therefore, be very cautious in this matter.
After removing these tumors, it is necessary to cleanse the wound and examine it. If the tumor's incision is small or if there is only one simple fissure, then use bandaging made from cotton or linen. However, if the tumor is large and the abdomen has many wounds.
It is necessary to insert a wick into every fissure until they reach each other. If some of the skin or flesh of the tumor has been cut off, it should be stuffed with dry cotton wool or linen bandage and tightened for three days.
Then remove it and treat it with the appropriate ointment until it heals. If bleeding occurs during your work, use cold water and vinegar soaked in a linen cloth and apply it to the site of the bleeding repeatedly.
If the bleeding persists, then you should use the procedures and treatments and dressings that we have described in many places throughout this book and its divisions. If it is wintertime and the site of the tumor has many veins, then warm honey and oil should be applied.
Apply it to the site, but if it is summertime and the places are fleshy, then you should bring the poultice soaked in cold water and oil or vinegar and oil, all of which should be cold until on the third day as we said earlier, you should remove the tumor and cleanse it.
And use in its treatment something similar until it heals. This is all you need to know about the general treatment of tumors, and regarding the detailed method we have mentioned for each tumor how it should be treated concisely.

There appear on the scalp small tumors which are of the type known as 'salves' and are enclosed in sacs, having various shapes like that of a chicken egg. There are many types of these, some fatty and others containing moisture resembling mud.
And some contain moisture like dropsy or soup, and others are hard and solid. None of these pose any danger when incised and removed unless a vein is encountered during the incision.
To operate on it, first probe it with the tool that comes next, called the 'Al-Midas', until you know what is inside. If it contains fluid, then make an incision along its length as shown here.
Begin the incision from point ~b~ to point ~g~. Once the fluid is drained, remove and discard the entire pouch that contained it. Leave nothing behind, for remnants often recur.
Soak a bandage in powdered myrrh if available, or salt water. Fill the wound and leave it overnight to dissolve any remaining pouch. Repeat with the bandage twice more if necessary.
Until you ensure that no pouch remains, then treat the wound with myrrh until it heals. If the tumor contains fatty tissue, incise as shown here:
Make a cross-incision and release the adhesions on both sides of the wound. Remove it entirely from all directions, exerting effort to extract the omentum that contains it. If an artery obstructs you, perform as described later. Also, do this if the tumor is adherent to the incision.
And this is the treatment for what was mentioned. Incising a adherent tumor is easier as it has less blood and fluid. Some head tumors may have no fluid at all, as in the case of:
An old woman's head tumor. I found it like hard stone, rough and white. It could not be broken despite trying to crush it. Other acute head tumors are different, such as those found in children's heads.
If at the root of the ears, incise all of them simply and make their bottoms slanted to facilitate discharge of matter downwards. Then treat them according to what is suitable.
Chapter Forty-two.
In incisions on pigs, these tumors often appear in the neck, armpits, and groins. They can also appear elsewhere on the body, singly or in multiples, sometimes merging with one another.
Every pig, whether it is among the liver or tumors of the head as we have described, has its own unique sac. There are many types of these pigs, some hard and others containing fluids, while still others are harmful and do not respond to treatment.
I have seen some with a good condition upon touch, appearing close in color to skin, moving towards all sides without being attached by nerve or vein nor artery nor deeply embedded. It is necessary to cut it with a simple incision from top to bottom of the body in this manner from line ~g~ to line ~b~.
And peel it off from all sides, stretching the skin with forceps or two or many if needed as we described for tumors of the head. Remove it little by little without cutting any vein or nerve, using a not-too-sharp scalpel.
Lest your hand slip and cause unnecessary cutting or disturb the patient, if you cut a vein or artery, preventing you from proceeding, then apply powdered tragacanth or some cauterizing material to stop the bleeding.
Tie the wound and leave it until the inflammation of the tumor subsides, the wound settles and begins to heal. When bleeding stops, return to your work until finished. Then examine with your index finger if there are any remaining small pigs; remove them and clean them out.
If there is a large vein at the root of the pig, do not cut it from its origin but tie it with a double tight thread and leave it until it falls off naturally without harm. Then fill the wound with boiled cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment and treat it.
But if all the pigs are cut, then bring together the edges of the wound and sew it immediately after ensuring that no fragment remains. If you find that a bone fragment is left behind
Then seek to cut its origin and base using sutures and cauterization as mentioned earlier. As for pigs containing fluids, tie them off with a simple ligature at the point of maturity appearing above, making the ligature below as we have said.
Then, after the bone, use the Egyptian ointment and similar ones to eat away what remains of the corruption until you see that the wound has healed. Then treat it with ointments suitable for flesh until it heals completely.
Chapter Forty-Three
In cutting the throat due to a swelling occurring inside the throat
The ancients mentioned this incision in the throat but I have not seen anyone in our land perform it, and this is their opinion. However, those with suffocation should avoid cutting the throat as they do not benefit from it.
In order for all the veins and lungs to be clear, but those with a hot swelling in the mouth or throat or tonsils, if there is no cause in the trachea, it is necessary to perform the throat incision to escape the harm that comes from suffocation.
If we want to do that, we should cut the throat below three or four circles of the trachea, making a narrow incision like the one in the peritoneum and not in the cartilage at this spot.
Because it is devoid of flesh and its blood vessels are distant, if the surgeon is hesitant, he should extend the skin of the neck with a probe then cut the skin until he reaches the trachea avoiding the blood vessels if he sees any.
Then cut the peritoneum we described, and identify the trachea by the mucus coming out of it along with what bubbles up and the loss of voice. Leave the wound open for some time until the time when suffocation was feared has passed. Then bring together the edges of the wound from the skin.
Then cut it alone without the cartilage, and then use medications that promote flesh growth until it heals. The author of this book said: "This passage we quoted means only if they see the patient's throat blocked by one of these swellings mentioned.
When the patient is near death and feels suffocation, they resort to cutting the throat so that the patient can breathe on the wound spot some breaths and be saved from death. They were commanded to leave the wound open until the course of the disease passes, which takes three days or more.
Then they ordered him to stitch the wound and treat it until it healed. I myself witnessed a servant taking my sword and stabbing his throat, severing some of the windpipe. He was brought to me for treatment, but he expired like a slaughtered animal. So I opened the wound.
I found the blood issuing from the wound slowly, so I knew it was not an artery or vein that had been severed. Wind was escaping from the wound, so I cleansed it and sutured it, treating it until it healed. Nothing else happened to the servant except a slight hoarseness of voice.
And after some days she returned to her former state, hence we say that cutting the throat is not dangerous.
Chapter Forty-Four.
Regarding the incision made on the tumor that appears externally in the neck, which is called the 'goiter of the neck.'
This tumor called the 'goiter of the neck' is a large tumor the color of the skin, and it is common among women. It has two types:
Either it is natural or acquired. As for the natural one, there is no remedy for it, but the acquired one has two types: one resembles fat tissue, and the other resembles a tumor caused by an obstruction of the artery. In its incision, there is danger: It is not permissible to operate on it with iron unless it is small, provided that it has been examined and probed with the probe to find that it resembles fat tissue and is not attached to any vessels. Then it should be incised like fatty tumors. And extract it along with its contents if it is in a sac; otherwise, remove all of it and treat the site as necessary.
Chapter Forty-Five.
Regarding Incision on Types of Tumors:
Tumors are many in kind, and all their types have been mentioned in the division. Here we must explain the difference between a tumor (salwa) and an abscess (khuraj), for it is confusing. I say that an abscess is accompanied by heat, fever, and intense pain until the swelling subsides. The ulceration is completed, and thus the fever and inflammation cease. The condition does not come with heat or fever nor pain, and it contains a peritoneal pouch that is peculiar to it, matching the color of the body. Its beginning resembles measles but becomes like a boil, sometimes larger, sometimes smaller.
There are two types of this condition: fatty or containing moisture. If there is moisture, its colors are many as mentioned in the previous sections. When treating an ulceration, it is necessary to probe and examine it first using the tool called the 'al-Midas', as shown in the following chapter.
Measure the size of the tumor, then remove the 'al-Midas' and observe what comes out. If moist discharge of any color appears, make a simple incision as mentioned for other tumors. But if no moisture appears upon removing the 'al-Midas', know that it is fatty.
Make a cross-shaped incision on the ulceration as I have shown you. Suspend it with forceps, gently tear the skin from all sides, and if possible, preserve the pouch along with the ulceration.
If the pouch tears during the procedure and cannot be removed intact, cut it out piece by piece until none remains. Otherwise, if any part is left behind, the ulceration will likely recur.
If you are unable to remove all of it, cauterize the wound with some sharp caustic material upon completion. Suture the wound and apply something cold to reduce inflammation. Treat it with other remedies until it heals. If the ulceration is large, sew its edges together using adhesive materials.
If bleeding occurs, either profuse or otherwise, quickly cauterize the area with powdered pitch. Leave it for two to three days until the wound becomes inflamed and bleeding stops, then proceed to remove any remaining ulceration.
Chapter Forty-Six.
In Images of Instruments.
The tools used for incision and dissection include different types of 'al-Midas', each with varying sizes: large, medium, and small.
A large spoon.
A medium spoon.
A small spoon.
The first type is made of strong iron and has sharp corners to easily enter tumors. These probes are called 'al-bard' and come in three sizes: large, medium, and small.
A medium-sized probe.
A small probe.
It is used to search for tumors, wounds, and cavities and remove any bones or other materials within them. It is made smooth and round like a spindle from copper (sinny), brass (espadra), copper, iron, or silver, with the best ones being made of brass.
Lead probes can also be made for exploring winding cavities that are difficult to navigate with other probes. They come in three sizes: long, medium, and short.
A large lead probe is used for deep cavities with wide openings.
A medium-sized lead probe.
A small lead probe.
The various types of clamps are numerous. They include simple ones with one mouth, which come in three sizes: large, medium, and small. There are also blind clamps, again in three sizes, and double-mouthed clamps, also available in three sizes. Additionally, there are curved clamps with two mouths. A large simple clamp. A medium simple clamp. A small simple clamp.
A large blind clamp. A medium blind clamp.
A small blind clamp.
A large double-mouthed clamp. A medium double-mouthed clamp. A small double-mouthed clamp.
A large triple-mouthed clamp.
A medium triple-mouthed clamp. A small triple-mouthed clamp.
A large knife for cutting and scraping tumors and abscesses.
A medium-sized knife.
Image of a small scalpel.
Its blade is limited while the other end is unlimited. This design allows for careful dissection without cutting nerves or vessels, thereby reducing the patient's discomfort during tumor removal.
And these are the probes, of which there are three types: large, medium, and small. Image of a large probe:
It is made of half-polished copper, and at one end it resembles a wide spoon with two layers, having a hidden scalpel-like blade inside similar to a bird's tongue that can be moved inwards and outwards as desired.
And these are the small forceps used between the fingers when extracting tumors, of which there are three types: large, medium, and small. Image of a large forceps
And these are the ligatures used to tie off bleeding vessels, of which there are three types: large, medium, and small. Image of a large ligature
Made of copper or brass, slightly curved in length as shown. They should be flexible and you should have both large and small sizes to quickly tie off bleeding vessels when necessary, without needing medication.
But these are not used for tying off bleeding vessels in all parts of the body, rather they are used in fleshy places such as the thigh muscle, calf muscle, arm muscle, chest, abdomen, and groin, etc.
And others can be made like this, small instruments resembling pistachio shells:
Used for tying off bleeding when blood flows from a cautery wound or when cutting vessels. They can also be made curved like this:
Chapter Seventy-Four
On the Treatment of Male Breast Disease
Some men at the time of puberty develop breasts resembling those of women, which are unsightly and offensive. To prevent this, an incision should be made on the breast in a helical manner as shown.
From line ~b~ to line ~j~ Then excise all the fat, then fill the wound with the fatty ointment, then join the edges of the wound by suturing and treat it until it heals. If the breast droops downward and relaxes on its bone as it appears in women.
It is necessary to make two incisions in its upper corners resembling a crescent shape, each one connected to the other at their ends such that the larger line encircles the smaller like this:. From line ~b~ to line ~j~, then strip the skin that lies between the incisions and remove the fat, and use suturing and bandages as mentioned earlier and whatever else is needed in treatment until it heals.
If the desired piece cannot be excised due to anxiety of the patient or because of bleeding, it is necessary to pack the wound with cotton soaked in boiling pitch and leave it until it consumes the remaining fat, then treat it until it heals.
Chapter Eighty-Four
In the armpits of tumors that appear
These tumors that appear under the armpit are of the type called solid pigs. Some contain fluid, and if one contains fluid, it is not necessary to make a crescent-shaped incision like this:.
From line ~b~ to line ~j~. If all the contents of the tumor have been discharged, pack it with boiling cotton and leave it until the next day, then remove the cotton.
Then treat it with the appropriate ointment until it heals. If the tumor is of the type called pig knots, incise it as mentioned earlier in the incision for pigs, whether or not the wound extends to release pus, then use cautery as previously described.
Chapter Forty-Nine
In incising a tumor that appears due to an artery or vein, known as an aneurysm.
If the artery is injured and the skin above it is torn off, a tumor often appears from this. Similarly, an aneurysm may also appear in veins.
The signs by which it is known whether a tumor and swelling are from an artery or a vein: if the tumor is from an artery, it will be rectangular and congested towards the depth of the body; and if you press the tumor with your finger, you will feel as if it has a creaking sound.
If it is from a vein, the tumor will be round and protruding on the surface of the body; operating on these tumors is dangerous, especially those in the armpit, groin, neck, and many other parts of the body. It is advisable not to neglect their treatment with iron.
And those in the extremities or head should also not be neglected; if it is a pulsating swelling of an artery, make a longitudinal incision on the skin over it with a scalpel, then open the wound with scissors and free the artery from its surrounding tissues.
Until it is fully exposed, then insert a needle underneath it and pass it to the other side. Tie the artery with a doubled thread at two points as shown in the illustration of the arteries in the ears, then cut with scissors at the point between the ligatures until all blood flows out.
The tumor will dissolve and then use the treatment that produces pus until the slough falls off, then treat it with appropriate ointments until it heals.
If the tumor is from a lacerated vein, grasp as much of it with the skin as possible in your hand, then insert a needle underneath this point and pass it through with a doubled thread until it exits on the other side. Then tie it securely with the thread as described for tying a grape, tying both ends of the thread. If you fear that the threads may slip, insert another needle with another thread under the entire tumor at the point where the first needle crosses.
Pull the threads at four points, then cut open the tumor in the middle until its contents come out. Cut off a piece of skin and leave the rest tied up, then apply a dressing soaked in wine and oil. Then use treatment with poultices and ointments until it heals,
Chapter Fifty
On the tumor that appears due to nerve torsion.
Similarly, a tumor may appear in the artery or vein due to injury or excessive fatigue; however, this is more common in the elbows and knees.
In every joint where movement occurs, it is a movable tumor resembling the color of other body parts and is usually painless. However, when pressed firmly, the patient may feel numbness similar to that caused by pressure. This type of tumor does not collect deep within the body.
Rather, it is under the skin and moves in all directions except towards the front or back. Therefore, tumors present in joints should not be treated with cautery as this may cause scarring. Tumors on the head or forehead are an exception.
Incise the skin with a scalpel. If the tumor is small, grasp it with forceps and cut it off at its origin. If it is large, tie it off with thread and then excise it. Sew up the wound and treat it until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-One
On the amputation of umbilical hernias.
Many people may develop umbilical hernias, also known as congenital hernias, which resemble mushrooms due to their thin stalk and thick head. Some of these hernias are small while others can become quite large.
I have seen a man with two hernias in his abdomen, each resembling mushrooms. They had thin, white bases that had ulcerated and were constantly wet with moisture. I removed them, and one weighed about eighteen ounces while the other weighed about six.
To operate on them, examine the patient. If they are moist and have a white, wet appearance with thin bases, cut them off using a wide scalpel. Have cautery ready nearby as much bleeding may occur during removal.
If bleeding is profuse, cauterize the wound. If the patient is frightened by the use of cautery, take a strong lead thread and tie it around the hernia with such force that it begins to strangulate. Leave it for two days, then tighten the thread further until it completely cuts off blood supply to the hernia.
Whenever a mole is affected until it breaks off and falls off by itself without any pain, if the mole has a thick origin, there may be some fear and hesitation in cutting it off, especially those located in the abdomen. However, it can still be cut halfway or partially.
Then cauterize it so that it does not return, then treat it until the wound heals. Beware of attempting to cut a mole that is dark-colored, insensitive, and appears swollen as it is a cancerous tumor. We will mention more about cancer later on.
Chapter Fifty-Two
In treating anal fistulas.
Anal fistulas have many causes, either from a tear in the peritoneum on the abdomen that protrudes through it, or from the intestines as seen in other fistulas, or from blood flowing from a vein or artery as mentioned earlier, or from wind that becomes trapped within.
If it is due to a tear in the peritoneum with the protrusion of the hernia, then the color of the tumor will resemble that of the skin and will be soft without pain. It will appear different depending on its position. And if it is due to the intestines protruding, its position will differ greatly from what has been described. If you press on it with your fingers, it disappears but then reappears. It may also make a gurgling sound and become more prominent during exertion or bathing. If it is caused by moisture, it will feel soft.
If it is caused by blood, the tumor will appear dark in color along with these signs. If it is due to flesh that has grown out of place, the tumor will be firm and solid and will remain at a constant size.
If it is caused by wind, it will feel soft to the touch. If the anal fistula is due to blood from an artery or vein, or wind, you should not hesitate to treat it, for there is fear and hesitation in this matter as I have told you earlier in the chapter that mentions tumors caused by arteries and veins.
If the anal fistula is due to the intestines or a hernia, you should order the patient to stand upright with their legs apart and then mark around the entire fistula with ink. Then command him to lie on his back before you, then make a wide incision around the tumor with a scalpel at the point marked with ink, then insert a large probe into the center of the tumor upwards, then bind the site of the incision tightly with a strong silk thread.
Then tie the ligature in a knot, then open the center of the taut tumor above the ligament and insert your index finger inside it, and seek out the bowel. If you find that the bowel has been taken by the ligament, loosen the knot and push the bowel back into the abdomen. But if you find a diverticulum, dilate it with a probe.
Then cut off its stalk, but if you encounter an artery or vein, ligate it neatly and return to your task. Then take two needles and insert into them two strong threads, and insert the needles into the incision made around the tumor in a crosswise manner, having passed through them. Then pull the tumor at four points with the needles.
If you wish, remove the needles and leave the site until the adherent flesh rots and falls off by itself, or cut it off if it has softened and rotted. Then treat it with appropriate ointments until it heals, if the tumor is a fibroid attached to flesh.
Or if it is from moisture, then cauterize the tumor as mentioned and remove any blood or moisture found therein, then treat it with what heals the site.
Chapter Fifty-Three.
On the Treatment of Cancer.
We have mentioned in the section on types of cancer and how they can be treated with medications, and the warning against treating them with iron lest they become ulcerated. We have also mentioned cancer occurring in the uterus and the warning against its treatment.
The ancients mentioned that when cancer is in a location where it can be completely excised, such as in the breast or thigh and similar organs that are suitable for its complete removal, especially if it is small and newly developed, then it should be approached. But if it is large and has spread, then it should not be touched.
To the extent that you are able to cure one person from it, and I have not seen anyone before me who has reached this goal. The procedure for it when it is suitable as mentioned is to advance cautiously and remove the black matter several times, then dissect it if it is in the vessels filled with blood.
Then the patient is seated in a chair that allows him to work, then he receives in his tumor the curettes suitable for it, then scrape from every side with the skin upon thorough examination so that nothing of its origin remains, and let the blood flow without cutting quickly.
Squeeze the places and draw out all thick blood with your hand or whatever tools you have at your disposal. If profuse bleeding occurs during the procedure due to cutting an artery or vein, ligate the vessel until bleeding stops, then treat it with other remedies until it heals.
Chapter Forty-Five
In treating burns.
He informed us in the division about the types of edema, how they occur with water and signs of each type and their treatment with drugs. The one treated with iron is only the serous type, and he does not approach the tuberosity type nor the fleshly type at all with iron.
If this type of burn (serous) has not improved with medication, look for other causes: whether the patient is extremely weak or has another disease besides the burn.
If the patient has coughing or diarrhea, etc., do not treat him with iron, as it is deceptive. If you find the patient to be strong and free from other diseases besides the burn, and he is neither a child nor an old man, make him stand upright before you. And have someone behind him squeeze his abdomen with their hands, pushing the water down towards the pubic area. Then take a pointed instrument of this shape:
Long and pointed at both ends like a scalpel, but with a slight bend to prevent harming the intestines during use. Then insert it if the burn is near the intestines.
It is not permissible to make the incision more than three fingers' breadth below the nipple, nor above the pubic area. If the burn is caused by a liver disease, make the incision on the left side of the nipple by three fingers' breadth; if it is caused by a spleen disease, make the incision on the right side by three fingers' breadth.
It is not advisable also for the cut to be on the side that the patient wants to lie down on lest waste flows towards that weak place, then the skin is entirely pierced with the tool and the tool is inserted into that cut and your hand is raised.
With the scalpel between the skin and the peritoneum as if you are scraping it, and the amount scraped should be the size of a fingernail or similar, then pierce the peritoneum until the scalpel reaches an empty place which is the watery cavity (abdominal cavity), then withdraw it and insert into the hole the tool that looks like this.
And it resembles a thin tube made of silver, copper or polished smooth brass with two small holes on one side and one hole on the other side as you see.
And its tip is placed like this, resembling a pen's nib in this manner:
At its upper end there is a ring, for when the tool reaches the water (abdominal cavity), it will flow down onto the tool, so discharge some of the water at an average pace because if you discharge more than necessary at that time, the patient might die from loss of consciousness.
Or it may cause him to faint, close to death, but discharge according to his strength and the condition of the patient, indicated by the strength of his pulse and the color of his face, then remove the tool and collect the water as it accumulates from that moment.
Due to the skin that holds the hole on the peritoneum which I told you to stitch up in that manner, then reuse the tool another day if you see the patient improving.
And also discharge a small amount of water from time to time while you are at the patient's neck, and be careful not to leave too much water remaining, because if you fear for the patient and leave a large amount of water, treat it by burying it in hot sand.
And excessive sweating in the bathhouse and sun, keep him thirsty and treat him with dried drugs until he recovers, cauterize his stomach, liver, and spleen after removing the water as described earlier.
Chapter Fifty-Five
In treating children born with unperforated or constricted urinary passage, or with the opening in an abnormal location.
Some boys are born from their mother's womb and belly button unperforated; it is necessary to pierce its opening immediately upon birth.
With a very fine lancet of this shape:
Then place a thin lead pin in the hole and tie it, keeping it there for three or four days. When the child wants to urinate, remove the pin and then replace it again, lest the passage that urine follows closes up if the lead is not used.
As for those whose opening is narrow, they are treated with lead as mentioned above for many days until it widens. And among them are those whose opening is in an abnormal location, such as at the end of the navel, preventing them from urinating towards the front upon birth.
Until he can lift his penis with his hand upwards, so that the urine does not flow directly downwards but instead follows a curved path, which is highly desirable. The method for this is to have the patient lie on their back.
Then, using your left hand, pull the abdomen firmly and straighten the glans penis with a sharp knife or lancet like a large pen point, so that it resembles a navel with a hole in the center as intended.
Be cautious during this procedure to avoid bleeding, as it often occurs. If bleeding happens, stop it immediately and treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-Six
On bubbles appearing in the foreskin, navel, scrotum, and their union and adhesion to one another.
These bubbles often appear in the glans penis, which is swollen and inflamed. They may be non-painful or painful. Non-painful ones should be attached to a fine forceps.
And cut it off until completely cleaned, then apply a lint soaked in Egyptian balm. Afterwards, treat it with lung ointment until healed. But if the bubbles are painful and dark-colored, then cauterize it after cutting and scraping.
If the abscess is within the scrotum of an uncircumcised man, some of it being inside and some outside the scrotum, then you should remove the one that's inside first, until it heals; afterwards, treat the one from the outside.
For if you treat them both at once, the scrotum may be perforated. Blackness and corruption may also appear in the testicles and the scrotum itself. Therefore, all that has turned black should be cauterized before it causes harm or becomes corrupted.
Then apply honey mixed with ground pomegranate peels and myrobalan along with the dough. Then treat it with other remedies until it heals. If bleeding occurs, use a hot iron shaped like a crescent moon in this manner:
If the wound becomes corrupted, you should not insert a lead tube into the urethra for urination. As for adhesion of the scrotum to the penis,
This adhesion occurs only in those whose scrotum is healthy and has not been circumcised. It may result from a wound or tumor. Therefore, use a curved lancet to dissect it until the bond dissolves and the penis becomes free on all sides.
If distinguishing between them is difficult, then cut a small piece from both the penis and scrotum. The scrotum being thin may tear quickly due to its thinness. Then separate the scrotum from the penis using a thin linen cloth moistened in cold water so that it does not stick together.
Then treat with an astringent drink until it heals.
Chapter Seventy-Five
On the purification of boys and treatment of what afflicts them.
Circumcision is merely a separation of connection like other surgeries, except that it is done intentionally and is especially used on boys. Therefore, we must outline the best method for it.
The easiest way leading to safety is what I say: The ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books because it was not practiced among them; rather, it is something we have adopted.
By experiment, I found that the majority of craftsmen and surgeons use cautery with a hot iron or scissors, and they use bandages and sutures made from thread or cut with fingernails. I have tested all these methods.
I found no better method than cautery with scissors and suturing with thread, for cauterizing with a hot iron often harms the skin because the skin has two layers, so one may cut the upper layer while leaving the lower layer intact.
Thus, one must cut again causing renewed pain. Cauterizing with a file does not ensure cutting the tip of the glans because it may enter its hole. Using fingernails might tear the skin and ruin your work, especially if the skin is thin.
Many are born thus and do not require cautery. I have seen this. As for cauterizing with scissors and suturing with thread, experience has shown me its superiority because the upper blade is equal to the lower blade in cutting.
So when you press both blades of the scissors together evenly and at once, the thread becomes like a wall surrounding the glans skin on all sides without any error. Initially, it may seem difficult.
Especially since it may seem to someone with little understanding that you are merely tying a thread around the glans and leaving it until the next day, then removing it and sewing it up however you can. Then, he stands before you with his body upright.
And he should not be seated, and the scissors should be hidden in your sleeve or underfoot so that the boy does not see them at all nor any other instruments. Then, insert your hand into the glans and inflate it by blowing air into it until the head of the penis emerges.
Then clean the area of any dirt, tie it with a double thread at the designated location, then tie another stitch below it. Take hold of the lower stitch firmly between your thumb and index finger, and cut between the two stitches. Then lift the skin upwards quickly and extract the glans penis. Allow some blood to flow, as this is beneficial and reduces inflammation of the glans. Then wipe it with a wet cloth and sprinkle on it powdered burnt mallow seeds or fine barley flour; these are the best remedies tried or found effective.
Then lift the skin upwards quickly and extract the glans penis. Allow some blood to flow, as this is beneficial and reduces inflammation of the glans. Then wipe it with a wet cloth and sprinkle on it powdered burnt mallow seeds or fine barley flour; these are the best remedies tried or found effective. Then apply it from above in a cloth folded around a boiled egg crushed with rose water and mixed with fresh fragrant rose oil, leaving it on overnight before treating it with other remedies until healed.
This is the shape of the scissors suitable for cleansing:
The scissors should be sharp and even, with a smooth screw mechanism; the length of both blades should equal that of the handles. Otherwise, when cutting, one might accidentally turn over all or some of the inner skin, so before cutting, gently pull it back using your fingers to prevent swelling at the site.
Cut it evenly. If you cannot hold it with your fingers, grasp it with tweezers and cut it. If three days pass and the area under the glans remains swollen and warm, leave it alone until the inflammation subsides, then peel it off gently.
Cut it as desired, but be careful not to cut into the glans penis; if some of the glans is accidentally removed, this does no harm. Treat it with the ointments for wounds mentioned in the chapter on ointments.
If too much skin is removed and it retracts upwards, this is not harmful; treat it with the remedies mentioned until healed.
Chapter Eighty-Five
On treating retained urine in the bladder.
Retained urine in the bladder occurs due to obstruction by a stone, blood clot, pus, or growth of flesh etc. When treated with the remedies mentioned in their respective sections,
and the urine does not flow, and you find that its retention is due to a stone lodged in the neck of the bladder, make the patient kneel down facing the ground, then have another person mount his back, pulling his abdomen backwards. The patient should hold himself steady as much as possible.
He must then compress the bladder's neck to push the stone backward, allowing urine to flow. If this does not succeed as mentioned, and the patient's condition worsens, it is advisable to use an instrument called a catheter.
It is made of silver, smooth and thin like a bird feather quill, slightly bent, about one and a half spans long. It has a gentle funnel at its head; take a doubled thread, tie it securely to the tip with cotton or wool.
Insert the thread's tip into the catheter, trim any excess cotton with scissors to fit tightly like a cork. Then grease the catheter with oil, soap foam, or egg white and have the patient sit on a chair.
The patient empties their bladder using warm water or oil, then insert the catheter gently into the urethra until it reaches the bladder neck. Bend the catheter upwards towards the scrotum, then advance it inside.
Once the urethra is bent, push the catheter further until it reaches near the bladder. Lower the penis and insert the catheter into the bladder; you'll feel it enter an empty space.
This is done because the urinary passage has a bend. Then pull the thread with cotton gently to draw urine towards it, remove the catheter and let urine flow freely.
Continue doing this until the bladder is emptied and the patient feels relief.

The instruments suitable for this purpose are made of silver or ivory, hollowed with a long, thin tube for fluids and drugs to pass through. This instrument is called the 'syringe' and looks like this:
It is made of silver or ivory, hollowed with a long, gently sloping tube on one side, closed at the tip except for three holes: two on one side and one on the other.
The hollow place where the syringe is, it should fit its width without excess so that when something is drawn with it, it draws it, and when something is pushed with it, it pushes it away just like a siphon used to throw oil in naval warfare.
If you wish to expel fluids from the bladder, insert the tip of the syringe into the fluid and draw with the pump upwards; the fluid will be drawn into the hollow of the syringe, then its tip will be inserted into the urethra as described in the catheters, then push out the fluid with the pump.
Then that fluid reaches the bladder immediately so that the patient feels it; and this is also an image of a fine syringe for injecting into the bladder
It is made of silver or bronze, its upper end resembles a small funnel, and there is a groove beneath it to hold the cord. Take a camel's bladder, put inside it the fluid you wish to inject into the bladder, then tie it tightly between the grooves with a double thread.
Heat this fluid slightly over fire, then insert the tip of the syringe into the urethra, and press your hand on the bladder with the fluid until the patient feels that the fluid has reached the bladder.
If you do not have a bladder, take a piece of linen, make it into a circle and pierce it on all sides, then insert a thin thread through that hole as it rotates, then gather the circle like a sieve after placing in it whatever fluid or ointment or water you wish.
Then tie it to the apparatus and use it as you would with a bladder, pressing your hand on it until the fluid reaches the bladder.
Chapter Sixty.
On the removal of stones.
We have mentioned in the classification types of stones and their treatment with medicines, and we have mentioned the difference between stones formed in the kidneys and those formed in the bladder, and their symptoms, all of that, and we have mentioned stones that are operated on by hand or by incision.
And this is a specific stone formed in the bladder, and especially those that lodge in the urethra, I have described it clearly and concisely.
I say that the stone produced in the bladder is mostly seen in children and one of its signs is that urine exits the bladder like water in its smoothness.
Sand appears in it and it irritates his penis and agitates him, and often it hangs down then spreads; the anus protrudes with it in many cases. It is easy for children to expel it until they reach fourteen years of age; it is difficult for the elderly; but young men have a moderate case between those two.
When stones are large, their treatment is easier; but when they are small, it is the opposite. When we begin treatment, we must first administer an enema to remove all waste from the patient's intestines, for it may hinder the detection of the stone.
Then the patient is taken by his legs, shaken and moved downwards to cause the stone to fall into the neck of the bladder or he jumps from a high place several times then sits in front of you with his hands under his thighs so that the bladder becomes entirely inclined downwards; then examine him.
Feel for it externally; if you feel the stone in its cavity, hasten at that moment to cut upon it. If it does not fall out immediately, do not wipe the index finger of your left hand with oil if the patient is a boy, or wipe the middle finger.
If the boy is intact, insert your finger into his anus and search for the stone until you find it under your finger; then move it slightly towards the neck of the bladder and press upon it with your finger and push it out towards the place where you intend to make the incision.
Order a servant to press the bladder with his hand and order another servant to extend his right hand upwards with forceps and with his other hand extend the skin below the forceps towards the place where the incision will be made; then take the sharp bistoury which has this shape:
Make the incision between the anus and scrotum, not in the middle but towards the left side of the scrotum; make the incision directly on the stone and your finger should be in the anus pressing it outwards so that the external part of the incision is wide and the internal part is narrow enough for the stone to pass through.
Indeed, perhaps you pressed the finger that is in the bladder to expel the stone through the aperture, and know that there are stones which have corners and edges making their exit difficult.
And from them are smooth ones like hazelnuts and rounded ones, their exit is easy, but those that have corners and edges may cause some difficulty in the aperture. If it does not come out this way, then it should be left alone until it can be grasped with a firm forceps, its tip being like an ice tong.
Hold onto the stone so that it does not escape, or else insert a delicate instrument with a wrapped tip underneath it. If you are unable to do so, then widen the aperture slightly. If some blood troubles you, cauterize it with gum.
If there are more than one, first expel the largest towards the mouth of the bladder and then incise upon it. Then expel the smaller ones similarly if they are more than two. But if they are very large, it is ignorance to make a great incision upon them because that exposes the patient to two harms.
Either he will die, or it will cause him perpetual urinary discharge because the place will not adhere. But try to push it until it comes out, or manipulate it with forceps to break it into pieces and remove them.
When you have finished your work, wash the wound with honey and wax, apply pressure and sew it up. Then pour onto it a cloth soaked in olive oil and wine or rose oil and cold water to cool the inflammation. Let the patient lie on his back, do not untie the bandage until the third day.
If the bandage is untied, wash the place with much water and oil. Then treat it with the 'Nakhla' plaster and the 'Basiliquon' plaster until it heals. If there appears an excessive heat and swelling in the wound, such as when blood freezes in the bladder preventing urine from passing out, and this is known by the exit of blood with urine.
Then insert your finger into the wound and remove that blood, for if it remains it will cause corruption and inflammation of the bladder. Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt, and treat each type according to its similar remedy until it heals.
It is necessary, during all periods of treatment, to bind the thighs together so as to secure the medication placed on the site. If the stone is small and has entered the urethra and adhered therein causing retention of urine, treat it with what I shall describe before it reaches the neck.
Often this treatment has been used instead of lithotomy. It involves taking a sharp iron probe with this appearance:
Like a triangle with sharp corners inserted into a rod, then take a thread and tie it to the penis below the stone so that it does not return to the bladder, then carefully insert the iron probe into the urethra until the probe reaches the stone itself.
And turn the probe with your hand against the stone a little at a time until it pierces through to the other side, then urine will immediately flow. Then press your hand on what remains of the stone outside the penis; it will crumble and exit with the urine, and the patient will recover.
However, if this treatment proves difficult due to some obstacle, then tie a thread below the stone and another above it, then make an incision on the penis between the two ties at the level of the stone, and remove it.
Then untie the tie and clean the congealed blood from the wound. It was necessary to tie the thread below the stone so that it does not return to the bladder, and the other above it so that when the thread is released after removing the stone, the skin will return to its place and cover the wound.
So when you tie the upper thread, pull the skin upwards so that it returns to its place once you are done and covers the wound as mentioned earlier.
Chapter 61.
On Extracting Stones from Women.
Stones rarely occur in women. If one of them has a stone, its treatment is difficult due to many reasons, including that the woman may be a virgin, or she may not permit herself to the doctor.
Another reason is that you may not find a woman skilled in this procedure, especially when it comes to manual work. A fourth reason is that the location of the incision on the stone in women is far from the stone itself, requiring an additional deep incision.
In this case, there is danger. If necessity requires it, one should seek a skilled female physician, though few exist. Her absence, one should look for an experienced and kind male physician or a skilled midwife knowledgeable in women's matters or a woman skilled in this art.
Bring her and instruct her to perform all that she is commanded to do, first examining the stone. She should observe whether the woman is a virgin; if so, she should not insert her finger into the vulva nor feel for the stone.
Then, command her to cut on her. If she is not a virgin but is a widow, order the midwife to insert her finger into the woman's vulva and feel for the stone after placing her left hand on the bladder and squeezing it well.
If she finds it, she should draw it out from the mouth of the bladder downwards as far as she can until it reaches the root of the thigh. Then she should cut on her opposite the middle of the vulva at the root of the thigh, whichever side is available, and feel for the stone in that area.
And her finger should not leave the stone, pressing down on it continuously. The cut should be small at first, then insert the probe into that small cut. If she feels the stone, increase the cut according to how much you know the stone can pass through, for there are many types of stones.
Among them are small and large, round and oval, smooth and rough, long and short, with or without a notch. Know their kinds so that you may be guided thereby. If bleeding troubles you, sprinkle powdered mastic in the place and hold it for a while until the bleeding stops, then return to your work.
Until the stone comes out. Work with yourself counting the instruments mentioned for removing stones in men, so that you may assist yourself in your work. If bleeding troubles you and you know it is from a severed artery, apply pressure using the forceps on the spot.
Tie it with forceps firmly and steadily, then leave it without returning to it or removing the stone, lest the woman dies. Then treat the wound. When the severity of the bleeding subsides after some days and the place becomes dry, return to your work until the stone comes out.
Chapter Two and Sixty
In the fissure over the water duct.
The water duct is nothing but the accumulation of moisture in the white membrane that lies beneath the skin surrounding the testicles, known as the scrotum. It may have a special membrane prepared by nature on one side of the testicle.
It may be thought to be another testicle, and it is found between the skin of the scrotum and the white membrane that we have mentioned. This happens rarely, and this duct is produced from weakness which exposes the spermatic vessels, causing this material to adhere to it, often due to a blow on the spermatic cord.
This moisture comes in many colors; it may be yellowish, reddish blood, blackish mucus, or whitish water. The most common is the latter. These are the signs by which it is recognized.
Where water accumulates, if it is in the white membrane mentioned earlier, the tumor appears round and slightly elongated like an egg shape, and the testicle does not appear as the moisture surrounds it on all sides.
But if the moisture is in a special membrane of its own, then the tumor appears round on one side of the testicle.
Therefore, a man may think that it is another testicle. But if the moisture is between the skin of the scrotum and the white membrane, it is palpable. To determine the color of the moisture, squeeze the tumor with the square forceps whose image you have seen earlier; whatever comes out indicates its nature.
When we proceed to treat with iron (surgery), it is preferable not to order the patient to bleed himself if possible, and especially if his body is full. Then he should lie down on his back on a slightly elevated surface, and many cloths should be placed underneath him. You should then sit at his left side.
And order a servant to sit at his right side, extending the patient's penis towards one side of the scrotal skin and towards the lower abdomen. Then take a wide scalpel and make an incision along the middle of the scrotal skin towards close to the pubic hair.
The incision should be made straight, parallel to the line that divides the skin of the scrotum in two until it reaches the white testis. The latter should then be freed from its covering while taking care not to cut into it; preferably do this on the side attached to the abdomen and strip according to what you can manage.
Then spread the water-filled tunic widely and remove all of its fluid. Then separate the edges of the incision with forceps and elevate the tunic upwards without touching the skin covering the testis, cutting the tunic as much as possible either entirely or in pieces.
Especially its thin side, for if you do not strip it entirely, water will return. If the testis emerges from its skin during your work, once you have finished cutting the tunic, replace it and join the edges of the scrotal skin with sutures.
Then treat it like other wounds until it heals. But if the testis is injured by another disease, do not tie its blood vessels in the spermatic cord for fear of bleeding; rather cut off the testis from the cord and remove it; then treat as mentioned above.
If water has collected on both sides, know that they are inflamed. Make an incision on the other side as you did on the first one, if possible doing it all at once; then wipe away the blood.
Insert into the incisions wool which has been soaked in oil or rose fat, then from outside place another wool soaked in a mixture of honey and oil on the testes and abdomen, followed by a folded bandage; this is the dressing. And tie it above with a bandage having six ends like this:
Then take two bandages, sew them together and pad them with loose wool like this. Make the ends from cotton or wet wool and gather them around the waist with a belt; one end should reach up to the back.
And the second takes towards the pubis, with two ends on the thighs from below and the other two on the groins, all gathered together by a belt around the waist; this dressing can also be made of plaster instead of iron cuts.
He takes a fine metal spatula, with it he incises the skin of the heel which is tough as we have described until the white fascia containing water is exposed. Then take another spatula in this shape.
Then he presses it upon that fascia until all the moisture is expelled, then he stretches the fascia with forceps and scrapes off its outer layer with the spatula, cutting it away as much as possible without injuring the egg.
Know that this method is safer, farther from bleeding and better than cutting. If you encounter any resistance in the incision or inflammation at the time of cautery or if there is heat, swelling, bleeding or any other condition, treat it accordingly as mentioned before.
But if the patient is faint-hearted and cannot endure this procedure due to its unpleasantness, then use cupping as I have described, if it suits him according to the signs mentioned before.
The water is fluid, so make the patient sit on a high chair. Then press beneath the swelling with a wide-mouthed syringe and apply cupping along the length of the body, with the opening being wide enough for all the water to flow out. Then place a piece of cotton on the spot and tie it.
Leave him to absorb the remaining water, then treat him until the wound heals. If the water does not flow out during cupping, it is because the white membrane blocks the mouth of the wound and prevents the water from flowing out.
Then insert into the wound a swan feather or the instrument used to extract water from love apples, whose picture has been shown previously, or widen the opening of the wound slightly.
Know that water may return and accumulate after six months or so. If it does, treat him in the same way, and let him observe his days (of abstention from intercourse).
Chapter 63
On Incising the Fatty Swelling and Its Treatment.
Know that incising this swelling is one of the gravest operations that often leads to death, therefore we see that it should be left alone and avoided. I mention its procedure and types of swellings here.
I say that many tumors occur in bodies from which the testicles are composed, and this is due to many causes either from excessive heat that settles in the testicles or from injury. The color of the tumor is like the color of the body and it does not have moisture.
The tumor may be hard and perhaps it is calcified, its color like that of mud but there is no sensation in it. It may also be due to the complexity and swelling of the vessels as mentioned earlier or from the swelling of the veins, which can be distinguished by the disappearance of the tumor.
If it is pressed with fingers and does not disappear, then there should be no bleeding. However, the type that is due to the swelling of veins does not disappear when pressed with fingers. This kind can easily spread to other tissues.
It is necessary to cut the skin of the scrotum, then bring out the testicle upwards and remove it from the white abdominal membrane, freeing it from its vessels. Then tie the vessels and cut off the testicle, especially if it has adhered to those neighboring tissues.
It is not necessary to remove and cut the testicle, but if there is any adhesion between it and some of the membranes or vessels, all of that adhesion should be freed and cut off in a round manner.
If there is flesh growth at the site of adhesion which is behind, then all of it should be cut and the testicle removed as mentioned earlier. After your work is done, wash the wound with warm water mixed with rose oil and wine, then treat it with other remedies until it heals.
Chapter Forty-Four.
On treating tumors accompanied by inflammation.
Daliya is a tumor with some twisting, resembling a bunch of grapes. It causes relaxation of the testicles and difficulty in movement, walking, and exercise. The treatment for this condition is close to what has been mentioned earlier.
But it is necessary to mention the procedure in this case as done by the ancients. I say that the patient should sit on a high chair, then push the testicle downwards and hold the skin of the scrotum with the vessels that are close to the penis.
A servant other than yours takes hold of it and stretches it strongly, then cuts with a wide, sharp lancet a curved incision along the vessels until they are exposed. Then, on all sides as you were told regarding the sloughing of veins in the armpits, he peels it away; finally, he inserts into it an embroidery needle with double thread.
Then she ties it first at the initial locations where the string was placed, and also at its end, before cutting through it vertically along the length of the body to remove the accumulated corrupt, foul fluid.
And treat the wound with the treatment of other wounds in which you wish to create a delay so that one of the twin vessels falls away; there is no harm in that. But if the string has been placed around all the vessels, it is not permissible to remove one of the twins along with the vessels lest you starve the egg. Before cutting the vessels so that they wilt and are of no benefit.
Chapter Fifty-Five.
In treating aneurysms.
The occurrence of this aneurysm results from an incision that appears on the extended peritoneum over the abdomen in the region of the kidneys, causing the gut to herniate into one of the twins.
This hernia is either due to a tear or an extension of the peritoneum, and these two types occur from many causes such as blows, falls, coughs, lifting heavy objects, etc. If it is due to an extension of the peritoneum, its symptom is that it occurs gradually over a long period.
However, if it is due to a tear in the peritoneum, it occurs suddenly and causes severe pain abruptly. In this case, the hernia appears as a difference under the skin near by.
And this happens when the gut protrudes and exits through the peritoneum, and its fate is to become strangulated outside of it. Sometimes the omentum also protrudes along with the gut, in which case the aneurysm is called a mesenteric-omental hernia; or it may contain gas, or feces may accumulate within it causing gangrene and death.
It happens with severe pain and cramps, especially upon squeezing. The treatment for this condition with iron is risky, so one should be cautious to avoid it. The procedure involves commanding the patient to push their intestines back into their abdomen using their hand if possible.
Then, have him lie on his back with his legs raised. Pull the skin over the scrotum upwards and cut the entire length of the skin of the scrotum. Then insert spatulas into the incision according to what is needed to open it.
The incision should be large enough for the testicle to come out. Then, peel off the tunics underneath the scrotal skin until the white, solid peritoneum is exposed on all sides. At this point, insert your index finger behind the testicle.
Between the white peritoneum under the testicular skin and the second peritoneum, loosen the adhesion behind the testicle. Then grasp the testicle with your right hand inside the scrotum and, at the same time, pull the white peritoneum upwards with your left hand, lifting the testicle towards the incision.
Command the assistant to pull the testicle out. Completely release the adhesion behind it. Then, with your finger, make sure there is no twisted intestine in the white peritoneum. If you find any, push it down into the abdomen.
Take a needle with a thick thread made by twisting ten threads. Insert it into the end of the white peritoneum under the scrotal skin next to the incision. Then cut the excess thread so that there are four strands left. Tie two of the threads together in a reef knot and use them to tie the white peritoneum tightly on both sides. Then wrap the excess thread around it and tie it tightly so that nothing can reach the blood vessels that nourish it. So that it does not cause inflammation and also forms a second tie outside the first, about two fingerbreadths away. After these two ties, leave about one finger's breadth of the white peritoneum under the scrotal skin.
So that it does not cause inflammation and also forms a second tie outside the first, about two fingerbreadths away. After these two ties, leave about one finger's breadth of the white peritoneum under the scrotal skin. It cuts off the rest of it all around and removes with it the egg, then makes an incision at the bottom of the foreskin through which blood and pus flow as we described earlier. Then it uses wool soaked in oil placed in the wound and the bandage we described.
And it covers the white spleen that we mentioned after its removal carefully to prevent bleeding, for this is often seen. And let the bandage remain until it falls off by itself; if it takes too long, let it be removed with warm water and carry whatever burden it causes until it falls.
Then treat the wound as other wounds are treated until it heals,
Chapter Sixty-Six.
In this type of hernia, I have not seen anyone dare to treat it with iron. The ancients mentioned that it should be done like the one with a stalk, namely, tying the vessels gently after cutting them.
Then cut in the middle and treat the swelling until the vessels fall out and treat the wound as mentioned until it heals,
Chapter Seventy-Seven.
In the hernia that occurs in the scrotum.
The hernia in the scrotum, as we have mentioned, appears in its place and does not descend towards the anus. If it descends, that would be easy and it always returns.
However, if time passes, the incision in the spleen increases until the intestine descends and herniates in the scrotum due to the extension of the spleen that is present in the scrotum as we mentioned. And this is because the spleen extends, then relaxes and pushes out the hernia, which causes it to prolapse. Its treatment involves cauterization as we have described.
And it can be treated with iron as follows: The patient lies on their back before you, then cut across the site of the swollen hernia, about three fingers wide. Then push aside the fat underneath the skin.
Until the white spleen underneath is exposed, take a probe and place it on the site where the spleen protrudes into the abdomen. Then suture the two openings at the end of the probe and sew them together.
Then, ligate the end of the vein without cutting the peritoneum at all and do not touch the ovary or anything else as I have instructed you regarding the treatment of hernias. Then treat it according to the treatment of wounds.
If the sutures break and the wound becomes open such that it does not heal, then the peritoneum will shrink and the hernia will not increase.
And cautery is best in this place because it is closer to the healthy tissue.
Chapter Eighty-Six
In relaxation of the foreskin.
Often, the foreskin becomes relaxed in some people without the flesh inside it also being relaxed, which is unsightly. Therefore, whoever wishes to treat it should lay the patient on their back.
Then cut away all the relaxed skin from the thick skin, then bring together the lips. If you wish to first suture a portion of the relaxed skin with three or four sutures and secure it, then cut between the sutures.
Then treat it like other wounds until it heals and the sutures fall out.
Chapter Ninety-Six
In Castration
Castration is forbidden in our religion/sharia.
Therefore, it was not appropriate for me to include this in my book, except that I mention it for two reasons: first, so that it would be in the knowledge of the physician if asked about it, and secondly, because we often need to castrate some animals for our benefits.
The castration of animals such as horses, cattle, cats, and the like is done in two ways: either by cutting or by crushing and severing. The method of castration by crushing is performed by seating the animal in hot water until its genitalia relax and soften and droop downwards.
Then crush it with your hand until it becomes soft and not distinguishable to the touch. As for castration by cutting, one should hold the animal tightly and squeeze the scrotum with the left hand, then tie the spermatic cords and make a single incision on each testicle.
Until the testicles come out, then cut them off after peeling them and do not leave any peritoneum on them except for the thin peritoneum that is on the vessels. This method of castration by cutting is better than that by crushing.
Because perhaps something remained of the twins, so the animal desired mating, then the wound was treated until it healed.
The Seventieth Chapter.
In treating hermaphrodites.
A hermaphrodite in men appears in two types: one that is evident externally or within the scrotum between the testicles, resembling a woman's vulva with hair, and urine may flow from that which is in the scrotum.
And as for women, there is one type that appears above the vulva on the pubis like a small penis of a man protruding externally, and another like female genitals. The treatment for these three types.
The two types in men and the one type in women should have those superfluous flesh cut until there is no trace of it left, then treat it like other wounds until it heals. But for the second type in men which emits urine from within the scrotum, there is nothing to be done nor any hope.
The Seventy-First Chapter.
On cutting the clitoris and excess flesh from women's vaginas.
The clitoris may be larger than usual, causing discomfort and making the appearance repulsive. In some women it may become enlarged like a penis leading to sexual intercourse.
It is necessary to grasp the foreskin of the clitoris with your hand or forceps and cut it, but do not dwell too much on cutting, especially at the root lest bleeding occur.
Then treat it like other wounds until it heals. And that excess flesh is flesh that grows in the mouth of the uterus until it fills it.
It may also protrude externally resembling a tumor. And some earlier physicians called it the disease of the 'tumor' so it should be cut like the clitoris and treated until it heals.
The Seventy-Second Chapter.
On treating hemorrhoids.
Hemorrhoids are when a woman's vagina is not open or the opening is small, either naturally at birth or acquired later due to certain causes such as excess flesh growing there.
This is a thin or thick membrane, which may be found either in the depth of the womb, or on its sides, or above it, or below it. It prevents coitus and pregnancy, and hinders delivery; sometimes it may obstruct menstruation. Its presence can be determined by inspection from the midwife.
If the septum is visible and close, then if it is not visible, search for it with your fingers or a probe. If the septum is made of thin peritoneum and is close to the cervix, immediately puncture it, pressing both thumbs on the cervix as if making a pout.
The woman lies on her back with her legs spread, then she pushes the cervix forcefully until the thin peritoneum ruptures and the septum opens. Then take some wool, soak it in oil, and place it on the site to prevent adhesion. The woman should engage in coitus daily to prevent the site from adhering again.
If the peritoneum is thick and dense, do not cut it with a broad knife like an almond leaf. If the septum is made of flesh, cauterize it with caustic substances and remove it. Keep with you drugs that stop bleeding without causing pain, such as senna, silphium, and honey mixed with egg whites.
Then use a wide lead pipe to prevent rapid adhesion of the wound. Hold it in place with bandages made of dry linen, and treat it with other medications for healing until it heals. Sometimes flesh may grow again in the uterus, do not cut it according to this description.
Unless it is a cancerous tumor, no iron should be used for a cancerous tumor that occurs in the uterus.
Chapter Seventy-Three.
In the treatment of piles, warts, and red pimples that appear on women's genitals.
As for piles, they are the swelling of the veins' openings until much blood flows from them constantly. When piles become hard and lumpy, they become warts. The types and signs of piles have been mentioned in the previous sections, and we will mention them here as well.
Tumors and warts, if they are deep within the uterus and not visible to touch, cannot be treated with iron; those that can be touched at the mouth of the uterus are treatable.
After a woman enters a cold house, she should stretch out the warts with a needle or coarse cloth and cut them off at their roots. Then she should apply one of the bleeding remedies without causing pain.
Like qaciyya, shi'an, and butter. Then raise her legs towards the wall for a moment before lowering them into cold water. If bleeding persists, seat her in a mixture of samak herb, pomegranate husks, and figs. Mix barley flour with honey and vinegar.
Apply this to her back until the bleeding stops; if not, press hard on her backbone and breasts. Then take cotton wool, dip it in a decoction of tarragon or coltsfoot leaves, or olive branch sap with fig syrup, and apply it to the wound.
If the swelling subsides, treat the area with ointment until it heals. As for red boils, they resemble acne heads and should not be cut like warts; treat them until they heal.
Chapter Seventy-Four.
Concerning the polypus that appears in the uterus.
Many types of tumors appear in the uterus, such as cancer, hardened growths, ulcers, fistulas, eating ulcers, warts, cracks, and hot tumors. All these diseases and their types and symptoms have been mentioned previously.
It is not necessary to mention in this chapter the hot tumor that appears in the uterus, especially if it collects for a long time. If its pain at the beginning is severe with two blows and inflammation and fever.
If it appears red and can be touched, do not rush to treat its center. Treat it with what ripens it until these symptoms subside. Then seat the woman on a chair with two seats.
She brings her legs together toward the lower abdomen, with thighs apart, and places her arms underneath her knees, securing them with a suitable bandage.
Therefore, the midwife sits on the right side and uses the instrument for opening the mouth of the womb, an image of which will be shown later. It is necessary to estimate with care the depth of the woman's womb beforehand so that what enters from the instrument does not exceed its depth.
If the woman is harmed, then if the instrument is deeper than the depth of the womb, pads should be placed on the lip of the neck of the womb to prevent the entire instrument from entering its depth. The coil that runs inside the instrument should be from the upper side.
You hold the instrument, and the servant turns the coil until the neck of the womb opens. When the discharge appears and touches the hand, if it is thin and watery, then cut its head with a wide scissors until all the matter is expelled.
A soft wick should be placed in the wound, dipped in rose oil or green olive oil with a little myrrh. The wick should exit from the incision in the neck of the womb and be placed on the outside on the uterus and pubic area. Clean wool dipped in hot water boiled with cumin should also be used.
Then treat it after two days with the appropriate ointment until it heals.
The womb and wound can be washed by injecting water and honey, then with hot water boiled with frankincense or long pepper. Then return to using the ointment, especially if the discharge is hidden inside the womb.
It is not necessary to treat it with iron, but rather with what has been mentioned in this section.
Chapter Fifty-Nine
On teaching midwives how to treat live fetuses that emerge abnormally.
The midwife should first know the signs of natural childbirth: when a woman feels pressure downward, breathes heavily, and desires to push.
If the fetus comes out quickly, know that this is a natural birth and it will come headfirst with or without the umbilical cord. If you see these signs, do not press her belly to speed up its emergence.
If the afterbirth descends upon his head, it has descended with him. It should be cleaned from that excess in a thorough manner, but apart from this birth, any other is unnatural and condemned because the child may emerge feet-first or hands-first before the head.
If one hand or foot emerges first, or the head and one hand emerge together, or if it comes out folded over or turned on its back, or in any other condemned form, then midwives must be skilled and proficient with all these matters, taking care to avoid mistakes and errors.
And I have explained all these forms and how to deal with each one, so that you may rely upon them and stand upon them. If the child emerges head-first in the natural manner but it is difficult for the woman and hard on her, causing her strength to weaken, then seat her on a chair and order women to support her.
And anoint her womb with cooked fenugreek and damp cotton wool. Then, the midwife should insert a small lancet between her fingers and cut the umbilical cord until its moisture flows out, then press her belly until the child descends.
If it does not descend, then the woman should be injected with fenugreek juice mixed with shark oil. After the injection, she should be made to sneeze and cough using ginger root, holding her mouth and nose closed until the child emerges immediately. If one of the child's hands emerges first, they should be gently pushed back in a little at a time.
If it is impossible for the hands to enter, then place the woman on a platform and raise her legs up high. Shake the platform on the ground while she holds on so as not to fall during the shaking. If the hands do not emerge and the child is dead, then cut off its hands and pull out the rest of the body.
Or tie its hands with a cloth and pull them gently until it emerges. If the child emerges feet-first, then push its feet up and turn the child slightly until it is straightened out, then take one of its feet and stretch it out little by little.
If it comes out to the thighs, order her to sneeze and blow into the vessel with a syringe, for it will come out. If not as described, then gently pull back the fetus little by little until it regains its natural shape, at which point it will exit smoothly.
Take the juice of mastik, walnut juice, shea butter, and gum arabic, mix them all together in a mortar, then apply it to the woman's vagina and lower abdomen. Afterwards, make her sit in lukewarm water until she feels relief.
If you see that her lower part has softened, make a suppository from myrrh for her to hold. After some time, seat her on a chair, then sneeze her and plug her mouth and nose, gently pressing her lower abdomen until the fetus comes out at once, with its legs and arms extended.
If it comes out in this manner, gently insert your hands to bring out its arms. Then, make the woman lie on her back with her hips raised and her head down while lying on a bed. She should hold her hands close to her chest before gently pressing above her belly. Remove the pillows from under her legs to lower them. If the fetus does not come out, grasp both of her legs together and shake them vigorously. Then, gently press above her hips until the fetus moves up. The midwife should then insert her hand and adjust the fetus.
Make the woman sneeze until the fetus comes out, coming out crooked with one of its hands extended. If you cannot put its hand back, then make the woman sit up and help her walk. If she cannot walk, have her lie down on her side.
Lay her on her bed and shake her legs vigorously. Then apply the ointment made from the herbs described earlier. If labor progresses, seat her on a chair, then treat her by putting back her hand and adjusting the fetus to its natural shape. Make her sneeze and order her to sneeze until it comes out.
When the child emerges facing upwards with its arms outstretched and its face towards its mother's back, it is necessary for the midwife to grasp the child's hand, then gradually turn it a little at a time, carefully placing it until it is upright. Then proceed as previously described with the fat and wrappings.
Then have her move a little at a time until she does so, then seat her on the chair and instruct her to lean towards the right side. Then have her strain and push with the kandis, for the child will emerge standing upright on its hip.
If it descended to the mouth of the womb with the placenta in this manner, then tear the placenta with your fingers until it is freed from its moisture. If it adheres to the child's face and neck, cut it away at the root lest the child should be suffocated and die. Then push the child back inside until it assumes its proper position.
Instruct the woman to strain repeatedly, for it will emerge easily. The emergence of twins or multiple fetuses is known to occur frequently, with three or four sometimes being born and surviving, although this is rare. As for five, it is contrary to nature and they never survive.
And they are surrounded by a single placenta, even if there are many. They are separated by a thin partition attached at the root of each one, and they emerge like a single fetus in a natural and easy manner, or in an abnormal fashion as previously described.
If some prove difficult at birth and assume the unnatural shapes mentioned earlier, treat them as described. Let the midwife be gentle, proceed with care and patience, and adapt her methods to whatever situation arises in order to ensure safety.
It has been mentioned that fetuses are found in various numbers in the womb, ranging from one to two, three, four, five, six, seven, and more than ten. I have personally witnessed a woman who expelled seven and another who expelled fifteen, all of them being formed.
With the grace of the All-Knowing, this is all that should be known by a midwife. For perhaps such a case will come upon her one day, and she should deal with it appropriately.
Chapter Sixty-Seven
On the Extraction of the Dead Fetus
If treating the dead fetus as mentioned in the section did not result in its expulsion, and it became necessary to proceed with manual intervention, then first examine the woman. If she is strong and there are no symptoms that would cause concern for her well-being, have her lie down on a bed on her back.
Her head should be tilted downwards, and her legs elevated. An assistant should hold her on both sides or secure her to the bed so that her body does not slip when pulling out the fetus.
Then moisten the mouth of her uterus with a moistened cloth, applying spittle and decoctions of coltsfoot and fenugreek seeds ground with flaxseed. The midwife should then apply this mixture to her hand before gently inserting it into the uterus. She should then search for a suitable spot where she can grasp the fetus with forceps.
If the fetus is breech, insert the forceps into its eyes, cheeks, mouth, throat, or beneath its beard or umbilical cord, or in places close to its ribs or buttocks.
If the fetus is presenting by its legs, insert the forceps into the groin or central part of the ribs. Hold the forceps with your right hand and curve it between the fingers of your left hand. Gently insert your hand and grasp one of the mentioned locations with the forceps.
Continue inserting the forceps until you feel empty space. Then insert another or even a third forceps on the opposite side if necessary, ensuring equal traction and preventing it from tilting to one side. Pull gently in a straight line, but also move it from side to side.
This should be done gently, similar to how a cork is extracted from a bottle. During this process, occasionally relax the pulling force if it becomes stuck on one side. If necessary, the midwife can apply some grease to her fingers and insert them from one side to rotate what has become stuck. Once part of the fetus has been expelled, relocate the forceps to other positions.
Once the fetus has been expelled, gently raise it a little until its entire body emerges. If one of the hands comes out first and cannot be pushed back due to tightness, wrap it with a cloth and continue pulling until all of it exits. Then cut off the umbilical cord.
If the head of the fetus is large or pressed upon in its exit, or if there is water gathered in it, then you should introduce a hooked probe between the fingers.
And tear open the head so that the water comes out or draw it out with the instrument called the forceps, the image of which is found along with other images in the chapter following this.
Similarly, if the fetus has a large head, then you should split open the skull or draw it out with the forceps as mentioned earlier. Then remove the bones using tongs. If the head comes out but is compressed at the neck, make an incision until the moisture in the chest is relieved.
If the chest cavity is not restored, then cut as much as you can. If the lower abdomen is warm or there is heat in it, then compress it until moisture flows out of it.
If the fetus is presented by its feet, then pulling it out is easy and pushing it back into the mouth of the womb is simple. But if it is compressed in the abdomen or chest, then pull it out using a cloth wrapped around your hand and cut open the abdomen or chest until what is inside flows out.
If all other organs are removed and the head remains lodged, then let the midwife insert her left hand. If the mouth of the womb is open, she should enter her hand into the neck of the womb, seek out the head with her fingers, and pull it towards the mouth of the womb. Then insert a hook or two hooks and pull it out.
If the mouth of the womb is closed due to a hot tumor, then do not be harsh upon it. Rather, use moist compresses and apply poultices. Then sit in warm water for relaxation.
As for a fetus lying on its side, if it can be turned, then use the methods mentioned earlier for a live fetus. But if it cannot, then cut and remove it. Make sure to leave no pieces of the placenta inside. After you have finished treating it, apply the treatments mentioned earlier for hot tumors in the womb.
If there appears bleeding, let it flow into warm water and use other remedies. I have seen a woman who became pregnant, but the fetus died within her womb, and then she became pregnant by it again.
Then the other fetus also died, and after a long time she appeared with a tumor in her womb which swelled until it opened and began to discharge pus. I was called upon to treat her, but despite treating her for a long time the wound did not heal. So I applied some powerful drawing ointments.
Then a bone emerged from the location, then after some days another bone emerged. I was amazed by this as the belly is not a place for bones. I suspected that it was from the dead fetus' bones. So I searched the wound and found many skull bones of the deceased fetus.
I continued this until I removed many bones from her and the woman was in good health, living thus for a long time with only a small amount of pus coming from the location. But I have recorded this case here as it is unusual.
Because it contains knowledge and guidance for what the practicing physician may attempt in treatment.
Chapter Seventy-Seven.
In this chapter are pictures of the instruments needed for expelling a fetus.
Image of a screw used to dilate the mouth of the uterus:
This dilator is like the ones used in books, having screws at both ends. But this dilator should be smoother than the dilator and made either of ivory or ebony wood, with each wooden part being as thick as two fingers.
And their ends are shaped like fingers, and they are one and a half cubits long. In the middle of the wooden parts there are two projections of the same wood securely attached to them, being half a cubit or slightly more in length and about two fingers or more in width. These are the projections.
These are the ones that enter into the mouth of the uterus to dilate it when you operate the screws, picture of another similar instrument but smoother and lighter:
It is made from ivory or ebony wood in the shape of forceps, but with two projections at its end as you see. Each projection is about one cubit long and two fingers wide. If you wish to dilate the uterus with it,
I seat the woman on a bed with her legs dangling, spread apart between her thighs. Then I insert these two ropes, tied together at one end, into the mouth of the womb while holding the other end below her thighs. Next, I open my hand with the tool as one does with tweezers, opening the womb to the desired extent. To make whatever midwife's instrument you wish, here is another design mentioned by earlier authors:
A depiction of the cannon used for expelling the fetus:
A depiction of the hook used to extract the head of the fetus:
It resembles a pair of scissors with teeth at its end as shown. It can also be made like tweezers, with teeth like those of a saw to cut and tear.
A depiction of another cannon:
A depiction of a hook:
This hook should be slightly thicker so as not to break when pulling the fetus with it. Depiction of a hook with two prongs:
A depiction of two wide scissors for cutting the fetus:
The more numerous these instruments are and the better equipped the craftsman, the quicker his work and the greater his reputation among people. Do not disdain any instrument that may be useful to have at hand.
Chapter Eighty-Seven.
In removing the afterbirth.
If the afterbirth remains inside after delivery, order the woman to hold herself back and then plug her vagina with a tampon. Pull your hand on its mouth and nostrils until it comes out, otherwise cut as much of it as you can.
And make a hole in the cover and place inside it open herbs such as fennel, sage, mint, thyme, purslane, and cumin seeds. Soak them in water and heat them on fire. Then place one end of a silver tube on the hole of the pot's cover, and the other end in the mouth of the womb.
And hold it until the steam reaches the bottom of the womb. Then plug as mentioned earlier, and the afterbirth will come out quickly. If it still remains after this treatment, order the midwife to dip her left hand in sesame oil or ox-gall.
Then insert it into the vagina and search for the placenta with it. If you find it, grasp it and gently pull it out a little at a time until it comes out. If it is adherent deep in the uterus, then insert your hand as described previously until you locate the placenta, then gently pull it out bit by bit with caution.
Lest the uterus fall out due to excessive pulling, it is preferable to gently push it towards the sides, left and right, then gradually increase the force of traction. It will then come away from its adhesion. If the mouth of the uterus is closed, we have described the treatment by cauterization and ligation.
But if it does not come out despite all that has been described, then avoid excessive force in retrying to pull it out. Instead, tie what has emerged from the mouth of the uterus to the woman's thigh, and apply the quartremmer ointment. It will rot it after a few days.
And it will dissolve and come out until, if it rots, a foul odor will emanate from it to the stomach and head, causing harm to the patient. It is therefore not advisable to use this method.
Therefore, some earlier practitioners have tried using incense and dried figs as suitable replacements for the quartremmer method in cases of menstruation retention and placenta expulsion, among others.
Make it from brass or copper in the shape of a funnel. Insert the narrow end into the vagina and place the wide end on the fire with incense burning on embers. Hold it until the incense burns out, then replace it with more.
Chapter Ninety-Seven.
In treating an unperforated anus.
Many boys are born with an unperforated anus, blocked by a thin membrane. The midwife should not pierce this membrane with her finger but rather use a sharp lancet to cut it without touching the muscle.
Then apply a linen pad soaked in honey and oil. Treat it with ointments until healed. If you fear that it may close up again, insert a brass tube into the hole for many days, then remove it when the child wants to pass stool.
Sadd al-muq'adah may also appear due to the fusion of a wound or tumor. It should be cut open, then treated with the aforementioned treatment and dressing.
Chapter Eighty
In treating hernias that occur in the lower region
Hernias that occur in the lower region are a complex and thickened formation near or within the space of one side of the rectum, appearing as single or multiple prolapses.
If this complex breaks open, a watery white fluid or thin pus may escape from it. Some hernias may prolapse into the bladder or intestines and remain unruptured; however, prolapsed ones can be identified by the passage of feces or wind upon attempting defecation with an enema.
Furthermore, worms may emerge from the hernia, and there can be additional prolapses if it is situated within the space, prolapsing into the bladder, urethra, groin, or perineum. Hernias that prolapse into the rectum are also considered non-prolapsed.
Insert your index finger into the anus and use a thin probe made of copper or iron to enter the hernia if there is no covering; otherwise, use a thin lead probe or horsehair suture if there is covering.
Until you feel the probe or hair within your finger, if nothing emerges from the hole, no feces, wind, or worms as mentioned earlier, then know that it is not prolapsed and proceed with treatment.
If the hernia prolapses into the bladder or urethra, it can be diagnosed by urine emerging from it and failure of medications to adhere. If it prolapses into the groin or perineum, the probe will reach that location.
If there is no bony covering, pain in the affected side, constant discharge of pus, lack of improvement with treatment, and failure to adhere with ointment, all prolapsed hernias are incurable.
The treatment of prolapsed hernias is futile for those who attempt to reduce them without knowledge. However, non-prolapsed and non-chronic ones can be cured by the use of iron as described and proven by me, which involves placing the patient on their back in front of you.
Splay his legs upwards and incline his thighs towards his belly, then insert the copper or lead probe if it is in the navel until you know where the probe ends. If the patient feels it near the bladder, do not insert your index finger into the bladder.
If you feel the probe has passed through on its own, exposed without feeling any fat or flesh between your finger and it, then know certainly that it is perforated. Do not waste time with it, for there is no cure in this case as we have said.
They say that it sometimes heals in some people, rarely. One of the treatments hoped for success is to heat a thin iron with fire according to the width of the navel and insert it into the navel until it reaches near the bladder, then repeat this process twice or three times.
Until you know that all the excess flesh has burned, resembling chicken feather tubing. Then treat it by twisting with melted fat until the burned flesh comes out, then apply burning ointments and it will heal.
Otherwise, it will not heal without other treatment ever. If the probe was inserted but did not reach your finger in the bladder, and there is a thick barrier of flesh or peritoneum between them, and you see the navel above the skin, then cut the skin from the beginning of the navel. Then pass through the incision with the probe still in the navel until you reach where the tip of the probe ended, and remove it. Then cleanse all the excess flesh resembling chicken feather tubing so that nothing remains.
Then treat it with cauterizing ointments until it heals. If bleeding overpowers you and hinders your work in cutting that flesh, the best thing to do quickly is to cauterize with fire or sharp medicine, for cauterization by fire combines two beneficial states: burning the excess flesh.
Stop the bleeding, dry the wound, then treat it by twisting with melted fat or sulfur powder mixed with oil until it discharges. Then remove the burned flesh in the discharge, and afterwards treat the wound with cauterizing ointments that are effective on solid flesh.
These are the medications in which constipation and thirst occur. If they become severe, recovery will not occur unless it is treated. If the wound has reached deep into the bladder and is distant from the body's surface, insert your finger into the bladder and search with it.
If you feel the bladder wall and there is a barrier of peritoneum or flesh between you and it near the urethra, then the only course of action is to hope for the best. In this case, one of three approaches can be taken: either cauterize it as mentioned before.
Or, cut it until you reach its base, allowing you to insert the probe and administer treatment from close by. Do not cut too deeply lest you sever the muscle surrounding the bladder, causing involuntary urine leakage. Then treat it as mentioned before, recovery may occur.
Or, pierce that barrier after cutting it close to the bladder as mentioned before, either with a probe or another sharp instrument. Then clean out all the affected flesh in the incision as much as possible.
Then sew up the entire wound along with the incision and upper opening until it heals, leaving the urethra open inside the bladder. This will be easier for the patient. The urethra may remain like this.
If a probe is inserted into the urethra and it is near the surface of the body with the skin and bladder wall, take a probe like this: pierced at one end, shaped like a saddle stirrup.
And insert into it a thread made from five or so strands. Then insert the probe with the thread into the urethra until it reaches its base. If it is open near the edge of the bladder inside.
Then pull the thread out of that hole by inserting your finger into the bladder and pulling out the thread's end. Bring both ends together, tie them tightly, and leave it for a day or two. Whenever the thread cuts into the flesh, pull it tightly until those tissues between the thread's ends break off and fall away. Then treat the wound until it heals.
If the nostril of the patient is not dilated, dilate it as much as possible without going too deep lest you cut the muscle. Then proceed as mentioned until it heals.
A sharp-pointed instrument is used to cut the nostrils, with one end being very sharp and the other not so as to avoid unnecessary cutting.
Chapter 81.
Treatment of hemorrhoids that bleed and fissures, and their repair.
Hemorrhoids are of two types: either they are inside the anus, resembling red grapes, or they resemble small and large bunches of raisins, from which blood always flows.
Some hemorrhoids are single, some are multiple, and some are external to the anus. Those that are external usually have little moisture and discharge yellow water or a small amount of blood occasionally, appearing similar in color to the skin.
And the treatment for those inside the anus is to order the patient to evacuate their bowels and cleanse themselves until the hemorrhoids appear. Then quickly grasp them with forceps or pinch them with your fingers, and cut them at their base if they do not stick due to moisture and relaxation.
Remove it with a coarse cloth or a piece of linen soaked in vinegar, or pull it out with your fingers, then cut it off. After cutting, sprinkle some sharp salt to act as a cautery, or cauterize it as mentioned earlier under the chapter on cautery.
Then treat it with other medications until it heals. If the anus does not expel, inject the patient with a solution of myrrh to wash out its contents and facilitate expulsion when they evacuate their bowels. The external hemorrhoids are easier to handle.
And for external hemorrhoids, grasp them with your fingers or attach them with forceps and cut them off. Then treat them as mentioned until they heal. And if cutting with iron is disliked, use a ligature by taking a thread, doubling it, and inserting it into a needle.
Then you draw the mole upwards and pierce it with a needle at its base from the other side, wrapping both ends of the thread under the needle as it is inserted, and pulling the mole tightly. Then you tie the knot and remove the needle. Do this for all moles except one that you leave unexcised.
To cause a drop of blood to flow from it, then you place on the navel a cloth soaked in rose oil or carrot oil and apply it there, commanding the patient to remain still until it falls. Once it has fallen, treat the moles with ointments and other remedies until they heal.
As for the treatment of piles, it often appears from the hollows of the anus and constipation. If it persists without improvement despite medication, then scrape it with a sharp blade or rasp until it becomes moist and the outer skin that prevents adhesion is removed.
Then treat it until it heals as is proper. If it does not heal, then scrape it more harshly than the first time until it bleeds well and peels off, then treat it again; it will recover.
Chapter Two Eighty.
In treating inverted and non-inverted splinters, dry moles, and warts.
A splinter is nothing but a round node on the skin's color, resembling the head of a nail, found throughout the body but especially beneath the feet and toes. It causes pain upon walking.
It is necessary to incise around the splinter, grasp it with forceps or a tweezers and remove it from its root. Then treat it as mentioned earlier in its chapter. As for dry moles, each one is a small, rough, tangled, round node on the surface of the skin.
They often appear on the hands of children. Its treatment involves pulling out the mole and cutting it off or excising it with a silk thread or hair until it falls. You may cauterize it with fire or apply strong medication as mentioned earlier.
The inverted and non-inverted moles can be removed using the instrument mentioned earlier for treating warts. As for warts, they are also small, tangled nodes on the skin's surface that penetrate deeply into it. When exposed to cold, one feels a sensation similar to that of ants biting.
A tube should be taken from the feather of a goose or a strong eagle's feather and made into an instrument to encircle the mole around its circumference, then rotate the hand with the tube until it cuts through what surrounds the mole.
And inserting it into the depth of the flesh and removing the mole from its root, you can do this with a copper or iron tube as follows:
The upper part of the tube should be closed and thickened to make it easy for the fingers to hold and twist. You can cauterize the mole beforehand as mentioned in the chapter on cautery.
Chapter Eighty-Three.
On the shapes of instruments used for injecting enemas, purgatives, and cataplasms.
And the syringe can be made of silver, bronze, copper, or gold, and it can be plain or engraved. They should be made in various sizes according to their intended use. And the syringes used for treating young children with narrow or constricted anuses should be very thin. The shape of a large syringe:
The upper end of the syringe where the bulb is attached should be wide, as shown. There is a rim at the point where the bulb attaches, and the lower tip that enters the anus should be smooth and rounded with two small holes on one side and one larger hole on the other.
The width of the holes should be about the thickness of a barley grain or slightly thicker. The bulb that holds the medicine should be made from an animal's bladder or a ram's caecum, with a diameter of one sherva.
And it should be pierced with many holes around its circumference, about the thickness of a finger apart. Then insert a thin thread made from twisted wool (ten or twelve threads) into these holes and gather up the bulb like a small sieve. After filling it with medicine, tie the syringe tightly between the two stones at its head. Then use it to administer the enema. This is a diagram of the bulb and the hole:
To administer the enema, fill the bulb with warm medicine without making it too hot or too cold. Then have the patient lie on their back and raise their legs towards the ceiling.
Place beneath it a board or cloth, then anoint the tip of the syringe with oil or egg white or mallow juice or similar. Then insert it gently into the rectum. Then the servant takes the tube in both hands and squeezes it firmly until all its contents are emptied into the bowel.
Then remove the syringe and have the patient place their legs against the wall, if urged by the medication to expel it. If they pass the entire night in this state, it is most beneficial for the treatment of diarrhea. If used to treat dysentery and expedite its discharge, prepare another dose until recovery.
If there is haemorrhoids or painful tumors in the rectum, let the syringe be very gentle and smooth, like those used for children. This is a diagram of such a soft syringe:
Chapter Eighty-Four.
In the treatment of wounds.
I have mentioned the treatment of wounds similar to burns earlier, but here I will mention the treatment by hand and medication in detail. Know that surgical wounds differ according to the cause of the surgery and the location of the wound.
There are many things by which surgeries occur, such as a stone cut, sword or knife cut, spear stab, stake wound, arrow and the like from many other things.
As for wounds according to their locations on the body: those that occur on the head, neck, chest, abdomen, liver and similar organs.
And I will describe the treatment of some simple head wounds, as they serve as a model and standard for other wounds. I begin with simple head wounds.
I say that when a simple head wound occurs, not involving bone fracture, and it is from a stone cut or similar, having only grazed the skin but with a large wound, fearing hot swelling for the patient, quickly tie off the bleeding point. Do not delay this. Let out blood according to his strength if it does not prevent bleeding, especially if the blood coming from the wound is slow. Let the ligation be on the opposite side of the wound.
Warn the patient against overeating and drinking, especially harsh foods. If prohibited from eating solids, let them reduce food intake and avoid meat and hot drinks. Apply a compress of cotton soaked in rose oil alone or with the aforementioned drink if inflammation occurs at the wound.
If the inflammation has been cured, apply to the wound if it is fresh with its own blood without exposing it to the corrupt air that I shall describe later. But if it has already been exposed to such air, apply some ointment.
Until the pus discharges, then treat it until it heals. If the wound is large and caused by a sword cut or similar, and its edges do not meet, sew it together as I describe in abdominal surgery.
If the skin has been stripped from the bone and hangs loosely, cut it off. Then treat the wound with medications that promote the growth of hard flesh to replace the skin, and advise the patient to consume foods rich in nutrients like heads and fish.
If gangrene appears on the skin and does not adhere to the bone, cut away all the rotted part and discard it. Then treat the wound. If there is an artery or vein bleeding profusely that has not stopped despite medication, search for and ligate the artery.
If it is struck but does not heal, cauterize it with a scalpel and ligate it. If necessary, when the aforementioned remedies fail, cut until bleeding stops. If these wounds are small and numerous, simply treating them by applying this corrupt air to them while they are fresh.
Before exposing it to the air, the corrupt air dressing is prepared by mixing one part of frankincense, two parts of gum acacia, and three parts of quicklime or unslaked lime. Grind all ingredients together, sieve, and apply firmly on the wound until well adhered.
The dressing is secured with blood, then the wound edges are approximated from above and left undisturbed until inflammation subsides. The wound should not be changed until it heals. Alternatively, quicklime alone can be used if frankincense and gum acacia are unavailable.
He can also perform this act with his finger in many large surgeries, if he mastered its placement and tension. But if the surgeries are fresh with blood, it should not be changed by air; however, if it has been altered somewhat by air, especially in summer.
There is no purpose in this bandaging as mentioned by carrying on it some prepared ointments or applying a dough made of barley flour with water and honey until the pus comes out, then treat it with other remedies until it heals.
But if the wound causes a fracture of the bone, and it is slight, bind it with plaster. I have mentioned the treatment of head fractures in the section on surgery of the neck; if the wound is on the neck, its treatment is not different from that of a simple head wound.
But if he cut the nerve or artery, then if it is a nerve, there is no way to treat it except by avoiding its treatment with anything that constricts strongly like ginger and quicklime etc., for they harm the nerve and paralyze it.
And nothing cold should be placed on the wound because the essence of the nerve is cold, and its connection with the brain which is the noblest organ. Therefore, what is used to treat it should be warm remedies like washed purslane soaked in sweet water for several times dipped in oil or rose oil.
If you have also washed it with sweet water and other mineral stones on this condition, and ointments. But if the wound is large, use suturing or approximate its edges with pins until it heals.
If the wound has depth and a cavity underneath where pus has accumulated, then drain it at its lowest point. If an artery is severed in the wound and you notice blood flowing profusely, then ligate or cauterize it if necessary.
If the wound has cut some or all of the tonsils and the uvula is exposed, then sew up the skin edges over the tonsillar stalk without touching the tonsils. Then place the uvula in its natural shape and tie it gently and leave it for some time.
Then he treated it with plaster which had adhesive and drying properties until it healed. If the wound had affected the bone, he searched it; if there were any fragments of bone in it, he extracted them all or as many as possible, and if he could not manage to do so, he left them until the wound softened and healed and their removal became easier.
If the wound was tender, he applied the poultice we have described. If it became inflamed in the wound and hardened like bone, then treat it as mentioned in his chapter on surgery of the chest and between the shoulders.
If it is a wound from a spear or knife and you find it has a cavity, observe: if wind passes out of it when the patient breathes, know that it is a mortal wound. If it does not have a cavity but is still moist with blood, do not apply any poultice at first nor press it lest blood be trapped inside it.
It may extend to the heart and kill the patient. But apply an adhesive plaster and change it twice a day. If you do not have any plaster, place a wick of old cotton in the mouth of the wound to absorb any moisture that comes out, and let the patient sleep with the wound downwards.
If three days or more have passed since the injury and the patient has not experienced convulsions, rapid breathing, shortness of breath nor other signs of deterioration, know that the wound is safe. Treat it by cauterization and other remedies until it heals.
If you cannot see it and the air persists in escaping, know that it has become hard. Treat it as mentioned in his chapter. If the wound is on the chest or back, treat it with what has been mentioned under suturing.
If it is large or filled with poultice, if it has affected the bone and some fragments have broken off, search the wound and hasten to extract those fragments if they are clean. If not, leave them until.
until the wound heals for it becomes easier to remove them. As for other wounds that occur in other organs, their treatment is judged by what has been mentioned.
Chapter Eighty-Five
In surgical procedures for abdominal incisions and the extraction of intestines and their suturing.
A wound that exposes the abdomen may be large, small or medium in size; a large one may allow the exit of intestines or several segments thereof, making their reinsertion and suturing more difficult.
Even a small wound can pose difficulties of its own, making closure challenging; intestines may swell and thicken if not immediately replaced into the abdomen, causing difficulty in their reinsertion. Therefore, a medium-sized wound is preferable as it does not pose these challenges.
Know that abdominal suturing can be performed in four ways: the two common methods are suitable for abdominal closure and other general surgeries, while the other two specialized methods are primarily used for abdominal closure.
And I will describe each method to you individually with explanation, saying that if the wound is small and a portion of intestine has exited, making its replacement difficult, this may be due to either the small size of the wound as mentioned earlier, or because the intestines were exposed to air before being replaced, causing them to fill with air.
In such a case, it is advisable to warm the intestines by moistening a sponge or cloth in lukewarm water alone or adding hot water until the swelling and gas subsides and the intestines can be easily returned to their position.
Alternatively, a solution containing lint seeds (Trigonella foenum-graecum) can be used to dissolve the gas, as it is more effective than water alone. Once the swelling has subsided, moisten the intestines with hot water boiled with sesame seed or lentil to facilitate their reinsertion into the abdomen with ease.
If the intestines still cannot be replaced even after these treatments, make a small incision in the wound using an instrument designed for cutting ligatures. This procedure should only be performed as a last resort when other methods have failed. The instrument has the following appearance:
The tip of the instrument should be slightly blunted, not as sharp as a lancet, and resemble a small tweezers in appearance. When the wound is widened enough to allow the entrance of the intestines, they should not be replaced in their natural shape.
If possible, its proper place is preferable. If the wound is wide and located in the lower abdomen, the patient should lie on their back with their legs raised higher than their head. If it is located in the upper abdomen, they should be positioned with their head and chest elevated above their feet.
Similarly, if the wound is on one side of the abdomen, always elevate the side where the surgery is being performed higher than the other side. This should also be done in major and minor surgeries.
As for small surgeries, position the patient as best you can. Then have a skilled assistant nearby to hold all of the wound's edges with their hands and pull its lips together, gradually revealing more of it to the surgeon for suturing.
This is the general method of suturing: Take as many needles or needle holders as needed according to the wound's width. Leave a length of thread equal to the thickness of a finger at the end of the wound, then insert one needle without threading it into one edge of the skin. Pass the needle through both edges of the skin and the peritoneum beneath it until it emerges from the other side, bringing together the skin edge and peritoneal edge to form four layers. Then tie the thread securely around the needle with a double knot on both sides to close the wound edges tightly.
Next, leave a length equal to the thickness of a finger and insert another needle, threading it as done with the first needle. Continue this process with needles of medium thickness until the entire wound is closed.
Do not use very fine needles as they quickly cut through flesh, nor very thick ones as they are difficult to insert into the skin. Therefore, medium-sized needles should be used, and do not prick the needle too close to the skin edge.
To prevent the flesh from breaking quickly and the wound from opening before it can heal, do not stitch too loosely or too tightly. Then cut off the needle tips to avoid hurting the patient during sleep, and use cotton bandages on each side to hold the needles in place.
Leave it until you learn that the wound has healed, for this type of stitching with needles is most suitable in small wounds because they may be sewn with one or two needles or similar.
And as for the characteristic of suturing for novices, it is that he should gather together in one stitch all four layers - namely, the skin edges and the peritoneum - using a moderately thick thread on a needle; then, once this has been done, he should withdraw the needle from where he began.
The thread should be tied at the top of the wound to resemble the stitching used for tying down cargo, leaving one finger's width between each stitch.
With this suturing method, an abdominal wound was closed for a man whose abdomen had been stabbed with a knife. The wound was over a span in length and about two spans of the middle intestine had prolapsed from it, being centrally located.
After keeping his intestines outside the wound for twenty-four hours, he returned them and sutured the wound. The wound healed in about fifteen days, and he was treated until he recovered completely. He lived many years afterward, functioning normally in all respects. Physicians considered him to be incurable.
It is remarkable that I did not treat him with ointment because I was in a place where there were no medicines. Instead, I applied boiled cotton to the wound twice daily and cleaned it with honey water until it healed.
One of the specialized types of suturing is as follows, according to Galen's words: begin at the skin and insert the needle from outside inwards; once the needle has pierced through the skin and entered the straight muscle fibers running along the entire length of the abdomen...
Leave the edge of the peritoneum in the side where you entered the needle, and pass it through the other edge from inside out. Then, pass the needle again into this same edge from outside in.
And leave the edge of the peritoneum on this side and pass the needle through its other edge from inside out, also passing into the edge of the quantum on that side until it pierces all.
Then he also began from this side of the eye, drawing a line along the edge that is towards the liver on the other side, and brought out the needle from the skin near it, then returned it into that skin, drawing the edge of the liver on the other side along with this edge.
And he brought it out from the skin on his side, and did this again and again until the entire incision was stitched in that manner. The description of this stitching is like the sewing together of a garment's seams.
That he should stitch the peritoneum once from one side with the skin edge and leave it once on the other side until emptied. As for the second type of special stitching mentioned by Galen, this is his exact words.
And that he should stitch it like those who stitch the parts together, gathering each part to its counterpart. The difficulty in this is that they join the edge of the peritoneum to its other edge and the edge of the liver to its other edge, as I have described to you.
It is necessary to insert the needle into the edge of the liver near you from outside alone and pass it inside there alone, leaving the edges of the peritoneum, then return the needle and pass it from outside to inside in both edges of the peritoneum, then return it again.
And pass it from inside to outside in the other edge of the liver on the opposite side. This type of stitching is better than common stitching, and it is the stitching that was mentioned earlier; this is Galen's exact words. Some have said that the abdomen can be stitched with two needles. And that you should insert a single thread into them and begin by inserting the needle from your side and passing it to the other side, then insert the other needle from the opposite side so that it passes from your side according to the stitching of the sacs.
Know that wounds, if they are in the middle of the abdomen, their stitching is more difficult than other parts of the abdomen. As for treating the wound, its ruling in treatments is like that of other surgeries. If you reach the wound while it is still fresh with its blood before the air has altered it, return the intestines and stitch and mend them, then apply meat broth compresses.
If the wound has been exposed to air, apply some of the dressings you have prepared until it suppurates and the threads fall off, and the peritoneum and membranes adhere. Then treat it as you would other wounds until it heals.
If you do not have any prepared dressings, apply from the beginning sterile gauze and change it twice a day as I instructed until it heals. In most cases, there is no need for further treatment if the wounds are simple; however, be cautious lest the wound share pain with the main organs.
It is preferable to soak a clean piece of wool in warm olive oil or rose oil and place it around the areas between the thighs and armpits. If there is pain or foul smell in the abdomen, this often occurs; therefore, give him an decoction of black hemlock.
Especially if the putrefaction has reached the intestines and become a penetrating wound into its cavity, know that thick intestines are easier to heal while thin ones are harder.
As for the intestine known as the 'fasting' one, it does not accept healing from a wound that occurs in it frequently due to its abundance of veins and bones, and the thinness of its wall and its closeness to nerve tissue. However, if what emerges from the wound is the turbidum and it is still soft, replace it according to how you would replace the intestine.
If it has passed some time and the turbidum has turned green or black, then tie it above the place where it has turned black with a thread to prevent bleeding. There are veins and arteries in the turbidum. Then cut what is below that ligament.
Leave the ends of the thread attached from below the wound, outside it for ease in pulling and removing it when the turbidum falls off and the wound suppurates. As for a wound that appears in the intestine...
Some people may become accustomed to it (the wound in the intestine), as I have seen a man who was pierced by a lance in his abdomen, and the wound was on the right side of the stomach. It became constricted and became an opening through which feces and wind escaped. I treated him without expecting healing. I did not cease applying the plaster until it adhered and the place became sound. When I saw that the place had become sound, I feared that some evil might happen to the patient inside his body; but no such evil happened to him at all, and he remained in the best of health. He eats, drinks, copulates, takes a bath, and performs his service. Some who have experimented with it mentioned that when it appears in the bowel, it is usually a small wound, and should not be sutured based on this description.
Large-headed ants are to be taken, then the lips of the wound are brought together and one ant is placed with its mouth open on each lip. When it clamps down and closes its mouth, its head will adhere and not come loose; then another ant is placed nearby.
And this is done with several ants according to the size of the wound, then the wound is dressed and sutured. Those heads will remain adherent in the bowel until it heals and the patient suffers no harm at all. The bowel may also be sutured with fine thread.
This one which adheres from the animal glue after entering a needle: take the end of this thread from the glue, then pull it through with tweezers and tie a thin, twisted linen thread to its end, then insert that thread into the needle. And with this glue-thread, the bowel is sutured and then returned to the abdomen. This method of suturing with ants and glue is only for those who are desperate and hopeful.
But if the tear is large and wide, especially in one of the delicate intestines, there is no remedy nor any cure for it at all.
Chapter Eighty-Six.
Regarding the treatment of catarrh and nasal polyps.
Know that every wound or tumor, if it becomes chronic and does not heal, and continues to discharge pus without ceasing, is called generally in any organ, 'catarrh,' and we call them 'polyps.'
It is actually a solid, tangled, white substance without pain, having a hollow like the hollow of a bird's feather.
And thus some call it 'feather,' for sometimes it is moist, continuously secreting pus, and at other times the moisture may cease. This moisture can be abundant or scarce, thick or thin.
I previously mentioned, in the section on surgeries, that every ulcer will not heal nor will flesh grow in it unless there are nine causes: one of them is either insufficient blood in the body, or its thickness, or because there is solid flesh inside and around its edges preventing good flesh from growing. Or it may be due to many discharges and impurities, or because the ulcer itself is foul and its matter is of poor quality. Or it may be due to an unsuitable remedy being applied, or there has been a contagion of this type in the town, or there is something particular about this locality.
Or it may be due to many discharges and impurities, or because the ulcer itself is foul and its matter is of poor quality. Or it may be due to an unsuitable remedy being applied, or there has been a contagion of this type in the town, or there is something particular about this locality. This has been mentioned regarding the city of Saragossa, where recovery from illnesses is difficult and healing of tumors is delayed naturally, either because there is one or several bones in it. All these causes and their signs and treatments with medications have been explained in the section.
I should now inform you about the treatment of nasal polyps and catarrh by manual operation. Know that polyps can occur in all parts of the body, some ending in large veins or arteries, others in nerves.
Or to the peritoneum, intestines, bladder, ribs, vertebrae of the back, or joints with complex structure like hands and feet. Some also approach important organs.
If polyps have reached these states, they are among the difficult-to-heal diseases that do not accept treatment and are troublesome and confusing. But if there are polyps that have not reached these places mentioned and desired for treatment.
Take a probe made of copper or iron, if the polyp is straight, use it to explore. But if there are branches in the polyp, use a thin lead probe because lead softens its body.
If it enters crookedly and turns towards the branches, if the polyp has many openings that you cannot discern with the probe, then inject one of its mouths with water; the moisture will flow towards the other mouths.
Then, meticulously examine the site as much as possible to determine if there is a bone or nerve present, or if the cavity is deep or shallow, or if it has one opening with multiple entrances. Make note of all this based on your patient's tolerance and discomfort when you press on the location.
And other such indications and causes of tumors, once you have accurately established all this, then proceed to treatment with confidence. If it is found that.
If the cavity is superficial and close to a joint, nerve, artery, vein, or one of the aforementioned locations, then incise the cavity as previously described and remove from it any excess flesh, spoiled flesh, and clots.
And remove any flesh that grows inside its mouth or warts and the like, treating it until it heals. If the cavity is deep and straight, do not cut too deeply into it but rather clean out all of its spoiled flesh.
Then apply the cautery bandage using the hot method, inserting it into the depths of the cavity that you have reached with the probe. Repeat this procedure until the cavity is completely freed from corruption.
Then apply ointments that promote the growth of healthy flesh until it heals. If it does not heal, repeat the procedure as previously described. If the cause of the cavity is bone and you are certain of this, then explore and incise it as instructed, provided there is no impediment to doing so.
If a vein, nerve, or principal organ is exposed and some corruption and blackness are found on the bone, scrape it clean until its corruption disappears. Then treat it with what adheres to it until it heals. If it does not heal and continues to discharge pus as before.
Then know that you have not completely removed all the corruption. Expose it again and scrape it clean thoroughly, then treat it. If it heals, good. Otherwise, know that the corruption is deep-seated, so expose it again.
And scrape and clean it thoroughly with all your effort. If the bone is small and corrupted, try to extract it using suitable forceps.
If there are many bones, then meticulously pull them all without leaving any behind to your utmost ability. If something from the ligaments stands in your way and cutting them poses no danger, cut those ligaments and flesh if present, and free the bones.
If you are unable to extract the bones promptly, apply something that will cauterize the wound and leave it for some days until what surrounds those bones in flesh and ligaments has decomposed. Then preserve the wound so that the cut does not heal during your procedure.
But if you fear this, use a linen cloth soaked in powdered sulfur mixed with oil, or a linen cloth soaked in Egyptian pitch or one of the green ointments. For when these ligaments decompose and the bones become loose, it is easy to extract them.
If there is a single large bone like the thighbone or shinbone and only its end has rotted, strip it bare completely until that blackness and decay disappear. Then close the wound. But if a significant portion of it has rotted and the decay has reached the marrow, then it must be removed.
And cut off all of it until the decay ends. Then treat it so that it heals, and I shall tell you about a man who had gangrene in his leg as an example for your treatment, this man was elderly.
Around thirty years old, he had pain in his leg for a cause that moved from within the body until the matter reached the leg and it swelled greatly and became red. There was no external cause. Then time passed with the mistakes of physicians until the abscess burst open.
And much matter flowed from it, and his treatment was poor until the leg putrefied and became full of many holes all discharging pus. Physicians treated him for nearly two years, but none were skilled in manual surgery.
Until he came to me, and I saw his leg with much matter flowing from those holes like a great river. The man's body had wasted away and his color was yellowish. So I inserted the probe into one of those holes until it reached the bone, then I explored all the holes.
I found that some of them communicated with each other from all sides of the leg, so I made an incision on one of those openings until it revealed some bone which was decayed and had turned black and rotten to such an extent that the hole extended into the brain. Then I exposed what was visible.
He removed the decayed bone, believing that there was no other decay besides what he had cut out and exposed. Then he applied medicinal poultices for an extended period to try and heal the wound, but it did not adhere. He then returned and reopened the wound above the first incision.
I found the decay connected to the bone, so I also exposed what was visible of it. Then I tried to cauterize it but it did not heal nor adhere. So I continued cutting pieces from the bone until I reached about a span [of length].
After removing it with its root, he cauterized it with medicines which healed quickly and completely. However, this repeated procedure was necessary due to the patient's weak condition, his inability to endure, and fear of death since he was constantly suffering from severe diarrhea.
And in the place of the bone, solid flesh grew and his condition improved. He regained his strength and was able to move around without any further complaint from walking. If a broken bone is found in a part of the body,
It is not necessary to expose it in this manner. Instead, take a bandage and tie one end around the protruding part of the bone. Then command someone to pull it upwards while another stronger bandage made of wool is wrapped around it.
Then tie it to the flesh underneath the bone and pull its end upwards so that the flesh is pulled downwards. While exposing the flesh at the place where you want to cut without damaging it with the saw, place a piece of wood or board under the bone from below.
Otherwise, the saw would not hesitate to cut the decayed bone. It is better to make the incision slightly above the site of decay so that there is no decay inside the bone cavity and thus you will not have to cut it again.
If the bone is decayed and not protruding but connected to itself, with decay in its center or some parts of it, expose the flesh from all its sides, then place the lever from below, then separate it from the first side where the decay is.
Once you have separated it from the first side, separate it from the other side. The separation should be a little away from the decay, as we have mentioned. If the decay is at a joint, cut off the affected joint and separate the bone where it connects on the other side.
If the decay is between two joints, there is no cure but excision. If the decay is in the hand's metacarpus or foot's metatarsus, its treatment is very difficult, but you should scrape off whatever decay appears and excise and clean it as much as possible.
And however you proceed, if you are not hindered by blood vessels or nerves, know that the saws and chisels for cutting these bones are numerous according to their position, setting, thickness, thinness, size, smallness, hardness, and fragility. Therefore, you should prepare a specific tool for each type of operation.
And know that the operations themselves may indicate the type of tool needed if you have a long experience and knowledge of the arts of this profession, for mastering the profession and observing many cases of diseases. He may infer what is suitable for himself from tools for each disease, and I will illustrate for you at the end of this chapter a number of instruments.
Make them examples to follow and measure by others if God wills. Picture of a saw:

The Seventy-Seventh Chapter.
In severing limbs and separating bones.
If the extremities are putrefied, either due to an external or internal cause. When treated with medications and the treatment proves ineffective while the putrefaction spreads throughout the limb without ceasing,
It is necessary then to cut that limb where the putrefaction has reached, to save the patient from death or a great affliction worse than losing the limb. A sign of this condition is when the limb turns black as if it had been burnt by fire.
Or putrefies after turning black until the putrefaction spreads to other limbs, involving the whole body. In this case, cut it off immediately. Similarly, if the cause of corruption is due to the bite of venomous creatures like scorpions or snakes or spiders, etc.
If the corruption or bite is at the tip of a finger, cut off the finger without delay, lest the putrefaction spread to the hand. Similarly, if it has taken hold in the hand, cut it off at its root from the wrist, and do not wait for the putrefaction to spread into the forearm.
Similarly, if it has taken hold in the arm, cut off the arm at the elbow joint itself. But if the putrefaction has reached towards the shoulder, do not cut off the shoulder at all, for that would mean death to the patient. Instead, employ other treatments according to one's ability.
Do the same for the leg if corruption takes hold in the toe, cut off the toe at one of its joints. If it has taken hold in the foot, cut off the entire foot. And if it has risen to the knee, cut off the thigh at the knee joint.
If the decay has reached above the knee, there is no remedy except to leave it alone and for the patient to submit to death. The method of cutting or opening the member: tie a band below the place you intend to cut and another band above it.
Extend one servant the lower band downwards and another servant the upper band upwards. Then strip the flesh between the bands with a wide scalpel until all the flesh is exposed, then cut or open. It is necessary to place strips of linen on all sides.
So that the saw may not cut into the correct place causing additional pain and heat. If bleeding occurs during your work, quickly plug the place or apply some absorbent cloths to stop the bleeding then return to your treatment until finished.
Then bind the injured member with a suitable bandage and treat it until it heals. I inform you of an example of this condition in a man's leg which I will describe to you: blackness with heat like fire appeared in his leg.
The decay first appeared in his toe, spreading to the entire foot. The man cut it off at the joint himself when he saw the decay progressing and felt intense pain and heat. It then healed.
After a long time had passed, the decay appeared again in his index finger. He came to me and I applied various medications to it but the decay did not stop, instead it spread to the other fingers.
He then asked me to cut off his hand but I refused, hoping that the decay could still be cured. I also feared that he might die if his hand was amputated because his condition was critical. He eventually gave up and went home.
I heard later that he cut off his entire hand himself and it healed. I tell this story so that it may serve as a guide for similar cases in the future.
Chapter Eighty-Eight.
Treatment of fistulas and their injection with medications.
If a tumor appears in some fleshy member and persists for a long time until it bursts open or bursts out, then all the contents are emptied and the place remains empty like a vessel.
The skin that is like a cloth has been cauterized, and its defect was not so severe as to affect bone, nerve, or ligament. Therefore it deserves to be called 'protected', but it would not have deserved to be called 'sound' had its defect extended such that it affected one of these members.
At this point it is called 'sound' or 'healthy', and its treatment is to cut away all of that skin as it curves, especially if it has been cauterized and become like a cloth. Ensure that it does not adhere to the site due to its defect.
If you wish for the skin to adhere and its defect has not reached that extent, there is a good amount of flesh in it, then treat it by injection. Look into the protected area; if the pus that comes from it has an offensive odor, cauterize it with Egyptian medicine.
This is made by mixing equal parts of honey, oil, and vinegar in a vessel and cooking it over fire until the medicine thickens like honey. Then take what you need, dilute it with water and honey, heat it up, inject it into the protected area, tie its mouth shut, and leave the medicine inside for two hours.
Then squeeze it out, doing this repeatedly until the protected area is cleaned and the offensive odor goes away. If you do not have this medicine, you can use ash water instead, by taking either grapewood or oakwood ashes and pouring water over them.
Then clean it and inject with it until you are sure that the protected area has been rinsed. If the patient cannot tolerate Egyptian medicine or ash water, mix some powdered cinnamon into honey and water, then inject this mixture.
Or inject with a mixture of honey and wine, as honey cleanses and rinses while wine adheres to the protected area, especially if it is a fine vintage. Once you have done this several times and ensured that the defect has gone, then inject something that promotes flesh growth.
Such as taking the green ointment, dissolving it in rose oil and astringent wine, or injecting some of the other medications and ointments whose properties have been described earlier. If the mouth of the protected area is too narrow for the tip of the syringe.
Widen it slightly with iron or insert a thread soaked in Egyptian ointment or St. John's Wort ointment until it expands. Similarly, if the mouth is also wide, gather its lips by suturing and leave an opening sufficient for the entrance of the syringe.
And if the mouth from which pus issues is raised upwards, incise it at its lowest point so that the pus may flow downwards, for when pus accumulates in a cavity it prevents flesh from growing there.
But if you are unable to make the incision downwards as desired, then raise the organ slightly so that pus may flow out easily according to what is feasible for you and ensure that no pus remains trapped within it at any time.
And as for the cauterizing medicines that are applied to the cavity from outside and how they should be placed, take one of the cauterizing ointments suitable for your purpose, spread it on a cotton cloth which should be large enough to cover the entire cavity. Then, using scissors, make a larger opening opposite the mouth of the cavity. Take one of the soft ointments on another cloth of the same size as the opening and apply it at some distance from the mouth of the cavity to facilitate the exit of pus. Do not remove the large cloth until afterwards.
For several days, remove the dressing at the mouth of the cavity at regular intervals to allow the accumulated pus to escape and to determine whether the pus being discharged is abundant or scanty, turbid or clear.
And also examine the site of the cavity itself to determine whether its owner feels any pain there or not, and whether it is swollen or not. If you find that the treatment has progressed in this manner and that the matter being discharged from the mouth of the cavity has become serous...
...then know that the cavity has healed or nearly healed. In this case, leave it for another day or two and when you open it on the following day or third day, change the dressing and renew the ointment. If after a long time serous fluid is discharged from the cavity, do not despair of its healing.
Curing is near because among people are those whose flesh's growth in wounds is delayed, and others whose opposite is that; so if it emerges from the cavity after many days as undissolved pus, know that the cavity has not adhered. If the adhesion of the cavity was delayed.
If its case is prolonged, increase the drying of the remedies. Let them be remedies that are moist in consistency but dry in power, like the ointment of bees if it has had too much addition of wax; and the most effective for treating this is to take the ointment of bees.
Apply rose oil and sprinkle the moderate, consistent old wine upon it then knead it with it and use it. And do this action if the ointment of bees is not available; take honey, if you have it, cook it until it froths and use it, or take myrrh, frankincense, and bdellium grind all together and sprinkle on the honey while it is on fire. Then boil it on a cloth and wrap it around the cavity or apply the honey that has been cooked until it froths, sprinkle drugs upon it, place the cloth upon it, and wrap.
It may be used in such a case the long asafetida, the blue lily root, and the dust of nard, frankincense, and storax either separately or together ground and sieved then sprinkled on the honey previously described and used. If the cavity remains prolonged without being cured by this treatment, know that there is corruption within it.
When it affects the bones or any other solid nerves or ligaments, treat it with the treatment of the 'Nassour' as previously mentioned.
Chapter Ninety-Eight.
In the treatment of [cases involving] dislocations and fractures, removal of the supernumerary toe, and separation of adhered fingers.
Dish is excessive flesh that grows under the nail of the thumb, either of the hand or foot, and may also grow on other fingers. If its case is prolonged without treatment, it becomes inflamed and hot.
Or it may putrefy and become corrupt until it consumes the root of the nail, perhaps all of it is spoiled. And perhaps the corruption reaches the bone so that it has a foul odor, and the tip of the finger becomes bare and its color darkens. If you have treated it with what we mentioned in the section without success.
Firstly, cut off all the excess flesh that grows from the nail using iron. Then cauterize the wound afterwards; cauterization in this case is quite beneficial. However, if the bone is sound and the nail also is sound.
And the angle of the nail that has caused flesh to gather and become ingrown should have a thin probe placed beneath it, lifting it upwards, and then this flesh should be cut away gently.
And apply caustic medicines on the remaining flesh until it all disappears, then treat it with ointments until it heals. But if the decay has affected the bone, cut away that bone and remove it, for it will never heal as long as there is putrid bone in it.
If you find that gangrene and decay are spreading in the finger, cut it off at one of its joints as mentioned earlier, then treat it until it heals. But if the nail receives a blow or wound causing severe pain, do not lance the boil at first.
Then cut the nail with a sharp pointed instrument in an oblique manner from top to bottom, making sure not to reach the flesh underneath the nail. This would cause severe pain for the patient and lead to excessive growth of flesh at that spot. Then treat the place with something that relieves pain.
As for the extra finger that appears in some people's hands, it may be entirely fleshy, or there may be bones and nails within it. Sometimes its growth is at the base of a joint between fingers.
Or its growth may be at one of the joints of the finger, and those that grow at the joint do not move, while those that grow at the base of the finger might move. If it is only flesh, cut it off easily at its root with a wide pointed instrument.
But those that grow at the root of a joint are difficult to treat and should not be cut off. But if it grows on one of the joints of the finger, first cut away the surrounding flesh in a circular manner towards the bone, then chip away the bone with one of those chisels suited for this purpose.
Then treat it until it heals, but as for the fusion that affects the fingers together, this often occurs and is usually congenital, resulting from the merging of a wound or burn. Therefore, do not cut into that fusion.
Until the fingers return to their natural shape, then place between them a cloth or linen soaked in rose oil so that they do not fuse quickly and are separated, or insert a thin sheet of lead between them until the site heals properly.
Similarly, if fusion affects some fingers at the palm, cut through that fusion according to what is feasible and beneficial for the shape of the member.
The Ninety-First Chapter.
In cutting off the testicles.
Varicose veins are twisted, hard, swollen veins filled with black fluid that occur more commonly in the body's limbs, particularly around the feet, ankles, and calves. First, vigorously shake the body to expel the black matter.
Then apply a bandage to the patient's leg, and regarding treatment with iron, there are two methods: either incise and remove the black blood, or cauterize the vein and remove it entirely. If cutting is chosen, first warm the leg with hot water.
Until the thick, coagulated blood liquefies, then bind the healthy leg above its thigh down to below the knee with a bandage. Then cut the vein in one, two, or three places with wide incisions.
Then squeeze out the black blood from below the leg towards the top, and from the top towards the bottom until you remove as much blood as is sufficient or as much as the patient can tolerate. Then bind it and instruct him to avoid foods that cause hemorrhoids, and repeat evacuation and bandaging.
If the veins become filled and cause harm to the patient, then treat it as follows: shave the patient's leg if it has much hair, then enter him into a hot bath until the leg becomes reddened and the vein becomes visible or swollen due to vigorous exercise.
If he does not prepare a bath to warm the limb, then cut the skin opposite the vein lengthwise, either at its end near the knee or below it near the heel. Then open the skin with forceps and scrape away the vein from both sides until it becomes visible to touch.
When it appears, you will see it red and bloody. Once freed from the skin, it will appear like a cord. Then insert a probe beneath it until, when raised and brought out of the skin, it is suspended by a smooth blind forceps. Then cut another incision near that one about three fingers wide.
Then scrape the skin off the vein until it becomes visible. Then raise it with the probe as before and suspend it with another forceps as before, or cut another incision or several incisions if necessary.
Then tie and cut it at the end of the incision near the heel, then pull and tie it until it comes out of the second incision. Then pull it up to the incision above it, doing this until you pull it out from all incisions. Once completely out, cut it.
If it does not yield to pulling and tying, then insert a strong doubled thread needle and tie it. Then pull it out while inserting the probe beneath it and rotating your hand in both directions until it comes out. Be careful that it does not break, for if it breaks, it will be difficult to tie it.
After tying it all, place on the wound sites wool soaked in a solution of wax or rose oil or olive oil. Treat him until he recovers. If the vein is twisted and has branches with turns towards different directions.
If it is not straight as we mentioned, then do not cut near each of its branches and points of torsion. Suspend them with forceps until you tie them all. Be careful when cutting not to cut or injure the vein, for this will make tying difficult.
Image of the incision used to tie the vein:
Image of the Blind Needle.
Unlike other needles, it should not have a head nor be sharp-pointed lest it damage the nerve. It should be thick and smooth because if it is thin it may cut the nerve.
Chapter One Hundred And Ninety.
In sewing the median nerve.
This nerve originates in the legs, especially in hot countries such as Hijaz and other Arab lands with little rainfall. It may also originate elsewhere on the body besides the legs, due to humoral imbalance occurring beneath the skin.
As it is said, this nerve also arises from the inside of living creatures such as snakes and worms, and from lice and other parasites generated between skin and flesh. The beginning of its occurrence is indicated by severe pain in the leg, followed by swelling at that spot, then the nerve emerges from the site of that swelling.
It seems like a plant or animal root. When its tip appears, it should be wrapped around a small piece of lead weighing between one and two dirhams and tied, leaving the lead suspended from the leg.
Whatever comes out of it, wrap it in lead and tie it. If it becomes too long, cut some of it and wrap the remainder, but do not cut it from its origin before it has all come out, lest you cause contraction, entrance into flesh, inflammation, and bad ulceration at the site.
Therefore, it should be handled and pulled out little by little until it all comes out of the body. Sometimes this nerve can come out to a length of five cubits (approx. 2.5 meters) and ten spans.
I have heard that in one case, it came out to a length of twenty cubits (approx. 10 meters). If it breaks during treatment, insert a reed into its hole and bind it with a long bandage to the body until all matter is emptied from it. Then try to heal the site with drugs for several days.
Then treat it as a tumor. This nerve may have many branches, especially if it appears at the knee joint or the thigh itself, with multiple mouths from which numerous branches emerge. Treat each branch separately according to what has been mentioned earlier.
Chapter Two Hundred and Ninety
In the fissure, there occurs a worm that is generated under the liver, known as the disease of oxen.
This disease is called in some of our lands the disease of oxen because it often affects oxen; it is a small worm that develops between the skin and flesh, moving throughout the body both upwards and downwards.
It can be perceived by feeling her movement from organ to organ until she ruptures the skin at some point and emerges, formed from the corruption of some humors like other worms, animals, and moles in the belly.
Her harm is expected to be such that if she moves through the body, rises up to the head, and reaches the eye, perhaps she will open it and come out, thereby destroying the eye; this happens often. If one wishes to treat her and remove her, then it is only possible when her movement can be perceived.
It is advisable to tie what is above and below her with a strong band, then cut upon her and remove her. If she has buried herself in the flesh and cannot be found, cauterize the place with fire until she is burnt. Her greatest harm is expected to be to the eye, as mentioned earlier.
But if she has reached the head near the eye, tie below her tightly on the forehead, then cut upon her and remove her. It is advisable for the patient to treat himself by purging his body of corrupt humors with laxative drugs and avoiding foods that generate corruption.
Chapter Three Hundred and Ninety
In the fissure, concerning the disease known as the napfer.
This disease called in our land 'the Napfer' is a pain that appears in some organs, then moves from organ to organ; I have seen it as described.
I was called to a woman who was ill in some of the towns, and she uncovered her arm for me; I saw a slight swelling in the vein of her forearm. After a while, I saw that swelling moving with the vein like a worm upwards towards her shoulder blade as swiftly as quicksilver.
If it moved from one place to another, the pain left that spot and settled in her shoulder blade. Then after a short time, it flowed throughout her body until it reached her other arm; she told me that her whole body was rotating as I had seen.
I was amazed by the swiftness of its passage from one member to another, for I had never before seen this disease manifest itself in such a manner until I saw this group suffering from pain that moved from one limb to another; nor had I ever witnessed it with my own eyes as I did in this woman.
I did not deem it possible except that the woman was from the desert-dwelling people, having a dry body and visible veins; hence, the swift movement of the pain became apparent. It is unlikely to appear in this manner among those who live in comfort with moist bodies and hidden veins.
If you wish to treat it and the patient feels pain, if it appears visibly as mentioned earlier, then promptly compress above and below it, and incise until that congested wind breaks forth; then cauterize.
But if you do not see it with your own eyes, treat it by shaking the body and using remedies that disperse wind and break up congestion, such as ground rhubarb and colocynth, and similar drugs.
Chapter Four and Ninety.
On Removing Arrows.
Arrows differ according to their types and the locations in the body where they strike, and as for their differing types, some are large while others are small; some have hollow glass tips while others have solid ones; still others have three points or four.
And some have tongues while others have splinters. As for those that strike vital organs, they fall into two categories: either the organ is hollow, such as the brain, heart, liver, lungs, kidneys, intestines, bladder, and similar ones; When an arrow strikes one of these organs and you observe the signs of impending death that I will describe later, it is not permissible to refrain from removing that arrow from it, for death usually ensues. But if these signs of ill omen do not appear, nor is the arrow hidden deep within the organ, then remove it and treat the wound. Signs of a brain injury include severe headache, dizziness, and fainting, if the arrow penetrates the bone and injures the membrane covering the brain.
But if these signs of ill omen do not appear, nor is the arrow hidden deep within the organ, then remove it and treat the wound. Signs of a brain injury include severe headache, dizziness, and fainting, if the arrow penetrates the bone and injures the membrane covering the brain. And redness in the eyes, redness of the tongue, spasms, loss of consciousness, and vomiting may occur. Blood might issue from the nostrils or ears, speech might be lost and voice impaired. A white, watery fluid resembling gruel may emerge from the wound, accompanied by a meaty serum-like discharge.
If these signs appear, desist from treating the patient and removing the arrow if it has not yet exited; as for the signs of an arrow, when it hits the heart being near the left breast and feels as if it has pierced something solid not something hollow.
Perhaps the arrow has a pulsating motion, and black blood flows from the wound, followed by coldness of the limbs, cold sweat, and fainting. Know that death is inevitable in such case; and if the lung is wounded, frothy blood will issue from the wound.
If the vessels following the neck become swollen and the patient's color changes, with rapid breathing and a desire to inhale cold air, know that if the arrow has pierced the diaphragm in the chest, it will be near the small ribs, causing intense pain.
And all the members of the trunk sigh and move, and if the liver is pierced, intense pain follows with blood resembling liver in color issuing from the wound; and if the stomach is pierced, some undigested food may issue from the wound.
It is evident that if the arrow hits the abdomen and some excrement or intestines protrude from the wound, there is no hope of recovery nor removal of the arrow. If the bladder is pierced, urine will flow.
And if something protrudes from it externally and the pain becomes intense, know that the patient is doomed. As for other members such as the face, eye, neck, shoulder, arm, back, thigh, leg, etc., they are generally easier to deal with.
When the arrow does not hit an artery or vein and is not poisoned, I shall tell you of some cases that I have witnessed concerning such arrows for your guidance: Once an arrow struck a man in the eye socket at the root of his nose.
I removed it from him through the ear on the other side, and his eye remained unharmed. Another Jew had an arrow struck under his eyelid, with only its small tip visible.
A large iron-tipped, square-pointed arrow of composite material was extracted from the Jew's thigh. There was no ear injury and no evil occurrence in his eye. Another arrow, an Arab one, was removed from the neck of a Christian.
A second arrow, having two ears, was extracted from between the shoulders of a Christian. It had become lodged in his throat and was gently drawn out until it was removed. The Christian survived and was healed. Another arrow was extracted from a man's stomach; we thought he would die from it.
After about thirty days, without any change in his condition, the arrow was removed and he recovered. No misfortune befell him. I saw another man struck by an arrow in the back; the wound became inflamed.
After seven years, the arrow came out at the root of his thigh. I saw a woman struck by an arrow in her belly; the wound became inflamed but the arrow remained and did not cause her any harm or interfere with her natural activities.
I saw another man struck by an arrow in his face; the wound became inflamed but caused him little pain, and there are many like this. I also extracted an arrow from a soldier of the sultan's guard that had struck him in the middle of his nose, slightly deviating towards the right side.
The entire arrow had disappeared, so I was summoned to treat him three days after its removal. I found the arrow wound very narrow; I dilated it with a thin probe and he felt no pain. However, he complained of discharge and pain beneath his right ear from the wound.
I hoped that the discharge was from the tip of the arrow, so I applied a medicated dressing with drawing power and waited eagerly for the place to swell and show signs of the arrow. But when I incised him, nothing happened to indicate that the arrow had reached that spot.
So I continued the dressing for many days without any result. Then the wound closed over, and the patient was distressed at his inability to expel it until one day he felt the arrow inside his nose and informed me. Then I applied a strong, eating medicine for several days.
Until the wound opened and I explored it, I felt the tip of the arrow's thin shaft adhering to the bone. Then I increased the incision with that sharp medication until the tip of the arrow became visible to us, and it remained with me for a period of about four months.
When the wound widened and I was able to insert forceps into it, I tried to pull and move the arrow, but it did not yield. So I continued to soften it and manipulate it with various instruments until one day I securely grasped it with forceps, as shown at the end of this book.
And the physicians judged that the cartilage of his nose cannot be restored, but I straightened it and the wound adhered and the patient healed completely without any harm whatsoever. And I inform you of how some arrows are removed to make this a criterion and an example for what has not been mentioned.
For the details of this craft and its particulars cannot be grasped by description nor can they be comprehended from a book. Only the skilled artisan can measure the small by the large, and what is present by what is absent, and infer new works and new instruments for unusual emergencies.
If one masters this craft, I say that arrows are removed from the organs into which they have penetrated in two ways: either by pulling from the point of entry or from the opposite side. Those that are extracted from where they entered.
Either the arrow is prominent at a point of inflammation and can be pulled out without delay; if it does not yield, one should leave it alone until the surrounding flesh decays and becomes easier to grasp and extract. Similarly, if an arrow has lodged in bone.
If it does not yield to extraction, leave it alone for a while and then attempt to pull and manipulate it daily; if after several days it still does not yield, you should pierce around the arrow in the same bone on all sides with a fine awl until the space around the arrow is widened, then grasp and extract it.
If an arrow has lodged in the skull and extended into one of the ventricles of the brain, and some of the symptoms mentioned have appeared in the patient, do not attempt to extract the arrow; leave it alone until the matter clarifies after a few days.
In drawing out the arrow and removing it, if it is deeply embedded and does not yield to traction, use the drill around the arrow as I have described for you, then treat the area until it heals. But if the arrow has disappeared into a part of the body. And if it has disappeared from sensation, search for it with the probe. If you feel it, draw it out using some of the instruments suitable for this purpose. But if you are unable to do so due to the narrowness of the wound and the depth of the arrow's penetration, and there is no bone, nerve or vein in its path.
Then cut him open until the wound is enlarged and you can grasp the arrow and draw it out. If the arrow has two barbs holding it, free the flesh they are embedded in from all sides as much as possible. If you cannot do so by breaking off the barbs and twisting them out, then use any means available to free yourself.
And when you attempt to draw out the arrow from any location, twist your hand with forceps in all directions until it is freed, taking care not to break the arrow as this will make extraction difficult. But if you cannot do so after a time.
Leave it for some time until the flesh surrounding it becomes gangrenous, then return to it as extraction will be easier at that point. If you encounter bleeding during this process, use the treatment mentioned earlier in its chapter. Take great care not to cut any vein, nerve or tendon, and use caution.
Free the arrow using every possible means, but do so gently and carefully, as I have described to you. When drawing out the arrow, ensure that the patient remains in the same position they were in when it was struck.
But if you cannot do this, use whatever means are available. As for the arrow exiting from the opposite side, either some of it will be protruding outside or you will feel its tip through the skin near its exit point.
It opened on him, let it be opened to the extent that the forceps can fit inside, then pull it out; if it sticks to the bone, twist your hand in a circular motion until the arrow affects the bone and makes space for itself, then pull it out.
If not, leave it alone until it comes out on its own. If the shaft of the arrow is still inside, use it to push it out; if the shaft has fallen off and you wish to use a pushing tool, insert the hollow instrument into the tip of the arrow then use it to push.
If the arrow is hollow, use a tool that fits into its cavity to push it out; this will make its exit easier. If the arrowhead is poisoned, do not cauterize the flesh where all of the poison has accumulated if possible, then treat it with what is appropriate for it.
If the arrow is lodged in the chest, abdomen, bladder or flank and is close to what can be felt with the percussion hammer, and if you can open it, do so; carefully avoid cutting any veins or nerves, then remove it.
Then suture the wound if necessary, treat it until it heals. Image of the forceps used to extract arrows:
The ends are shaped like the beak of a bird, crafted such that when they grasp an arrow or other object, they do not release it. They can be made in various sizes: large, small, and medium, according to the size of the arrowhead, its thinness or thickness, and the width or narrowness of the wound.
Image of the hollow instrument:
Image of the solid instrument:
This has a blunt tip like a pestle, making it easy to insert into and push through a hollow arrow.
Chapter Fifty-Nine.
On the letting of blood vessels.
The vessels that are usually let blood from the body, numbering thirty: of which sixteen are in the head, including the two pulsating veins behind the ears known as the temporal veins and the two arteries visible on the temples; also the two veins at the angles of the eyes known as the nazar veins.
The vein standing in the middle of the forehead, and the vein at the tip of the nose, and the two veins on either side of the neck, and the two veins on either side of the upper lip of the mouth, and the two veins beneath the tongue.
And the veins that are cut in the arm and hand are five: one is the Qifal, which is on the lateral side and is commonly called the vein of the head; the Akhal, which is the middle vein composed of a branch of the Basilic vein and a branch of the Qifal, and is commonly called the vein of the body.
The Basilic vein, which is on the medial side and is also called the axillary vein; it is commonly known as the vein of the abdomen and the arm cord, which lies on the forearm and appears clearly above the thumb; and the Asilum.
And the vein between the index and middle fingers has two branches; in the leg and foot there are three veins: one is beneath the knee on the lateral side, the second is the saphenous vein located at the heel on the medial side, and the third is the nerve vein located at the ankle on the lateral side.
And in the other leg there are three veins like them. And as for the two veins behind the ears, their benefit is in the treatment of chronic fevers, migraine, and head sores; and how to cauterize them will be described.
It is necessary to shave the head of the patient and rub his nape with a rough cloth at the location of the veins, then choke him with a cloth until the veins appear behind the ears in their lower positions on the head; then search for them with your finger and where you feel their pulsation underneath your finger, mark that spot with ink.
Then take a sharp lancet, known as the Neshil, and insert it under the vein in the skin until the lancet reaches the bone; then lift your hand with the vein and skin above, and cut the vein along with the skin in an everted manner, the length of the cut being about two fingerbreadths.
After releasing the desired amount of blood, then tie them with bandages and leave them until they heal. As for the arteries in the temples, severing them is beneficial for chronic headaches, severe migraines, and persistent eye inflammation accompanied by intense discharge.
To locate them, have the patient tie a cloth around their neck until the pulse of both arteries becomes clearly visible and palpable under your finger. Then, using a scalpel, gently raise the skin above each artery from top to bottom with your index finger.
And inserting the scalpel underneath, raise the artery upwards and cut it as you did with the other arteries. Release a sufficient amount of blood, then loosen the patient's neckcloth and place your finger on the artery for a moment.
Then apply a bandage and compress, tie it firmly from above, and leave it until healed. The mentioning of these arteries and their cutting and ligating has been discussed in the first book. As for cupping the frontal vein, its benefit is for chronic facial complaints such as boils, ulcers, and blackheads.
And to locate it, have the patient tie a cloth around their neck until the vein becomes visible. Then take the instrument called 'al-Fas' (the axe), which looks like this:
Place the protruding spike at the head of al-Fas on the vein, strike it from above with a comb or similar object, allowing blood to flow according to your desire. Then loosen the patient's neckcloth and bind it until healed.
It is permissible to use a wide-bladed scalpel, but it should not be too sharp-pointed like other scalpels. Its edge should be slightly blunted to avoid damaging the nearby bone, as the blade may break if it is thin.
And the two veins at the angles of the eyes are beneficial for eye diseases such as scurf, redness, and inflammation, as well as facial diseases. To locate them, have the patient tie a cloth around their neck while you stand above their head and cut along a slight diagonal using a small, wide-bladed scalpel.
If the place has no flesh in it, then if the lancet is thin-pointed it may break. Send blood until satiated and apply a bandage. Leave them overnight and remove them. As for cupping of the nose to draw off blood, it is beneficial for acute fevers.
And for severe headache and facial diseases such as the red boil appearing on the nose, especially if chronic, the method of treating it is: Have the patient tilt their head back. Then, using your left hand, grasp the patient's nose while holding a thin, long lancet in your right hand.
And insert it into the center of the nostril itself between the partitions of the nose, for the vein does not appear there by touch. Blood will issue immediately. It is necessary to press your hand on the lancet a little and send blood until satiated, then bind it overnight as it heals quickly.
And as for the buboes, their cupping is beneficial for shortness of breath and the onset of leprosy, and black diseases that appear on the skin's surface such as black patches, boils, and bad sores. The method of treating them is: Have the patient tilt their head back while seated, then have the cupping practitioner stand at the patient's head.
And the patient sits on a chair. Then draw blood from both sides for a wide cupping, then bleed them moderately or according to what you see is needed. Then do likewise with the other vein and remove the band.
And tie both veins moderately so the patient does not choke, and leave them overnight as the wound will heal. And as for the veins on the legs, their cupping is beneficial after cupping the head, as it helps with mouth ulcers, tooth decay, gum disease, cracked lips, and bad sores.
That appear on the nose and around it, and the method of treating them is: Have the patient sit facing you and tie a scarf around their neck. Then pull back their lips and look for the veins which one appears on the right side of the lip and the other on the left side. Then bleed from their darkness.
Similarly, around them are small black veins that should be cut off. If you are unsure about this, go for the largest and most obvious one; do likewise for the two veins in the lower lip.
And as for the two veins underneath the tongue, it is beneficial to cauterize them after treating the lymph nodes in the throat for diseases of the uvula and mouth. The method of cauterizing them is: have the patient sit before you facing the sun, raise their tongue, and look beneath it on one side for a vein and on the other side for another vein, both appearing dark.
Cauterize them and be cautious not to linger in cutting them, for underneath them are arteries. Thus, excessive bleeding may occur from those arteries. As for the three veins cauterized at the elbow, it is customary to do so in most people, and cauterization occurs on both sides.
Either cauterize with a wide, curved or olive-shaped iron heated over a fire, or cut with a scalpel. Here is the shape of the wide, curved iron:
It should be wide as shown to fit the purpose of opening swollen, filled veins that are prominently visible and contain thick, dark blood. Here is the shape of the olive-shaped iron:
This scalpel is narrower with a sharper point, suitable for cauterizing thin veins containing yellowish blood. Here is the shape of the scalpel:
This scalpel suitable for cutting comes in various widths and thinnesses according to the size of the veins, and it can be used to infer others; it is well-known among craftsmen.
And of these three veins, cauterizing the basilica vein is beneficial as it draws blood from diseases under the throat and neck leading to the chest and abdomen. The cauterizer should be careful and leave some part on the neck because underneath it lies an artery. If one errs and pushes the iron too deep, it may cut that artery.
So cauterizing it with a heated iron should not be done, but rather cut with a scalpel. If the basilica vein is not clearly visible, avoid it and proceed to another one or ask for some of its branches.
And if you want to tie off its place, it will be clear, and cut it with the fine scalpel as mentioned earlier. But if you want to tie it specifically at that location, before tying up the arm, examine the site until you recognize the pulse, then mark its location with ink.
Then tie the arm and cut the vein with a fine scalpel as mentioned earlier, ensuring that the cut is away from the artery's location. When you see swelling at the site marked with ink upon tightening the ligature, know that it is the swelling of the artery, so avoid it.
If you see blood gushing like a boy's urine, and it is thin and red, know that it is arterial blood. In this case, quickly press your finger on it for some time, then remove your finger. If the bleeding stops, which happens often, then tie up the arm.
And leave him, warning the patient not to neglect it. Let it rest on his neck without moving until it heals. If the bleeding does not stop and you are unable to control it with medication, ligate the artery if its ends become constricted and the bleeding stops.
Or take a skinny needle and split it, taking one half and tying it around the vein tightly with thread and sutures for another day. If bleeding stops, then treat it as mentioned earlier using catgut ligatures to stop bleeding; otherwise, cauterize its blood supply.
Know that if the wound is small and the ligature on the arm is secure, it is beneficial to tie off the dark-colored vein because it draws blood from above the head and below the body since it consists of a branch of the basilic vein and a branch of the cephalic vein as mentioned earlier.
It is necessary for the ligator to be on guard against it, as there is a nerve below it. If the scalpel goes too deep and hits the nerve, numbness will occur which may not recover entirely, although this nerve is sometimes palpable.
If it is not palpable in some people and thin so that it cannot be seen, then make your incision with a fine scalpel avoiding the nerve as much as possible. If the vein is between two nerves, cut it lengthwise. As for the cephalic vein, its ligation is beneficial because it drains blood from the head.
Eye diseases can be benefited from this procedure, especially if you wish to separate it; use the olive-pointed scissors or the wide laurel-pointed scissors because all vessels are sound since there is no artery nor nerve beneath it.
However, when performing phlebotomy, you should avoid cutting the muscle's head with the scissors and seek the soft spot. It is not harmful if it is not struck on the first attempt; phlebotomy can be repeated until success is achieved, although in some people, swelling may occur if it is not struck on the first attempt.
But that swelling causes no harm, and as for the manner of phlebotomy, its complications, and what should be done to repair it, know first that phlebotomy is either used solely for preserving health.
And it is either used for diseases, and what is used for preserving and maintaining health and preventing the occurrence of diseases is that phlebotomy should be performed in one of the three veins in the elbow, namely the cephalic, basilica, or median cubital vein, and it should be done at the beginning of spring if signs of plethora appear.
And phlebotomy should be performed on a Sunday or Wednesday after noon has passed three hours, but for the phlebotomy used in diseases, there is no limited time; it can be done anytime day or night as needed.
And at every hour and time, except for children until they reach fourteen years old and elderly people who have exceeded sixty years of age. If anyone intends to undergo phlebotomy.
It is necessary to cleanse the stomach before phlebotomy with a gentle purgative if there is much retained food, so that no offensive matter from the stomach is drawn into the vessels during phlebotomy. Do not perform phlebotomy on the drunkard or intoxicated until that state has passed.
And phlebotomy should also be avoided after an attack of fever, vomiting, diarrhea, excessive sexual intercourse, fatigue, exercise, sleeplessness, and fasting. Then examine the thickness of the humors before that to see if the blood is thick.
If possible, he should consume foods, drinks, and drugs. Then he enters the bathhouse if nothing prevents him or engages in some exercise to make his blood flow freely and prepare for surgery as previously mentioned. He should aim to cleanse his mind that day from all negative emotional distractions.
He should also rid himself of physical afflictions like excessive fatigue and intercourse, as well as mental disturbances such as grief, anger, fear, etc. He should prepare the necessary items according to common practice, such as perfumes, incense, lamps, etc., to the best of his ability.
The surgeon sits on a cushion higher than the one for the patient. He then takes out his arm, washes it twice or thrice, ties the bandage with the tourniquet and twists it twice or thrice, ensuring that the tension is moderate.
For if the tension is not moderate, either excessive tightening will prevent blood flow, or too much slackness will also hinder it. After tying, the surgeon should rub his hands together to warm them.
Until the veins swell and become visible. Then, the surgeon wipes the knife with a little old oil, especially, before placing his left hand's index finger gently on the vein beneath the point he intends to cut, so that the vein does not slip away from the blow. Some veins may slip away like a bowstring during cutting, while others may be filled with wind, causing the knife to sink into them and deceive the surgeon without opening the vein or opening it only narrowly.
Therefore, the surgeon should be steadfast and cautious in all these matters. If he cuts and opens the vein with one stroke, well and good. Otherwise, he should repeat the stroke beneath or above that point quickly if there is no swelling.
If the patient bleeds or swells, leave him for a day or two without tightening the bandage, as it may cause hot inflammation. Do not let him enter the bathhouse. If he wishes to continue with the operation, and if the knife went deep but the opening was small and the blood flow was thin...
I feared that the intended amount of blood might not come out, so I prepared the lancet in the same hole and moved it straight forward, adding a little more to the opening. Do this swiftly before the area swells, for many people experience swelling even with a small incision.
If it has swollen, do not resort to it again for it will be of no use. Apply some castor oil on it instead; it facilitates blood flow and is better than any other oil or fat in this context.
Use castor oil in all bloodletting procedures where blood flow is obstructed. The medication Farouk al-Tariq and Shakuniza can also be applied to the site, as they help liquefy thick blood.
If a large swelling occurs at the bloodletting site, especially if the person has not been bled before or if the vein was opened barely, quickly apply a warm compress of saltwater-soaked sponge and hold it in place for some time to reduce the swelling.
It is preferable to do this after the blood has completely flowed out of the vein or another one. Any remaining discoloration or greenness at the site after a few days is not harmful. If desired, you may apply a solution of myrrh and frankincense.
Or you may use the juice of fennel or similar substances. Swelling and discoloration often occur during bloodletting from the basilic vein; if it feels soft when pressed, it indicates harmful swelling, so avoid applying any of the mentioned remedies.
If blood from an artery is released, tie off the site with a forceps to arrest bleeding and then treat it like any other wound until it heals. Each person should have their blood let according to their constitution and the prevailing color of their blood.
If the blood is black, let it flow until it turns red. If it is thick, allow it to become thin. If it is sharp, let its edge subside. For robust and strong individuals who require a significant amount of bloodletting at once...
He should expand the veins and use a broad lancet. If it is weak, then its opposite should be used. It is preferable to draw it out repeatedly with a narrow opening. The best tool for bloodletting is a polished, sharp-edged one without a guard.
This method of bloodletting is safe from excessive bleeding and nerve cutting. It is easier than crosswise or lengthwise bloodletting, especially if the patient has hairy skin; in such cases, it is preferable to feed him bread soaked in pomegranate water before bloodletting.
If the lancet is polished and blood has been drawn out three or four times, then if the patient's temperament is cold, he should be given bread soaked in syrup of pomegranate juice, honey syrup with saffron, or fragrant rose syrup before bloodletting.
However, if hair growth occurs during bloodletting due to excessive bleeding, then water of meat broth and diluted fragrant rose syrup should be given. Perfume with incense should be applied on his chest, and all the aforementioned methods in the chapter on hirsutism should be used.
For purging, the blood should be let out gradually, little by little according to one's strength on consecutive days.
For those who want to purge and let blood again, with a strong body, this should be done after seven or nine hours from the first bloodletting. For those who wish to draw blood away from a particular side, they should wait two or three days before letting blood again.
However, if there is a lot of blood in his body that has become heated and inflamed causing fever, then the blood should not be drawn out all at once. Instead, it should be taken out gradually until hair growth appears after ensuring that all conditions for bloodletting are met. And place your hand on his pulse during bloodletting to prevent death in place of hair growth, as this often happens due to ignorance or negligence of the phlebotomist. This should not be done if you intend to free the arm and let blood again.
The mouth of the vein has closed and the exit of blood is difficult. Do not press upon it forcefully or twist it violently, for this would be harmful indeed. Either allow it to open again on its own, or gently remove with a scalpel what has congealed at the mouth of the vein.
Or hold upon it a little salt dissolved in water, or some of the drug Farouk or Shakhshinaj, and gently press until blood comes out. If the vein is swollen, leave it alone.
Do not touch it until the swelling subsides. If necessity requires opening the vein again, either do so above that spot or in another arm or vein.
As for cupping the arm vein, use instead a mixture of Akhzal and Basilaq if they are not available or hard to find, as it is composed of them both. To perform cupping, place your hand in hot water until the skin reddens and the vein becomes visible. Then tie a bandage around it with moderate tightness.
Then cupping should be done at a slight angle, neither horizontally nor vertically. The opening should be wide and the cupping should be performed slightly above the wrist joint. If blood does not flow out, place the hand back in the hot water bowl and allow the blood to flow into the water.
Continue until you achieve your purpose. In summer, you may not need to return the hand to the hot water bowl, while in winter, blood flow into the water is more likely. Cupping at this vein is preferable to cupping any other vein. For beneath it there is no pulsating vein or nerve. Cupping at the Aslim vein on the right hand is beneficial for liver ailments. To perform cupping, tie the wrist with a bandage or press it with your hand after immersing it in hot water until the vein engorges.
For beneath it there is no pulsating vein or nerve. Cupping at the Aslim vein on the right hand is beneficial for liver ailments. To perform cupping, tie the wrist with a bandage or press it with your hand after immersing it in hot water until the vein engorges. It will become very apparent to the touch, then cup it at a slight angle. Even if you cut completely around it, it will cause no harm. Be careful not to probe too deeply with the scalpel, as underneath there is a nerve and tendons are exposed. Then return the hand to the hot water.
Let it bleed until blood flows freely. Then, immerse it in warm water to prevent the blood from clotting at the mouth of the vein and blocking its flow. Once enough blood has been removed, apply grease and salt to the vein to prevent it from sticking quickly.
And similarly, you should do with every narrow vein. As for the benefit of cupping from the left hand's side, it is useful for treating spleen ailments, and you should perform cupping in this manner as you did previously on the second side. And as for cupping on the right side, its benefit is for lower body diseases such as uterine ailments.
And for retention of menses, kidney diseases, chronic sores on the thighs and legs, and similar ailments. The method of cupping is to place his leg in warm water, apply pressure with the rubbing tool until the veins appear, then tie it above the ankle joint where the vein emerges near the heel.
And many veins branch out on the face, so cup at its largest vein or at the heel where they converge, for that is better and safer. If you cup on the face, be careful not to touch the nerves underneath.
And make your cupping for him like this: pretend as if you are about to cut him, using a dull blade. If blood does not come out, place his leg back in warm water and let the blood flow until it is emptied. If the cupper mistakes the vein on the first attempt.
So move the cup upwards slightly for the second attempt. The safe place has no harm if you are careful about the nerve, as mentioned before. And do the same with cupping on the other leg, equally. As for the vein of the thigh, its location is as previously mentioned, at the back of the outer side.
And the benefit of cupping is for hip pain if it is caused by hot blood. And its method: have the patient enter the bath quickly, then tie his thigh from below the buttock to above the heel with a thin, long cloth strip, and you will see veins appearing only like this.
When the veins appear, cup at any visible vein. Either on a false cut or with a real cut using a scalpel or incising knife. The safe place is usually quite faint, so if you cannot find it.
And there appeared to the touch not at all, so cut some of its branches, those that appear on the back of the foot towards the little finger and the index finger, being careful of the nerves, and let go only as much blood as you wish.
Then release the tension and apply a piece of gauze to the site of the incision and secure it. The wound will heal quickly.
Chapter Sixty-Nine
On Cupping (Hijamah) and its Method of Use
Cupping vessels can be made from horn, wood, copper or glass. There are two types of cupping: one with cauterization and bloodletting, and another without cauterization.
And this cupping [without cauterization] is of two kinds.
And cupping can also be done on the sides of the neck, under the lower jaw, on the shoulders, on the upper back near the buttocks, on the insides of the arms, on the thighs, and on the calves.
Cupping draws blood from the superficial vessels beneath the skin, therefore it does not cause weakness like bloodletting. It should not be used with fire or without fire in any disease that is accompanied by fullness until the entire body has been purged.
If cupping is necessary due to illness or custom, it should be performed at the beginning, middle, or end of the month, at any time.
Some people have an excess of blood in their bodies, causing heaviness and headaches when it needs to be removed by cupping. Others experience fullness, redness, and heat in the face, head, and neck. Still others experience dryness, darkness, and inflammation in the eyes or itching at the site of cupping.
And some people may laugh excessively, while others may taste blood in their mouths or have blood on their teeth and gums. Some may experience excessive sleep, while others may see visions of blood, redness, wounds, and injuries [in their dreams].
Especially if it is in the middle third of the month, we should then prescribe cupping at that time after two or three hours have passed during the day. The benefit of cupping the nape of the neck is that it helps relieve heaviness in the head and prevents water from building up in the eyes.
However, it is preferable that this should come after the evacuation of a large quantity of phlegm from the body. This cupping may also be used instead of venesection of the temples, but it should not be employed on those with cold temperaments or who are suffering from an illness, for it would cause them great harm.
It is therefore not advisable to use this (cupping) on the elderly, those with cold-headedness, or those who have become accustomed to it to the point that they forget.
Therefore, it is recommended to command the cupping practitioner to lower his hand slightly with the cup to avoid causing fainting. As for cupping on the nape of the neck, it serves as an alternative to phlebotomy on the temples and behind the ear.
Therefore, it benefits those with asthma, shortness of breath, headache caused by difficulty breathing, and coughing. However, one should raise the cupping vessel on the nape slightly, for if it is placed too low and causes suction, it may weaken the heart and stomach.
And as for cupping on the temples, it benefits from sharp pains in the head, inflammation of the eyes, migraine, congestion, and pain in the roots of teeth. It serves as an alternative to phlebotomy behind the ear, and one should command the cupping practitioner not to insert the needle too deeply lest he cut a vein and cause bleeding.
And cupping below the collarbone benefits from ulcers in the mouth, tooth decay, and similar diseases of the mouth. It can also serve as a substitute for phlebotomy on the veins of the lips. As for cupping on the shoulders, it benefits from palpitations caused by fullness or heat.
As for cupping on the lower abdomen near the hip bones, it benefits from what phlebotomy on the three veins of the temple, eyebrow, and forehead benefits, for it attracts blood from all the superficial vessels in that area and attracts those vessels from deeper ones until it reaches the three deep veins.
It is necessary for the barber to avoid examining the site as it is bare of flesh and beneath it lie nerves and vessels. The single cautery applied to the sciatic nerve benefits hemorrhoids and anal ulcers.
It is necessary to order the barber that the cautery be large and made of copper because the site requires strong heat and perhaps a glass cautery may break, causing many cauterizations. The cauteries for the legs should be less filled in order to avoid excessive swelling.
For it attracts blood from the entire body, benefits chronic pains in the kidneys, uterus, and bladder, regulates menstruation, treats boils and skin diseases, and acts as a substitute for cupping and leeching, except that it greatly weakens the body and often causes dizziness. The cauteries for leeches are similar to those used for bloodletting from the legs.
To apply the cautery, first place it empty and draw out a moderate amount of blood. Do not prolong the application of the cautery but place and remove it quickly to allow the humors to enter the site evenly and repeatedly until you see that the site has turned red and opened up.
When the redness of blood appears, then cauterize and gradually decrease suction. Afterwards, examine the patient's condition; if they have loose flesh with open pores, it is sufficient to cauterize once only, lest the site become necrotic.
Order the barber to widen and deepen the cautery slightly, regulate suction gently with slight movement. If there is thick blood present, cauterize twice: first to open a path for thin blood and watery fluid, second to ensure complete removal of thick blood.
If the blood is extremely thick, cauterize a third time to complete the procedure. In general, one cautery is sufficient for removing a small amount of blood, but more cauteries are needed for a large quantity of blood, especially if the blood is thick.
It is necessary to make a deep incision and moderate in the case of shallow skin depth. No ointment should be used when applying bandages, nor water or anything else that might harm the patient. Those with thick, hard, tough skin and small pores should be particularly careful.
It is necessary to anoint the places of bandages with open, ground, melted ointments. Especially in summer time, such as henna ointment, violet ointment, sweet almond ointment or cucumber seed oil should be used.
And in winter, ointments such as narcissus or crocus or papaya or saffron and the like should be used. If the weather is cold and dry, olive oil or sesame oil or butter or beeswax and the like should be used.
If the patient has large pores and soft flesh, ointment should be avoided. These patients should wash their bandages after cupping with rose water or cold water or raven's grape juice or cucumber juice or pomegranate juice and the like. But those whose blood is moist should avoid these waters.
They should wash their bandages with vinegar or water of oak and sumac and the like. But those whose skin is thick should wash their bandages with old wine or olive oil or beeswax paste or papaya paste and the like. Cauterization should be avoided in the bathhouse and after bathing.
Rather, cauterization should be performed two hours after leaving the bathhouse. No one should sleep immediately after cauterization. The patient and the cauterizer must not eat or drink before or after cauterization.
First, check if the patient or cauterizer is jaundiced. If there is sharpness and inflammation in their blood, they should take cooling agents such as pomegranate and hibiscus with vinegar, chicory and purslane, and make their diet consist of fruits, lamb meat, and chickpeas and the like.
He whose temperament is cold, it is advisable that he drink honey water and gruel of cooked barley or Bazoori Sunkin. He should consume medium-aged perfumed wine which is between old and new. Let his food be limited and make his diet partridges and quails, sparrows, and young pigeons. On the day of cupping and bloodletting, let drink exceed food.
It may be advisable for some people to drink the Farouq Tiryak or Musk Dawa or Shiltha medication before cupping and before bloodletting, or afterwards, to strengthen the main organs and relax the blood. It should not be given to the intoxicated.
The cuppings that are done without restriction are those placed on the liver, spleen, breasts, abdomen, heart, kidneys and hip socket, as these organs cannot tolerate restriction. Rather, they are intended to draw blood from one organ to another.
When we place the cupping on the breasts in cases of engorgement or use it to remove cold wind from an organ, we also place it on the abdomen and heart. This clears the organ, warms it, and alleviates pain by releasing that cold wind.
Cupping may be placed on the kidneys if there is a blockage or stones present. With sufficient drawing, it might open the blockage or dislodge the stone from its place. Similarly, it can be used on the liver and spleen for cold wind that disrupts them. These cuppings are typically performed using only suction.
Cupping can also be performed with fire or using water. For ailments like shoussha, fill the cupping vessel with warm water alone or water boiled with certain herbs suitable for that purpose.
Then place it on the desired location, secure it, and remove it repeatedly according to need. This is the method of cupping used with fire:
The mouth of the cupping vessel should be two fingerbreadths open and half a cubit deep. On one side, there should be a small hole large enough for an awl to pass through, made of Chinese or yellow copper with thick rims.
A flat, smooth cup is prepared so that it may not harm the member when placed upon it. In its center there is a hollow made of copper or iron where the candle with fire is placed. This cup can be made large or small according to the diseases.
If you wish to use it, then the cups of boys and children are not like those of men. And as for how this cup is placed with fire on the member, it is that a tightly wound cotton wick or small candle made of wax is ignited and placed in the center of the cup's hollow.
So that the fire may rise upwards within the cup, and not burn the patient's body. Then it is placed on the member, with a finger on the hole mentioned until we secure the cup; then we remove our finger.
And the vapor comes out through that hole, and the cup adheres to its place. Then the wick is extinguished according to how it was lit, and relit if necessary. But the cup used in treating dropsy with water has no solid tube or hole.
But it is used by filling it with water and placing it on the member only, and its appearance is:
And the larger this cup is to hold much water, the better.
Chapter Seventy-Nine.
On treating hemorrhoids.
The cautery is used in most cases on members where cups cannot be placed, such as those that are too small like the lip and gum, or those that are bare of flesh like the finger and nose.
And its use is that you take a cautery from among those that are in fresh, pure water of the fountains, and leave it for one day and night in fresh water until it becomes hungry and nothing remains in its belly. Then the body is first purged with phlebotomy or cupping. Then the affected member is wiped.
Until it reddens, then the cautery is placed upon it. When it fills up and falls off, if possible, the place should be cupped with a cup. Otherwise, wash the place first with vinegar then with plenty of water, wipe and squeeze. If blood continues to flow after the cautery falls off, that is good. Then dip a cotton cloth in cold water.
Place it above until the discharge stops. If blood is abundant, sprinkle powdered gum or bdellium, or similar astringents until the bleeding ceases, or apply crushed chickpeas to the site.
Leave it until the chickpeas adhere to the site, then remove them if needed without touching the wound. If the dressing cannot be reapplied, wipe the area with fresh blood.
Or insert a needle into the site until some blood flows out, then apply it. If it feels blood, it will adhere to the area. To remove it, sprinkle incense, salt, or ash upon it.
The Third Chapter.
Regarding Fractures.
This chapter also contains what is necessary for the practice of medicine, namely, the reduction and treatment of dislocations and fractures of bones.
Know, O my sons, that many physicians who are ignorant and unlettered, as well as the common people, claim this book to be of no value, having neither read nor studied the books of the ancients.
For this reason, this art has become extinct in our country, and I have never encountered any proficiency in it. However, I have benefited from what I have learned through my long study of the books of the ancients and my diligent effort to understand them, and by following this path throughout my life.
I have compiled for you in this chapter all that I know about it. And after years of practice, I have brought it close to you, freed it from extraneous matter, abbreviated it as much as possible, and made it clear and concise, illustrating it with many diagrams of the instruments used therein.
This is merely an addition to the clarity I have attempted in the preceding chapters, and all power belongs to Allah, the Most High, the Greatest.
Chapter One.
At the beginning of this chapter, it is necessary to mention general principles and categories regarding fractures of bones before discussing each member separately. Therefore, I will first present some general statements and sections. You must first understand and grasp its reality, both you and those who come after you who are eager to learn this noble art.
So I say that whenever one suffers a fracture, dislocated bone, sprain or fall, it is not advisable to rush immediately to reduce it or splint it or both. Unless there is a hindrance such as weakness of power, or the person who suffered it is a child or very elderly, or the time is extremely hot or cold.
He should then restrict his diet to cold grains, poultry and fish, avoiding wine, tough meats, overeating, and any food that enriches the blood vessels excessively until the swelling subsides and there is no risk of further discharge to the affected area.
Then the patient should return to his usual diet, but if the fractured bone becomes fixed in its place, he should avoid foods that are too thick and sticky, such as dates, rice, lentils, porridge, and beef brains. And eggs, fried fish, thick broths and similar foods, for with this regimen healing of the fracture will be quicker and better. Know that in strong men and elders, broken bones cannot always heal perfectly.
For the bone edges of strong men and elders are rough and brittle, although some bones may heal like those of young children. However, nature produces a substance resembling glue on all sides of the broken bone, which binds and holds it together.
And it binds them together until they become strong and firm like their original state, causing no hindrance to his actions.
And therefore, the patient's diet should include foods that are thick and sticky as mentioned earlier. Know that fractures differ in type according to the different parts of the body, for a fracture of the leg bone is not like a fracture of the skull bone, nor is a rib fracture like a spine fracture.
And similarly, all other parts of the body are different from one another. We shall come to a detailed description of each type of fracture in its respective chapter, as fractures also differ among themselves.
It may be that the fracture is a simple one without splinters, or it may extend along the bone with splinters and fragments both sharp and blunt. The fracture may also occur with skin wounds and tears, or it may be a slight displacement.
For each type of fracture, there is a specific method for its reduction which will be explained in detail later. One way to identify a bone fracture is by its deformity, swelling, prominence upon touch, and crackling sensation when pressed with the hand.
However, if there is no visible deformity, no crackling sensation upon touch, no prominent bone feeling upon pressing, and the patient does not complain of much pain, then it may not be a fracture but rather a dislocation, a hairline fracture, or a slight displacement. In such cases, one should refrain from moving or manipulating the limb.
But apply to the area one of the medications that will be mentioned later, then gently traction is applied. Know that if a bone fractures and breaks into two pieces without any splinters, each part becomes completely separated from the other.
It is not permissible for you to immediately attempt reduction and alignment of the fracture before the swelling has subsided. If there is already heat and inflammation, leave it alone until the swelling has decreased, then reduce it with gentleness and skill.
Know that the reduction and alignment of a fracture without splinters is easier than one with splinters. If there are splinters present, then traction must be applied in both directions, whether it's an arm or leg fracture.
Either use your hands if the limb is small, or use two ropes, or a rope and hand together. Ensure that the limb is placed on a level surface in its natural position so that when the fracture is extended, the displaced fragments may be gently guided back into place with skill and care.
Strive your utmost not to cause the patient any pain or swelling through your actions. Your goal is to approximate and hold one of the bone fragments in its proper position with the other, gently touching and feeling them with your hand. If you find anything out of place, repair it and reduce it as much as possible.
Beware of excessive cutting and strong squeezing, as many ignorant ones do. Often they speak of doing so, causing burns or contusions to the limb, which I have seen happen repeatedly.
After trimming, suturing and tying the limb, ensure its rest and tranquility. Warn the patient not to move it during wakefulness or sleep, nor during coughing or sneezing, nor at any other time. Ensure that the bandage is applied in a way that prevents pain.
If the patient feels pain or discomfort with a certain bandage, transfer it to another that does not cause pain, ensuring it is straight and even.
To avoid deformity if it heals, know that the method of tying broken limbs is as I have described. Be aware that broken members differ in size and shape; those that are small like the arm, finger, hand, etc.,
For small members, bandages should be soft and flexible; for large ones like the thigh, back or chest, they should be wide and firm to evenly compress the member on all sides without causing any displacement.
After completing trimming, begin applying the appropriate plaster. Gently place a bandage on the fracture site, then begin wrapping it around the fracture itself for three or four layers depending on what the limb deserves. Tighten your hand slightly with the bandage, then bring it up to the upper side of the fracture.
Tighten slightly less than at the fracture site, then gradually unwind and loosen until you achieve a suitable tension. Then take another bandage and wrap it around the fracture.
Wrap around again, then bring the bandage down to the lower side of the fracture. Repeat the process of tightening and loosening as previously described. Then place a layer of soft padding or cloth between the layers to correct any deformity.
If there is no deformity, do not alter anything, then wrap it with another bandage and straighten it using these tight layers of cloth if there is neither swelling nor heat in the member.
If there is swelling or heat, apply something to relieve the swelling and reduce the inflammation, then leave it for some days before tightening with splints. The splints should be made of half-rounded reeds prepared wisely, or they can be made of grape vine wood.
These splints are made from fir wood, date palm leaves, papyrus, or similar materials that are available. Each splint should be of this size and shape.
However, the splint placed directly on the fracture should be thicker and wider than the others. The length of the splint should be determined according to the size of the broken member. The shape of the splint is as follows:
Then bind the splints with another bandage, just like the first binding, and secure them from above with tight strings as mentioned before, ensuring that the binding is tighter at the site of the fracture. The further away from the fracture, the less should be the tension.
It is preferable that the strings are of moderate thickness and stiffness, particularly made from moistened cotton thread. It is an error to use thick strings like those made from twisted cotton strips, as seen among ignorant people.
Because excessive tension occurs with thick strings, and thin strings are also unsuitable as they do not allow for the desired tension. There should be no less than the width of a finger between each splint.
If the patient is discomforted by the ends of the splints after binding in the correct places, place padded linen or wool beneath them to prevent any harm. However, if the fracture is accompanied by a wound and there is a tear in the skin, we will discuss this separately.
Know that not every broken member should be immobilized with splints from the very first day. If the member is large, splints should not be applied until five or seven days have passed, depending on your assessment of the risk of heat and inflammation.
This is the description of the plaster used by the ancients for fractures, dislocations and contusions. It is a general, brief recipe that sets bones and suits most temperaments, especially children and women as it is neither too hot nor cold.
And it is that you take the flour dust which adheres to the walls of the millstone during its motion, and knead it as it is without adding egg white. Make your dough neither thick nor thin. Then apply it.
Another plaster for setting fractures, dislocations and contusions: Take ten dirhams each of mastic, ladanum, tragacanth, bdellium, frankincense, and styrax. Five dirhams each of myrrh and incense. Twenty drams of aloe and twenty drams of Armenian or Roman earth clay. Grind all the ingredients together and mix with aloe water or egg white if the patient's temperament is hot. This plaster has a good composition, it sets broken bones quickly and suits most people due to its balanced nature.
Another plaster beneficial for fractures and contusions: Take ten dirhams each of frankincense, mastic, white lead. Five dirhams each of myrrh and incense. Six drams of tragacanth. Twenty drams of Armenian earth clay. Grind finely, sift, knead with water or egg white and apply.
A plaster for dislocations and displaced bones, to relieve pain and headaches caused by them. Take some clean wool, soak it in vinegar and cooked oil, then apply it to the affected area. This plaster does not have setting power.
However, it is excellent for relieving hot swellings and driving away pains particularly. Another plaster for setting broken bones: Take papyrus leaves and leaves of bramble-poppy, grind them together and apply wet. Another brief recipe used when a bone is displaced.
And if you wish to remove the rest of the tumor, take equal parts of cinnabar, camphor and woad, grind them together and knead with varnish if the member is not hot. If it is hot, use carob water or plain water and apply it.
A stronger plaster for analysis than the first one is used when a hard tumor forms due to bone injury. It is made from equal parts of the roots of camomile, cottonseed, saffron, and henbane, and half parts of frankincense, myrrh, and gum arabic.
He strikes them all together and kneads with water of vinegar or sweet water or oil, according to the heat of the member and its quietness. But Hippocrates did not mention in his book that it should be placed on the broken member upon setting.
Except for the cerotto made of wax and oil alone, which should be moderate between hardness and softness. And Galen saw that things with voids containing some heat, such as myrrh, ginger, and balm, should be placed on the broken member upon setting.
A plaster that benefits for weakness and pain is taken of sesame, lentil, human hair powdered or bird feather, camomile, and salt, equal parts are crushed and sieved, kneaded, and bound with it. And as for the amount that should remain on the bandage.
Then when it is dissolved, it should be looked at. If no pain or itching occurs and the broken bone does not move from its place, do not remove it for many days. But if severe itching or disturbing pain or swelling appears.
So hurry up and remove it at that time, do not delay it at all. Then take a soft cloth or sea sponge moistened with warm water, dip it in and wash the place until the itching stops and the pain subsides. Then let the member rest for a while.
Then apply the white wool dipped in vinegar and oil or rose oil ointment on it for a night to secure the hot tumor, reduce swelling of the member, and alleviate its pain. Then return it to gentle stretching and light bandaging, do not stretch it as before.
And tend to it until it heals. If you see that the tumor, redness, pain, swelling, and all symptoms have disappeared completely and there is no need for bandaging and stretching, then return it to its original state as before. But if none of what we mentioned occurs in the member.
Only cut it open after three days or four or five, or even up to twenty days, depending on what you see regarding the state of the limb. And only do this when fracture has become necessary and flesh has begun to congeal.
Then also increase tension at this point more than you did initially. Also, continue to provide thick food for the patient as mentioned before. But if you find that the site of fracture has dried out and wasted more than it should, know that nourishment is not reaching it.
Rinse it with warm water every time you open it, doing so once every three days. Reduce tension slightly, for by this action nutrition reaches the limb and heals quickly. But what ignorant practitioners do in breaking the limb again is wrong.
This is because they did not first set the bone correctly but rather reduced it incorrectly, which was a great error on their part. If it had been correct, the ancients would have mentioned it in their books and practiced it, yet I have seen no trace of it from anyone. And it is not permissible to do this.
Chapter Two.
On accidental fractures of the head.
The types of accidental head fractures are many and varied in their shapes, with diverse causes. Among them is the fracture caused by a sword strike, which can be such that it breaks all the bone until it reaches the peritoneum beneath it. As when splitting wood.
And this type of fracture is called 'qdumi'. Or it can be that the sword cut only a part of the bone, breaking its surface without penetrating all the way through. This type is called a 'general qala' fracture. The injury in both types may be large or small.
Among fractures is the one that is crushed or contused, caused by a blow from a stone or falling onto a stone. This fracture may be deep, approaching the membrane beneath the bone, or it may be on the surface of the bone.
And the injury in both types may also be large or small. And there is the fracture that is hidden within the bone, like the splitting of a hair, which is a minor concussion.
Therefore, this type of fracture is called 'hairline,' and it is the kind that results from a fall or blow by stone or similar, where a part of the bone enters into itself and becomes displaced like when copper is struck by a blow causing a piece to enter within.
More commonly, this occurs in the moist bone head of children. Shattered fragments that are both sharp and blunt may occur with all these types of fractures, and their treatment will be discussed in its appropriate place. All these types of fractures will be identified through inspection.
To examine it with probes and remove putrefied flesh from it, but as for the hairline type, it is recognized by exposing the bone and wiping and painting on it with ink, the fracture will appear black. As for treating fractures, first one should look at the patient's symptoms.
If you find among his symptoms clear indications of fear, such as vomiting blood, extension, loss of consciousness, hoarseness, fainting, high fever, reddening and inflammation of the eyes, or similar symptoms, then do not approach nor treat him. For death is certain in most cases with these symptoms.
But if you find symptoms that do not deter you and you hope for his safety, then proceed with treatment. For when the injured person comes to you at first after being injured, especially during winter days.
In any case, do not strive to remove the bone before the fourteenth day, especially in winter days. And even in summer days, do not hurry to remove the bone before the seventh day lest what is under the bone should putrefy and display the symptoms we have described.
If a bone fracture has reached the meninges of the brain with comminution and inflammation, then it is not permissible to cut off the shattered diseased part as I have described for you. Rather, shave the head of the injured person.
Examine the bone from whichever side you can manage and according to the shape of the wound and what affects the patient. If blood appears or a hot swelling when exposing the bone, then deal with it appropriately.
This means that you should fill the place with cotton wool soaked in rose water and oil, then cauterize the wound until the swelling subsides and bleeding is secured. Then proceed to reset and extract the bone in one of two ways.
The lone face [operation], it is to cut the bone with a fine, narrow chisel; this is its shape:
Then use another cut after this one, somewhat wider; this is its shape:
Then also use another cut, still wider than the second; and it is necessary for you to have various cuts of different widths and lengths, some being broader than others, and some shorter than others, and all with very sharp edges; let them be made of Indian steel or good iron.
And use gentleness in striking the cut so as not to shake the head and harm it; for if the bone is strong and hard, do not drill around it before using the bores which they call 'non-immersed' bores, but rather use those called 'non-immersed'.
Because it does not exceed the limit of the cranial bone towards what is behind it, for the drill has a round edge beneath its sharp point like a ring or small circle which prevents it from penetrating too deeply and crossing the thickness of the bone.
And you should take many of these drills, each suitable for the thickness of that bone, so that you have a drill fit for every skull with its sharp point equal in length and width to the thickness of that skull; here are pictures of three types. Large, medium, and small drills:
As for the method of boring around the broken bone, place the drill on the bone and turn it with your fingers until you know that the bone has been penetrated, then move the drill to another spot, leaving a space between each bore equal to the thickness of a finger or thereabouts.
Then cut with the chisels what is between each pair of bores, doing so with utmost gentleness as mentioned earlier, until you can remove the bone either by hand or with some other tool prepared for that purpose.
Like the gentle forceps and tweezers; and it is necessary to be very careful that neither the drill nor the chisel touches anything of the dura mater. When you have freed the bone from its attachment and removed it, do not strip [the dura].
Smooth the remaining roughness of the bone with another tool, similar to the saw but finer and more delicate. If any small bones or fragments remain, remove them gently using your available tools.
Then treat the wound afterwards with sutures and ointments mentioned previously. The other aspect of this procedure is straightforward, far from difficult as Galen mentions and praises highly, which he himself states. First, you should expose the part of the bone at the location where the fracture is most severe and apparent, so that beneath it you can place the tip of this crescent-shaped tool, which looks like this:
The blunt part should not cut anything, while the sharp edge faces away lengthwise. Place the blunt part against the peritoneum and the sharp edge against the bone, then strike the tool on one side only.
With a small hammer until all the bone is cut gently, while turning and being secure from the membrane, without causing any frightening incident at all. Even if the surgeon is the most ignorant and inexperienced person, he will still succeed.
If any part of the membrane adheres to the bone in some places, scrape it off gently with the blunt tip of the tool and remove it without harm or fear.
However, if the bone fracture has not reached the membrane and only the surface of the bone is broken with rough fragments remaining, then you should remove those roughnesses and fragments gently using various sized probes adapted for this purpose, choosing the most appropriate one according to the requirements of the situation.
The shape of the fractured bone and its edges should be considered when using probes. Begin with a broader one, then proceed to narrower ones until you reach the narrowest.
As for minor cracks and slight fractures, each one should be treated according to what is most appropriate for its correction. This is something that is not hidden from anyone with even a basic understanding of this field, as we have written and explained regarding major fractures.
If the membrane remains exposed after removing the bone, you should take a piece of cotton cloth corresponding to the size of the wound, dip it in rose oil and place it on the mouth of the wound; then take another folded or triangular piece of cloth. And dip it in wine and rose oil, placing it on the first cloth and doing this with the utmost care so as not to weigh down the peritoneum; then use it from above a wide bandage, pulling it only enough to hold the wound closed.
And leave it like this for a day or two until the inflammation has subsided, then remove it and afterwards use powders made from such things as are efficacious in case of dryness like red iris root, nard powder, frankincense and zedoary etc., making poultices with them.
And sprinkle them dry on the wound; in general, use a medicine that clears without burning. Always ensure during treatment of the wound that it remains clean, without oil foulness or dirt, and do not allow pus to accumulate.
For if pus accumulates on the cerebral membrane, it corrupts and inflames it, causing great harm to the patient; likewise, it may appear in the abdominal cavity of the head when the bone is exposed, especially if its treatment is neglected.
If you observe blackness on its surface, know that if the patient exhibits the symptoms mentioned, he is surely doomed; although this blackness may have resulted from a medicine applied to it, whose potency could cause such discoloration.
It is necessary to take a portion of honey and three parts rose oil, mix them well together, apply the mixture to a cloth and place it on the peritoneum; then treat it with whatever remedies are appropriate until it heals.
Chapter Three.
How to set a broken nose.
Know that the upper part of the nose, which is composed of two bones, alone can be broken; whereas the lower part, being made of cartilage, does not break. Instead it may exhibit symptoms such as swelling, deviation or inflammation.
If one of its sides breaks, you should insert the little finger into the nostril hole and push this fracture back in place from inside using your index and thumb fingers from outside until the nose returns to its natural shape. Do this gently and ensure that you do not cause pain to the patient with your actions.
If the fracture is at the top of the nose and the finger cannot reach it, then a thick rounded probe should be used to set it in place. If the fracture is on both sides, do likewise. The splinting should be done on the first day after the fracture.
If possible, and if not then after the seventh or tenth day when the swelling has subsided, insert a cotton wick into the nostril hole if the fracture is on one side, or two wicks if it is on both sides.
And let the wick be thick enough to fill the nostril hole. Some of the earlier splinting practitioners have mentioned that the wicks should be smeared with butter and changed daily, but I do not recommend this. Instead, the wicks should be dipped in beaten egg white mixed with flour.
Then leave the wicks in place until the bone has healed and the cartilage has hardened. You can also insert goose feather tubes into the nostrils after wrapping them with soft gauze to create a more secure splint, ensuring that the patient's breathing is not obstructed.
This is not necessary; if you wish, you can make the tubes or use wicks alone. If there is swelling during your procedure and inflammation occurs, bandage the nose with cotton wool soaked in camphor or linseed oil and rose water, or with some diacilicon ointment.
If there is no inflammation, then bandage the nose from outside with a paste made of semolina flour and almonds mixed with beaten egg white. Then place a soft compress on top without binding it tightly, especially if the nasal bones have only suffered a minor fracture.
Or if the bones are crushed, then make an incision over it and remove the fragments using a suitable instrument. Then suture the wound and treat it with appropriate healing ointments. If there is an internal injury in the nose, treat it with wicks and use lead tubes. Until it heals.
Chapter Four.
To reset a dislocated lower jaw.
If the lower jaw is fractured but not accompanied by an injury to the eye, and if it was fractured externally without being broken in two or dislocated towards the inside, then its diagnosis is easy.
If the fracture is on the right side, insert the left hand's index finger into the patient's mouth and similarly if it is on the left side use the right hand's index finger. Then gently lift the fractured condyle from inside outwards to reduce it.
Place your other hand outside the bone to guide its reduction. If the jawbone is broken in two, use a bandage on both sides to align and reduce it. If the fracture occurred between the teeth, allow them to grow back together.
Or separate them and secure what you have reduced with a gold, silver or brass wire. Then place a plaster on the fractured jawbone followed by a folded cloth and finally apply a firm bandage or a piece of leather strap equal in length to the jawbone. Then tie it firmly from above according to your preference and ensure that the dressing is secure so that it does not displace. Order the patient to rest quietly and make his diet soft foods. If you notice any change in shape on any side, proceed with its removal on the third day.
Then tie it firmly from above according to your preference and ensure that the dressing is secure so that it does not displace. Order the patient to rest quietly and make his diet soft foods. If you notice any change in shape on any side, proceed with its removal on the third day. Then fix what you have immobilized using fine sand mixed with egg white or flour paste after removing the plaster. Place a soft compress on the dressing, leaving it until it adheres and there is no change in the condition of the bone.
Do not remove it until the fracture heals and becomes solid. This usually takes three weeks. If a hot swelling appears during this period, apply the remedies mentioned earlier to alleviate it until the swelling subsides.
If the fracture is accompanied by an injury to the eye, and if any bone fragments have become detached from it, be gentle in removing those fragments using appropriate forceps. If the mouth of the wound is narrow, dilate it with scissors according to your need.
Then, if those fragments are removed and nothing remains of them, suture the mouth of the wound if it is wide; otherwise, apply one of the dressings suitable for that purpose. The wound will heal together until it heals.
Chapter Five
If the collarbone is broken, reduce (set) it.
Most commonly the collarbone breaks at its anterior end near the shoulder joint. Its fracture can occur in one of three ways: either it cracks into two pieces without any fragments, which is the easiest type to reduce (set).
Or, it may occur with fragments, which is more difficult to reduce. If the fracture occurs without injury, arrange for two assistants: one to hold down the arm on the side of the broken collarbone and another to extend the neck toward the opposite side.
Then, use your fingers to align the fracture until its shape is as it should be without any displacement or deformity. If you need more traction, place a ball of cloth or wool under the patient's armpit.
The bone should be at the desired length, and you should extend and elevate the collarbone while pressing on the ball with your hand until the fracture is properly aligned. If you cannot pull the end of the collarbone out due to it being deep within the wound, then have the patient lie on their back.
Place a moderate pillow under the patient's shoulder and have the assistant press down on their shoulder until the deep collarbone rises up. Then, align and reduce the fracture using your fingers.
If you feel that a fragment of the collarbone has broken off and is moving around, carefully incise over it and remove the fragment gently. If the fragment is stuck in the bone, use one of the cutters prepared for that purpose to break it. After this, place under the collarbone the instrument that preserves the peritoneum, which is made of wood or iron and looks like this:
It resembles a spoon without a handle, with a width according to the size of the bone you are dealing with, and a length suitable for working with. It should have two ends: one wider and one narrower as shown.
If the wound you made to remove a bone fragment is wide and you fear inflammation, then sew it up with stitches. But if the wound is small or you are uncertain about inflammation, then cleanse the wound and dress it according to its extent.
If inflammation appears, then apply oil of roses and vinegar or honey to the wound. As for setting a broken bone without cutting, use a bandage made from flour paste mixed with egg whites. Then place a soft splint on it, and put a ball under his armpit if necessary. Then take a long bandage, about an inch wide, and wrap it around the splint and dressing. Finally, apply a plaster made from thin board. It should be three fingers wide and similarly long, then wrap it in a cloth. Then wrap that cloth with the plaster into the middle of the bandage where it is positioned over the fracture, and tie the bandage around the fracture as usual. And here it is tied around his neck, under his sound armpit, and under his affected armpit. Tie it repeatedly on each side, as you have seen how strong the fixation of the fracture is, which should be clear to you.
And your aim should be that the plaster does not come off from the broken bone. So you should visit the patient every day. Whenever the bandage loosens and you see that the plaster has shifted, tighten it again. Also, make sure the patient sleeps on his back with a small pillow under his affected armpit at night.
To raise his shoulder blade off his side and thus elevate the broken collarbone above the elbow, or tie his arm to his neck. Do not remove the bandage unless there is an incident of itching or inflammation for twelve days.
Then renew the plaster if necessary. And continue to apply pressure until the fracture consolidates and the collarbone heals completely, which usually takes about twenty-eight days. Sometimes it may take less than that in some people.
Chapter Six
In the treatment of collarbone fractures, most fractures occur at its broadest part. However, it may also break at its extremities; therefore, it is determined by touch whether the fracture is in the middle or at an extremity. Treatment depends on how the bone is fragmented.
Reduce it and bring its ends back to their natural shape using any means possible, then apply powdered frankincense mixed with egg white and tragacanth gum over the affected area. Place a folded linen cloth on top, followed by a wide bandage made of wood.
Make it as thin as the collarbone or slightly wider. If there is any bulging underneath the bandage at any point on the collarbone, smooth it out using tragacanth gum until the bandage lies evenly. Then secure it with a long headband from above.
Tie it firmly and ensure the bandage does not slip from its place. Check the bandage daily; if it becomes loose, tighten it and adjust the bandage accordingly. The patient should lie on their sound side with the fractured collarbone elevated for twenty days.
After twenty to twenty-five days, remove the bandage. This bone is not prone to break or dislocate again. If there is any splinter protruding and piercing under the skin, make an incision over it and remove it. And do as mentioned for collarbone fractures regarding treating heat inflammation if any occurs.
Chapter Seven
On the treatment of rib fractures
The chest may fracture in its middle, though this rarely occurs. However, its extremities are more prone to break and dislocate. Symptoms include severe pain, difficulty breathing, and coughing when a fracture occurs in the middle of the chest, causing it to tilt downward.
Sometimes, blood may be coughed up, and the depression in the fractured bone can be felt. To treat this, have the patient lie on their back with a pillow between their shoulder blades. Then press down on both elbows and bring the ribs together using both hands, gently manipulating them back into place as much as possible.
He agreed until the bone regains its intended shape, then apply a splint and bandage over it, place on top of it a support made from a thin slice of willow or broomstick, wrapped in cloth. Then, gently secure it around the broken bone so that it does not slip off, pass the bandage around to the back in circles several times and tighten it moderately, then regularly check the bandage and whenever it loosens, retighten it.
And if necessity demands its removal due to pain or swelling at the site, promptly remove it and treat what has appeared there appropriately, then replace the splint if necessary. Face him and insist on pressure until he recovers.
Chapter Eight
If ribs are broken, know that they fracture only in the hard parts that follow the spine and its ends towards the front; this is evident due to the softness of these places. Recognition of this is not difficult by examining with the fingers.
And fix them by aligning the fracture with your fingers on the affected side until it assumes its intended shape, then bandage and tighten the broken bone with a support if necessary. If the rib fracture is inward, it will cause severe pain.
And like the crackling sound heard in those with pleurisy due to the bone piercing the pleura, it also causes difficulty in breathing and coughing up blood excessively, making treatment difficult. Many remedies have been devised for this by the ancients.
Among them, some said it is preferable to feed the patient foods that produce wind and gas to cause the abdomen to expand and push the fracture outward. We reject this as it may cause hot swelling if it has not already occurred, and if it has, it will increase and aggravate it.
And some suggested applying a cupping glass to the site and then sucking strongly, which is closest to the appropriate method except that it fears drawing out blood to the site due to its weakness. Others said the area should be covered with wool soaked in hot oil.
The wound becomes inflamed between the ribs until it fills up, and the bandage is even. Then wrap it around evenly. After that, treat the patient with a diet and medication for healing wounds. We feared for the patient, so we did not cut on the spot and expose the broken rib. Instead, we brought forth the instrument that preserves the diaphragm, as previously described. We then gently cut the bone with it and extracted it.
Then, if the wound is large, we close its lips with stitches and treat it with ointments until it heals. If inflammation occurs during this process, promptly apply olive oil compresses on the area and also administer internally something to alleviate the inflammation.
He should lie on the side that promotes sleep until he recovers.
Chapter Nine.
Treatment of hernias of the back and neck.
As for the cervical vertebrae, fractures are rare and dislocations are more common. The same applies to the lumbar spine. If such an injury occurs, you may wish to know whether it will heal or not. If you observe that his hands are limp, numb, and paralyzed, with no movement or sensation in them despite being pricked by a needle without feeling pain, then know that recovery is unlikely and he will likely die.
However, if he can move them and feels the prick of a needle, know that the spinal cord is intact and the patient will recover with treatment. If a lumbar hernia is similar to this, you may wish to know whether it will heal or not.
Observe his legs. If they are also limp and similar to the condition of his hands, then if he lies on his back wind and feces will pass without control, and if he lies on his stomach urine will pass without control. If he lies on his back and cannot pass urine despite wanting to, then know that he is lost and do not bother with treatment. If this does not happen, the case is less severe. Treat by applying something internally to alleviate the inflammation.
To apply hot compresses of rose oil alone or with burnt garlic cloves, place them on the affected area three times a day until the inflammation subsides. Then, apply a moistened gauze dressing and bandage it tightly in place. Instruct him to remain at rest.
If the patient feels no pain when lying on one side, he should sleep on that side until healed. However, if a bone splinter or fragment has remained after fracture healing, do not cut open the skin to remove it. If the wound is large, bring its edges together with stitches and treat it with healing ointments until healed. If the last cervical vertebra (coccyx) fractures, do not insert the thumb of your left hand into the anus.
Align the broken bone with the other hand as best you can and apply a splint or bandage if necessary. Then secure it tightly in place.
If you feel a bone fragment inside, make an incision over it, remove it, and treat the wound as previously mentioned until healed.
Chapter Ten
Treatment of Hip Fracture
Rarely do the thigh bones break; however, if one does break, it usually fractures at its ends and lengthens, tilting inward, causing pain, numbness, and weakness in the leg on the affected side.
To treat, run your hand along the bone until you reach the fracture. If the fracture is only at its ends, align it as best you can to resemble its natural shape.
If the fracture is in the shaft or has tilted inward, lay the patient on their back to align and reduce the fracture. Once reduced, apply a splint and secure it with a wooden or leather brace, then tighten it firmly.
Do not fear displacement of the fracture or loosening of the splint. Fill in the spaces between the toes to ensure even tension and instruct the patient to sleep on their back or unaffected side if swelling occurs.
Leave off pressing it and heating it until the hot swelling has subsided, then apply to it what quiets it as mentioned earlier. Then return to your pressing and heating it as is proper; but if fragments or pieces of bone appear in it, it should not be removed.
And do not touch it, but smooth it from the outside as mentioned earlier, and leave its pressing until it heals.
The Eleventh Chapter.
On Setting Fractures of the Arm.
The arm is what is between the elbow and the head of the shoulder. If it breaks, press it back into place on either side, taking an oiled, smooth, stout splint of this form:
And tie its ends with bandages, then suspend it from an elevated place and have the patient sit on a chair. Then lay the broken arm on the splint so that the armpit rests firmly in the middle of its curve, and then suspend something heavy from above.
Or a servant extends it downward, then the physician straightens the fracture with both hands until the fragments return to their proper position. The other method is for the patient to lie on his back and have his hand suspended from his neck by a bandage.
Then order two servants to each hold one end of the fracture with their hands, one above it and one below it, and extend each towards his side. And if you wish for stronger extension, tie a bandage under the fracture and another above it, then have each servant extend his end towards his side.
If the fracture is near the elbow, then one bandage should be placed under the armpit and another under the fracture towards the elbow. And similarly, if the fracture is near the elbow, the bandage should be placed on that spot and on the elbow itself.
Then gently align the fracture without force until the fragments are properly aligned and well united. Then bind it tightly if there is no hot swelling; but if a hot swelling appears, leave it unbound for seven days and apply a poultice of moistened lentils soaked in vinegar and ointment of roses.
Even if the swelling has settled, then pull it taut. The method of pulling is to apply a bandage on the fracture, then place a fresh cloth wrap over the bandage, and finally bring the arm up to rest on its own elbow with the hand open and placed on the shoulder.
Carry the cloth and tension on the elbow and arm so that the arm serves as a splint if there is no impediment preventing you from doing so and nothing has changed regarding the broken bone. But if you fear any change, then use splints.
And to place on the fracture itself a splint that is wider and stronger than other splints, with one finger's width between each splint, and the length of the splints should be according to the fracture plus three fingers' width from both sides.
Then tighten on the splints with the tension mentioned at the beginning of this book.
And your tightening should be strongest at the site of the fracture.
And whenever you are after the fracture, the tension should decrease. So if you find that placing the splints and tightening as mentioned when you first set the bone is useful now, then do so.
However, if you fear heat in the swelling, then leave off the tension and splints until the seventh day as mentioned before. Then examine the bandage every three days to ensure that there is no itching or inflammation at the site, nor does excess tightening prevent nutrition from reaching the member. All of this will be as described.
If you are confident that nothing of this will happen, then do not remove the bandage until many days later. The patient should lie on their back with their hand on their stomach and a bolster filled with wool placed under their elbow in moderation.
And examine at all times, day or night, to ensure that the shape of the broken member does not change nor does the bandage become loose. If this happens, then repair it with your effort. Also, maintain the patient's diet on the level mentioned previously, starting with a soft diet until the bone begins to harden.
It is not permissible to make the patient's diet harsh, as it is customary for the arm and leg bones to harden in forty days. At that time, it becomes necessary to remove the bandage, use the bathhouse, and treat with appropriate ointments, especially if the fracture was severe and displaced.
Do not remove the stitches for fifty days or two months.
Chapter Twelve
In treating fractures of the arm.
The arm is composed of two bones called the radius, one small which lies next to the thumb and the other large which is situated underneath the small one from below. Sometimes only the large bone may be fractured or only the small one may be fractured, while at other times both may be fractured together.
When the upper radius bone is fractured, its treatment is easy and recovery is quicker. But when the lower radius bone is fractured, its treatment is poor and recovery is difficult. The worst case is when both bones are fractured together. If the upper radius bone has been fractured
The doctor treating the fracture should make the reduction gently and carefully until it is aligned. If the larger bone has been fractured, then greater pressure should be applied during reduction. If both bones have been fractured together, then much stronger pressure must be used during reduction.
During reduction, the hand should be placed on a pillow with its palm facing down. The thumb should be held higher than all the fingers, and the little finger should rest on the ground beneath them, while the elbow is bent and folded under itself.
And the pillow should be at the same height as him to avoid causing discomfort for the patient.
Then a servant should extend the arm from below either by hand or using a bandage, and another servant should do likewise from above. The doctor should then reduce the bone until it returns to its best possible position. If there are any bone fragments, they should be removed.
Return each fragment to its proper place as much as possible. If there is a sharp fragment that has pierced the skin and cannot be reduced, cut into it and remove it according to the method described earlier. A separate section has been devoted to fractures accompanied by wounds.
If swelling and heat appear during the initial reduction, take a cloth soaked in rose oil and beeswax mixture of medium thickness, not too thick or too thin. Apply it to the affected area with gentle pressure until the swelling subsides.
Remove the plaster, apply a prepared dressing made of flour and egg white. Then bring the splints, with the one placed on the fracture being longer and stronger. Know that in most cases there are six splints for the arm.
If the fracture is in one bone or both bones together, make your bandage stronger and tighter at the site of the fracture. Whenever you wrap the bandage upwards or downwards, loosen it a little from what was mentioned earlier.
And let the bandage wrapped around the fracture be a soft, moist one and not too hard. And let the thread used to tie it be medium thickness linen as we described earlier, and examine the limb and bandage after some days.
If something happens that needs fixing, such as an itch appearing on the limb, then soak the limb in warm water until the itching stops. Leave the limb unrestrained overnight to rest, then resume bandaging.
If the bandage has loosened and the bone has shifted, then fix it all as much as you can. Also, if nutrition is not reaching the limb due to excessive tightness of the bandage, loosen it a little and leave it for some days until nutrition reaches the limb, then retighten it.
If no improvement appears as mentioned, do not remove the bandage until after about twenty days. Then suspend the patient's arm to their neck and keep the arm level with the shoulder. The patient should avoid sudden movements and sleep on their back.
Know that this fracture of the arm usually heals in thirty days, or sometimes in forty-two days, and perhaps even in twenty-eight days, depending on the nature of the person's constitution and their strength.
Chapter Thirteen.
In setting fractures of the hand and fingers.
Most often, the palm of the hand and the fingers are not subjected to fractures but rather to contusions. So whenever a fracture or contusion occurs in the hand...
It is necessary for the patient to sit cross-legged with a chair in front of him at eye level.
Then he places his hand on it extended, then the bone-setting servant stretches it and the physician aligns it until it has healed properly. At that point, it is necessary to apply a splint and bandages if there is no heat inflammation. Then a plaster cast should be applied above it according to its size.
And he has wrapped it in a soft cloth, if the fracture is towards the palm of the hand then make a ball shape from the cloth and tell the patient to grip it with his fractured hand. Then tie it with a long cloth strap.
And let the plaster be made of soft leather that can bend with the skin as the hand is moved, and tie it firmly in place. If the fracture is on the outer side, then make one plaster above and another below the hand so that the hand remains open and elevated.
Then wrap the bandage around like the hand rotates and tie it between the fingers. If the fracture is on one of the little fingers, if it's the thumb then align it properly and wrap it with the hand. And if you wish to make a small plaster cast for it to keep the fracture in place.
And do not move it, if the fracture is on any of the other fingers such as the middle, index, ring or pinky then align it and bind it with the next healthy finger or bind all together. It is better, or place a small plaster cast upon it.
As we have said about the thumb, and examine him during healing and afterwards for any heat inflammation. Respond to it as necessary whenever something like that occurs, as mentioned repeatedly in its description.
Chapter Fourteen
On the Setting of Fractures of the Thighbone.
The thighbone often breaks and it is apparent because it rotates towards the front and back, its treatment involves tying a bandage above the fracture and another below it while the patient lies on their face.
Then extend each bandage towards its side evenly, if the fracture is in the middle of the bone. But if it is near the hip joint then tie a soft bandage made of wool or similar material.
When the thighbone approaches the pelvis near the hip, let one ligament be above the fracture and the other below it. Similarly, if the fracture is near the knee, then place the ligature near the knee with the traction downwards; thereafter, the physician should realign the bone using both hands until it resembles its natural form.
The bone should be set well and when it is, the bandages and traction may then be applied. But if inflammation occurs in the limb, allow some time for it to subside before resuming treatment.
As for the traction, it should not be wrapped too tightly around the fracture like a turban twice or thrice and left with some slack. Then wrap the leg so that the heel is near the buttock, insert a long thread between the thigh and the lower part of the leg near the knee, leaving both ends from above on either side.
Then wind the remaining part of the turban around both the leg and thigh, place padding on the thigh at the exact location of the fracture to make a single bolster for the shinbone, and fill the gap between the thigh and leg with linen wadding to even out the traction.
Begin strong traction from the center towards the fracture, winding three or four times around it. As you move away from the fracture with the ligament, decrease your tension and make it gentler and looser.
Then proceed to the two ends of the thread inserted between the thigh and leg, tie them around the nearby padding above, then bring each end downwards until they reach behind the knee. Tie them together there as well, pulling both ends gently.
So that the ligature does not slip from its place, leave the traction undisturbed as long as there is no pain, swelling, inflammation or similar complaints in the limb. But if any such thing occurs, promptly remove the traction and correct it according to what has been mentioned repeatedly.
If there is a splinter embedded in the bone, it should not be realigned if possible; otherwise, cut upon it and remove it. Treat the wound as mentioned earlier until it heals. Sometimes the thighbone may fracture without involving the shinbone, requiring no additional padding on the leg.
As mentioned in the arm and forearm, except that its fracture is not accompanied by lameness unless it breaks alone without being attached to the leg, in which case its owner must always limp.
Know that the thighbone strengthens in fifty days or a little more or less, all according to the variation of temperaments and other conditions.
Chapter Fifteen.
In fractures of the knee joint.
The knee joint rarely fractures, but it often dislocates. If it does fracture, it is either a fissure or a fragmentation of its parts, which may occur with or without laceration.
All of this is determined by examination, and its fracture is reduced by pressing the fragmented parts together with the fingers until they meet and align as much as possible with gentleness and care. Then a splint is applied and, if necessary, a circular bandage is used for immobilization.
Then tie the bandage above the affected area, and follow all the procedures mentioned earlier for other fractures, such as applying hot compresses, until it heals.
Chapter Sixteen.
On the reduction of leg fractures.
The leg has two bones, one thick called the tibia and the other thin called the fibula, both of which are subject to various types of fractures similar to those of the arm bones. Therefore, its reduction is like that of the arm and the procedure is the same. If both bones are broken, the leg will rotate in all directions. If only the thin bone is broken, the leg will rotate forward. If only the thick bone is broken near its lower end, this should be obvious to you.
Therefore, use traction and reduction techniques to apply splints accordingly. However, if the leg fracture is a severe one with many fragments, then gentle traction should be used, taking great care in its reduction.
In addition to the work done on the arm, when you have finished reducing and immobilizing the leg fracture, take two pieces of pinewood used for flattening the spaces between floorboards or made from date palm leaves, and place them along both sides of the fractured bone.
Select ones that are slightly thick and not from the linen, let their length be equal to the length of the leg from the knee downwards. Then wrap each one twice in a bandage along its length, placing one on the inner side of the leg and the other on the outer side.
Let it be from the knee to below the foot, then tie the bandages at three points on both sides and in the middle. With this splint, the leg will be prevented from moving sideways and will remain steadfast. A wooden splint of the same length as the leg may also be used.
Insert it to prevent movement, especially in cases of fracture accompanied by a specific wound. Then examine the leg daily and pay close attention to any swelling or inflammation, etc. If anything like that occurs, address it accordingly until it heals. The leg bone takes about thirty days or so to unite.
Chapter Seventeen
On the fractures of bones in the leg and toes.
As for the heel, it never breaks, but the bones of the leg and toes may fracture. However, fractures in the toes are rare, with dislocation being more common.
If the bones of the leg are fractured and you see that some have shifted towards each other, have the patient stand with their foot flat on the ground, then place your foot on the elevated bones and press down gently to realign them.
Until they return to their original positions. Then bring the splint and bandages from above, placing a small board with flat ends underneath the heel of the foot. Tie the foot securely after wrapping it in cloth and any other necessary materials.
After three or four days have passed, release the bandage. You will find that the bones are straight and aligned, whether they were fractured or dislocated. Proceed accordingly based on what you see. As for fractures in some of the toes, reduce and align them according to the method described for reducing fingers of the hand.
Then make a splint for the fractured toe along its length, making it slightly wider. Then place the board described earlier under the foot and tie it securely. If two or more bones are fractured...
Make a bandage for each finger, graduated according to its size, and place it in a soft cloth. Stretch the sole plate below the foot, ensuring that each head of the plate's heads is pressed evenly against the sole of the foot for proper adjustment.
And you must not forget to examine all that we have mentioned to you concerning the signs of fractures, and treat each sign accordingly.
Chapter Eighteen.
On fracture of the woman's hipbone and pubic bone.
When the woman's perineum fractures, seat her upright and gently lean her backwards while holding onto her from behind. Then allow the midwife to insert cotton into her vagina until it is full and resembles a ball inside her.
Then shake the woman gently and elevate her hips slightly until that cotton comes out to rest at the vaginal opening like a ball. Then place a support on her back, so that whenever she wants to urinate, the cotton can be removed gently for her to do so.
And return it as it was originally inserted. Then return to her first support, doing this for seven days or so until it heals. If you wish, you may also insert a sheep's bladder into her vagina by tying a reed tube onto its mouth and inserting the entire bladder into her vagina.
Then blow into the tube forcefully until the bladder inflates inside the vagina, causing the fracture to heal. Then fill it with cotton and keep her on bed rest as previously described until she recovers. As for fractures of the pubic bone in men or women, use what has been mentioned for their treatment.
And treat it as described for fractures of the hipbone. These strange fractures are not common, especially if one has some experience and understands this book well; the fracture itself usually indicates its treatment.
Understand the correct method of treating and reducing it, especially for fractures of the neck of the thighbone. If a man's thighbone fractures at its neck, insert an ostrich bone into his penis, then wrap it with bandage and leave it for three days or so until healed.
Chapter Nineteen
In case of fracture with wound.
It is necessary that if a person has a fracture with wound, especially if it is a large bone such as the thighbone or the armbone or similar, to hasten and perform bloodletting from its onset provided the conditions for bloodletting are present as previously mentioned.
However, if the wound is bleeding profusely, it is necessary to hasten and cauterize it using powdered niter. If nothing else is available, then proceed with reduction of the fracture on that same day without delay.
If no inflammation occurs, then allow the fracture to remain undisturbed for nine days until any inflammation subsides. Do not approach it on the third and fourth day in case of ill effects.
If the fractured bone is protruding through the skin, then carefully push it back and align it with your hands using gentle pressure. If you are unable to do so manually, use this instrument made of iron which should be approximately seven or eight fingers in length. Adjust its size according to the wound.
Therefore, the physician should have three or four of these instruments prepared beforehand according to the size required for each type of fracture. They should be slightly thick and not bend under pressure during use.
The tip of the instrument should be sharp with a slight bend at its end, tapering from thickness at the top to extreme thinness towards the bottom. Its shape is as follows:
It is called in Greek 'perma', meaning a small lever. The sharp, curved tip should be placed on the protruding end of the bone and gently pushed until the bone returns to its original position and the fragments are approximated.
If the tip of the fractured bone is thin and not gripped well by the instrument, then cut off the end of that bone so that the instrument can secure it. If you still cannot reduce the fracture as described, then use one of the cutting instruments mentioned earlier to cut it accordingly.
Alternatively, if possible, use one of the saws to divide it. Then remove any remaining rough edges and splinters from the bone. If after reduction, there is severe pain that persists, know that the bone has not returned to its normal position.
If you are able to restore it to its natural place, do so; this will greatly benefit the patient. Once the fracture has healed, dip a cloth in strong black vinegar and apply it, especially if it is summer. Do not use any ointment or greasy substance on the wound.
To prevent putrefaction and corruption, then use dressings when the bone has been set. Leave the wound exposed by making a hole in the bandages with scissors equal to the size of the wound.
And beware, with great caution, not to pull on the wound along with the fracture. Many ignorant physicians have done this and caused either death or the loss of a limb for their patients. Let your pulling be gentle and unlike the pulling used in other fractures.
If the wound is foul or large and you fear some of the bad symptoms we have described, do not apply dressings. Instead, make bandages from stiff cloth and bind it tightly.
If, after a day or two, you see that pus has begun to form in the wound, remove the cloth soaked in the liquid. Then apply ointments and dressings such as we usually use for wounds, like the four-ingredient ointment, etc., and loosen the bandage.
And examine the wound every morning and evening until it heals. It is also advisable to elevate the limb so that pus drains downward easily. If many days pass without the wound adhering or the discharge ceasing, know that there are small bone fragments remaining.
It is not permissible to search the wound with forceps. Any bone fragments that are clean should be removed and taken out. If they are dirty and cause pain and inflammation, then cut them away and remove them as much as possible.
If the wound exhibits inflammation, gangrene, or any other type of putrefaction and corruption, then treat each manifestation with its corresponding treatment as described in this book.
When a large bone is broken and presses on the member, such as the thighbone or armbone, do not attempt to pull it out or remove it. Often, attempting this results in death. Rather, leave it alone until it rots, for it may fall off by itself after twenty or thirty days.
If at that point the wound appears treatable, then treat it; otherwise, leave it alone.
Chapter Twenty
On treating complications that arise after some fractures.
Such complications often occur during the healing of fractures, especially those near joints; they distort the shape of the limb and may even impair its natural function.
If the complication is fresh, use astringent drugs such as myrrh, bdellium, frankincense, and aloe vera, mixed with vinegar, egg white, or wine.
And apply it to the complication with pressure, binding it tightly and leaving it on for several days without removing it, then removing it and repeating the process until the complication disappears, God willing. Alternatively, use a tightly fitted brass plate.
Lead has the property of removing all that is excessive in the members. If the complication has hardened and become severe, and it is necessary to remove it, make an incision above it and cut away or scrape off the excess bone until it disappears, then treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-One
On treating fractures when the limb remains thin after healing.
If a bone fracture has healed but the limb remains thin and weak afterward, this may be due to many reasons. One of the causes may be excessive tying of the ligaments with improper binding, too tight binding preventing nourishment from reaching the limb, excessive massage, performing movements at inappropriate times, or weakness and insufficient blood in the patient's body.
The treatment for this is to nourish the patient's body and strengthen it until blood becomes abundant in it, use baths, induce happiness and pleasure, then apply warm pitch plaster on the limb to draw nourishment to it, or perform moderate massage with lukewarm water. Until food passes through it and returns to its natural form.
Chapter Twenty-Second
In the treatment of broken bones that are displaced and do not align properly.
Whenever a limb appears crooked after healing from a fracture or the bone is deformed, causing the member to appear ugly and misshapen. However, if the limb has not lost its natural function, it is not permissible to accept the claim of those who say that the limb should be broken from its root, despite many ignorant physicians and bonesetters practicing this in our land.
This action is greatly reprehensible and leads to great harm; however, if the deformity and complexity are recent, then it is permissible to use water that has been boiled with softening herbs such as papyrus leaves and roots, acacia fruit, and similar substances.
And the dressing should be done with softening cataplasms such as well-made diacylons, or else papyrus sap mixed with chicken fat and sherg oil, and dressed with it; or fig paste beaten with pigeon dung, among other medicines called "disjoining ointments".
And if the complexity cannot be resolved through continuous, gentle manipulation and movement of the limb in all directions at all times, then it is necessary to resort to treatment with iron.
It is necessary to carefully cut through the skin above and release the connection of the bone, then cut away any excess deformity or bone with fine saws, taking care and caution in this matter. Afterwards, treat the wound as mentioned earlier until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Third
When a jaw joint dislocates from its proper place and causes immobility, deformity of the member, and severe pain to the patient, it is imperative to promptly reduce it back into position.
One should never delay in doing so, as any delay may cause swelling around the area and make reduction of the jaw more difficult. Therefore, one must not wait nor move nor stretch the affected area while it is still swollen, as this often causes tremors and severe pain for the patient.
However, if this condition presents itself, one should first proceed to perform bloodletting on the patient, then leave it alone until the swelling subsides a little. Then, soften the member with warm water and oil before gently replacing it and treating each organ as mentioned in its respective place.
I have arranged the sections of the jawbone according to what has been mentioned regarding fractures, from top to bottom of the body.
Chapter Twenty-Four.
In treating the lower jaw.
Rarely do the jawbones dislocate except in rare cases, and dislocation occurs in one of two ways: either they slip out of their places easily and remain somewhat relaxed, or they become completely dislocated until they relax. Up to the point where the patient's saliva flows uncontrollably, and he cannot hold it back nor can he close his mouth or control his tongue for speech. But if the dislocation is slight, then in most cases he can return it to its place with ease.
However, if the dislocation is complete, one should not rush to put it back in place too quickly nor delay doing so. Instead, a servant should hold the patient's head steady while the doctor places their index finger into the origin of the jawbone inside the mouth on the affected side.
Or if the dislocation is on both sides, he should insert both his index fingers inside the mouth and use all his other fingers from outside to align it. Then, he should instruct the patient to relax their jaw and move it towards each side while the doctor guides the jaw back into place.
If returning the jawbone to its place is difficult, especially if both are dislocated, use a bandage soaked in warm water and oil to facilitate their return without delaying it. Once they have been returned and aligned, and the patient's mouth has closed but has not fully relaxed, then apply compresses made of linen with cotton wool dipped in wax and oil.
Then, tie it gently with a relaxed bandage. Ensure the patient sleeps on their back with two pillows supporting their head to prevent them from moving it left or right and avoid chewing solid food; instead, they should consume soft foods.
Even if the pain subsides and the jaw is dislocated, he should eat whatever he desires. He should not be hasty in his eating nor strain himself when opening his mouth for eating, drinking or yawning until the jaw is healed.
However, if the jaw does not return to its proper place after dislocation and remains misaligned, it often leads to feverish illnesses, constant headaches, abdominal pain or repeated vomiting. If you observe such symptoms, know that it is damaged.
He may die within ten days from this condition.
Chapter Twenty-Five
On the dislocation of the jaw and point of the shoulder-blade.
As for the collarbone, it does not dislocate towards the inner side due to its connection with the chest. If it becomes dislocated outwards, this can be determined by touch. Its reduction is achieved when the patient lies on their back and extends their arms.
Then press the site with your hand firmly; it will return to its place. Then apply bandages and splints, securing them tightly. As for the end near the shoulder-blade, it rarely dislocates. If it does, do not attempt reduction or alignment.
Then apply bandages and splints, securing them tightly. Order the patient to remain at rest until healed. With this same treatment, the point of the shoulder-blade can also be reduced if it has dislocated.
Chapter Twenty-Six
On the reduction of a dislocated shoulder.
Know that the shoulder may dislocate in three directions: downwards towards the armpit, towards the chest, or rarely, upwards above the shoulder.
It does not dislocate backwards behind the shoulder-blade or forwards towards the nerve. It most commonly dislocates downwards towards the armpit, especially in individuals with less fat, as it exits and enters quickly.
Those with abundant flesh find it difficult to exit and enter. Some people may receive a blow or fall, causing the shoulder to swell and become hot, leading them to believe it is dislocated. Do not examine this until you are sure of its condition.
Then in its treatment, you proceed as follows: If the shoulder blade is displaced downward towards the armpit, and if it is dislocated between the healthy shoulder blade and the shoulder blade, you will find a noticeable difference between them. You will also find the head of the shoulder blade damaged, and upon touching under the armpit, you will feel as if there is an egg.
If it [the shoulder blade] has dislocated towards the chest or upwards, you will find this evident upon examination; the patient is unable to raise their hand to their ear nor move it in all its movements.
If the shoulder blade is soft, or if the patient is a child, it can be easily reduced. You should raise the patient's hand upwards with the help of an assistant, then place your thumbs under their armpit and push the joint upwards forcefully into its proper position while the assistant raises the hand overhead.
Then if it does not return as mentioned above, and the shoulder blade has been dislocated for many days, it is not advisable for the patient to bathe in hot water. Instead, they should use a plaster that relaxes and softens the muscles, such as a mixture of linseed, hulba (fenugreek), and alfalfa boiled in water.
Then the patient should lie on their back, and a moderate ball of wool should be placed under their armpit. The physician should then sit on top of the ball, hold the patient's hand with one hand, and extend it downward with the other.
If the ball is pushed with his foot, it will return to its place. If you wish to reduce it in this manner, arrange for a man taller than the patient and have him stand on one side of the patient's bed. He should then insert his elbows under the patient's armpits and raise their arms upwards until the patient is suspended in mid-air. Then another assistant should pull the patient's hand downward towards their stomach. If the patient is light, it is not necessary to hang anything else on them for fear of weighing them down; the shoulder blade will return immediately upon doing this. It can also be reduced in another manner.
Another method is to place a long, round wooden pole on the ground, similar in shape to a mortar but not too thick or too thin. Then place a soft cloth on top of it and have the patient stand along its length with their armpit resting on the pole.
Then he reaches his hand downwards from the other side and stretches his body likewise with force; the joint returns to its place quickly. If it is difficult to reduce, use all that we have mentioned and apply this treatment: take a stick about two cubits long. And its width should be about four fingers and thick like two fingers, having a rounded end to facilitate insertion into the depth of the armpit as follows.
Then tie a soft cloth on the rounded head of the stick to prevent harming the patient with the stick, then insert it under the armpit and extend the hand and arm downwards along the stick, tying the stick to the forearm and wrist.
Then place the arm on a support, suspending it by its width and extending the hand downwards while leaving the rest of the body hanging on the other side; the joint enters into its socket. Once it has entered completely, place a moderate-sized ball of wool under the armpit.
Then apply the prepared poultice made from flour dust, incense, and egg white to the entire shoulder, wrapping it around from above. Then firmly remove the ball of wool from under the armpit, wrap the bandage over the poultice from above, and tie the hand to the neck.
He should keep his hand still for seven days, not moving it. It is advisable to keep the patient's diet light so that the member gains strength; it heals faster this way. After seven or five days, the bandage can be removed and movement can be exercised. If there is no recurrence and the joint does not relax, then recovery has taken place.
But if the joint dislocates frequently due to dampness or some other cause, then it should be treated with reduction using three splints as mentioned in the chapter on reduction. If all this is done and the bandage is removed after seven days but the joint remains unstable,
Then know that the tendon of the shoulder joint has either been cut, stretched, or relaxed. Know then that this joint will never remain in place permanently.
If the jawbone extends towards the chest and breast, and even to the back, it is reduced by pushing and pressing with the hands until it returns to its place. The usual bandaging and treatment are employed until it heals. However, if healing leaves a scar on the member and movement remains slow.
Let the patient use hot compresses repeatedly until the scar softens and returns to its original state.
The Twenty-seventh Chapter.
In treating the elbow joint.
The elbow joint dislocates with difficulty and also reduces with difficulty, it can dislocate in all directions but especially anteriorly or posteriorly. Its dislocation is obvious to you as it lies beneath sight and touch, regardless of its shape.
When you compare the dislocated elbow with the normal one, it becomes clear that the joint is misaligned and the arm cannot be bent nor touched at the shoulder. Therefore, you should promptly reduce the dislocation before heat begins to accumulate in it.
For if heat accumulates in it, it becomes difficult to reduce and may not heal at all, especially if the dislocation is posterior as this is the worst type of dislocation with the greatest pain. Often death accompanies it.
If it is reducible, order an assistant to extend both his hands and arms, palms facing up. The doctor should place one hand above the elbow and the other below it, then push the joint back into its place using the thumb or heel of the hand.
If the dislocation is anterior, it can be reduced by bending the hand until the heel of the palm strikes the shoulder that is adjacent to it. If reduction does not occur, then use strong and forceful pressure by ordering an assistant to extend the arm.
The patient should also hold the assistant's hands to prevent him from slipping away during traction. Then, wrap the arm with a folded cloth or wide bandage and rotate it in all directions after reduction. The doctor should grease his hands for easier manipulation of the joint.
Then push the joint forcefully until it reduces. After reduction, apply a splint that has been padded and dried with egg whites. Secure it gently but firmly, suspend the arm in a sling from the patient's neck, and leave it immobilized for several days.
Then if it becomes infected, if the joint stays in its place, cut away the bandage from around it and leave it. But if you see that the joint has not yet healed well, prepare a new bandage and ligature and leave them on for however many days it takes until it heals. If there is swelling after the joint returns to its place and is cut open.
If it is difficult to move, use massage in the bathhouse and gentle rubbing and kneading until it becomes soft. Or place a bandage of fat from a thick sheep on the joint, then leave it overnight and remove it the next day before entering the bathhouse. If he sweats, gently rub the joint.
Then put the bandage on again once, twice, or three times with entering the bathhouse until it becomes soft. If you wish to place a damp, softened piece of cow's udder on it with fat and tie it on, do so repeatedly for it will become soft and return to its former state.
Chapter Twenty-Eighth.
In the treatment of dislocation of the elbow.
The elbow joint often dislocates and its return is easier than that of other joints, except that it should be returned quickly at the time when it dislocates before the place becomes stiff or inflamed.
To return it, place the elbow of the sick person on a board and have an assistant extend his hand. The doctor should place his palm on the back of the joint and push until it returns, but he should first look to see if the joint has completely returned to its place in the inner part of the hand.
The sick person should place the outer side of his hand on the board during extension and reduction. If the joint remains prominent on the outer side of the hand, then place the inner side of the hand on the board so that the doctor's hand lies directly on the back of the joint. If it does not return at this time, apply a bandage with an anti-inflammatory poultice.
Leave him alone without repeating this procedure unless the joint remains dislocated and cannot be reduced after some days have passed. This will not harm the patient except that his hand may become weak and unable to grasp anything.
Then know that if the nerve is severed or crushed, there is no remedy except to bind it with a splint; perhaps it will benefit and perhaps not. After wrapping the wrist, apply the bandage we described, then tighten it and leave it for five days.
Then remove the bandage and exercise the hand; if its movement is hindered or there is stiffness, soften it with hot water and massage repeatedly until it becomes supple.
Chapter Twenty-Nine
In treating fingers.
If a finger becomes dislocated in any direction, when it is displaced towards the front or back of the hand, extend the finger and push the dislocation back with your thumb until it returns to its place, then bind the base of the finger and suspend it in the direction from which it was dislocated.
Leave it for two days, then release it and extend the finger until it stands straight that day. If it is bound at night according to the same description, leave it unbound during the day, exercise it with movement and bind it again at night. Continue doing this until it becomes strong.
Do the same if a finger dislocates towards the palm of the hand, binding it in the same direction and following the initial procedure until it heals. Do likewise for dislocation to other directions.
Chapter Thirty
In treating dislocation of the spinal vertebrae
If there is a complete dislocation of one vertebra from the spine or neck, or if several vertebrae shift from their places, there is no treatment for this condition as death swiftly follows.
The sign of this is that the patient's feces come out without control and they cannot hold them back. Often, some of their limbs become paralyzed, either both legs or arms, or just one of them. However, if only one vertebra shifts from its place, it can often return to its position on its own.
When a vertebra shifts in four directions, that which shifts backwards is called a "hump." If the hump occurs from an injury to the spine in childhood, there is no treatment for it and it never heals. However, if the hump occurs from a fall or blow, etc.,
I have omitted many of the lengthy discussions and treatments mentioned by earlier authors, most of which are not beneficial. I have abbreviated those that may prove useful and provided clear explanations and illustrations different from what others have shown.
I say that the hump occurring at the front of the chest and also on either side is incurable, whereas those occurring in the back can be treated as I shall describe.
Place a bed level against the wall with a damp cloth underneath to prevent it from hurting his chest, then insert a post upright into a hole in the ground at the head of the bed and another one at its foot.
Have one servant hold the post at the head of the bed, not firmly fixed in the hole, and another hold the one at its foot. Then wrap a soft, tight bandage around the patient's chest and under his armpits, bringing the end towards the post at his head and tying it there.
Then tie another bandage above his hips, knees, and ankles, gather all the bandages together, and tie them to the post at his feet. Each servant should pull on their respective posts without removing either post from its position.
Unless the posts are not firmly fixed, as mentioned earlier. The physician presses his hands on the stone with force until it returns to its place or places a board on top of it and leans on it with his legs until it does so. If this treatment does not succeed, take a board about three cubits long.
And carve out a place in the wall mentioned earlier, near the patient, to insert one end of the board. Then place the middle of the board on the hump and have the physician stand on the other end with his legs and press firmly until the stone grinds against itself.
Until it returns to its place, and if you wish, you can use a screw that is turned by hand. Drive two stakes into the ground at the head of the bed about an arm's length long and do the same at its foot.
After piercing each plank with a bore of one-fourth of its length, and making in each a hole through which the screw may pass, fasten all the planks firmly to the ground so that they may not move at all. Then introduce into them the screwing stick, which is the instrument by means of which the ligature passes through both holes.
And at one end pierce a hole in which place an awl of the length of a span, upon which to turn. In the other two planks make like holes for the screw-stick; then draw tight the bandages which you have applied to the wound of the patient in the screw at its head and those placed on his legs in the screws at his feet.
Then, at each screw, let a servant stand and turn the handwheel with which the screw is wound; and the physician shall straighten the hump as we have shown it. This is an illustration of the screw, the bench, and the patient:
After the swelling has subsided and the part is straightened, then you should bind on the dried dressing with white of egg, followed by a bandage, and then place over it a splint made from boards three fingers wide or so, and its length equal to that of the hump.
After placing him upon a proper bed, then bind him with the bandage which is to be used. Let the patient take soft diet until healed; if any remains of the lump remain in the part after healing, then you should apply the ointments that relax and soften the parts together with the use of the splint we have described for a long time.
And in this case you may use a sheet of lead, but if the swelling appears at the end of the backbone it should be thought of as a fracture and not treated with this remedy lest death ensue.
Chapter Thirty-one
On the treatment of dislocated hip.
Know that the hip joint and knee joint are subject only to dislocation, and not to slight dislocations or subluxations. The hip joint is dislocated in four directions:
The hip joint dislocates inwardly, outwardly, anteriorly and posteriorly. The most common is inward dislocation, the least common is anterior or posterior dislocation. A sign of inward dislocation is that when you compare the healthy leg with the affected one, the healthy one appears longer.
The knee is protuberant beyond the healthy state, and the patient cannot flex his leg at the knee. The area behind the knee is warm and humid, clearly indicating that the femoral head has reached there.
The symptom of dislocation of the lower jaw outwards is opposite to these symptoms, and the symptom of dislocation forwards is that he extends his leg fully except that he cannot bend it without pain in the knee. Even if he tries to walk, he cannot do so towards the front.
He retains urine and his buttocks are tender. When walking, he puts most of his weight on his heels. The symptom of dislocation backwards is that he cannot extend the knee or bend it before bending the hip, and his leg is also shorter than the other one.
The hip is relaxed, and the femoral head is at the location of the groin. As for the reduction of this dislocation, it is not possible if the dislocation is old and has not been reduced by its owner who did not attempt to do so, as there will be no treatment in that case.
It is not appropriate to reduce it, but if it is recent and of any type from the four dislocations, then proceed to move the joint by twisting, extending it inwards and outwards, and moving it right and left, perhaps this will be successful.
It returned without the need for anything else. But if it did not return in this way, then proceed to use a strong servant aid to extend his leg from below, either by hand or with a splint tied above the knee, and another servant should extend it from above.
So that he enters his hands under the armpits, then pulls with a soft bandage on the hipbone and another servant holds the end of the bandage. The extension should be either from in front from the hip towards the shoulder blade or from behind towards the back.
They should all extend together with one pull until the patient's body is lifted off the ground and remains suspended. This type of extension is common to all four types [of dislocation]. If the dislocation returns as mentioned, otherwise each type requires a specific treatment that I will mention.
His special treatment, if the jaw is dislocated inwardly, is that the patient should lie on his sound side, then a bandage should be applied at the root of the thigh between the head of the femur and the area below the pubis.
He then stretches the bandage upwards from the side of the pubis to above the chest towards the collarbone, and another strong servant aids by embracing the thick part of the thigh bone of the affected leg and pulls it outwards with great force, so that it returns to its place.
If this method proves difficult or impossible, then both of the patient's legs should be bound together tightly with a soft bandage at the ankles and knees.
Then, after every two of his own fingers (of the doctor), and with the affected leg extended more than the other by two fingerbreadths, the patient is suspended from a wooden beam in the house, leaving about two cubits between him and the ground.
Then, order a strong boy to embrace the head of the thighbone and another boy to pull the patient. Push the latter boy with force towards the former one holding the thighbone, so that the joint returns quickly to its place.
The patient should lie down on the couch as previously described for the case of hip dislocation. He should have a bandage tied around his affected leg and chest, then two beams are placed one at his feet and another at his head. An additional beam is placed in the middle of the couch, securely fastened.
Cover the beam with a wet cloth to prevent injury to the patient. Place the beam between his thighs to prevent him from slipping downwards during traction. Each servant pulls on his side while the doctor pushes the hip back into place with his hands.
If not, place the board on him and press as mentioned in the case of hip dislocation. However, the patient should lie on his sound side. If the dislocation is anterior, extend the affected leg while lying in this position on the couch.
The physician places his right hand on the patient's thigh, then presses it with his left hand. However, he should extend the pressure downwards towards the knee. If the dislocation is backwards, he should not extend the limb downwards.
He is high off the ground, rather he should be placed on a solid object. It is also necessary that his hips are turned outwards according to what we mentioned about the position on the bench while facing down with the bindings tightened.
As mentioned earlier, the compression should also be used with the slab on the place where the joint has dislocated. When the hip joint returns to its proper position, which will be evident by the extension of the patient's leg.
When they are level and the patient can easily bend and straighten his leg, know that the joint has returned to its proper position. Then, apply a bandage to the thighs and tighten it with a cloth strip so that the hip does not move in any direction.
The patient should remain still for three or four days, then remove the bandage and splint, and move his leg gently. If the dislocation has healed, he can walk. But if there is any relaxation,...
Then return and bind it again as before, leaving him for another three days. After that, remove the bandage and allow him to walk slowly until he regains his strength, God willing.
Chapter Two and Thirty.
In treating a dislocated knee.
The knee can dislocate in three directions: inwards, outwards, and downwards (backwards). It does not dislocate forwards. The sign of a dislocation is when the patient cannot bring his leg towards his thigh.
If the leg does not stick to the thigh, know that the knee is dislocated. To reduce it, have the patient sit down with his legs extended, if he can. Then sit behind him, hold his waist and tilt him back slightly. After that, you sit on his thighs.
Press your back against his face, place his leg between yours, then grip his thigh with both hands and interlock your fingers behind his thigh. Then squeeze his thighs tightly with both hands, while another servant extends the patient's leg until the knee returns to its original position.
The sign of its reduction is when the leg adheres to the thigh smoothly without resistance. Then, dress it and bind the thigh and leg together with a bandage for three or four days. Afterwards, release them and only allow walking little by little until they regain strength.
If reduction proves difficult despite the method described earlier, then apply strong traction using the bandages mentioned previously for hip dislocation treatment until reduction is achieved.
Chapter Thirty-three
In treating the broken heel.
The heel may dislocate easily or completely fracture, with the fracture either facing inward or outward. The sign of a fracture is that the heel appears swollen and prominent on the side where it has dislocated.
If it is only dislocated, it is easy to reduce by gently extending the limbs and aligning them until they return to their normal position. However, if it has completely fractured, do not let the patient sit. Instead, have a strong servant hold him from behind at his waist.
Then, grasp the patient's foot with your right hand from above and left hand from below at the ankle joint. Pull the foot towards you with your right hand twice, then extend it with your left hand while pushing the sole of the foot with your right hand gently towards the leg.
Repeat this process twice as described, then on the third attempt, push the sole of the foot towards the leg while pulling at the ankle joint. If it returns to its normal position in one or two attempts, you will see that the foot is straight. Otherwise, repeat the procedure until it returns.
If reduction is still not possible despite the described method, then lay the patient on his back on the ground. Drive a strong wooden peg into the ground between his thighs and secure it firmly with ropes to prevent movement. Cover the peg with cloth to avoid injury to the patient. Then have a servant hold the thigh steady.
Then another servant extends the man's leg either by hand or with a bandage tied around his neck, then each servant extends differently from his companion, and the rope is upright between the patient's thighs which he holds to prevent the body from slipping down during extension, then the doctor aligns the jaw with his hands.
Another servant holds the sound leg down, for the jaw returns quickly. When the jaw has returned and its correctness is apparent to you, then take up the splint and the bandage and tighten them with close bindings, and tie the foot down with a bandage. Take care to avoid the nerve that lies above the heel behind.
So that the bandage is not too tight upon it causing him pain, then leave it for two or three days. If the bandage has loosened, then tighten it again on the third or fourth day, and the patient should refrain from walking for forty days.
But if he tries to walk before this period, there is fear that the jaw will dislocate and be ruined, and it will not accept treatment afterwards. If swelling appears, heat should not be applied in any other place of treatment or bandaging except where prescribed earlier.
Chapter Forty-three.
On treating dislocation of the toes.
It is necessary to align what has been dislocated without force by a slight extension, which is not difficult but easy. If the dislocation is in one of the toes on the back of the foot, then the patient should place his foot on a level spot on the ground.
Or he should stand on a board as if walking, then you place your foot on the prominence of those joints and press it with your foot with force until it returns to its place and appears straight without any protuberance at the spot.
Then place under the sole of his foot a board that takes in the whole foot and has two ends, then bind it tightly with a close bandage for three days. Then release it and let him rest from walking many days until it becomes strong and the return is secure, God willing.
Chapter Fifty-three
In types of fracture that occurs with wound or with breakage or with both together
When such things happen, if treatment and splinting are delayed, death often ensues.
Therefore, only someone skilled in the profession with extensive experience, compassionate, careful, and not hasty or reckless should undertake such treatment. Initially, medications to alleviate inflammation should be used.
O Allah, grant healing only if You will it, and do not allow harm with ease of illness. If there is some hope in the case, then restore health immediately before inflammation occurs.
If the bone returns to its original position, then apply remedies that alleviate inflammation and treat the wound with appropriate dried ointments. If the fracture is accompanied by displaced bone fragments, remove them. Follow what has been mentioned earlier in simple cases as detailed therein.
Strive diligently and keep yourself from straying onto paths of error, as I have warned you before. That is best for your reputation and safest for your patient, if Allah wills.
