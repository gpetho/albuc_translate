And the salvatella is the vein which is between the little finger and the ring finger, and it has two branches; and in the leg and foot there are three veins: one is below the bend of the left ankle, and the second is the saphenous which is at the ankle of the right side; and the vein which is called "nesse", which is at the ankle of the other side; and in the other leg there are three veins below those.	And the salvatella which is the vein between the little and ring fingers; it has two branches. There are also three veins in the leg and foot; one of these is the sciatic vein on the outer aspect; the second is the saphena situated near the heel on the inner aspect; and there is the external saphena situated near the heel on the outer aspect. And there are three veins, counterparts to these, in the other leg. Venesection of the two veins behind the ears.	0.8981824
Bleeding from the vein of the forehead is worth as much as bleeding from the cephalic vein for chronic diseases of the face, and for migraines, and for redness; and the method is that the patient squeezes his neck by twisting, until the vein appears; then take the instrument which is called a "digger", of which here is the form:	Venesection of the vein in the forehead is, after venesection of the cephalic, a relief to chronic diseases of the face such as pustules and scabs and erysipelas. Now I shall relate to you the method of cutting: you bind the patient's neck until the vessel stands out; then you take the instrument called the 'pickaxe'.	0.75981826
And put the point on the vein, and strike it with your hand, or with something else, and let the blood flow out according to the quantity you want; then loosen the patient's neck, and tie the vein until it is healed; and sometimes it is done with a broad lancet.	The spike in the head of the instrument you place on the vessel itself and then strike with a comb or some similar thing; and let the blood flow to the extent you wish; then loosen the band round the neck and bandage the vein until healed.	0.8000042
However, the lancet should not be too sharp; and bleed across, because the bone is close, and perhaps the lancet will break if it is thin.	The incision should be oblique, slightly longitudinal, with a small, rather broad scalpel, for in this place there is no flesh; so if the knife have too narrow a point it may be broken on the bone.	0.6632892
Bleeding from the two veins which are in the two tear ducts helps the eyes, and ringworm, and redness, and stye in the eye, and diseases of the face; and the method of their bleeding is that the patient squeezes his neck by twisting with some sort of band, as before; then bleed him, and the bleeding should be across, a little along the length of a somewhat wide lancet, because there is no flesh there.	Then let flow what blood you wish, put cotton wool on both, tie for one night, then loosen. Venesection of the vein of the nose helps in acute fevers, in violent headache, and in diseases of the face such as the red pustules that arise on the nose, especially if they are chronic. This is how you make the incision: the patient binds his neck and then you hold his nose with your left hand and take a long fine scalpel and stick it in the middle of the very lobule of the nose, perpendicularly in the nasal septum (for the vein is not obvious at that spot) and blood will immediately flow out.	0.6661818
And if the lancet is thin, it might break; then let the blood flow as much as you need, and then tie cotton over it, and tie it well.	You should advance the scalpel a little and cause the blood to flow as required; then bandage for one night, for it will quickly heal.	0.5583669
Bleeding from the veins of the upper lips helps with burning in the mouth, and infection of the gums, and chapped lips, and of the nose and around.	Venesection of the jugular veins helps tightness of breath and the early stage of elephantiasis, and the melancholic diseases arising on the surface of the skin, such as the black vitiligo and impetigo and malignant ulcers and cancrum oris.	0.58150876
And the method of bleeding is to have the patient sit in front of you, and squeeze his neck as I have said; then turn the lip, and look at the two veins, one of which is on the right lip and the other on the left, and they are recognized by the fact that they are black, and by the fact that around them are small black veins: then cut one and the other, and if you do not recognize them, and you are in doubt, cut the largest on each side, and do the same with the two veins that are above and below, for it is the same method. of the bleeding under the tongue The bleeding of the veins that are under the tongue helps after the bleeding of the cephalic vein, and this is for tightness of the throat, and diseases of the uvula, and diseases of the mouth; and the way to bleed is that the patient sits between your hands in front of the sun, and lift the tongue, and look underneath on each side for a black vein: then bleed one and the other, and do not go too deep, for underneath are the arteries.	Do the same with the two veins in the upper lip. The two veins under the tongue: their venesection is, after section of the cephalic, of good effect in the quinsy arising in the throat from disease of the uvula, and diseases of the mouth. The way to venesect them is to seat the patient before you in the sunlight and raise his tongue, and look, and you will see beneath the tongue one vein on each side, blackish in colour. Cut them; but be careful not to go too far in your incision, for beneath them lie arteries from which there may be haemorrhage.	0.8396712
The veins of the neck that are commonly bled are bled in two ways: either by pricking with a myrtle-leaf-shaped lancet, or a thin olive-shaped lancet like a cutting edge, and it is called "anesil"; and they are wide and narrow depending on the width and narrowness of the veins. The myrtle-leaf shaped lancet is very renowned, and is wide as you see:	The three veins that are opened in the elbow are the veins which universal custom has used for bloodletting. There are two ways of venesecting these: either by piercing with a broad myrtle-leaf scalpel or a rather fine olivary; or by cutting with a knife-edged scalpel, the lancet whose figure follows. The broad myrtle-leaf scalpel.	0.7475912
The myrtle-leaf shaped lancet is very renowned, and is wide as you see: And it is needed for opening hairy veins full of thick, apparent blood, and that contain thick and cloudy blood; and this is the shape of the olive-shaped lancet:	The broad myrtle-leaf scalpel. As you see, it should be broad so as to serve for opening hollow, full, outstanding, obvious and thick veins, and those containing turbid blood. The olivary scalpel.	0.82910717
and it is more finely pointed, and is for bleeding thin veins, where there is thin, clear blood.	This scalpel is less broad and finer-pointed. It is suitable for venesecting fine veins that contain thin jaundiced blood.	0.64917386
Bleeding the basilic vein, which is one of these veins, helps with illnesses that are below the throat, and in the neck, and in the chest, and in the belly; and the bleeder must bleed wisely, and beware of the artery that is underneath.	This one indicates what the others are like; it is well known to surgeons. The basilic vein, which is one of these three vessels, helps, when cut, by extracting blood from disorders below the throat and neck, in the parts neighbouring the chest and abdomen.	0.7440319
And if he cuts the artery, and bleeding occurs, it must be stopped, as I have said; and the lancet should not be piercing, but cutting like a razor.	When one venesects it one must be careful and wary of it, for beneath the vein is an artery, so that if one is inaccurate and sticks the scalpel in too far one will cut the artery and cause a haemorrhage; therefore venesection of it should not be done with a transfixing scalpel but should be an incision with the lancet.	0.58118373
And if the basilic vein does not appear clearly, you must compress it and choose another; or you seek a branch of it, or you bleed instead the vein in the middle of the arm: it appears clearly; and cut it with the razor lancet, as we have said.	If the basilic vein is not clearly discernible, leave it and turn to another, or look for a branch of it; or venesect the brachial cord instead, for that is evident; incise it with the lancet as we have said.	0.8747645
And if you want to know the location for the bleeding, you must, before you tighten the arm, touch the area until you feel the pulse; then mark the place with ink, and then tie the arm, and cut the vein with the razor lancet; and be careful not to strike the artery when you see the area swollen, for that is the artery: avoid it then.	But if you wish to open the basilic vein itself you should, before you bandage the arm, palpate the place till the site of pulsation is found; then mark it with ink; then bind the arm and cut the vein obliquely with the lancet as we said, and take care that the stroke fall some way from the artery. If, when tying the bandage, you see a swelling in the place that you have marked with ink, that swelling is the inflation of the artery, so avoid it.	0.8581813
And if you see it spurt upwards like the urine of a child, and the blood is red and thin, know that it is blood from the artery: hurry then, and put your finger over it for a long time, then remove your finger if the blood stops, which often happens; then tie the arm, and leave it like that, and let the patient not move it; and let him be wary, and not move it until he is healed.	And if, on section, you see the blood spurt out like a child's urine, and it is clear and red, then you may know that it is arterial blood; so then be quick and put your finger upon it for a long while; then remove your finger and if the bleeding stops, as it often will, then bind up the arm and leave it. Caution the patient against neglecting it; let him be careful and not move it for some days, until it heals.	0.9421493
And if the blood is not stopped, and it overcomes you, and the medicine is not at hand, cut the artery if it appears, for the ends of it retract; and the blood will stop.	But if the bleeding is not stayed but resists your treatment and you have no medicament there at the time, then cut the vessel through if you can see it; for the two ends will contract and the haemorrhage will stop.	0.76307464
And take a bark of fustic, and split it, and take one of the halves and tie it on tightly until the next day; if the blood stops, it is good; if not, treat it, as we have said, with powders that stop blood; and the stopping of bleeding is not difficult in most cases because of the small size of the wound, and the pressure of the bandage on the arm.	Or else take a pistachio nut shell and split it and take one half and bind it over the site of the haemorrhage with a pad and bandage until next day. The bleeding may stop; if not, then treat by those means mentioned previously, namely the application of styptic powders. It is not difficult in most cases to stop the bleeding, because the wound is small and it is easy to bandage the arm. So get to know it.	0.7858262
Bleeding from the median vein helps because it draws blood from the head above, and from the body below, because it is composed of the basilic and cephalic veins, as we have said; and the bloodletter must beware of the nerve that is underneath, and if he pricks too deep, and finds the nerve, and it swells and the healing is difficult, and perhaps it cannot heal; and this nerve appears often, and if it does not appear in some men because of its thinness, you must bleed it with the lancet instrument; and avoid the nerve as much as you can.	Venesection of the median vein results in drawing off blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body; this being due to the fact, as we said, that it is composed of a branch of the cephalic and a branch of the basilic veins. The venesector should be very careful in opening it because there is a nerve beneath; and if he takes the scalpel too deep and hits that nerve it will cause stupor, the healing of which will be difficult and perhaps even impossible. Generally this nerve can be felt, but if in some persons it lies hidden and is slender and not discernible, then you should make your venesection an incision with the lancet and diligently avoid the nerve.	0.88626176
And if there is a vein between the two nerves, split it lengthwise.	If the vein lies between two nerves you should cut it longitudinally.	0.79892755
Bleeding from the cephalic vein helps, as it draws blood from the head, and helps the eyes; and it should be bled by pricking at the olive-shaped swelling or the myrtle-shaped swelling, for it is the safest of all the veins, because it has neither nerve nor artery beneath it.	The cephalic vein: section of it is effective in drawing blood from the head and in diseases of the eyes. Particularly in this vein you ought, if you wish to incise it, to make your incision by puncturing with the olivary or the broad myrtle-leaf scalpel, for this is the safest of all veins as there is neither artery nor nerve beneath.	0.8185665
However, one must look for the easiest place, and it doesn't matter if one misses the first time, and starts again; and perhaps the place swells in some men, when one misses the first time, but it doesn't matter. The quality of the bleeding depends on your judgment.	When you are cutting it you have only to avoid with the scalpel the head of the muscle and to look for the soft place. It will not injure it, if at the first cut you miss the vein, to repeat the incision several times; except that in some people it will sometimes swell up if the section is not made at the first stroke; nevertheless that swelling will do him no harm. The manner of venesection, the accidents that may supervene, and the necessary preliminaries for performing it properly.	0.6525582
The first thing you must know about bleeding is that bleeding is administered only to maintain health, and to avoid future illnesses; and the bleeding should be done in one of the three veins that are in the elbow: namely, the cephalic, median cubital, and basilic; and one should bleed at the beginning of spring while fasting, and in autumn and winter after eating, when the signs of plethora appear; and one should bleed on the first or third day, after two or three hours of the day.	First you should know that venesection may be employed either for the preservation of health or in cases of disease. When used for the preservation and maintenance of health and for guarding against the occurrence of disease, the venesection should be in one of the three vessels at the elbow, cephalic, median, or basilic; and it must be performed at the beginning of spring when the signs of repletion appear. The venesection should be done on a Sunday or Tuesday, after three hours of the day have passed.	0.82975703
Bleeding administered for illnesses has no fixed time, but only when needed, day or night, at all hours and at all times; and children under fourteen years of age should not be bled, nor should pregnant women except from the fourth month until the seventh. The elderly who have passed sixty years should not be bled.	On the other hand, venesection administered for diseases has no fixed hour but when need and necessity arise, either by night or by day, at any hour, in any season. Children should not be venesected until their fourteenth year, nor should you venesect old men of over sixty years.	0.8905954
And when someone wants to be bled, in whatever manner, it is necessary that they cleanse the intestines with a light enema, if they have a lot of retained feces, so that the veins do not draw putrid superfluities from the intestines, harmful to the principal members; nor should one bleed someone who is too satiated with food, nor who is drunk, until they are sober, nor the dropsical; and one should beware of bleeding after colic, and vomiting, and diarrhea, and excessive intercourse with a woman, and from work, from staying awake and fasting, and that which weakens all strength, either by something of the mind or of the body; then thin the humors, if the blood is thick, by foods and drinks and by medicines, if you have the power; then enter the bath, if nothing prevents it, to thin the blood, and bleed from the worst vein around the third hour, as we have said; and guard yourself that day from work, and from exertion, and from sexual activity, and similar things; and be happy and joyful, and let the bleeder be higher than the one being bled, and let him rub the arm two or three times, then tie the ligature above moderately, because when it is too tight or too loose, the blood cannot flow; and then let him rub the place with his hands, until the veins swell, and they can be felt; then let the bleeder moisten the lancet with a little old oil, then place the finger of his left hand on that vein below the place a little where he wants to bleed, so that the vein does not flee and fail upon being lanced. For there are veins that flee like cords when bled, and there are some that are full of wind, so that when the lancet is placed on them, it retracts from the lancet, and the vein cannot be opened, and thus it is with these; and if he opens the vein, the wound is too narrow, therefore the bleeder must be knowledgeable in these things.	After putting on the tourniquet the patient about to be venesected should chafe his own hands together until the veins swell up and become obvious. Then the venesector should wipe over his knife with a little olive-oil, preferably old. Then he should place the forefinger of his left hand on the vessel itself below the place where he wishes to cut, lightly, so that the vein does not slip away and elude the stroke; for there are some veins that you may find like cords slipping away at venesection, while others are filled with flatus and when the knife is applied to them they contract under it and deceive the operator and the knife fails to open the vein or makes only a narrow opening. Wherefore it behoves the venesector to be firm and deliberate in all these cases.	0.79791665
And if the vein opens the first time, that's good; if not, then try again a little below that spot or quickly above, if the place is not swollen.	Then he should apply the knife and if the vein is opened first time, good; but if not, let him repeat a little lower down or a little above, quickly, if the place does not swell.	0.89069164
And if the place is swollen, and the patient is frightened, leave it for a day or two, and do not tie the arm: perhaps hot abscesses will come there; do not enter the bath, then try the bleeding again if it pleases them; and if the opening is small, or the blood flows thinly and you doubt that not as much blood will come out as you want, then strike into that same opening with the whole lancet straight; and open it a little quickly, before the place swells; for this happens many times, when the wound is small.	If it does swell or the patient be anxious, then leave him for a day or two and do not bandage, for that might perhaps provoke an abscess; nor let him go to the bath. Then if he likes, let the venesection be repeated. If the knife has made an opening but it is small and the flow of blood is feeble and you fear that the amount of blood you require will not come out, then gently insert the knife again straight into the same opening and widen it a little. Do this speedily before the place swells up; for in many people the place swells up at once from a small opening.	0.920508
If you see the place swelling, do not restart the bleeding, and apply a little oil dregs, for it lightens the body of blood, and the dregs are better in this place than the oil; and thus administer the oil dregs in every bleeding that you bleed the veins, to stop the flow of blood; and the same is done with theriac and ox dung, when it is placed on the spot; thus the blood thins and spreads when it is too thick.	But if you see it swell up, on no account make another incision for it will be ineffectual; but apply to it a little lees of oil, for that will facilitate the flow of blood; it is superior in this situation to the oil itself and to all other unguents. Therefore use lees of oil in all cases of venesection when the flow of blood is hindered. The great theriac and shakhzanaya both have the same effect, for when the blood is thick it is rendered thin and running.	0.81115496
And if a large abscess develops there, which happens often, especially when it is not bled except at that time or the opening of the vein is small, then hurry, and apply a sponge moistened in slightly warm water and salt to the place, and squeeze it for an hour; and you must do this after the blood has flowed from the vein, and if any blackness or greenness remains at the place after a few days, it does not harm it; and if you wish, apply something of aloes or myrrh mixed with juice of calamint, wild mint, or similar.	If there occur a big tumour at the site of venesection, as often happens, especially with a man who has not previously undergone venesection or if the opening in the vein be small, then quickly apply to the place a sponge soaked in lukewarm salt and water and bandage it for a while, then it will go down. You should do this after the blood has gone out altogether from the same vessel or from another one. If there remain after some days some discoloration or greenness at the site it will not hurt; if you like, apply some solution of myrrh and aloes, or juice of penny-royal or something similar.	0.88647
And often an abscess and swelling occur with the bleeding of the basilic vein: then put your hand on it, and if you find the place soft when pressed by the hand, then this swelling is bad. Therefore, be careful not to apply anything of what we have said, for perhaps blood flows from the artery; but make a dry plaster for him to harden the place, then treat it with another treatment, until it is healed.	Often in section of the basilic vein there occurs tumour and swelling. Put your hand upon it, and if you find that it sinks when pressed then it is a harmful swelling; be careful not to apply to it any of the things we have told you; for often arterial blood comes from it. But apply a poultice with some styptic qualities, to harden the place; then treat in the usual way until healed.	0.8815918
And draw blood from each one according to the quantity of his strength, and the color of the blood.	Now in each case you should extract blood in proportion to the person's strength and to the prevailing colour of the blood.	0.6787348
For if the blood is black, let it flow until it is red; and if you see it thick, let it flow until it is thinned; and if it is too hot, let it cool down.	If the blood be black, let it flow until it becomes red; in the same way, if you see it is thick, let it run until it is thin; and again, if it be sharp, until its sharpness is gone.	0.9085418
And for one who is full and strong, and needs bloodletting, a larger wound should be made, and the lancet be wide; and for one who is weak, do the opposite, and he should be bled little and often, and one should bleed him by cutting across, not by pricking; and this manner of bleeding is safe from excessive bleeding and cutting of a nerve, and is better than bleeding along the length or width.	In the case that is plethoric, robust, and requiring venesection just the once, the incision should be wide and the knife should be broad. And on the contrary for the debilitated person, in whose case you should venesect several times and the opening should be small. The best method in venesecting is if the incision be at an angle, oblique, cutting, not piercing. This manner of venesecting is safe from haemorrhage and from cutting the nerve; it is better and safer than cutting straight across or straight along.	0.817601
And to the one whose body faints during bleeding, give bread soaked in pomegranate juice; if he is heated, draw blood three or four times. And if he is of a cold complexion, before bleeding, have him eat bread soaked in syrup of muscat, or in syrup of aromatic honey with spices, such as pepper, cinnamon, ginger, and chickpeas, and a very fragrant syrup.	To the patient who habitually faints during venesection you should give to eat beforehand a little bread macerated in the juice of unripe pomegranates or oxymel, if he be of a warm temperament; and draw off the blood in three or four instalments. And if he be of a cold temperament let him take beforehand bread macerated in syrup of quinces or in aromatic syrup of honey or in fragrant syrup of basil.	0.85121644
And if he faints during bleeding, after the release of much blood, he should drink meat broth, and a delicate fragrant syrup, and use the other things that we have mentioned in the section or chapter on syncope, concerning the opening of a vein.	If the patient faints during venesection and the cause is great loss of blood, then be should be given to drink meat-juice and thin syrup of basil; and he should perfume himself with galia moschata and anoint his chest with it. And for the rest, use what we have spoken of in its place in the chapter dealing with fainting due to evacuation.	0.67084324
And if he wishes to empty his arm, and bleed again, it is necessary, when he is weakened by much bleeding, that he bleeds little by little, according to the amount of his strength, continuously.	As for him who wishes to ease his arm and draw off blood a second time, when he is undergoing the venesection on account of great evacuation and the lowness of his strength, you should let the blood slowly, in proportion to his strength, on successive days.	0.76170325
And whoever wants to empty his arm after the first bleeding, and he has a strong body, let him bleed seven hours after the first bleeding, or after the ninth hour.	For him who wishes to ease his arm and draw off blood a second time, being of robust body, it must be done seven or nine hours from the first venesection.	0.79011124
And whoever wants to bleed from another part, should do so the second or third day.	He who wishes to draw blood from his body to the side opposite to that toward which it tends, should be eased on the second or third day.	0.79817444
And if the vein is swollen, leave it and do not constrict it, until the swelling has subsided.	But if the vein has begun to swell, leave it and do not touch it until the swelling has subsided.	0.8248687
And if it is necessary to draw blood a second time, bleed him in the same place, or in another vein, or in the other arm.	And if you are unavoidably called to let blood again, venesect either above the place or in the other arm or another vessel.	0.8311374
The vein in the middle of the arm is bled instead of the vein of the head because it is well-formed/suitable.	Section of the cord of the arm: this is cut in place of the median and basilic veins when these are not to be found or are hidden; for this vein is composed of those two.	0.4066996
And the method of bleeding is that the patient puts his hand in hot water, until the skin is red; then it should be tied moderately, so that the vein appears well, then bleed immediately across, not lengthwise nor along the length; and let the opening be wide, and be bled very close to the joint of the hand, and if blood cannot come out, put the hand back in hot water, and let the blood run into the water, until you have enough; and if it is in summer, do not put the hand back in hot water, for it is put there more in winter than in summer; and bleeding from this vein is safer than all other veins, because there is neither artery nor nerve. Bleeding from the cephalic vein of the right hand is good for all diseases of the liver, and this is the method: clench the hand, and put it in hot water, until the vein is swollen, so that it can be seen; and bleed it across, and if you cut it completely through, it does no harm; and do not go too deep, because the nerves are underneath, bare of flesh, and then put the hand back in hot water, if the blood has congealed in the wound, and cannot come out.	Section of the salvatella of the right hand is efficacious in case of diseases of the liver. The method of venesecting it is to tie a band round the wrist or grip it with your hand, after you have put it in hot water until the vein is swollen up and is plainly to be felt; then cut it somewhat obliquely; if you cut it right through that will not matter at all. But be careful not to go too far with the knife, for underneath there are the tendons of the fingers and the place is bare of flesh. Then put the hand again into hot water and let the blood flow; for if you do not put it into hot water again the blood will clot in the opening and will be prevented from flowing.	0.8368624
And when you have drawn as much blood as you need, put oil and salt on the vein to heal it quickly, and do this for every branch/vein.	When you have extracted the required quantity of blood, put oil and salt on the vein so that it does not heal too quickly. You should act thus with every narrow branch.	0.84085786
Bleeding from it in the left hand is good for diseases of the spleen, and do just as I told you for the right.	Incision of the salvatella of the left hand is of value in diseases of the spleen. Venesection of it should be carried out in the same manner as you did in the other.	0.61013377
Bleeding from the saphenous vein is good for all illnesses that are below the body, such as illnesses of the marrow, and retention of menses, and illnesses of the kidneys, and of the thighs and of old legs, and similar illnesses.	Venesection of the saphena is beneficial in diseases of the lower part of the body, such as afflictions of the uterus and retention of the menses, and for diseases of the kidneys, and for chronic ulcers of the hips and legs, and similar diseases.	0.8646062
And the way to bleed it is that the patient puts his foot in hot water, and rubs the vein until it appears, and ties above the ankle joint; and the vein is at the ankle, and many branches go above the foot; then bleed it in the largest branch, or at the ankle, which is better.	Now the manner of venesection is for the patient to put his foot in hot water, then friction should be applied to it until the veins fill up; then bind a thong over the joint of the foot; then the site of the vein at the ankle is shown up running toward the big toe and forming many branches on the surface of the foot. Then make your incision either in the broadest branch or at the ankle before it ramifies, for that is better and safer.	0.8655311
And if you bleed it on the foot, beware of the nerves that are underneath, and bleed it across as if cutting; and let the lancet be sharp.	If you venesect it on the surface of the foot, be careful of the tendons that are beneath on the surface of the foot. Make the incision obliquely as though you were cutting the vein through. The knife should be a lancet.	0.73888916
And if the blood cannot come out, put the foot back in the water, and let the vein empty well.	If the flow of blood be impeded, put the foot back again into hot water and let the blood flow out into it until it is evacuated.	0.7530072
And if the bleeder misses the first time, try again a second time a little above, because the place is safe; do not fear the nerve, as we have said, and do the same with the saphenous vein of the other foot equally.	If the venesector makes a mistake the first time in the vein to be cut, let him repeat the section a little higher up, for the.place is safe; you need fear no mischief as long as you are careful of the tendons, as we said before. In the same way you may deal with the saphena of the other foot.	0.8061589
The place of the sciatic vein is at the outer ankle, and bleeding it is good for hip pain, when it's due to hot blood.	Now the position of the sciatic vein is, as we said, on the outside near the heel. Section of it is effective in pain in the hip when it arises from hot blood.	0.76341826
And the way to bleed it is that the patient enters the bath, and squeezes above the ankle with four fingers while twisting, because otherwise the vein does not appear; and if it appears, bleed it in every way you can, and across; and it is better that you cut it, because the place is safe, and it is very deep in many people.	The way to venesect it is to make the patient get into the bath.
