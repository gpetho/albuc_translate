On the scraping of teeth with iron.	On scraping the teeth with an iron instrument.	0.8673351
When on the surface of the teeth, in the inner parts and in the outer parts, and between the gums, there are rough scales attached, loose, and sometimes they are blackened and become yellow or green, which leads to corruption in the gum and makes the teeth loose.	Sometimes there collect upon the inner and outer surface of the teeth and also between the gums, rough scales, ugly, sometimes black or yellow or green, from which corruption is communicated to the gums and thus the teeth become unsightly.	0.8559718
And so you must make the patient sit between your hands and place his head on your lap, and scrape the teeth on which those scales and sand-like substances appear until no part of them remains, and do this for the blackness, the yellowness, and the other substances until they are cleaned.	The patient should sit before you, putting his head in your lap; and you should scrape the teeth or molars on which you can discern crusts or gritty substance, till nothing remains; do them all in the like manner, black, green, yellow, and the rest, until they are all gone.	0.8141639
So if what is on them is removed from the beginning of the scraping, that is good; if not, then repeat the scraping on them the next day and the second and the third until you reach the final state you desire.	If they disappear at the first scraping, good; but if not repeat the scraping on the following day and the second and third until you attain your purpose.	0.84221935
And know that teeth require many scrapers of various forms and many shapes according to what is prepared for your operation. And because the scraper with which the tooth is scraped from the inner part is different from the scraper with which it is scraped between the teeth according to different shapes, and these shapes of scrapers should be prepared by you, which you will see shortly:	You should know that molars need scraping-tools of many diverse forms and shapes according to the character of your undertaking; for the tool with which the inner surface of the teeth is scraped differs from the tool with which the outer surface is scraped; and that for scraping between the teeth is different again. Here is a number of scrapers, all of which you will have ready by you	0.78265965
