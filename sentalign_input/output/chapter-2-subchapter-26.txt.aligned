On the suturing of the nose, lips, and ear when continuity is dissolved by wound or similar.	On suture of nose, lip, and ear, when there is discontinuity from a wound or the like.	0.91922826
Know that when a solution of continuity happens in one of these cartilages, little confers in that operation except in some men.	You should know that when discontinuity occurs in one of these cartilages, treatment of them rarely does any good, except in a few people.	0.85383695
So, when one of these causes happens to someone, you should consider if it is a fresh wound with its blood, and then you join the two lips of the wound with suture, and then treat it until it is healed.	When such a thing happens to anyone, look carefully, and if the wound be fresh and bleeding, bring the edges of the wound together with a suture, and dress them till they are healed.	0.69397783
And if the lips of the solution of continuity are already separated, and each one is healed, then you must scrape each part of its apparent scab until blood comes out. And then join the two lips with suture and tighten them, and sprinkle over them dragon's blood and pounded incense, and place over the powder a piece of diafinicon plaster, or some other consolidating plaster, and leave it tied for two or three days, and then untie it and change the plaster and leave it until the threads by themselves are detached, and then treat with ointment until it is healed.	If the discontinuity has separated the edges, and both edges have healed, it is necessary to scrape both edges on the external skin till they bleed; then bring the edges together with a suture and dust over it dragon's blood and olibanum; and put over the powder a plaster of Palm ointment or some other of the regenerative ointments, and leave bandaged for two or three days; then unbandage and change the medicine, and let the sutures come away of themselves; and afterward dress with ointment till healed.	0.8708838
But the manner of suturing is that you join the solution of continuity either with needles as we have recounted in the suturing of the belly, or you join the solution of continuity with thread as you have been taught.	Now the manner of suturing is to close the discontinuity, either with a needle, as we describe for suture of the belly, or with a thread as we tell you there.	0.715981
