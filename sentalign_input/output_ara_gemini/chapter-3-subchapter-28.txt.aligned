The wrist joint frequently dislocates.	The carpus of the hand is often dislocated.	0.8239497
And the reduction of its dislocation is easy, unlike other joints. Except that it is necessary to hasten to reduce its dislocation the hour in which it dislocates before the place swells or a hot swelling occurs in it.	Unlike other joints, the reduction is easy, but there should be haste to reduce it as soon as it is dislocated, before the place swells or an abscess occur.	0.789297
And the reduction of its dislocation is that you place the wrist of the ill person on a board and an assistant extends his hand and the physician places his palm on the prominence of the joint and pushes it until it returns.	The way of reducing the dislocation is to place the patient's wrist upon a board while an assistant stretches the hand, and the doctor puts the palm of his hand upon the prominence of the joint and applies pressure on it until it goes back.	0.8841328
Except that it is necessary to look, if the dislocation has shifted towards the inside of the hand, then let the ill person place the back of his hand on the board during the extension and reduction. And if the dislocation is prominent towards the back of the hand, then let the placement of his inner hand (palm) be on the board so that the physicianâ€™s hand falls on the prominence itself of the joint.	But he should examine: if it is a displacement toward the ventral aspect of the hand, the patient should place the back of his hand upon the board for extension and reduction; but if it be a luxation toward the dorsum of the hand, then the inner part of the hand should be laid upon the board so that the doctor's hand may come upon the prominence of the joint itself.	0.8474432
And if it returns immediately (well and good), otherwise tighten it with a bandage that soothes the swelling and leave it, do not return to it, because it does not bear it, and you will not be able to reduce it after days have passed for it.	If it go back at once, good; but if not, bandage it with a plaster that settles swelling and let it be. Do not revert to it, for it will not tolerate that, and you will not be able to effect its reduction after some days have passed.	0.72341466
Except that the joint remains in its crookedness and does not harm the ill person at all, except if the hand becomes loose and is unable to grasp anything. Then you know that the nerve has been severed or bruised, so there is no recourse for it except to tighten it with cauterization, perhaps it will benefit and perhaps that will not benefit at all.	But the joint will retain its deformity; and the patient will in no wise be harmed except if his hand is slackened so that he be unable to grip anything; then you may know that the tendons are either severed or bruised. In this situation there is no method but to strengthen it by cauterization; this sometimes helps but sometimes is of no use at all.	0.87535864
So if the reduction of the wrist is completed, then apply to it the bandage that we described, then it is tightened and left for five days, then it is loosened, and the hand is exercised.	When the reduction of the joint is complete, apply to it the plaster we have described, then bandage it and leave it for five days; then loosen it and try out the hand.	0.84815764
And if its movement is difficult and some stiffness occurs in it, then soften it with heated water and rubbing repeatedly until it softens.	If movement be hampered and any hardness occur in it, soften it repeatedly with hot water and sweating until it be softened.	0.8771883
