O you, very dear sons, I have completed this book, which is the last of the science of medicine, together with its fulfillment, and have made the end through its expositions and through its declarations. And it came to me in a vision that I complete it with this treatise, which is a part of the work of hands, that is to say, "surgery".
And because the work of hands is very difficult in our region and is estranged from it completely, so the science is lost and cut off, and nothing is left of it except the small descriptions in books of the ancients that the hands have moved. And from this came error and vanity, and the understandings are closed and the science is estranged.
Now it seems to me that I want to revive it together with the ordering of this treatise according to the way of exposition and declaration and abbreviation; and will come together the forms of cautery irons, and of the other instruments of the work with the addition of the declaration and preparation of them, as is necessary.
And for the reason of this, that no good masters of hands are found in our time, the art of medicine is estranged. And it is necessary for him who undertakes this to excel in the science of anatomy, as Galen says, so that he knows the structure of the members, and their shapes and connections and separations, and has knowledge of the bones and nerves and vessels and their number, and the movement and the stationary veins, and the place of their exit.
And for this, Hippocrates said that the name with the name is much, and with the work is little; and especially in the art of the hand.
We tell you in the introduction of this book that he who is not knowledgeable of the aforementioned things, must guard himself from falling into error and killing people;
just as I have seen many of those who meddle with this science and abandon themselves to it without knowledge and without experience.
For I saw a foolish doctor who cut an abscess of scrofulas on a woman's neck, and cut the arteries of the neck; because so much blood came out that the woman fell dead in his hands.
And saw another doctor who extracted a stone from an old man, and the stone was large; and he took with him a piece of the bladder, and the man died within three days.
And I had already been called to remove it, and saw the disposition of the sick man and the size of the stone, and knew well that if it were cut, he would die.
And I saw another doctor who took on as a patient a duke of our land who had a broken leg, and with the break there was a wound;
and the doctor, full of ignorance, squeezed the break over the wound with strong bandages, and did not give the wound any slack, and left it thus for a time;
and he commanded him not to loosen it at all;
and remained thus until the leg, and the foot, were all swollen, and came to ruin.
I was called to come to him, and I hurried to come and unbind the leg; and when I loosened it, it was at peace, and felt no pain.
But nonetheless the corruption was already confirmed in the member, and I could not heal it;
and the corruption did not cease to travel through the member until the member was entirely lost.
And I saw another mire that crushed the festering abscess, and then inflamed due to the malice of its dominion.
For a chancre, when it is pure of melancholic humor, one should not touch it with iron unless it is in such a place that one can entirely remove what is corrupt.
And therefore, noble son, it is necessary for you to know that the work of hands is divided into two divisions: that is to say, work where there is peril in several dispositions;
and I will show in each place of this book where there is fear and peril.
Therefore it is necessary for you to be careful so that fools cannot speak ill of you.
Take your tools carefully, and undertake your patients lightly and firmly, and use the best way so that through God's grace you come to a cure and are praised;
and leave the terrible illnesses of serious illness;
and remove your tools from that which makes you doubt, and have faith in yourself so that you may go from this world to the next in glory.
Galen says in some of his admonitions: Do not undertake a serious illness unless you are called a foolish physician.
I have divided this treatise into three chapters.
The first chapter is of cauteries of fire and of cauteries of sharp medicine, and this chapter is arranged from the head down to the feet;
and of the forms of instruments, and of the iron implements for cauterization, and of everything necessary for the work.
The second chapter is of cutting and piercing, and of cupping and wounds, and of the extraction of arrows, and of similar things;
and this chapter is arranged and the forms of the instruments.
The third chapter is of restoring dislocations and sprains, and of similar things;
and is ordered from the head down to the feet, and of the forms of instruments.
Before we remember the work, it is necessary for me to say the quality of the help and the harm of each temperament.
I say that the quality of help, and of harm, is the longest speech and subtlest science and hidden secret.
and many wise men spoke of this, and agreed on this;
and I am satisfied with their words, for I fear the length.
I say that cautery helps universally in all temperaments where there is matter, except for two temperaments: that is to say, a hot temperament without matter, and a dry temperament without matter.
In a hot and dry temperament with matter, some argued that cautery is a great help; and the others said the opposite: that cautery is of no value to an illness that comes from heat and dryness. For the nature of fire is hot, and should not be used to cure a hot illness by heat, nor by dryness;
and the one who said the opposite stated that cautery is of great help for a hot and dry illness that comes upon a man's body. For when you compare a man's body and its moisture to the temperament of fire, you find the body cold.
And I agree with this statement. For I have found it true on several occasions through experimentation.
And by all means, do not intervene except the one who has experienced it, and who knows through long use the chapter on cauteries, and the diversity of human temperaments, and the dispositions and causes of their illnesses, and the occurrences and the duration of time;
Of other temperaments, we have no fear, especially in cold and moist illnesses. And all the doctors assembled and agreed on the cautery.
And know, son, that cautery combined with fire is among the secrets of cures, and of greater goodness than cautery by burning medicine.
For fire is simple, and does not affect anything beyond the affected limb, and does not harm another limb except slightly.
Burning medicines spread from one limb to another, and cause serious illnesses in the affected limb; and perhaps kill the patient.
Fire, due to its intensity and the goodness of its substance, does not cause harm, unless there is excess.
And this I have found through experiment and through the length of service and study I have put into the art, and it is based on the truth of things;
and therefore I apologize for the length of the speech, for I do not wish to deprive you of the secret contained in fire, and the quality of the work, how it expels illnesses from the body, as the philosopher states in his demonstrations; or receive it into your thoughts.
And know, son, that they agreed on the time when cauteries should be performed, and chose spring.
And I say that cautery is suitable at all times, because the harm that comes afterwards is mitigated by the help of cautery; and especially if cauteries are necessary for pain, strong and urgent, so that the time when greater harm comes to the limb cannot be awaited.
And never think about it, dear son, as foolish people do; for the illness that is cured by cautery has no return; and they say it thus;
and they say it thus; but it is not as they believe, because cautery is only a medicine that changes the complexion, and dries the humours that are the cause of the pain, and it is more valuable than other medicines because of its speed, and because of the virtue of its work and its power.
And it is possible that the illness comes sometimes according to the complexion of the sick person and the location of the illness and its power;
and if superfluities gather in him through the consumption of food and similar things, it is not cautery administered where there is little superfluity and moisture, such as cautery of the teeth for the pain, and similar things, and such pain does not return; but this happens little.
And many people do not understand why cautery is called the last resort of medicine, and that is true;
but they do not believe that cautery is useful after medicine, but their intentions are false, and cautery is the last resort of medicine because when we administer various cures for any illness and they are ineffective, then we administer cautery, and it works.
Therefore, it is clear that cautery is the last resort of medicine, and not according to the intention of foolish people.
The ancients said that cautery using a gold instrument is better than one of iron, and they said this only because of the quality of gold and its high substance.
and they said that the place cauterized does not cause corruption, but this is not true, for I have experienced it, and have found it to be true in some people.
And cautery with gold is better than with iron, as they said. And yet when you heat a gold instrument, you cannot tell when it is hot by the color of the gold, and it cools quickly.
and if it is heated too much; so do they do to the fire; and thus there is enough impediment.
Or I have arranged this chapter from the head down to the feet, so that the way may be easier to find.
These cauteries are good for moisture and cold on the brain, and there are two that are done because of a disease called "soda," and because of many humors that descend from the head to the eyes and ears, and for a multitude of dreams and toothaches and sore throats, and especially for all illnesses that come from cold such as paralysis and soda and apoplexy and similar illnesses.
The form of this cautery is that the patient should be purged by a dissolving medicine that purifies the head for three or four nights, according to what the virtue and age and habit of the patient can bear; and then heat the head of the patient.
And then have him sit cross-legged between your hands, and place his hands on his lap;
Then place the root of your palm on the root of his nose between his two eyes; and leave where your middle fingers will come, then heat the cautery called "olivare," of which this is the form: And place it on the marked spot, and move it downwards, gently pressing and twisting your hand; then lift your hand quickly, and observe the spot if you see the bone slightly exposed; and if you do not see it, then repeat the cautery until you see the bone as I have told you;
afterwards, take a little of oil, and put it in water and soften cotton within, and place on the spot, and leave it for three days;
afterwards, put moistened cotton in butter; and leave it on until the inflammation is gone; afterwards, treat the wound with the ointment called "tetrafarmaçon" until it is healed.
And the ancients said that the longer the wound remains open, the more it cleanses; and therefore, so it helps.
And some of them said that one should leave the cautery on until a part of the bone is burned, and then the burned part of the bone should be removed and treated.
And others say that one should leave the cautery on for so long, and apply it so forcefully, that it removes a piece of bone as wide as a spindle that women use in their spindles, so that the humors may flow out.
And one should leave the wound open for a long time; After that, one should treat and close it.
And these two types of cauteries do not seem to me to be entirely good, except in some cases where there is a fear of pain.
And to me, it seems that I should leave it.
For the shoulder is weakened by the continuous dissolving of its nature, as we testify in other limbs;
And even when the patient's shoulder is weak by nature, the first type of cautery is safer and gentler for me, and with this one I use in such cases a combined cure.
When chronic pain comes to the entire head, and lasts a long time, the patient should use herbs and pills called "cochie," and head cleansings, oils, and plasters; and if one performs the cautery that we have previously described, and it is not effective. Be cautious if the patient's shoulder is strong in nature, and if it is not too cold; then cauterize below that cautery a little, as we have described above. After that, cauterize on each horn of the head, down to the bone, as we have said before, and perform cautery on the place called "vasselz"; and that is the place where cupping is applied; and place your hand so that you do not see all the way to the bone: the patient feels much greater pain in this cautery than in others, and I will speak of that elsewhere;
and the cauteries of the horns should be finer than those used to cauterize the middle part of the head, and this is the form:
of the cautery of the head When in one part of the head sudden pain occurs, and the illness extends to the eye, and the head is purged with purifying medicines, and the other cures I have mentioned in the division of diseases have been done, and all of this does not help: then the cauteries are done according to two ways, namely with sharp medicine and with fire.
The cauteries of sharp medicine are that you take a piece of alum, and remove the bark and cut it into two pieces, and then cut the temple where the pain is in such a way that you can place the piece of alum under the skin;
and when it is placed there, bind it tightly and leave it like that for twelve hours; and then unbind it and take out the piece of alum, and leave the wound like that for two or three days; then place on it a piece of cotton dipped in butter until suppuration comes out.
After that, treat with ointment until it is healed;
and if you wish, use some of the burning medicines that I have written in the twelfth chapter on burning medicines.
The cautery of iron is thus according to this manner. Heat the cautery with this form:
And it is called "closed" because the head is made in the form of a closed vessel or it has little curvature, and in the middle a small appearance;
and place it on the painful area, and hold your hand and turn the iron slightly, until half of the thickness of the core is burned;
and lift your hand so that the artery, which is outside, does not burn, and that an abundance of blood flows out.
After that, place cotton in salted water, and place it on the area for three days; then place cotton soaked in butter, and then treat the area with ointment until it is healed;
and if you want to cauterize this migraine with the cautery called "cultellare," at the very tip, and be careful not to cut the artery in this migraine that is not ancient.
of migraine
When you treat a migraine as we have previously said in the divisions of diseases, and it does not work, and you see that the previously mentioned cauteries of medicine and of iron are not enough, then you must heat the cautery called "cultellare" until it is white;
and thus apply it to the aching area in a line half a finger long, and remove your hand once, and be careful that you do not cut the artery and that you do not reach the bone;
and be careful of the jaw that moves when one chews, and that the nerve does not only concern itself with the movement and that spasms do not come to the patient, and be careful of a flow of blood from the artery when it is cut, or if the cutting causes great fear, especially for someone who does not know it and who is not a student and experienced; and leave the work half-done;
but I will tell you how to stop blood when the artery is cut, and I will show you the place where it belongs in this book.
And if you see that these cauteries are not sufficient for the illness, and the patient is suffering, cauterize him in the middle of the head as we have said, and treat the wound until it is healed;
And if you wish, administer the cautery that we have described in the chapter on the extraction of the artery, with the cautery that has two blades; and this cautery is better than that one and more helpful.
of the pain in the ears from cold.
When pain in the ear comes from cold, and one has applied dissolving medicines and other treatments that we have mentioned in the division, and the pain does not change, then heat this cautery that is called "point", of which this is the shape:
Then prick all around the diseased ear, or around both if the pain is in both, and move a little above the root of the ear after you have marked the place of insertion; and make ten pricks around each ear;
then treat the place until it is healed.
of the torment of the mouth
Torment that must be cured by cautery is no different from those caused by phlegm, as we have said in the divisions of disease;
and do not use cautery for those that arise from dryness and spasms of the nerves.
When you treat this type of torment caused by phlegm from drops and purges of the head and gargling, and this is not effective, then you must cauterize the patient with three cauteries: one at the root of the ear, and another a little outside the temple, and the third at the junction of the two lips;
and place the cautery on the part that appears healthy, and cauterize the head of the ear a little below the tip of the head, and another on the temple as long as a thumb; and leave the cautery there until half of the heart is burned;
and this is the form of the cautery:
And it is similar to the scalpel we have described before, but it is slightly more subtle and requires the knife to be slightly thicker;
after treating the area as I have said before, until it is healed.
When the apoplexy is longstanding and you treat it as we have said, and it does no good, and the patient does not have a fever, then apply four cauteries: Two on the two horns of the head, and one in the middle of the head, and one at the place called "vessels" as we have said before, and the last cautery on the opening of the stomach;
and be treated as we have said before.
of lethargy
For this illness, give the patient large ewers and pills that cleanse the brain;
Afterwards, raise the patient's head completely, and put a mustard plaster, as written in the treatise on plasters, onto the back of the head;
and this is the method of cautery: if you do it as I have said.
If it is thus healed, it is good; and if it is not, make three cauteries from the middle of the head, descending down to the neck, and have a space of one inch between each cautery;
and treat it like the others, and if you wish to add more, and the patient is enduring, make one cautery in the middle; and if necessary, two others on the two horns, and treat it until it is healed;
and let the cauteries be what is called "olivare," as I have said before.
It is necessary that the head be cleansed of sores and of what we have said before;
First, treat the patient's head, then cauterize in the middle of the head and on each horn, and one behind and three on the spine of the neck;
And if you need more, and the body is moist and the patient is suffering, and the illness is severe, then you make four cauteries on the spine of the back; and leave them until most of the core is burned, and lift your hand; after treat until it is healed, and let the cauteries that are called "olivare" that we have spoken of before.
of the epilepsy
The epileptic should not use fire cauteries except for those who are phlegmatic, and it is necessary first to purify the brain with years and other treatments that we have mentioned in the division when the patient is severe and suffering from taking medicine.
And if it is a child who cannot tolerate it, have them gargle and chew, purifying the brain often with good foods;
After the physician has examined the head, and applies cauteries in accordance with what we have said before, and applies cauteries to the vessel, and to each horn; And if the patient is strong and enduring, he applies cauteries as I have said to those with paralysis and softening of the body, on the spine of the back and neck, and the cauteries should be olive-oil based, according to the method I have described.
If the patient is a child, he applies subtle cauteries according to this method:
When, due to melancholy, superfluities or corrupt moistures and thick phlegm exist, then cauterize with such cauteries as we have described for those with paralysis.
And if, due to melancholy, the superfluities incline to melancholy, and the body of the patient is moist, then give him to drink something to cleanse the brain, according to what has been previously described in the division.
Afterwards, rest the patient's head; then make a well-made linen bandage, like a circle, and place it around the head;
and the patient sits cross-legged, and be firmly held from all sides;
then present the liniment, and it is worth rubbing with old badger fat; and heat it gently with fire, so that the patient can tolerate the application; then empty the circle inside the head, and let it cool;
and do this to the patient each week once, with other good treatment, until he is healthy.
Or if you wish to cauterize it, make several small punctures with the cautery.
This method of cautery softens the brain equally;
and then place soaked cotton in butter and goose fat.
of the eyes' water When water comes first to the eyes, according to the signs I have described in the division, then begin and give the patient something to drink that cleanses the head, and keep it from all moisture, and make him sweat in a bath several times on an empty stomach.
After that, he commands him to raise his head, and he performs cautery in the middle of the head, and he performs two cauteries on the two temples if the descent of the water is to both eyes together, or on one if the descent is to one;
and cut with the cautery all the veins and arteries that are under the heart, and let the cautery be long according to the width of the temple;
and be careful of the outflow of blood, and if you see too much blood coming out, then stop it with as much power as you have.
And I will teach you in the extraction of the arteries and in the incision the caution how you will stop it;
And sometimes cautery or a cauterizing instrument is used under the two bones behind.
and if one sees that it is from cold phlegmatic superfluities, then apply the cautery that I have described at the beginning of the ailment descending to the eyes: One cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries on the two temples, and two cauteries or cauterizing instruments under the two bones; and if there is further need, then cauterize wisely above the eyebrow with one small cautery.
When you treat him according to what we have said in the division, and it does not help, then give the patient three nights of draughts. After the head is shaved, and he is cauterized in the middle of the olive cautery; and make two cauteries of the cautery called "clavilis" above the two eyebrows, a little below the hair;
and watch out that you do not cut the artery.
And this is the form of the cautery called "clavilis":
When the membrane of the eye is softened by illness and moisture, then cauterize it with this cautery called "olivare". of which this is the form:
And if you wish, make two cauteries above the two eyebrows as long as the eyebrows are;
and do not leave your hand there except until the third part of the membrane is burned, according to the manner that I have said.
from hair that pricks the eye Sometimes it happens that the hairs of the eyes are turned inward and prick the eye, and cauteries are made according to two manners: that is to say, of fire, or of burning medicine.
For cautery with fire, instruct the patient to let the hairs grow long and even; and if they prick at their base, hold the eyes steady so they do not move until they grow.
When they grow and are even, then place the patient in your position; afterwards, draw a figure on the skin of the eyes, that should be like the leaf of myrtle, and let the sign's beginning be beside the hairs;
then put moistened cotton in egg white and parsley mucus on the eye, then heat the cautery, of which this is the form:
Afterwards, cauterize over the figure you have marked little by little many times, so that the heart is burned at that spot;
and the sign of the work's success is that you see the skin retracted and the hairs raised at the eye's puncture;
then raise your hand, and leave it thus for three days, then put moistened cotton in butter until the burn is gone; afterward, treat with ointment until it is healed.
And if afterwards the hair grows back, and the skin softens, then recommence the cautery over that same spot, as you did at first;
and if the hair has fallen out, cauterize until the skin is raised to its natural place, and is even, and the hair does not prick the eye.
The burning medical cautery is that you instruct the patient to let the hairs grow large and equal, then make a shape of myrtle leaf from parchment;
then take French soap and live coals, of each one a handful, and grind together well; and do it quickly, so that it does not cool, then spread it over the shape you made, like the myrtle leaf, and put it over the skin around the eyes; and if the patient holds it in one eye only, one must work on one, and if in both, likewise. and put under the eye cotton soaked in egg white;
and the patient's head be in your lap and place your index finger on the medicine, and press it gently and move it every time the patient feels the medicine biting, for it feels like a bite as of fire.
When you have done this a long time, remove the medicine from your finger. And when the biting sensation is gone, remove the wet cloth, and look to see if you see the paper raised, as if it were raised by constraint of fire or by incision; and if it is so, then it is good.
If not, then apply more medicine to the spot where the medicine did not work, until your work is even, and your eyes are focused.
Then place moistened cotton in butter until the burning heart is healed, after which treat the area with the ointment called "dyafenis" and others, until it is healthy.
And if you need to, be very careful in your work to ensure that no medicine gets into your eyes.
And if the paper becomes soft afterward, and the hair pricks in the eye, then reapply medicine to the area softened by the paper precisely, as you did before. After treating it until it is healthy;
and this is the form of the myrtle leaf:
And know that human eyes vary in size, and according to this, be your constraints.
And the right path be not denied to him who studies this art.
of the treatment of fistula by cautery
When you treat a fistula as we have said in the divisions of illnesses, and your treatments are of no avail, then you must apply cautery to it according to this method.
Instruct the patient to place their head on your lap. and let the attendant hold the patient's head between their hands in such a way that it does not move, nor does the patient move their head.
Afterwards, place moistened cotton in egg white or the juice of parsley over the eye;
Afterwards, heat the cautery iron which is like this:
and is shaped at the head like the shape of a vault's feather, with which the cautery should be;
if you wish, it should be pointed from one end to the other, and if you wish, it should also be like a tent;
However, this one that is shaped is better for your work.
Afterwards, press the fistula if it is open, and extract the pus, and dry it; and if it is closed, open it, and extract the matter;
afterwards, apply the hot cautery firmly, and hold your hand to the cautery on the part of the nose above the eye, so that your hand does not do harm; and place the cautery in the fat of the eye, and corrupt it.
If you go from the beginning of the cautery down to the bone, that would be good. Otherwise, repeat the cautery once more, and again if you need to, and leave it for three days;
Afterwards, put moistened cotton in butter, and treat it with desiccant ointment until it is healed.  If forty days pass and it is not healed, then apply an acrid corrosive medicine until the bone is uncovered. and treat it according to what he would put in his chapter.
And there is a way of cautery for a fistula that none of the ancients said. Understand a fistula, and treat the place; Afterwards, put into the fissure a subtle cauterization, of which this is the shape: and they make it the size of a lead three. and hold your hand on the cauterization firmly, and let the patient not move at all, so that the melted lead does not run into their eye;
and it is necessary that one put on the patient's eye cotton moistened in egg white or in water:
The lead will burn the fistula area, and heal it with marvelous health.
And if the fistula is healed by the cautery that we have described, it is good. If not, it is necessary to administer a puncture to the nose, and bring the fistula back to the body of the nose to its proper place.
Cracks in the lips Often cracks occur in the lips, which are called "sores," especially on the lips of children.
When you treat these cracks with what we have said in divisions, and the treatment is not effective, then heat a small, knife-like cautery according to this form:
And place it quickly on those cracks until it reaches the bottom;
afterward, treat the area with a plaster until it is healed.
When an abscess comes to the root of the throat or the uvula, or the palate, or the roots of the teeth, after it causes decay and rot and grows old and becomes a fistula; and you treat it as we have said in the divisions, and it does no good: Then it is necessary that you apply cautery according to the size of the fistula; after the opening or hole of the fistula, and hold your hand until the hot iron reaches the bottom of it, and at the backmost place;
and do so once or twice, after the treatment that we have spoken of in treatments, until it is healed;
and if it is treated thus, it is good; and if not, then it is necessary to uncover the place and remove the corrupted bone, according to what you will find in its chapter.
When the gums are softened by moisture and the teeth move, and you treat it with medicines and that is not enough, then place the head of the sick person on your own healthy body; afterward, heat the cautery of which the shape will come later in such a way that you place a rod over the tooth;
and quickly put the hot cautery inside, and hold your hand so long that the sick person feels the heat going to the root of the tooth;
afterward, remove your hand and reapply the cautery according to your will;
afterward, the sick person fills his mouth with salt water, and let it sit for an hour and rinse thoroughly.
And in this way, the tooth that was moving is now fixed, and the softened gums are restrained, and the corrupt moisture is dried.
of the pain of the teeth
When tooth pain comes from cold, whether there is cold or a true cold, and the treatments of medicine are not effective, then cautery is necessary in two ways: and cautery with butter and cautery with fire.
Cautery with butter is such that you take cow's butter, and the tip in an iron or copper spoon; after take cotton and wrap around the tip of a tent, and moisten it in boiling butter, and place it on the aching tooth quickly, and hold it until it cools;
and thus do often until its virtue reaches the root of the tooth, and if you wish, soak wool and cotton in cold butter, and place it on the aching tooth, and place a hot iron so that the heat reaches the end of the tooth.
The cautery with fire is such that you take an iron or copper rod, and it should be thick so that the fire does not reach the patient's mouth;
after heat the cautery, by which the form will come afterwards, and place it on the tooth and hold your hand until the cautery is cooled;
do this often, for the pain will be removed that same day or the next.
And it is necessary that the patient fill his mouth with good butter during the application of this cautery, and then apply a strong force.
and that is the form of the cautery:
And make cautery of whatever head you desire, and according to what you are able;
And this is the form of the cautery-iron:
of the scrofulas When the scrofulas are of phlegm and cold moistures, and are not obedient to digestion by medicines, then heat the cautery iron described later, and have two openings for the fumes to escape from the cautery iron on the other side;
and apply the hot cautery iron to the abscess once, or as needed, until it reaches the bottom of the abscess;
and if the abscess is small, apply the cautery iron according to the size of the abscess, and leave it thus for three days; and place soaked cotton in butter until the burning is gone;
then treat the area with ointments and dressings until it is healed.
When moisture overcomes the channels of the lung, and especially when this is due to a cold constitution, then the patient must first be purged by solution medicines;
After that, apply cautery to the root of the throat, and be careful not to reach the throat itself, and do not burn the heart but a little.
After that, apply another cautery to the joint of the neck at the base of the spine, and let the cautery, which is called "clavile," be of the form we have shown beforehand;
and treat the area as we have previously described until it is healed.
When the cough and lung ailment are from cold moisture, and the patient has neither fever nor dryness, and the illness is chronic, then apply two cauteries on the ribs in empty spaces; and another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two breasts;
and let the cauteries be called "clavile" according to the form previously described.
And if you wish, apply a cautery by pricking at the whole of the cautery called "poins" whose form is as previously described for ear ailments;
and let the pricks be up to thirty, or thereabouts.
After treating the area according to what has been previously described, let the cauteries be in three rows according to this shape:
And because of this, the cauteries are lighter, because you make three at a time.
of the dislocation of the shoulder
When the head of the shoulder is dislocated due to moisture, and it is reset, but it cannot stay in place, repeatedly dislocating with slight movement that occurs, as we have experienced, then it is necessary that you reset the dislocation first. Afterwards, let the patient be supported on their back and on their side; Afterwards, lift the heart which is within the armpit with the fingers of your left hand;
and if the joint is dislocated inside, then heat the cautery which has two nerves, whose shape is this:
and cauterize the armpit until it penetrates to the side, and the shape of the cautery together with four cauteries would come;
and for this, a cautery with three nerves is made, so that the shapes of the cauterization are six cauteries;
and the nerves are according to the thinness of a tent, and this is the shape of the cautery that has three nerves:
And sometimes one nerve is added to this, so there are eight cauteries.
Afterwards, put on the cautery for the bruised parts with oil; Afterwards, rest the patient, and let the limb be still for a long time until it is well comforted.
And if it is dislocated above, which thing happens little, then make cautery on the thick part of the keyhole cautery, or many cauteries by pricking.
For the joint is closed, and the moisture is removed and the patient is healed.
When cold and much moisture enter the stomach, so that they weaken it from its constitution, and catarrhs are multiplied in him, and by the customary methods of treatment, and it does not benefit him, then the patient must be laid on his back, and extend his legs and hands. From this, afterwards, he applies three cauteries: one under the breastbone, the size of a finger, throughout the keyhole cautery; and two cauteries outside the two sides, so that the figure of the cauteries is in three angles, and have such a space between one and the other that they do not come together when they throw out corruption;
and let the cauteries be so deep that they reach both parts of the heart, and the shape of the cauteries be according to this form without joining:
And if you wish to cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form;
and whoever is afraid of this cautery, cauterize by pricking and applying a mark on the stomach in a point according to the amount you wish to do. then cauterize it with the entire cautery that is called "points".
After the treatment of the treatment that we have had before, until it is healed.
When the liver suffers pain from cold and moisture and a large windiness, as it is forced out of its natural constitution by superfluities; and if the patient is treated with what we have said in divisions, and it does him no good, then the patient should be examined concerning his constitution. and apply three cauteries according to this form, this figure, and this quantity on the liver, to drive away the hypochondria, where the rib of the man comes.
and have a space of one finger's breadth between each cautery. and let the cauteries be the length of the body, and do not press your hand too much on the whole cautery.
and let only half of the core be burned, and let the patient be upright on his feet.
and if he cannot, let him lie down, and extend his legs, and lift his arms.
And if your will is, cauterize these cauteries with the knife, if you are skillful and wise in the art, and be careful not to burn the entire core, for you would dry up the entire body; and that it not reach the boil, for the core is very delicate in that place, and you know this to be true.
When there is an abscess on the liver, and you wish to know if it is in the flesh of the liver or in the membrane: if it is in the flesh, the patient feels pain not too strong;
and if it is in the membrane, he feels fierce pain.
And when this treatment should cleanse the wounds, it is necessary that the patient be propped up on his head;
and then draw out the matter from the place where the abscess is, and then heat the cautery which is similar to a ray, of which this is the shape: And cauterize with the cautery until the skin is burned and it reaches the surface, until the pus is all gone;
after the treatment, according to the treatment of dressings, until it is healed;
and it is by no means fitting that this cautery be used by anyone other than those who have long studied the art of medicine, and whose hands these maladies have run through several times.
Then he can work boldly, and yet I think it is better to leave it alone.
of cautery of incisions
The ancients said that one should make cauteries of aristoloche roots, and in such a manner: Take a long aristoloche root, the largest you can find, and let it be dry, and also as thick and as long as your fingers; and soak it in oil, and hold it in the fire, and cauterize with it once between the jawbone and the throat, and two small cauteries a little lower down in the part beneath the beard;
and two cauteries between the fifth and sixth ribs, inclining slightly backwards; and one cautery in the middle of the breast, and another above the stomach, and one between the two shoulders, and two on the two sides of the breast outside the cautery that is between the two shoulders;
and do not press your hand, but do it openly, as if smelling.
And some ancients said that some men used a cautery resembling a razor, heating it and placing it between the ribs until it reached the abscess; and the pain immediately went away, as we have said in the abscess of the liver.
But in this work, there is fear, where the patient dies now, or a fistula comes that cannot be healed.
of the mouse
When you treat the disease of the mouse according to what we have said about the divisions of treatments, and it does not benefit, then three types of cautery are appropriate.
Of which one method is that you make three, or four, cauteries, by lining them up according to the length of the mouse, according to the shape of the liver cautery that we mentioned before;
and do not press your hand on the entire cautery, and let the patient often lie on their back;
and another method of cautery is that you heat the cautery that has two nerves, as we showed in the dislocation of the shoulder;
and lift the heart that is near the mouse, or the patient's elbow comes towards the left, and let the elevation you lift the heart be along the heart, along the length of the body, and the cauteries be along the width of the body.
Afterwards, place the two inflamed nerves so that the heart is pierced on the other side, and then pull out the cautery, and thus there will be four.
And if you wish, cauterize with the entire cautery on three nerves.
After the treatment, when it has thrown off corruption for a long time, and this is worth more than the other treatments mentioned before.
Cautery is not useful for dropsy, except in the manner called "asclytes".
When you treat it according to the methods we have described in divisions, and your treatment is not beneficial, then you must make four cauteries around the abdomen, one on the stomach, one on the liver, one on the spleen, two behind the back on the spine, and one on the breast. And let the cauteries be close to the thick part of the heart.
Afterwards, leave the cautery open to discharge pus for a long time, and do not abandon the patient's treatment after the cautery. And healing would be hastened, and the two intentions will be united with the help of God.
The form of the cautery for the belly should be the style we have previously shown. And that for the back should be olive-shaped, according to what has been previously stated.
When the feet are swollen in someone who is hydrops, and are full of yellow water, you must cauterize on the back of the foot between the little toe and the ring finger; and lift your hand with the cautery without turning.
And do not enter too deeply, lest the yellow water should escape, and let the cautery be according to this shape:
Afterwards, make two cauteries on each leg at the tip of the little toe; and let the cauteries be long, one below the knee in front and the other outside, in the middle of the leg;
and leave the cauteries open for a long time without dressing, so that the water may issue;
after the treatment of the other treatments that we have spoken of.
When the bowel's solution comes from cold and moisture, so that the virtues of retention and digestion that are in the stomach and intestines are weakened, and cannot be cured by the methods of treatment; and you see the patient suffering greatly and with strong constitution, then apply a large cautery to the stomach, according to what has been spoken of previously in the chapter on cauteries of the stomach, by way of circular cauterization; and four small cauteries around the abdomen, one small cautery on each hip.
And if you see abundant moisture and the patient is suffering, then apply a cautery to the navel, and one cautery on each side, and two small cauteries near the large one on the stomach, for the cure is profitable when there is good assistance.
of the cure of hemorrhoids
When hemorrhoids are in the fundament, one or more, and are old and are of large, cold, moist, corrupted humors, and have been treated as we have described in the divisions, and it is of no benefit, then apply cauteries: Three on the spine of the back, one right outside the small of the back, gradually increasing in size in a triangular pattern, and one cautery under the abdomen on each side.
And if you think the stomach is chilled, and the food does not digest, and the face is seen to swell, then place one large cautery on the stomach, as previously stated, and another on the liver, and another on the spleen, with all the cauteries pointed downward. And leave the cautery open for a long time. After the treatment, let the area heal.
When you cut the thelul, heat the cautery that resembles a razor, and then put it completely heated onto the cut thelul. and leave it there until the cautery reaches the origin of the vein, so that the blood stops.
Do this once or twice, and if there is much thelul, cauterize each one as we have said. after applying healing ointments until they are healed.
And if you cauterize a large cautery on the wound, it will provide greater aid.
When the patient cannot tolerate cutting or opening, which we will describe in its place, such an illness arises that cannot be healed except by cautery.
When a fistula arises in someone, and it is old and discharges corrupt matter and moisture, you should test it with a very thin probe, and make sure you know how deep the probe goes in the fistula.
After, heat the cautery, which resembles a scraper, and insert it into the fistula according to the amount that the probe entered, and repeat the cautery until the putrid and corrupt flesh is burned, once, or twice, or three times, according to the amount needed.
And be careful not to burn the exposed nerves, and the large veins.
If the fistula goes to the bladder and the intestine, then avoid those areas and only make the burns in the fleshy area, and be sure it is not piercing through.
After treat the area until it is healed, and if the area is sealed, and the matter has been removed for a long time, then know that the area is completely healed.
And if the matter is not removed, know that the area is rotten, and the bone at the bottom is corrupt. And thus, like one of those we will describe in its place.
When pain from cold comes to the kidneys, and from a great windiness, and does not take the form of a woman, then you must cauterize the kidneys on both sides with the clavile cautery we have spoken of before.
And if we cauterize in the middle, then there will be three cauteries in a line, and they will be of greater help.
Of the bladder When the bladder is weak and soft from cold and moisture, so that the patient retains urine, then cauterize on the outer part of the bladder, where the hairs of the pubic region begin, and one on the right and one on the left, and let each cautery be as long as the tip of a finger (one inch).
And make one cautery outside the back, or two if you need them.
And let the cauteries be shaped according to the form previously stated.
When the spleen is cold and moist, and does not allow the conception, and the flowers are corrupted and their ends are delayed; and when they come, one feels great pain: Then it is necessary that one make three cauteries around the pouch, as we have said in the cautery of the bladder, and two cauteries outside the back;
and let the cauteries be sharp, as we have said.
When viscous moisture descends to the socket of the hip, and for this reason it moves from its place, and the sign is that the thigh is longer than the other when measured together;
and if the place of the separation is found empty, then you must cauterize the patient on the hip socket with one cautery resembling a circle, and mark in front of the place around the socket as it turns, so that the socket is inside the circle;
and let the cauteries be like those with which one has cauterized the stomach.
And if this cautery is not present, make three cauteries of large olive-wood, and let the cauteries be as deep as all the others;
and treat it until it is healed.
of the pain in the hip When pain comes in the hip joint, and it is from cold and moisture, and the patient is treated with what we have said in the division and the treatment is not working, and the illness is old: then it is necessary to purge the patient of the thick humors with fetid pills, or other similar good pills. After that, apply cautery;
and the method of cautery is according to two methods: that is to say, with burning medicines, and fire cautery.
Fire cautery is according to many methods, of which one is such:
that you cauterize on the hip joint three triangular cauteries according to this shape, and make them good and deep, and have a space of a finger's width between each cautery, and let the cauteries be olive-shaped;
Sometimes one makes a cautery in the middle on the head of the hip, so that there are four according to this shape:
And if you wish, cauterize it with the circular cautery that we have previously mentioned in the dislocation of the hip;
but make it in such a way that the circle encompasses the entire hip, and all the tissues within it are burned.
And this is the way it is done in sciatica, when the pain is in the hip, and does not reach the thigh or the leg.
And if it extends to the thigh and the leg, then make two cauteries where the patient says the pain is, and one cautery above the ankle, four fingers, a little to the left side;
and let the cauteries be incisive, and let the tissues within be burned.
and if the patient feels that the pain extends to the toes or near the heel, cauterize it where he feels the pain with three or four points using the cautery called "points". And if necessary, make more.
And if it is known that the pain is below the knee towards the thigh, make cauteries with a cutting or circular cautery, and take great care in all your cauteries that you do not leave the cautery on long enough to burn the nerves and major arteries, and that you do not cause the patient more harm and contraction.
And I myself have seen several who have applied cautery to the ankle of the foot, and they left it on so long that the leg became completely swollen, and the foot also, and the entire foot was pierced and corrupted. After a bellyache from which he died.
And if the pain is in two parts together, apply cautery to one and the other, according to this method.
And the wise men said, concerning cauterization of the hip, this is the method: make a cautery iron that is as large as a fingernail, or a little less, and let the cautery iron have indentations, and let the spaces between the indentations be the width of a fingernail.
and let the indentations be opposite on two sides, and be like knots, and let there be one handle on the iron well made;
and this is the form:
And heat it until it is all red and throws sparks, and then place it on the painful area of the hip, and turn it on the healthy side;
and cauterize once with the cautery iron and leave it for three days; and then make a plaster of butter, and leave the wound open for a long time; after the treatment with ointment until it is healed.
Albucasim says that we use this cautery little for fear of its effect, and we see few who use it;
and yet this is a good cautery, for whoever can tolerate it, and in the places where it is suitable.
The burning cautery is that you make an instrument with openings in it, into which the margin of the wound descends, and it should be of brass or iron with a long edge, and in height there should be two openings, and there should be between each the thickness of a finger; and they should be open in front and above, and join together according to this shape:
Then place the hip of the lying patient on the sound side, and press your hand firmly on the hip's area; then pour between the two rings hot water that is heated on the fire a little, and let it sit for an hour, and the patient endures the heat and burning.
For it finds there a burning as of fire;
and when the burning is passed, remove your hand with the instrument and lift the hip with soft water, and leave it so for three days, and apply butter until that which is black from the scald is removed; and leave it three days that pus may come out;
and that would be the final help after the treatment with ointments until it is healed.
And if the pain extends down to the thigh or leg, make an instrument to soak with water, according to what you have done to the hip similarly;
and that is the manner of hot water, and I have written it in the treatment of medicine's rectification. Take alkali and quicklime, as much of one as of the other, and grind them together, and put them in a new pot. where there is a small hole to escape, so that the tip of a razor can enter it;
where there is a small hole to escape, so that the tip of a razor can enter it; and put over that pot another pot well-sealed, and put alkali and lime and sweet water on top, as much as there should be two of them above the powders when you will have well grasped it in your hand;
and leave it thus until water descends and drips into the sealed pot, then take all that water, and pour it onto the lime and alkali as before.
And then it will be very clear and is administered in many medical procedures and in cauterizations of other limbs.
For it does a work like fire, and there are other medicines with which one cauterizes well the hip, such as terebinth and honey and mastic and lime with soap, all these things mixed together.
And Galen tells us of a cure by which a man was cured of hip and sciatic pain, and praises it much, and says that no other cure was made, and that he was healed in one single time when this cure was done, and he had bathed as he teaches afterwards.
And says in this manner that you take fresh and dry green litharge, and grind it much with a little fat, and put it on the hip and thigh and leg where the pain is, and bind it.
and leave it for three hours, and by the amount that the patient no longer feels the burning.
And then make him enter the bath so that his body is somewhat wet, and make him enter the bed, and the pain will go away entirely and he will be healed.
And know that no one should use cautery of such medicines, unless it is after the evacuation of the body.
And Dioscorides says that when the sciatic vein is cauterized with goat's dung, it helps a lot.
and the cauteries should be done in such a manner. Take wool and soak it in old oil, and place it on the hollow that is between the big toe and the other one, which is called the foscile.
After that, take dry goat's dung and heat it in fire until it is embers, and put it on the wool, and leave it until it is extinguished;
and repeat this, and do not cease to do so until you think by feeling that it reaches the hip, and that the pain is stopped;
and this manner of cautery is called "cautery of goat".
of the pain of the back
When pain comes to the back, whether from falling or impact or from excessive evacuation, or from the spread of cold matter, none of these does cauterization benefit, except for that which comes from the infusion of cold matter.
It is necessary after the patient has been emptied of fetid pills or similar things, that one make upon his back, where the pain is, three lines marked out, and on each line five cauteries or more, according to the strength and the quantity the patient can endure;
and let the cauteries be done according to the cautery which is called "pointed".
and if you wish, make three or four cauteries on the middle clavicle cautery, according to this form:
Many times this illness comes to young children, and the signs of the beginning are that they have a tight chest when they rise, and fear; and you find in the last spine of the back and on those others where the appearance comes.
When you see this and wish to cure it, cauterize it with a circular cautery, according to this form. So that the cautery grasps each part of the spine equally.
And if you wish, cauterize around the spine with a pointed cautery, two or three lines, and let the points be close together.
After healing the area until it is healthy, according to what we have said, and beware that you do not apply cautery to a swollen area near a nerve.
Of the pain of the joints
When joint pain is caused by moisture spread throughout the body's limbs, and when pain occurs in the feet, which the doctors properly call "podagra," and when it is caused by cold and medicinal cures cannot cure it, it is cured by cauteries in this manner:
Make many cauteries around the joint of the foot, and let the cauteries be olive-shaped according to this form:
And if it requires that you prick the sole of the foot, then make a cautery to the entire cautery that is called a "point". And if the pains extend to the knees and other joints, and this happens many times, then make three or four cauteries on each knee, of each part, to the entire olive-shaped cautery;
and if you need more, then make more, but do not hold your hand over it longer than until the thickness of the heartwood is burned.
And if the pains descend to the knee and back, then administer the cautery that we have said in this chapter.
And if the pains are in the hands, then make pricks around the wrist two lines;
and if any pain remains in the fingers, then make pricks on each joint and on the skin of the hand;
and if the pains come to the elbows or to the shoulders, then cauterize each part, and give good treatment to the patient and have them take medicines.
For if you give him good treatment and purge the phlegm, he will be healthy with God's help.
When rupture occurs in the groin, and the swelling descends to the testicles, and it is recent, then when you wish to treat it, he should not eat that day. and that he use things that loosen the belly, so that the bowels descend from his belly;
after that, make him sit on his back between your hands, and instruct him to hold his breath until the swelling is repaired, and bring it back into place with your fingers, and apply a sign under the rupture, over the bone of the finger, and make a sign like half a circle above the body;
then heat the cautery with this shape:
until it is white and it throws sparks. Then return the bowels to their place; and let the attendant hold his hand over them so they do not return back;
and open the patient's thighs well, and put a cushion under him and a servant on his thighs, and another one on his chest to hold his hands;
then place the cautery on the sign with your whole hand, and hold it straight and hold it until you reach the bone, and if you do not reach it the first time, start it again another time until you come down to the bone; and be careful subtly that the bowel does not leap when you do the cautery; that you do not burn it; and that through this the patient does not die, or other ills.
And know that when you do not come down to the bone with the cautery, your work is worth nothing.
And it is necessary that the cauteries of children be subtle according to their size, and of great people also great according to their size;
after three days treat the area of the cautery with butter until the burn is removed;
after that treat with other ointments until it is healed, and the patient must lie on his back for 40 days until the wound is well healed;
and it is necessary that his nourishment be lessened for a long time, so that the bowels do not swell when he tries to walk around.
And after 40 days, when he wants to get up, give him a well-made bandage, and keep it on for 40 more days;
and let him have good rest, that he work little and guard against too much drinking and eating, and against too loud shouting;
and when he follows this instruction he is completely healed.
And I will say here after the treatment of cutting in his chapter.
When ruptures occur in other bellies and are known, and you see that they are not growing any more, you should apply cautery cauterization according to its size, and burn one-third of the core; after the treatment according to what we have said;
and some of the ancients have said that it should be cauterized with a cautery with three angles according to this shape:
but first mark the place of the incision and make a line across the width above the rupture, and another outside, and place your hand in the middle over the entire cauterization area.
But the first cauteries are lighter and gentler.
of old pain in any limb When pain comes to any limb, from falling or striking, and that pain lasts a long time, and the remedies of medicine are not effective, then it is necessary that it be cauterized with the cautery that is called "points," and let the cauteries be according to the length of the limb and its smallness and weakness and its virtue and its location of twists and its pain.
If it is healed from the first cautery, that is good;
If not, start another cautery on top of that one, for it is customary that it should shift to the part of the limb that is nearest, therefore you should apply cauteries until the patient is healed.
Inflammation is sometimes aided greatly by cautery, especially that which comes from the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy.
When you see it being cauterized, be wary if the disease is in its early stages, and if it is cured according to what we have said in the division, and does not descend nor remain, and you doubt that the corruption will not seize the entire patient, then apply five cauteries to the head. One in the middle of the head, and the other towards the forehead at the end of the hair; and two on the two horns, and one behind on the nape of the neck;
and leave your hand there until the cauteries reach the bone, and until the scabs come out so that the vapors of the thick humors can escape;
and cauterize the mice according to what is in front.
And if the pestilence is spread everywhere; and if it clearly persists, you must cauterize it with those cauteries we have mentioned, one cautery on the forehead, two cauteries on the spine of the neck, six cauteries on the spine of the back, one large one on the buttocks and another beside it, and two on the two shoulders; and two on the elbows, and two on the tendons of the breast, and one on each joint of the hands and feet, and on the hollows of the hands;
and beware of the nerves that are under the back of the rump, so that you do not burn them;
and sometimes one cauterizes on the bone of the elbow, and another on the bone of the stomach, and another on the liver.
And know that the more cauteries you make, the more aid you give it, and the more benefit it has.
And know that the patient does not feel any pain from the cautery as healthy people do, because the body is already completely corrupted.
And it is necessary that the cauteries be large and small according to the limbs and joints, according to what you find in the varieties of irons.
After the treatment, cover the area with flour of chickpeas with honey and other remedies until it is healthy.
When swelling appears in any limb and is treated with medicines, oils, and plasters, and it is not healed, then make cauteries on the limb according to its size and smallness.
and let the cauteries be a little penetrating into the depth of the flesh. then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
And sometimes cauteries are applied to the hand, foot, and back, at the exit of the nerve that immobilizes the limb, and thus the swelling is removed.
However, let no one interfere unless they are knowledgeable about the limbs and the exits of the nerves moving the body.
When the disease called "albaras" has become advanced, and the resources of medicine are of no value, then cauterize it with a cautery a little deeply, according to the thickness of the heart, until the redness is removed, and its color is changed.
then treat it with flour of vetch and lentils, with rose oil and plantain leaves, and blood of a dove and blood of a partridge, of each a part. and mix it all together, and wrap it with a cloth, and leave it exposed to the air until it is healed.
The treatment of a sore by cautery
When a sore appears at the beginning, and you want to stop it, cauterize it with a cautery that resembles a circle, all around the sore.
And nevertheless, the wise ones say that one should also cauterize the middle of the sore;
And nevertheless, this does not seem good to me, for I fear that it might become ulcerated and corrupted, and I have already seen it happen several times;
And a more correct thing is that it be cauterized around, with a cautery called "circle", as we have said in the matter of cauteries.
When someone has an illness called "adubelati," and it delays healing, either due to the superfluity it causes or because of the patient's age—when they are decrepit (that is, too old) and have little blood, or because of the time; and you wish to hasten its healing: then cauterize around it with many small, pricking cauteries; after that, leave it thus. For it will hasten to heal.
And if you wish to pierce it with the whole cautery, heat the cautery according to this form:
And place your hand in the middle of that ailment called "adubelati" until the cauteries have pierced the core, and let the cauteries be such that the patient feels them outside in such a way that the course of the rot is eased.
After that, treat it until it is perfectly healed.
There is another kind of illness called "corrodens," which is nothing but a gnawing of the members, for it gnaws at the limbs just as fire gnaws at dry wood.
If you see this ailment in a place that can tolerate cauterization with fire, then heat the cauteries small and large, according to what is appropriate for the location where the illness is.
After cauterizing from all sides until you have eradicated all the corruption, and nothing of it remains, so that all that is corrupted is removed.
And then leave it for three days, and apply to the cauterized areas a soft poultice with oil until the heat from the fire is gone and all the corruption.
After the treatment with ointments that generate flesh.
And if after three days you see that healthy flesh does not grow, that is good.
And if not, then reapply the cautery to whatever parts of the corrupted areas remain.
And this inflammation has sometimes been treated with a sharp medicine instead of fire cautery;
However, fire cautery is of greater help, and I have already described the treatment with sharp medicine in the section: Take it when you need it.
of the boils that come on the feet Often, a disease called "clos," in our understanding, arises on the feet from outside, and it is a large, swollen thing that hurts the foot.
And the cauteries for this disease are according to two methods. That is to say, cautery by fire, and cautery by hot water.
Cauterization by fire is when you heat a cautery iron, just like a pointed wedge, and it should be made of good iron, sized so it can hold the nail on all sides, and have fine edges;
Then put it, hot, on the nail, and turn your hand all around the nail until it reaches the bottom of the nail; and leave it thus three days until it begins to cast off pus; Then make him a poultice of wild mallows pounded with salt, and leave the poultice on all night, and the nail will fall out and be uprooted from its roots.
Then treat the area with healing ointment until it is healed.
And if they are converted outward from the body, and often happen on hands and feet, then you must apply cautery with hot water to them; and it is of this manner: take a copper or iron rod, or a piece of wood, and put it on the nail and the wart, that is to say, for warts; and place the rod so that it grasps it completely around, then put a little hot water on it, and hold your hand firmly, and press your hand while turning so that the edge of the rod comes to the root of the nail, and the hot water can find a deep path to the root;
and let the patient suffer a little the burning of the hot water for an hour; then leave it thus, and it will be uprooted from all its roots.
Thus do one after another, until you have removed all those that are on the body, then treat them with ointments that generate flesh.
When someone trembles from cold nerves, or from quartan fever or other, then you must make four cauteries on the spine of the back, one cautery between each spine; and one cautery on the feet, and one on the stomach with the olive cautery;
This will stop the trembling, and the health will hasten from the cold sickness.
Sometimes, foul-smelling boils or pustules appear on the body, which come from large corrupted matter.
So it is necessary at first, when they appear, that one make cautery on each head of the pustule. A subtle cautery of myrtle wood, whose point is heated in fire, or of long aristolochia root, or a lenticular cautery.
And sometimes they are cauterized at the beginning when they appear, according to this manner, and they cannot grow further, but the superfluities from which they come are broken, and they are healed.
But it is necessary that this be done after the evacuation of blood.
Many times great flows of blood occur from the artery that is cut in the wound that comes from burns, or in the incision of the abscess, or in the cautery of the limb, and in similar things; and it is a very grievous thing to stanch.
And yet, when this happens to someone, hurry to place your index finger on the wound of the vein, and press it firmly until the blood is calmed under your finger, and no more drops come out;
then put the olive cauteries, many small and large, in the fire until they are all red;
then take one, large or small depending on the wound and the place where the artery is broken, and place the cautery on that vein where you hold your finger, and hold the cautery there until the blood is stanched.
And if it spurts out forcefully when you remove your finger from above the vein, and the cautery is extinguished, quickly take another cautery that is in the fire.
And do not cease doing this, one after the other, until the blood is stanched;
and watch that you do not burn the nerve that is beside it, and that no other harm comes to the patient;
and know that when blood flows from the artery, it cannot be properly stanched, especially when the artery is large, unless it is by one of the four methods that we have said: or by cautery, or by extraction when it is not treated, or by a strong binding of thread, or by medicines applied that have the power to stanch blood; and let it be bound and held tight.
Whoever applies a stanching of binding tightly with cloths or putting burning things on, or other similar things, will not profit much.
And if this happens to someone and they have neither a bandage nor medicine present, they should put their index finger on the wound of the vein, as we have said, and extend it well until it is stanched above the wound and above the vein; and do not move the finger, but moisten it with cold water often so that it is very cold until the blood is congealed and thickened and stanched;
and make inquiries beforehand about the cauteries and medicines needed.
We have told you in the first chapter all the illnesses in which fire cautery, or burning medicine, is necessary, and the indications and causes and instruments and forms of cauteries;
and I have arranged that chapter from head to foot, and I will follow the same way in this chapter so that what is sought may be found more easily.
And before I begin this, my dear son, you must understand that in this chapter there is more danger and fear than in the first one on cauteries, and therefore greater caution is necessary.
For in the work of this chapter, there is often an evacuation of blood when opening a vein, and incising an abscess, and in the treatment of wounds, and in the extraction of arrows, and in cutting into stones, and similar things; where there is doubt and fear, and death comes to many.
And I warn you not to undertake foolishness. For many kinds of people come for cures. for there come such who become so enraged with their illness that they die easily because of the fury they find in their sickness, and because of the greatness of its malice; and from these one should have fear.
And from these there are those who give you their sense, and say: wait, I am cured"; and the illness is spiteful.
You should not consent to those who come to you with this manner, but place greater trust in your honor than in your greed, and do not act foolishly but wisely regarding those of whom you are certain, and from whom you can obtain praise;
and use prognostication and indication in the treatment of your sick so that health may be attained;
and this will help you acquire good renown, glory, and a memory of praise.
Dear son, Our Lord grant you good understanding and rectitude, and may He inspire you with His holy inspiration, amen.
Now I have arranged this chapter in divisions, following what precedes it in the chapter on cauteries, which I have described from head to foot, so that you may more easily find what you need.
Know that this illness often afflicts children during childbirth, and when the delivery is too forceful upon the child's head;
and sometimes it comes from an unknown cause.
And I have never seen this illness outside of children, and in all those I have seen, death hastened. And therefore it seems to me that it is better to abandon this work in such cases.
And I saw a child whose head was full of water, and the head grew larger each day until it could no longer be supported;
and the moisture grew so much that it died, and this moisture collects beneath the bone on the surface, between the heart and the bone;
and the treatment is such if the moisture is between the heart and the bone, and the abscess is small, that you should make a wide incision into the head;
and as long as two fingers, until the moisture runs;
and see here the form of the spatula:
If the moisture is more profuse, and the abscess is larger, then make two incisions in the manner of a cross, according to this form:
And if the moisture is beneath the bone, and the signs that you see are the seams of the head opened on each side, and the pus jumps out forcefully when you press it with your hand from within, and this is not yet resolved: then it is necessary that you split the head into three incisions according to this method:
And after the incision, extract all the moisture outward. Afterwards, bind the incisions with bandages and powders, and apply wine and oil, and leave it thus until the fifth day;
then unbind it, and treat the wound with tents and ointments, and let the head heal evenly, and give the patient dry food with little moisture until the limb is strengthened and healed.
And another method of incision is that you look to see the size of the abscess, and the collection of pus;
for sometimes it is in front; sometimes behind; sometimes to the right; and sometimes to the left.
Therefore, cut there where the abscess is open, and the accumulation of water, and cut it according to what you are able to do;
and be careful that you do not cut the artery; and if blood flows, so that the patient dies from the flow of blood and the evacuation of moisture.
When it happens to someone a disease that is called "catarrh" in their eyes or chest, and the illness is long-standing, and the cures of medicine do not profit at all, then the final cure is cauterization with that by which the two arteries are cut.
It is necessary, then, when you wish to cut them, that the patient lift up his head. Then he rubs the area with a rough cloth until the arteries appear, then the patient tightens his neck with all of his strength. Then look where the vein flows, and the places of one and the other are near the ears, and they are pointed.
Then mark the places on them, then cut one and the other with a sharp scalpel from two sides, until the incision reaches the bone, and this should be across the width of the head.
And if you wish, place the scalpel under the artery and cut above it, cutting as you should through the middle.
And when the vein is cut, the blood spurts upwards continuously.
And if the artery does not appear upon feeling, you must measure the space of three fingers, then mark it and cut down to the bone.
And that which is necessary to draw out of the blood is six ounces, and perhaps a little more or less, according to what the patient can bear and the fullness of the artery.
then look at the wound: if any bone remains on the surface, cut it so that festering sores do not arise, then constrict the wound and bind it, and apply an ointment until it is healed.
of migraine When chronic migraine comes, and acute catarrh, due to moisture in the tears and heat in the temples and ancient madness and similar things, and he is treated by various medical cures and none of it helps him, then we will extract the arteries of the temples and cauterize them, as we have described.
And the method of extracting them is that the patient pulls back the hair of his temples and locates the artery which appears in the temple, for it shows well through its beating, and is scarcely visible except in some men who are very cold;
and if it is visible, the patient tightens its neck with some cloths, then rubs the area with a rough cloth, and warms the area with hot water until the artery is clearly visible; then take the spatula which has this shape: then lightly scrape the skin until you reach the artery, then pull it upwards with forceps, and separate it well from the tissues underneath on each side;
and if the artery is delicate, then turn it with the point of the hook, then cut that part according to the size of the two heads. For if it is not cut, the blood will not completely stop flowing.
And draw blood from six to three;
and if the artery is large, you must tie it in two places with a strong double silk thread, so that no rot occurs before the wound heals, and blood flow does not resume;
then cut the excess between the two ties at that same moment, and then, if you wish, cauterize it with a knife cautery down to the bone until the heads are cut;
and that is the better work, if the patient does not have a fever and is of a warm complexion. For cauteries are a help to finish moistures: for this reason, it is of greater help to moistures.
Where it is necessary for the extraction of arteries that one fill the place with old cotton and place well-made bandages on top;
and when one removes them, they should be treated with dry medicines that promote flesh growth, and with bandages, until they are healed;
and if without cessation of the artery while you work on it, hurry to cut it with cautery, or fill the place with vitriol and hold it with your hand so that the blood is stopped; and if you do not have that present, place your finger on the area until the blood is congealed, and cool the area with cold water until the blood stops, and hold it as necessary;
And there should be one finger's width of space between the two blades, and then when you have marked the two places, you put the burning iron on until it reaches the bone, and cut the vein in two places; and they should be separated between the two sides, for they are not completely soldered together by this cautery;
and this is the form of the cautery:
And what is gentler and more straightforward in the extraction of the artery is to cauterize the vein with this sharp cautery from two sides, but the cutting parts should be thick to retain their heat longer. For when the instrument is too thin, it holds less heat.
of tears When tears from the eyes are flowing down the veins on the head's surface, and no medical treatment helps, and you see the patient's face turning red, and feel a tremor like shivering in the forehead; and their eyes are weak and moist, so that the hairs of the eyebrows have fallen out, and the eyebrows are scorched and blistered from the heat of the tears, then this treatment is needed. And the ancients called it "contused cure," and you should do this for the patient with this illness: remove the hairs from their forehead, then make three even cuts across the forehead, lengthwise.
And the ancients called it "contused cure," and you should do this for the patient with this illness: remove the hairs from their forehead, then make three even cuts across the forehead, lengthwise. and one cut should be as if cutting through the middle of the forehead, down toward the nose, and the other two at the eyebrows, on either side, and be careful not to cut the arteries located on either side above the eyebrows.
and keep your hand away from the juncture of the two jawbones, and each incision should be about three fingers across and in depth.
and have ready a piece of sponge and many cloths to wipe away the blood, then apply the pointed spatula from two sides, following this shape:
from the incision beside the temple to the second incision. and scrape all the flesh between the two incisions, over the entire surface above the bone, then do the same from the middle incision to the other second one, and then remove this spatula. then place in the first incision the instrument called a "cultellaire", which is very sharp on one side, and on the other side is blunt, not sharp, and this is the shape:
And place the cutting side towards the flesh near the flesh, and the blunt side towards the bone, and insert it until it reaches the middle incision.
And cut all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes until the incision is continuous to what appears of the flesh, and then do the same in the middle incision to the other one;
and then remove the blood equally, and press the area for the blood taken;
then place in each incision a tent of old cotton, and place over it cloths moistened in wine and oil and vinegar, and guard that no hot abscesses come there;
and on the third day loosen the bandage, and administer to it much warmed water, then treat it with basil ointment with rose oil, and other treatments with which wounds are treated, until it is healed.
When some have acute catarrh habitually, and you see the eyes tense and small, and the sight weakening, and the eyelids burned; and the hair falls out, and in the head there is sharp pain, and the patient sneezes; Then know by these symptoms that those matters and that catarrh do not come from anything other than many veins, and the best cure for it is this.
And it is that you instruct the patient to lie on their back, then make a large incision through the forehead, and another one across the large brow. And begin from the incision of the left temple to the right temple, and let the incision go down to the bone; and keep your hand away from the nerves of the temples that move when eating;
and when the bone is exposed, wipe all the blood with a sponge, and then separate the two edges of the incision and put old cotton and linen strips in it; then bind over wet cloths soaked in wine and oil, and beware of a hot abscess;
when it is removed, you should rub the bone until flesh begins to grow, then treat it with things that dry up, that cause flesh to grow.
In such a manner: Take two parts of wheat flour, and four parts of colophony, and make a plaster from it; and apply it to these wounds to cause flesh to grow throughout.
of the stopping of the ears
All that falls into the ears is one of the four things: or grains, or a beast, or a stone from a mine or a similar thing such as iron; or seeds, such as haws, beans, peas; or a flowing thing such as water and juices and similar things.
When a stone or other thing falls into the ear that does not join to the ear nor grow in the ear, place the ear in the sun.
If you see the stone, then distill a little violet oil or oil of sesame, then administer extraction; and make him sneeze with remedies, and plug his nostrils when the sneezing comes, and put around the ear pieces of cloth or wool; and extend the ear upwards.
Often, this treatment causes pus to emerge;
and if it does not emerge, administer extraction with fine tweezers, whose form is as follows:
If it begins to emerge with the tweezers, that is good;
otherwise, administer extraction with a fine, small double-ended hook;
and if it does not emerge by that, make a copper wire loop and put the head of the wire loop firmly into the ear hole, and seal what is around the wire with soft wax so that air cannot enter with the wire; then pull it out forcefully, for often it emerges as we have said;
and if it does not emerge in this way, take bird glue, and place any suitable instrument to do this, and put a small piece of cotton around it; then press the glue against the stone or whatever it may be, and pull forcefully.
And if it does not emerge from all these things that we have said, quickly incise the ear before a hot abscess forms there, and spasms occur;
and the way to incise is that you first make the patient bleed from the cephalic vein, and drain blood according to its virtue, then have the patient sit between your hands and turn the ear upwards, and make a small incision at the base of the ear at the fat or dependent area; and let the incision be like a crescent moon, until you reach the stone, then remove it to the best of your ability, and quickly suck it into your mouth;
and treat it until it is healed.
And if it is grains that are within and it swells, administer extraction;
and if it cannot come out, administer thin, subtle spatulas according to this form: and administer an incision to that grain.
But do not do this at all when you think the grain is moist because of moisture in the ear, until you have made many pieces;
then extract with fine tweezers and by suction, as we have said, so that the extraction is eased.
In the water that falls into the ear, the patient should first use sneezing remedies, and dry the ear with old cotton. And let him lie on the very ear where the water is. If it jumps out with that, it is good.
If not, then take several stones according to the length of your finger and light, and heat them a little in the fire; and put one or several in the opening of his ear, and jump up on it with his feet on the other side, and strike another stone against the stone that is in the ear; and do not cease to strike stone against stone until the water comes out completely, and thus it jumps out completely;
and if you wish, take a reed, and put one end in the ear, and the other end hold in the fire until the softest part of the reed is burnt;
then do the same with other reeds until the water comes out completely, just as we said with the stone.
In extracting the pest, if it is small, such as a flea and similar things, treat it as we said in the division;
but if it is large enough to be felt, administer extraction with pincers; and this is the easiest thing to remove that is in the ear.
In the extraction of worms lodged in the ears, when you treat them as we have said in the division and in the treatment of distillations, and the treatment is not effective, you must examine the ear in the sunlight: if any worms appear, extract them with fine pincers, and if none appear, take the implement whose shape is this:
And it should be narrow beneath and wide above. And insert the finest end into the ear according to the severity of the patient's suffering, then suck strongly with the entire implement; do this repeatedly until all the worms emerge.
And if they do not emerge, plug around the implement with cotton as I have said about the stone;
and if they do not flee as we have said, then administer distillations that the ancients have proven effective in killing worms, and you will find them in the treatise on distillations;
and distill your oils and medicines into the ear with this entire instrument, of which this is the form as you see: And it is of silver or bronze, narrow underneath with small holes, and open above for distilling;
and for pressing within the distillation with a well-made bronze instrument for this, and if you wish, take a scraper and wrap cotton around the pointed end; then pour your oil or juice, and whatever medicines you wish into the tube, and the tube should be in the ear;
then place the scraper with all the cotton inside, and press with your hand gently until the oil is distilled into the ear's cavity; and the patient smells it within, and let the distillation be a little heated by fire thus when distilling it into the ear; and watch that it is not too cold, for the medicine would not be good at all.
Of the stopping up of the ears
No child is born who does not have any holes in the ears;
and this very thing happens to men through the stoppage of a wound, or of flesh growing inside the ear, and these stoppages sometimes go deep into the ear, so that one cannot see them;
and sometimes there is a little protrusion from the hole, and one sees it clearly.
That which goes deep, so that one cannot see it, requires more difficult treatment in several ways, and for that which one can see, you must place the patient's ear in the sun; and look inside: if you see the obstruction appearing, if you work at all this spatumile of which this is the form:
And let it be sharp and cutting in front and behind, perfectly smooth, so that it does not injure the ear;
if the obstruction is of flesh born within or on the ear, hold it with delicate pincers, and cut it slightly, until that flesh is all removed.
And if the obstruction is deep inside the ear, take a fine, light rasp and heat it a little in the fire, then place it on the inside of the ear.
If you feel the obstruction which the patient feels as a painful noise, pierce it lightly, and be careful not to injure the nerves of the ear;
then place a tent in the ear according to the width of the opening, and moisten it in Egyptian ointment. Do this for some days until the wound is healed, or you take a tent and moisten it in rose water, and powder with crushed vitriol;
and if you see the ear swollen, it is necessary that you remove the tent and replace it with another tent moistened in a cerote made of rose oil and wax, until the swelling is gone; then treat it until it is healed.
And if a discharge of blood comes, then dip a sponge and cloths in cold water, and place it on the ear, and use other treatments that stop the discharge of blood, which are in the treatment of discharges.
This is the treatment for papery growths from the eyes when they are moist and dry, you must pull them out with forceps and tweezers, and cut it with a spatula from its roots; then put powdered vitriol on the area.
And if blood flows, cauterize it with a subtle, lenticular cautery, and the cauterizing after the incision is worth much.
and many times they return, if anything remains of their roots; and when they are cauterized by fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
of hail Many times there come in the eyes' papers things that appear as hail in its form and hardness, and because of this, this illness is called "grandine," and is a collection of thick moisture in the paper above and below. the work is such:
the work is such: beware if the grandine moves from one side to the other, and it is an easy thing to know.
then cut it away from the sides, then scrape it lightly from each part, then take it with tweezers and cut it.
If you cannot cut it without piercing the paper a little, do not harm the patient.
and if the fissure is large, assemble it with a stitch, and treat it until it is healed.
and if it is small, do not apply force, for the ointment will restore it quickly and generate flesh.
And if the granulation is descending into the inside of the ear towards the upper part, turn the paper over, and take the granulation with tweezers, and cut it and press it from one side and the other.
And if the paper is moved away by the incision, it does not harm.
and when the granulation is cut, remove the salt water, and treat the place with that which generates flesh until the patient is healed.
of the fat of the eyes Exinach is a fat that is formed in webs of skin on the eyelids, and this happens more to children than to adults, and it greatly harms their eyes, and cataracts come to them in the mornings, and they cannot look at the sunlight because tears rush to their eyes;
and because of this they often lie on their faces, and sleep on their faces, and their eyelids under their eyebrows are dampened so that swelling and appearance are covered by exinach that is visible in the eye. And when you press the place with your fingers and feel the exinach between them.
And the method of treatment is that the patient places his head in your lap;
and then take a linen cloth, and prepare a covering in the shape of a circle according to the amount of exinach in each part, then put it over him; and press with your fingers on either side, so that the exinach is gathered within the circle;
then cut a slit in the middle of the moisture with a sharp spatula, and it should not be any wider than the wound made when opening a vein;
and cut the skin deeply until you reach the exinach; and in several places, exinach comes out of the slit, in the shape of a piece of white fat.
Then pull it out entirely with a piece of cloth held between your fingers to prevent it, and turn your hand to the right and left until it is dispersed;
and be careful not to force into the slit, so you do not injure the entire spatula down to the eye.
And if the exinach does not appear at the beginning of the slit, then slightly widen the slit a little until it appears;
then pull it out as we have said, then soak cloths in oil and vinegar, and place on the area, and bind with bandages.
And if there are such men who grind the salt and put it on to dissolve the moisture that remains.
Then treat it until it is healed.
And if an abscess arises in the area, treat it with soothing poultices until it is healed.
of the hairs of the papers When additional hairs grow on the eyelids, beyond the natural ones, and they age, they harm the eyes and cause various illnesses such as customary tears and softening of the eyelids and the albuginea, leading to the destruction of the eyes;
and the cure is according to four methods: or by cautery with fire, or by sharp medicine according to what is before in the chapter on cautery, and is done either by incision and suture, or by cauterization, according to what I shall say.
You must place the patient's head in your lap, then turn the eyelid to your left hand;
if it is turned, that is good; if not, then insert a needle along the entire thread above; and be it next to the edge of the eyelid where the hairs grow beside these hairs, and pull the thread over the entire eyelid, and turn it to the razor;
then cut in the part below the eyelid, below the attached hairs, along the entire slit, from the large tear duct down to the small one;
then pull out the thread, and place a small tent of cotton and cloth under the eyelid, then place a figure of a bandage on the eyelid, like a myrtle leaf, and nevertheless it is necessary that the figure be according to the quantity that you wish to raise the eyelid which is divided into all.
And if there is someone whose work requires that a large quantity of the eyelid be cut, according to how softened the eyelid is;
then cut along the entire slit above the two lines that you have marked, and begin from the large tear duct down to the small one; and let one of the incisions be near the natural hairs, the thickness of a root, then place the hook in one of the two angles of the wound, then scrape it all off;
then bring the two edges together with a stitch of a needle with a very fine thread of wool, and wipe away the blood, and dry the excess threads above the two eyebrows with some sticky substance, if you wish to do this;
and if not, do not treat it, then leave the stitches and threads for three or four days;
then treat the wound without stitches with dry and constricting things, for the wound will heal by the coming together of the wound and its joining, but stitches are weaker (as the ancients said), and this is work without fear; and if there is another way:
and if there is another way: and is that you shape the wound into a form like a myrtle leaf, as we have described, with three separated incisions according to the form that is here:
then cut off what is protruding with small equal forces, according to the form that is here:
And if you are unable to hold the tongs, and the things are not equal, take a needle with a thread and put it in the middle of the figure; and put another thread next to the large tear, and the second thread next to the small one, and gather the threads between your fingers equally;
then lift your hand equally, and lift all the skin over which you have marked, as we have described, then bring the two edges of the wound together by stitching, and treat it until it is healed;
and if an abscess comes to your incision, soothe it with cerate and similar soothing ointments;
and sometimes it happens that the hair of the paper is converted:
if so, you must use what we have said about the incision;
but the stitching in one and the other is more artificial.
The treatment of canes is thus according to this form: and it is that you convert the paper and the slit within according to what I have said, and then make two canes by art, and two thin strips as long as the paper and the width of the spatula is; and cut as two heads from two sides where you hold the threads;
then assemble one and the other subtly over what rises of the paper of the eye, and bind the two canes of the two parts firmly; and leave it thus for several days, and the skin that is bound will die and become hardened and rot, until it falls off by itself.
If it delays, then cut it with force, then treat it until it is healed;
and when the wound is closed, and the paper is removed, and the hairs will no longer prick;
and this is the form of the two canes that you will make according to this figure, and according to this amount of length and width:
the work is such that you take a fine needle, and put a fine and soft silk thread in it; then assemble the ends and tie them together subtly, and the length of the threads should be a palm long;
then arrange in the chase another fine silk thread briefly, and tie the ends of the thread;
then put the patient's head in your safe keeping;
and let it be beside the sun so that the work is illuminated, for it is a subtle and delicate work, then put the needle with the whole chase into the hair root exactly, and make it pierce the paper quickly so that you draw it over the natural hair;
then pull the hair up to the chase, and put that hair into the chase, if there is one or two or three or more;
then pull your hand so that the hairs come out with the whole chase into the paper with the natural hair.
And if the chase is pulled and the hairs do not come out with it, then you shall pull the chase downwards along the entire thread that you have arranged, so that the chase comes out of the hole above and that you see it through the vision of your eye;
then you shall pull the chase and the thread, and close the eye and leave it closed for two or three days, so that the hair hardens in its place and the flesh grows;
and if the hair is small, then attach one long hair from the natural hairs, and let it grow with that or leave it so that it grows long and then remove it.
of the rot of the eye When this disease, which is called "aleacrati" or rot comes to the eye, there are two kinds of it:
one natural, and the other unnatural.
And it happens through the wounding of a cut or a cautery and similar things.
And the method of treatment is that you split the wound, and separate its edges, and place linen bandages inside, and bind it until it is healed;
and you should not use things that dry and constrict in its treatment. For if you do that, the illness will return worse than before;
but use softening things, such as fenugreek; and bathe it with water or boiled linseed seed and soften diachylon ointment in any oil, and wrap a bandage around it, and treat it with that.
And the key to your treatment is to ensure it does not heal according to its former shape;
and these works that we have mentioned are only remedies for this illness, so that it does not return in its former form.
This illness, which is truly called "axacrati," is both natural and accidental.
The accident comes from wounds and cuts and cautery and similar things;
and the method of treatment in this case is that you take a needle, with double thread on it, and insert it into the flesh, and pierce it from the left tear duct to the right, so that the thread comes out in two places on the flesh;
Then stretch the flesh over the needle, and cut it with a spatula wide. And if the shape of the paper returns according to what is required, that is good;
If not, then take a scraper and place it in the fissure, and turn the paper, and make two cuts on the side inside the paper;
and let the ends of the two cuts be at the two angles of the incision you have made, and make angles such that when they are assembled, the shape is like the shape of a letter called "I Greek";
then remove that flesh, according to the amount that its sides are sharp below, of that which enveloped the paper, then join the two separated parts, and sew them with a wool thread;
then treat it with what we have said about softening medicines, and with poultices, until it is healed.
And if the ailment comes from a fissure or a suture or cautery, then you must make a straight fissure beneath the hairs of the papers, and according to what is before; then separate between the two edges of a poultice, as I have said;
then separate between the two edges of a poultice, as I have said; and one must do the work according to the form of the illness, for it is very diverse in form, and wise masters prepare remedies with all their power, how they might bring the form back to its natural shape;
and the sick person themselves, according to what work and instruments are needed in various conditions.
When this joining occurs in such a way that the paper on top is joined with the white of the eye and cannot move or perform its natural functions, then you must put the point of a razor under the paper and lift it up;
and spread it with pincers, until you cut that which is hard in a subtle manner, that it not be too sharp nor too cutting, so that the patient cannot bear the overly sharp spatula injuring the eye;
and let your incision, with which you are scalding that assembly, be slight, so that the paper returns to its natural form;
and the entire assembly is healed, and sometimes they use sharp salty water, and lift it with fresh water, and with a poultice;
then put a linen tent between the paper and the eye, and place moistened wool on the eye, abundant in egg white; and after the third day use poultices and other soothing things until it is healed.
Know that the nail is according to two manners: It is nervous and resembles a hard surface, and another that is not nervous, but resembles frozen white moisture; when one touches it with iron and attempts to tear it with tweezers, one cannot.
And both appearances begin near the large tear duct, and grow little by little until they cover the entire sight, the entire light, and the movement of the eye.
And the manner of the incision is that the patient places their head on your breast, then opens their eyes; and lift the paper to your hand, then grasp the nail with small tweezers, and extend it upwards; then take a needle, and put a horse's hair, or cow's, or ox's, and a strong thread; and double the point of the needle a little and stick it into the nail, and pierce it all the way through with the needle, and tie the nail with a thread and extend it upwards, and scrape all the hair from the side of the nail that touches the prune and silk to the hair down to the root, then cut the remainder at the root of the tear duct with fine and small tools, and leave the natural flesh of the tear duct, so that the flow of tears does not come customarily with the incision;
and sometimes the nail is extended with the forceps only, and with the thread, as we have said; then one scrapes it with all the gentle tools by which this form is made:
And be careful that the tools do not touch the fleshy tissue and break it, and that the prune is not pierced;
and after the incision, put a little bit of crushed salt and litharge into the eye, and leave it until the next day; then treat it with whatever is needed until it is healed.
And if the nail is not very sensitive, and you cannot push the needle, and the instruments cannot enter, this type of nail is often treated with medicines;
and they grow as I have described in the division, and if you want to cut it, open the patient's eye and take a small, sharp spatula according to this form: And carefully lift the nail slightly, and if you see that it is thinning and the flesh is pressing against it, then spit into the eye a mixture of litharge, red pigment, and crushed salt, and bandage the eye until the next day;
If anything opposes you in the eye, such as a boil, then leave it, and first treat the boil until it is healed, then resume the procedure as before, until it is healed.
then begin again the other work according to this same procedure until it is completely removed.
And if the appearance of the lacrimal tissue harms the eye with great injury, then suspend it by a hook, and cut off a part of it, but not all of it, so that the tears do not come out;
then spit into the eye red pigment made of litharge.
The eyes of some men sometimes develop red flesh, covering the pupil and pressing on the eyelids, resembling a rose-coloured swelling.
and the procedure is that the patient places their head on your breast, then opens their eyes, and draws all that flesh to suitable hooks, holding it firm.
then cut the first layer of flesh, continuing to cut with a razor until the end, taking care not to injure the eye in the process.
and let the incision of the spatumile be as we described in the incision of the nail, with gentle force to remove the swelling, as the form after this chapter demonstrates.
and when the incision is complete and all the flesh removed, fill the eye with powdered salt or you may distil a red colic and similar corrosive medicines, and place a protective covering of cotton with egg-white bandage over it, ensuring that the inflamed swelling is secured.
and if anything remains, and the blood flows and you suspect a hot abscess, leave the eye and treat the abscess with things that soothe hot abscesses.
then return to your work until it is healed, and thus do for all similar cases of flesh growing on the eye.
However, it is necessary that you ease the treatment of each eye weak from its natural way. and from the accidental way, through iron work.
and do not put your hand on any of these works until you see that this limb is enduring that work.
Red veins are those that are covered over the eye, and they take away the eye's function and weaken the eye every day.
It is therefore necessary for the first that you look to see if the eye, in which the redness is, is strong, and there is no other illness other than the redness. then the eye in this way:
instruct the patient to place their head on your chest, then support those veins with the whole instrument according to his wisdom, and let the instruments be slender, double according to this form:
And let there be two instruments in a row according to this form:
then with the eye pressing those veins subtly, and wipe the blood hour after hour, until you see those veins move away from the eye;
and be careful not to injure the eye with the points of the instruments, and do this work at midday before the sun, and be very fervent in your work so that you cut only those veins;
and when you have done this, distill green and red liquid into the eye to corrupt what remains of the blood.
And if you cannot collect all of that in that hour, make a plaster on the eye of things that relieve eye pain, and leave it for a few days until the pain is relieved and be sure of a hot abscess, then start again according to this method which is before until it is healed;
and this is the form of the pressing:
The mirror is called "arissati" fistula:
When you treat it with cautery and with sharp burning medicine, according to what I have said before, and it is not yet healed, if there is a problem beneath the abscess, where it should remain, and you open it up and remove all the moisture that is in it, so that the bone is uncovered.
And when the bone is uncovered, and you see the corruption and blackness, you should scrape it all with the instrument, whose form is described here;
and is called "asper chief," and should be made of iron, pointed at one end, and sharpened like a file, as it is in the present form:
And place it on the spot where the bone is corrupted, then turn it between your fingers, and press your hand a little until you know that the corruption is removed;
and do this several times, then restore the spot with drying medicines.
if the wound is closed, and flesh grows, and the body of the wound is healed, and it remains like this for 40 days, and it does not reopen and is not inflamed, and no bad accident occurs, know that it is healed;
if not, there is no other remedy than to lead the fistula to the opening of the nose according to this form: and it is that you uncover the bone a second time with an iron, and with sharp medicines, and when it is uncovered, then you take a drill according to this form, and let the iron head be at three angles, and the shaft be tapered to the tip as you see here:
then place it on the bone near the tear duct, and move your hand away from the eye a little, then turn the entire drill until it pierces the bone, and the patient will feel it because wind will come out if he holds his hand over his nose;
and then restore the place with dry medicines, as I have taught you, and when the flesh grows and the wound hardens, the matter will go to the nose; thus it is a lighter thing for the patient.
When the eyes are completely open and there is no disturbance to the nose, nor any lessening, then you should bind the patient.
then you should heal it, then apply leeches or cupping glasses without striking to suck, then place on the eye a compress made of acacia, aloe, frankincense, and sarcocolla, and then compress the eye, and place the plaster over it with bandages and cloths;
and the way to arrange the cloths is that you take sufficiently soft cloths, and double each into four, and then place one on top of the other according to the amount needed for the eye.
then compress it from above with a firm bandage, and reapply the cupping glasses to suck without striking;
then remove the cupping glasses and leave the eye compressed day and night, and if the compress softens, then you must compress it strongly;
then remove the compress after the day and the night, and if you see the eye recovering, that's good;
if not; then reapply the plaster, bandages, compress, and cupping glasses until it is healed.
from tearing of the cloth or with When disruptions occur in the cloth or with it, then it appears, and oozes from the fibers like grains of resin, and is frightening to see;
Then, if you see it torn, the work is such that you insert a needle into the root of the damaged part, down to the one above it, and then insert another needle where there is a double thread, from the part of the tear; and pierce it, and leave the first needle according to its position;
then cut the double thread, and tie a part of the cloth around it, and tighten it well, then pull out the needle and place moistened wool over it, along with egg white;
and leave it until the thread breaks with the cloth, then treat the eye with comforting things until the wound is healed;
and sometimes the wound is constrained by a cloth in a circle around it, until it is healed.
And if the eye shows great appearance, pierce it with a fine needle that goes deep into the eye, and drain the whitish moisture and the eye will descend, and enter immediately;
then pull it out until it is healed.
This illness, called "alcunnati," is nothing more than a swelling that has gathered in the eye, resembling a descending stream, and this is not in fact a stream;
and the method of treatment is that you have the patient sit on a prepared and straight seat, then take the head between your hands from both sides, and move it so you see the swelling come above your eyes; then it should be fixed, and not descend, and the light should be clear, and the patient should see things as they used to;
and if it does not descend below, know that it is pus, and if the descent of the swelling is not arranged as we have said.
then make the patient sit between your hands, then take a subtle spatula and make a small cut on the cornea along the continuation of the conjunctiva with the cornea and the crown, until the swelling comes out;
and when it has come out, then instill into the eye warm pus mixed with honey, or pus or fenugreek boiled and honey, then be treated with further treatment until it is healed.
of the pus of the eye We have already described the types of pus in the division, and what is necessary to pierce it; so work according to the health.
You should make the sick person sit between your crossed hands, away from the light of the sun, and bind the healthy eye tightly.
then place the paper of the eye in your left hand if the eye is left, or in your right hand if the eye is right;
then take in your right hand, if the eye is left, the instrument called "almagda," or in your left hand, if the eye is right;
then place the tip of the instrument next to the crown, by the thickness of a reed, in that white part of the eye near the smaller tear duct, then push the instrument called "almagda" forcefully, and turn your hand until it pierces the white part of the eye, and feel that the almagda reaches the empty space;
and the measurement of the almagda's path should be at the depth of the space between the pupil and the end of the darkness; and that is the crown of the eye;
then you will see the bone in that paper due to the clarity of the cornea, and then place the instrument to the place where the thorn is, and press it along one path after another.
if the thorn descends now, the patient will see in front of them and the instrument in their eye.
After resting a little, and if the thorn ascends the second path, apply force with the instrument, and when it is firmly fixed and does not rise, extract the almagda gently by turning your hand slowly;
and then place a drop of gem-like oil in the thorn, and lift the thorn from within the eye. Then apply over the eye, a bandage of wool or moistened linen in rose oil and plenty of egg white, and bind with a sound eye.
We, and those of our time, place over it a compress with plenty of egg white.
And if the almagda cannot enter the eye due to its hardness, for there are some people who have excessively hard eyes, you must take the instrument called "alberit," of which this is the form:
And pierce then only the conjunctiva, and do not go too deep, but make a subtle opening, then insert the almagda, as we have said;
and at the completion of the work, prepare for the patient a suitable bed, where he sleeps on his back in a dark place;
and be free from all movement, and take light foods, and do not move his head either to the right or to the left, and be bound according to his disposition until the third day;
then unbind him in the same dark room, and test his sight, and make him see certain things, and then reapply the bandage until the seventh day;
and it is not necessary for you to do this during the time of the treatment or immediately after the incision, but you must delay this, so that the inflammation rises quickly.
if a hot abscess comes, that you unbind the eye before the seventh day, and apply what soothes the abscess;
and when it is calmed, then unbind the vision and place a bandage on his face to cover for a few days, and let him remain in that dark room.
And then gradually leave the room, and return to his usual activities;
and know that no disciple should interfere in this case. And one came to us who was from Iraq, who told us that in his country people made an almagda that pierces, with which one draws out water, but nonetheless I have never seen any in our land, nor have I ever read about it in the books of the ancients; and perhaps it is a new thing.
And these are the appearances of the forms of almagda, so that those who do not know them may see them;
and are of bronze properly: And let their heads be of this same fineness, and their tails in three sharp angles.
Sometimes various additional flesh grows on the nose, some of which resemble scorpions with many legs;
and some have flesh that is deeply colored with dark red, and some have soft flesh with a good color. In that flesh then, which is soft and not deeply colored, you must have the sick person sit between your hands facing the sun;
In that flesh then, which is soft and not deeply colored, you must have the sick person sit between your hands facing the sun; and open their nostrils, and apply a lancet to that flesh, and draw it out; then cut what you can hold with a sharp, thin lancet on one side, until you know that the flesh is entirely removed.
And if any remains that cannot be cut, then work on it with all the slender instruments gently, so that nothing remains; and if it overwhelms you, or causes a boil, then treat it appropriately;
and if it is a malignant boil, then hurry and cauterize it until the blood is stopped and all the flesh is removed, then apply a soothing and sharp oil or wine. If the boil opens, and moisture flows to the palate, know that it is cured;
and if the moisture does not pierce as it should, know that there is flesh growing on the bone above, to which the instruments do not reach for cutting:
Then you must insert a somewhat thick linen thread, knotted by hand, and with a space of a finger or less between each knot; and have the patient hold the end of the thread in his/her boil to their fullest ability, and pull while smelling until it comes through the boil into the mouth;
and many children do this in schools, and it is an easy thing for whoever wants to do it;
Then hold the end that came through the boil in one hand, and the other end that came through the mouth in the other hand, and pull one after the other, while holding the knots of the thread.
Do this until you know that the knots have corrupted the flesh, then pull out the thread, wipe away the blood, and moisten the thread in Egyptian ointment, and replace it in the boil as before;
Do this for three days or more, until the ointment eats away all that remains of the flesh;
and then put a lead strip on the boil for a few days until it is healed, and if it needs drying medicines, use them;
and this is the form of the instrument for purging the boil, with which oils and medicines are distilled into the boil:
And it should be of silver or bronze, resembling an open lamp, like a pipe, and the conduit likewise;
and if you wish, make a closed pipe, and let the instrument be full to purge the boil;
and have a handle on the head to hold it when heating the oil or any liquid.
of the flesh over the boil
Many times a disease called "telul" arises on the head of the boil, and grows and becomes large often, until it is a visible thing to look at;
and for this, you must cut it at the beginning, and remove all the pus, then put the cautery or the burning medicine on the spot;
and if one delays in cutting it until it is large, watch out if it is hard, of a foul color, with poor sensation:
if you do not touch it with iron, for it is a festering abscess, for when it is cut sometimes, great harm comes to the sick person;
and if the abscess is of soft touch, not of foul color, and you see that it can be cut completely, empty the sick person and cut it without fear, and treat the spot with drying and binding things.
Know that when a solution of continuation comes to one of these cartilage-like works, it profits little, except in some men.
It is necessary then, when this happens to someone, to see if the wound is fresh with all its blood; and then join the two edges with a stitch, then treat it until it is healed;
and if the edges are already separated on one side and the other, you must cauterize all the parts of their edge until they bleed, then bring together the two edges with a stitch, and bind it, and dust on it powder of dragon's blood and crushed incense; and place over the powders a piece of strong plaster or other healing plaster, and leave it until it falls off by itself, then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
The method of the stitch is that you assemble the solution: or with needles, as we have said in the stitch of the belly; or with thread, as I have made known to you.
of abscesses of the lips
To men's hands there happen abscesses within the lips, hard, resembling grains of wheat, and smaller and larger;
Then it is necessary that you turn the lips, and cut open each one, and grasp it with pincers and cut it into each part;
then fill the place after the incision with powdered vitriol, until the blood is stopped;
and then lift the lip, and heal the place with dry things until it is healthy.
Many times, added flesh grows on the gums, which the ancients called "albulus";
so you must hold it with pliers, and cut it at its root, and let the pus or blood run;
then put powdered vitriol, or other astringent and drying powders, on the place;
and if that flesh returns after the incision, which often happens, then cut it a second time and cauterize it: if it does not return after the cautery;
Sometimes there are gatherings at the head of the teeth, within the mouth between the gums, scabs that are foul and rough; and sometimes the teeth are black and yellowish and greenish, such that the corruption reaches the gum, and the teeth are foul-smelling;
If so, you must make the patient sit between your hands, and their head in your lap, and scrape the teeth where the scabs appear, until nothing remains there; and thus do of the blackness and the greenness, and the yellowness and the other spots, until they are cleaned;
and if one removes what is there at the first reason, that is good; if not, then start again on the second day and the third, until you have scraped everything;
and know that teeth require various types of tools for scraping, according to what the craftsman demonstrates, because the scrapers used to scrape the surfaces of teeth have different shapes than those used to scrape between the teeth; and these shapes and others be with you prepared.
It is necessary when you treat a toothache that you delay pulling it out as much as you can, for this must not be done at all; for it is a very important substance until there is no longer any excuse for scraping.
Then, when the patient is forced to extract, you must be certain about the aching tooth. Many times the pain deceives the patient, and they think it's in the healthy tooth, and have the good tooth pulled out; and yet the pain does not depart because of that, until the bad tooth is extracted, for we have already wanted to do this to these lords;
And when you are certain of the aching tooth, you must cauterize around the tooth in every part, strongly, to protect the gums on all sides;
Then grasp it with your fingers or delicate pliers on the first nip and snap, until it is well loosened, then firmly hold the pliers; And let the patient's head be between your knees, and hold it firmly so that it does not move.
Afterwards, extract the tooth straight without breaking it, and if it does not come out easily, then take any of these instruments and insert them slightly on either side, and move it as you did previously.
And if the tooth is pierced and decayed, you must fill it with strips of cloth where the holes are; and hold it gently with pliers, so that it does not break when you hold it.
and you must work very carefully around the gum to loosen the tooth.
And be very careful not to break it, and leave a part, and the patient will return with greater pain from the root than the initial pain.
And beware that you do not act like ignorant surgeons, who, through their haste and boldness, sometimes break the jaw and do not achieve what we have described;
but sometimes cause great illness by the remaining roots, or by breaking the jaw, as we have often seen;
And when the tooth is extracted, wash the area with wine, or vinegar, and salt;
and if bleeding occurs, which often happens, fill the area with powdered vitriol;
and if that doesn't work, cauterize it.
The shapes of the instruments, with which one pulls teeth first, should have long points and thick handles, so that they do not bend when you pull the tooth;
and these are the shapes: And they should be of large members so that they do not bend when pulling, and they should be of well-made tempered iron, and be toothed to hold the teeth.
of the root of the teeth When the root remains when pulling, you must put soaked cotton in butter on the place for one or two days, until the place is softened, then put the pliers, which are called "algefri", on it, of which the head resembles the beak of a bird;
and they should be made like a file, and this is the shape:
And if the roots do not want to come out with all these pliers, you must expose the flesh all around the root, and put the instrument that is called "althali", that is to say, a pick, of which this is the shape:
And it should be strong and thick so that it does not break, and if the root jumps out with this, it is good;
If not, use all the instruments, of which the shapes come next:
And if one uses this instrument which has two prongs, of which this is the shape: and other tools which are before, in the order of the teeth, and of this instrument which resembles large pliers, of which this is the shape:
And let these instruments be strong so that they cannot break, and know that many instruments for teeth are; and also other instruments, which are not counted;
and the wise master, subtle, finds his own instrument, according to his works and the illness shows him, for there are such illnesses where the ancients did not teach any instrument due to the diversity of others, and if one breaks the chariot or other bones, where it could, then seek the instruments that are necessary, as I have told you, and help with the gestures, of which this is the shape:
And let them be thick and well-holding to hold the bone, so that it does not escape, but can be held and removed;
and then restore the place with appropriate medicines, and if there is rot in the bone, and it is small, then remove it with this instrument:
When the teeth appear not according to the natural body, and the shape is ugly, and especially in young women, you must know if the tooth is born after the tooth, and is not in the right place, and it cannot be straightened or filed:
Then remove it; and if it is stuck with the tooth, take this instrument, whose form is like a small beak, and is of sharp, tempered iron at the tip:
And cut it little by little over several days due to the tooth's hardness, and so that you do not move the other teeth, and if it appears that it can be filed, file it with a file of this shape:
and it is also like the file with which needles are made;
and file the tooth little by little over several days gently, so that it does not move until it falls out;
then in the end plane it completely with a rasp, and if the tooth is too sharp and it cuts the tongue, it is necessary to file off the sharpness until it is even, so that it does not cut the tongue or impair speech.
When the front teeth loosen, either through impact or falling, and the patient cannot bite down on food without them falling out, and you have treated them with binding medicines, and this is not working;
then they must be bound with a gold thread, for silver thread turns green and rots, but gold never changes.
and the thread should be neither too thick nor too thin, according to the space between the teeth.
And if you wish to straighten the teeth, take the thread and put it double between the two healthy teeth, then put the ends between the loose teeth, if there is one or several, until you have successfully reached the healthy tooth on the other side; then repeat the wrapping back to where you started, and gently and skillfully tighten your hand, until it no longer moves.
and let your binding be at the root of the tooth so that it cannot escape.
Then cut the ends of the thread with pliers, and join them, and place them between the healthy tooth, and position them so they do not injure the tongue;
and then leave it tight for as long as it can stay, and if it loosens, or the thread breaks, tighten it with another thread;
if it remains and serves thus for all its time, and that is the form of the teeth and the manner of straightening the two healthy teeth, and the two gums, as you see:
And when the tooth falls out, it is reset in its place, fresh by fresh, as we have said;
and do not interfere with it unless one is skilled and patient, and sometimes a tooth shape is made from cow bone, and it is placed in the space where the missing tooth is, and it is tightened as we have said, and remains and serves thus for a long time.
Sometimes this ligament comes from under the tongue by nature, that one is born with it; or by accident from a healed wound;
and the work is such that you open the patient's mouth, and hold their head in your hand, and lift the tongue;
then cut the thick ligament, so that the tongue is freed from its attachment, and if there is hardness or knots, and this is from the healing of a wound, you will use the hook and cut the ligament wide;
and be careful that the incision is not too deep, because of the artery that is underneath;
and when you have done this, apply a poultice of rose water and oil, or cold water, then place a linen tent under the tongue;
and bandage the patient every night, so that the area cannot close.
And if bleeding occurs, then place powdered vitriol on the area; and if the blood resists, cauterize it with the lentiginous cautery, which is good for this; then treat it with other remedies until it is healed,
and if you see it with a false color, or black or hard, so that the patient does not feel it, then do not touch it, for it is a chancre;
and if it is leaning toward a blister, and there is moisture, then one should insert a lancet, and cut it with a fine scalpel, and deliver it from one side and the other; and if the blood resists your work, then apply powdered vitriol until it is stanched, then return to your work until you draw all the blood out;
then clean the area with oil and vinegar, and treat it with other remedies until it is healed.
of abscesses of the throat Sometimes boils appear in the throat, called "godath", and they are properly called the two tonsils. And when you treat them, as we have said in the division, and they are not healed, then be careful:
if they are hard abscesses of small size and a dusky color, do not touch them with iron.
And if they are red and the root is large, do not touch them with iron, also to prevent the flow of blood; but leave them until they are ripe, and then you will lance them, or they will burst on their own;
and if it is whitish and the root is thin, prepare the instrument to cut, but first observe if the abscess is warm and calmed.
Then make the patient sit facing the sun, and his head is on your lap, and he opens his mouth, and the surgeon takes the tongue between his hands, and presses the tongue down over the entire instrument, of which here is the form;
and let it be of silver or fine copper, like a knife:
When you press the tongue down over this instrument, and you see the abscess, then take the lancet and place it in the opening, and pull it firmly upwards as far as you can;
and pull out any matter with it, then cut it with the instrument, of which here is the form, that resembles a wedge; and however the head is bent, and one edge on the other, and are very sharp, and it is made of hard steel or iron:
And if you do not have this instrument present, then cut it with pliers, of which here is the form: And be sharp on one side, and blunt on the other;
and when you have cut one of the almonds, then cut the other in the same manner, and after the incision the patient gargles with hot, sharp, and easy water, and if a discharge of blood occurs, the patient gargles with water, or with the peelings of roasted pomegranates, or with myrtle leaves, and similar things, until the blood is stopped; then treat it until it is healed;
and sometimes other abscesses appear in the throat besides the two almonds, then cut them likewise as the two almonds.
And I treated a woman with an abscess that had formed inside her throat, namely a small abscess;
and it had almost completely closed the throat, so that the woman could not breathe through the blocked passage, and could neither eat nor drink, and would have died if she had remained like that for one or two days.
And the abscesses had grown so large that it had forced two nostrils through the two nasal openings.
I hastened then immediately, and inserted a lancet into one, then pulled it out, and extracted a large portion of pus;
then I did the same in the other nostril, and opened her mouth and pressed on her tongue;
afterwards I inserted the lancet into these abscesses, and cut away a part, and only a little blood came out; and thus the passage of the woman's throat was cleared, and she now began to drink water and then wine, and I did not cease to cut away at this abscess for a long time;
and the abscess grew again, and filled the space I had emptied, until it became very large;
then I incised it and cauterized it within the throat: thus it remained without growing;
and I departed from these matters, and do not know what God did to it after me.
of the eye
When mucus descends to the eye, and it is swollen and long, it is called "perpendicular";
and if it is below large and round, it is called "eye".
When it is treated as we have said in the division, and the treatment is of no benefit, and you see that the swollen abscess is calmed, and it is subtle, then you must cut it.
and the one that is round and assembled and is not long; and if it is bloody or of a dusky color or black, then you should avoid cutting it. For there is great danger to the patient.
Therefore, when you see it, according to the method I have described, based on its whiteness and length, you must have the patient sit in front of the sun, and press their tongue with the instrument of which we have made mention previously; then insert the hook into the uvula, and pull it downwards, and cut it with one of the two instruments I mentioned in the incision of the two almonds.
And you must not cut more than the superfluity beyond the natural limit;
for if you cut more, you harm the voice, and the speech;
and after the incision, use what we have said concerning the incision of the two almonds, and treat it until it is healed.
And if the patient is afraid of the cutting, you must use a device for the cauterization of the sense of fear.
And the manner of the cautery is sharp and sharp. And the patient should place their head on your breast, and then press the tongue to the instrument that we have discussed in the chapter on cautery, and cauterize with sharp hot irons, such that it is neither too thick nor too thin; and fill the end of this instrument, of which this is the shape:
And have on the head a hair or a place where medicine is put, like the end of a spoon, and place the instrument with all the medicine upon the wound;
and let the patient lie on their side, so that the saliva and mucus run from their mouth into the medicine inside, so that it does not descend into the throat, and thus wound it;
then hold your hand over all the medicine and press it upon the wound, for the amount of half an hour, until you see it subside and the biting of the medicine is appeased;
and if you wish, take cotton and wrap it around any instrument, and moisten the cotton in the medicine, and put the instrument with all the cotton into the wound, so that the cotton adheres to the wound;
and do this often, until the cauteries are perfect, then let it dry, and it will fall off after four or five days.
And if you need to reapply the cautery of the medicine, reapply it, and after the cautery, wipe around the wound with cotton dipped in butter, and clean what is around the medicine;
and be washed with cold water, and be treated with gargles until they are healed.
This treatment is safer than the incision, not the cautery;
If it is treated with fumigation according to this method, take calamus and hyssop and origanum and rue and chamomile and yarrow and similar herbs, and mix them all or some of them in a pot, and put a little water in it, and boil it;
and the pot should be well sealed with strong clay, and inside the pot let there be an instrument shaped according to this method: And let it be of silver or brass, and let one of the ends be placed in the patient's mouth so that the vapor rises to the ulcer through the pipe, until the ulcer is deadened;
After that, repeat often, until the ulcer dries, and be careful not to do this at the beginning of a hot abscess, because many things can happen; and do not apply this fire except at the decline of a hot abscess.
And if this instrument is not available, take a pipe and put the end of a cracked egg inside, so that the patient's mouth is not too hot; for the cracked egg does not allow the vapor to burn the mouth, and this is a good and safe treatment overall.
Many times a bone or fish spine, or something similar, gets lodged in the throat;
so you must pull out what you can see, and press the tongue to the sun with the entire instrument, so that you see the thing move;
and what you cannot see and is lodged in the throat, you must make the patient vomit before the food is digested in the stomach; perhaps the object will be expelled by vomiting;
or the patient swallows a piece of sponge, or a piece of navel, or a lettuce root, or a piece of dry bread; and ties a thread to the sponge, and then swallows it; and when it reaches the place, it will stick, and then you will pull it out;
and if it does not come out by what we have said, then take an instrument of lead according to this form:
And let the instrument be curved at the head so that it can more easily enter the throat, and have the head raised high; and watch that you do not touch the epiglottis, lest the whole thing come to it, nor push the bone inside;
and it is better that the patient push the instrument, so that it may know where the thing is stuck; if he pushes it down, or he pulls it out with the entire instrument equally, until it is out.
of the leech of the throat
Sometimes the leech is medicated, as I said in the division, by the cure of medicines; and when this does not help at all, then look into the throat of the sick person in the sun, then press the tongue with the instrument that I have told you.
And if you see the leech, pull it out with a very small hook, or with delicate pliers that are suitable for this.
And if this is not effective, take a thin, heated chain, and place it in the sick person's throat, then place a heated iron at the end of the chain, and do this frequently. And if the sick person is suffering from fever all day.
Then take a full glass of cold water, and open the mouth, and pour it in without swallowing, and move it with their hand frequently; and as soon as the leech feels the water, it falls off.
And if it does not fall off as we have said, then fumigate the sick person with asafoetida, using the instrument that I mentioned in the fumigation of the eye;
do this many times, for it will fall off without delay.
And the manner of fumigation is that you take a pot in which there are burning coals, and let the bottom be covered with a pierced cover, and through that hole be the tip of the instrument;
then place your fumigation there, and let the sick person place the end of the tube in their mouth, and close their mouth, so that the smoke does not escape, but goes down to the leech;
and the leech will now fall off, and if it does not fall off, then restart the fumigation many times;
and let the sick person endure thirst, and eat salty and bitter things, and drink no water;
and then it will be necessary for it to come out forcefully by this treatment.
And the shape of the instrument with which one draws the leech, is, when one can see it, like bent tongs to make an entry into the throat; and it resembles the beak of a bird, and has a rough surface like a file, so that what it takes, it cannot let go;
Many types of abscesses exist, according to what memory brings here after this and that in this book, and they differ in perforation and incision;
and it is in two ways, one of which is in its own resemblance, and from what it holds of moisture.
And the second way is because of the places where they are in the body.
For abscesses of the head are different from those of the foundation, and abscesses of the fleshy area are different from those that arise in joints, and each has its own judgment in the work.
And there are abscesses that should not be pierced until the swelling is ripe according to its completion;
and there are some that should be pierced when they are swollen, and do not ripen according to their completion, like abscesses that are near joints.
For when an abscess comes near the joints, and one lets it rot around, the ligaments and nerves of the joint may be corrupted, which causes contraction in that limb.
Where the abscess is near the main limb, and if you delay the perforation until it is ripe, it will harm the main limb;
or if it is near the foundation, one pierces it sooner than it is ripe;
and you should not pierce a swollen abscess without complete digestion, except for the one near the foundation, lest it rot deeply, extend inward, and cause a fistula; and it cannot heal in a long time.
And you must know the time for perforating a ripe abscess according to completion, and that is when the pain is eased, and the fever subsides, and the lessening of pain and redness, and the lessening and sharpening of the abscess head, and the other signs;
and you should make the perforation sit over the most dependent part of the abscess, and where it appears moved;
and let the perforation be along the body's length, and if the abscess is on the hands or feet, or in joints and nerves and arteries, and in all places equally where there is no fold. In those that bend, according to that limb.
And when the abscess is in a fleshy place, it is better to leave the perforation until it is confirmed in complete digestion, as we have said.
For if you pierce it before that, the body of the venom will be extended from it, and it is full of much filth. and perhaps the lips and depth of it harden.
And if there is any abscess that is pierced according to the width of the body, according to what the limb needs.
And you must make small abscesses, small openings; and in large abscesses, large openings, and many fissures according to the appearance of the size of the abscess;
and if there are such abscesses where it is necessary to remove the core, and to cut; when it has become like a flag, and is dormant, then it is necessary to do as one does to boils:
and there are some that are split into three angles, and there are some that are cut like myrtle leaves, like abscesses of the groins;
and there are some where a round incision is made, and other incisions and similar cuts.
Those that have no head, like a superficial, soft abscess, it is necessary that you pierce it completely;
and when the abscess is large, and it has collected a large amount of pus, and you pierce it, you should not remove all the pus at once, but remove a portion. then bandage the abscess until the next day, then remove some more pus again. do this repeatedly, gradually, until all the pus comes out.
especially if the patient is of weak constitution, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an elderly, decrepit man. For the spirit sometimes jumps with the discharge of pus, so that the patient might die, and you do not realize it.
Therefore, avoid this chapter with great care, and when you have pierced your abscess, then wipe the wound, and see if the wound of the abscess is small. and if it is a gaping wound, apply linen or old cotton dressings. and if it is a large abscess, and there are many openings, then you must place a dressing in each one so that they meet each other.
and if you have cut a part of the skin in the abscess, and you have cleaned it around, then you must fill it with old cotton or linen rags without moisture, and bind it until the third day.
then remove it, and treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if blood flows during your work, apply cool and easy water, and soak a cloth, and apply it repeatedly to the flowing area.
And if the blood flow persists, apply remedies and treatment, and the powders I have mentioned in their proper places in this book. And if it is wintertime, and the area where the abscess is very sensitive, you must place dressings and cloths soaked in hot wine and oil.
And if it is summer, and the area is fleshy, you must place dressings soaked in water and oil, or in cold wine and oil, until the third day, as we have said.
and then drain the abscess, and dry it and treat it as necessary, until it is healed.
And this is what you must universally know in treating abscesses:
I have told you how one should proceed with the treatment of abscesses, and here is the chapter.
Where the head is affected, small abscesses arise, and there are kinds of them that are like webbed, like a hen's egg sack, and many resemble them.
There are some that are fatty and others where there is moisture, like pus;
and there are some that are hard and stony when cut, and there is no doubt if the artery is not opposed to it.
And the work of cutting is that you try with every instrument called "entromissoire," from which the form comes afterwards, what thing it contains.
For if it contains moisture, then cut it lengthwise.
And when the moisture is emptied, then scrape it without leaving the skin that contains that moisture, for it will return often when something is left there;
then dip cotton in Egyptian ointment, if it is present; if not, in vinegar and salt, and fill the wound with it, and leave it until the next day; and that which remained overnight will run.
And then repeat the cotton, as before, on the second day, and the third, until you know well that it does not remain overnight;
then treat the wound with ointment appropriate to it, until it is healed.
And if the abscess contains a lot of fat, cut it according to this shape, lengthwise; and insert your lancets, and scrape it from all sides, and place all your treatment to draw the matter from the place where it lies;
and if the artery opposes you, then do what I have told you after.
And also do this for a stony abscess, and its incision and treatment as I have said.
And the incision on a stony and moist abscess is easier, for they contain little blood. And if there are some of these abscesses, on the head where there is no moisture, and of these was the abscess which I cut on the head of an old woman;
and I found the abscess like a hard, rough, white stone, and could not break it; and if one had struck any of them, one would have caused a wound just as if from a stone.
In other abscesses occurring on the head, except those that occur on the heads of children and at the roots of the ears, the opening should always be in the lowest dependent place, in order to drain out the pus.
and treat them as necessary.
Many times these abscesses occur on the neck, and under the armpits, and in the groin, and sometimes come to other parts of the body, and are numerous, and are intertwined with one another.
And each scrofulous swelling is properly within its own covering, just like a boil or abscess on the head, as we have said; And the forms of these scrofulas are numerous.
And the forms of these scrofulas are numerous. There are some that contain moisture, and there are malignant ones that do not wish to obey health.
In that one, then, which you see of good disposition upon touching, and is similar to the color of the body, and soft on every side, and is not attached to the nerves of the neck nor to the artery nor to the duct, and is not deep;
Then it is necessary that you cut it above, and scrape it on each side, and spread the two lips of the wound with forceps if you need to, just as we have said for abscesses of the head;
and draw it little by little, and be sure that you do not cut the nerve or the vein, and that the spatula be not sharp or cutting so that the hand does not slip and go too far, so that you do not cut what you should not.
And if you cut the vein or artery, and this prevents you from working, then put powdered vitriol or some blood-stopping powder into the wound and bind up the wound; and leave it until the abscess is calmed, and the wound is softened, and begins to rot.
And when the blood is stopped, return to your work until you complete it;
then look with your index finger if there remain any small scabs, cut them and clean them.
And if there is a large vein at the base of the scab, you should not cut that scab at its base, but tie it with a strong double thread, and let it fall off by itself without harm;
then fill the wound with old cotton dipped in Egyptian ointment, then treat it.
And if you cut the entire scab, you must bring the two edges of the wound together and stitch them now, since there is no excess remaining due to the size of the scab. if it is necessary to cut the base of it, and pull it out, and stitch it as we have said.
if it is necessary to cut the base of it, and pull it out, and stitch it as we have said. Those scabs that hold excess, pierce there where it appears ripe;
and pierce it thus, as the one previously mentioned, by depending, then apply bandages with ointment and similar things, so that it destroys what remains of the corruption; and when the wound is well cleansed, treat it with ointment that encourages flesh growth, until it is healed.
The ancients said and spoke of the sore throat; but I never saw anyone in our land who did it, and that is the record of their words.
For those with quinsy, it is necessary that the opening of the throat, called the "epiglottis", be healed; and one should not provide help through that, because all the veins and the flesh of the sick person are affected by those who have a hot abscess in the mouth, or in the throat or in the tonsils.
When the disease is in the passage of the lung, it is necessary to cut the epiglottis to avoid the death that comes from strangulation.
It is necessary, then, when we wish to cut the epiglottis, that we cut it below three or four circles, a small slit across, between two circles or by the amount of the surface cut, and not into the cartilage.
And those places are suitable for the section of the epiglottis, because there is no flesh there, and the vessels are far apart.
And if the master is fearful, it is necessary that he extend the skin of the throat to the entire bone, then cut the bone until he reaches the channel. And dry the blood vessels, if you see anything, and then cut the surface, as we have said.
And it is shown by the section of the phlegm from the channel that leaps forth through the broken place, and by the loss of voice.
And leave the wound open for a while.
And when the time has passed that one doubts the strangulation, bring together the two edges of the wound of the heart, and stitch it completely without the cartilage.
Then administer medicines that cause flesh to grow, until it is healed.
Albucasim says that one should not do this until the throat is completely closed, and the patient is judged to be dying, and breathing ceases. Then one cuts the epiglottis so that the patient cannot breathe, and he breathes through the wound, and thus is saved from death.
and for this, the ancients commanded to leave the wound open until the malice of the illness has passed, and it passes in three or four days. And then they commanded to stitch the wound and cure it, until it was healed.
And I will tell you what I saw. I saw a lady take a knife and stick it in her throat, and cut part of the channels of the windpipe.
And I was called to cure her, and found her as if dead.
I uncovered the wound, and found the blood that had flowed from it, and I saw clearly that she had not cut any vein or artery except the throat, and the wind was coming out through the wound.
I hurried, and sewed the wound, and treated it until it was healed;
and the lady had no further affliction than that she was hoarse of voice, and returned to her condition afterwards;
Therefore, I say that there should be no fear in the cutting of the epiglottis.
This abscess is called "gullet hernia," and is a large abscess the colour of a yellowish hue, and is very common in women;
and is according to two manners: natural, and accidental;
where natural has no contrivance.
And the accidental is according to two manners, of which one is similar to fat in us, and the other manner is similar to an abscess that arises from an artery in us; and if there is fear, and it is not fitting to operate with strong force except on that which is small, and to prove and search throughout the whole space: if you find it like a fatty lump and it does not adhere to any vein, cut it, as one cuts lumps, and pull it out with all its covering if there is any. and thoroughly search everything, and treat it as is fitting, until it is completely healthy.
Many types of lumps there are, of which I shall describe all the appearances;
and it is necessary that I say all the difference that exists between a lump and a fistula.
I say that a fistula is hot and feverish, as long as the boil persists, and the putrefaction is complete; Then the fever and heat subside.
A lump has neither heat nor fever nor pain, and contains a cyst, which is its own sac and is according to the color of the body, and begins like a blister, and grows larger;
and they are according to two appearances, either greasy or moist, and many colors are as I have said in the division.
It is necessary, when you come to the treatment of the lump, that you first test and investigate it with all the instruments called "entromissoires," according to what their form will be in the following chapter.
And the manner of investigating the abscesses of lumps is that you take the most moist area you find in the abscess, and turn your fingers little by little, until you know that the instrument has pierced the core, since this should be according to the size of the abscess;
then withdraw the instrument, and be careful of what leaps out.
If the moisture runs quickly, whatever color it has, cut it as I have said of other abscesses;
and if after the instrument no moisture comes, know that it is greasy; then cut it in a cross, and take it with forceps, and slightly scrape it from each side, and watch the skin where it lies so that you pull it out healthy with the lump;
and if you cannot pull it out healthy, pull it out in pieces so that nothing remains.
For if anything remains, the lump returns many times;
and if a little remains, and the blood bothers you, fill the wound with some sharp corrosive powders, constrict the wound, and put on soothing, hot remedies for abscesses, and cure it with other remedies until it is healthy;
and if the lump is large, cut the two edges of the wound, and treat it with what generates flesh.
and if the throbbing vein is contrary or otherwise, hurry and fill the place with crushed vitriol, and leave it for two or three days, until the wound rots, and the boiling of blood settles down; then return to cauterize what remains of the wound.
See here the forms of the intrusive instruments, and they are of three kinds: large and medium and small;
and of them there are three squares called "albaret", and one called "breb", and of them there are three kinds: large, medium, and small, to search for abscesses of fistula;
and are also like the needles with which one sews sores, and are of yellow bronze, or of iron, or of silver, and those which are yellow are more valuable, and are more experienced from black lead for searching the recesses of fistula;
and are of three kinds: large, medium, and small, according to the quantity of the width of the openings.
The shapes of the probes are of many appearances, as you see here:
and there are probes which have two curves of three kinds as well;
and there are probes which have three curves, and are also of three kinds;
and there are probes which have two curves, and probes of only one curve, and are of three kinds;
and all of these are necessary in their place.
The head of those that are cut is sharp, and some of them only cut on one side, so that one scrapes the flesh, so that one does not cut the vein or the nerve;
and among these instruments are spatulas fitted into handles, so that the patient does not feel them during the opening of abscesses;
and are of three kinds: large, small, and medium, as you see;
and they are used only in fleshy places, such as legs, arms, breasts, and groins, and similar places;
and sometimes another small instrument is made, resembling the rind of a fig, according to this form, with which one stops the blood: and it is sometimes placed on the place that bleeds from cuts of veins, and arteries, and sometimes again according to this large form:
Sometimes the breasts of some men swell when they begin to rot, so much so that they appear like women's breasts;
and remain ugly and swollen, and whoever wants to cure them, it must be done according to this form from this line .b. up to .g.: then scrape off the fat, and fill the wound with a healing medicine, then bring together the two edges of the wound with stitches, and cure it until it is healed;
and if the breast droops downwards, and is softened by its size, as happens with women, then it should be cut into two sides above, by two similar cuts; so that one is attached to the other at the end of each, so that the larger line contains the smaller, according to this form, from this line .b. up to line .g.; then scrape the skin between the two edges, and remove the fat, and apply what we have said about stitching and powders, and whatever is necessary in the cure, until they are healed;
and if it is not healed, or the incision is not completely made, because the patient does not want to rest, or due to the flow of blood, then you should fill the wound with cotton soaked in corrosive ointment; and leave it until it consumes the remaining flesh and fat, then cure it until it is healed.
These abscesses that come from under the armpits are a kind of hard scrofulous swellings, or some contain moisture.
Those which contain moisture should then be cut according to this shape, from line .b. to line .g.: And when all the pus that is in the abscess is emptied, then fill the wound with old cotton, and leave it until the next day, then remove all the cotton, and cure with a suitable ointment until it is healed.
And if the abscess is like scrofulous swellings, cut it as we have said in the case of scrofulous swellings, and if the wound returns pus, then apply cautery as we have said before.
When the artery is ruptured, and the skin above is stitched, there often results abscesses, and similarly this happens to a swollen vein and abscess;
and if one recognizes it as being due to the artery, the abscess is long and deep; and when you feel it with your fingers, you feel a tightening;
and when it is due to the vein, the swelling is clearly visible;
and it is foolish to cut this abscess, especially when it is under the armpits, and in the groin and neck and many other places, and is very large. Therefore, one must avoid iron treatment, and one who is at the head must also avoid it, and in one who has an arterial swelling, one makes an incision through the skin along its length;
then open the incision with lancets, and carefully separate the artery from the tissues, until it is exposed;
then insert a needle underneath it, and pierce it to the other side, and tie the artery with a double thread in two places, according to what I have taught you in the extraction of the two arteries that are in the temples;
then prick the area between the two ligatures with a lancet until the blood that is there comes out, and the abscess is relieved;
then apply the cure that generates pus, until the ligature falls off; then treat it with the appropriate ointment, until it is healed;
and if the abscess is due to the incision of the vein, you should hold with your hand as much of the abscess as you can on the skin, then insert the needle under the area you hold, pierce it, and tie one double thread, so you pull it from the other side; then tie the abscess, as I have told you, or tie the thread at one of the two ends of the thread;
and if you doubt that the thread will not hold, reinsert another needle into the thread below the entire abscess at the incision of the first needle, and tighten the thread in four places;
then cut the abscess until the excess comes out, then cut the excess from the core and leave what is tied;
then place a damp cloth in wine and oil, then administer treatments of poultices and ointments until it is healed.
Just as abscesses come to the artery and the vein, abscesses come to the nerves when they are injured, or from too much work, and similar things.
And this happens more often to the shoulders and arms and in all places where there are joints, and it is a grievous abscess, and its color resembles the color of the body, and it is in various conditions without pain;
and when it is squeezed tightly, the patient feels pain, and it is not deep in the body, but under the skin;
and moves well in all directions, and does not go forward or backward, or below or above, and the one that is in joints should not be cut with an iron: perhaps there would be contraction; and the one that is on the head or forehead, cuts the skin at the spatumile.
and the one that is on the head or forehead, cuts the skin at the spatumile. If the abscess is small, then hold it with pincers, and cut it at its root;
and if it is large, then suspend it with a hook, and scrape it, then remove it and stitch the wound together, and treat it until it is healed.
Sometimes it occurs in the abdomen and nowhere else, a disease called "fungus" because of its resemblance to them, and its root is subtle, and the head large;
and there are small and very large ones;
and I saw a man who had two in his abdomen that resembled fungi more than anything else, and there was no difference, and they were white, and had fine roots, and were slightly split, and moisture often flowed from them.
I cut them open and found one weighing eighteen ounces, and the other six, and the method of incision is that you should observe if the patient is moist, and the color of the lump is white and moist, and has fine roots; if you cut it with a wide spatula, and the cautery iron is in your presence.
if you cut it with a wide spatula, and the cautery iron is in your presence. For when cutting, there is often too much bleeding, and if the blood overcomes you, then hurry to cauterize;
and if you see the patient frightened and afraid of the incision of the iron, then take a well-made lead thread, and bind the lump as we have said, and leave it for two days;
and then restrain it, and do not cease to tighten the lead thread until it cuts the lump, and it breaks apart by itself with no effort;
and if the roots are thick, there is fear of cutting even for the belly, but you can cut it in half, then cauterize it so that it does not return;
then treat the wound, and be careful not to cut the tissue that is of a fixed color and of poor feeling and milky appearance.
For it is an entrenched abscess, and I will come to the treatment of sores afterwards.
when the wound is open If the appearance of the wound comes from cautery of a wound or a cut to the skin, and is on the stomach, and some of the pus comes out, as happens in other breaks, or from blood flowing from veins or arteries according to what is before, or from windiness;
and if it is by a rupture of the skin and by the exit of the pus, the color of the abscess is similar to the color of the body, and is a slight thing without pain, and shows different exits. And if it is because of the exit of the intestine, then it is more diverse, and when one presses it with one's fingers it recoils, and then returns, and perhaps it is scarred, and greatly enlarges at the entrance of the bath and due to hard work.
And if it is because of moisture, it is a slight thing, and appears clearly when you press it with your hand, and does not constrain it.
And if it is because of blood, the abscess appears large and hard by these signs, and is fixed according to a certain quantity. And if it is because of wind, it is soft to the touch, and the work is that you look to see if the appearance is because of the blood from the artery, or from the vein, or wind.
And if it is because of wind, it is soft to the touch, and the work is that you look to see if the appearance is because of the blood from the artery, or from the vein, or wind. Then you must leave the treatment. For there is doubt and fear, as I have told you in the chapter on abscesses, concerning the artery and concerning the vein.
And if the appearance is due to the intestine or the bowel, you must instruct the patient to hold their breath, and lie straight, then apply leeches all around the area. then instruct them to lie often in your hands, then go around the area you have marked with the spatulim, and open the abscess halfway to the entire great incision. then bind it around with a strong thread, or a strong silk cord firmly, and let the wound be well bound.
then open the halfway abscess that is stretched over the bandage, and put your index finger in it, and seek the intestine. if you find it caught in the bandage, untie it, and put the intestine outside the belly.
and if you find the bowel, take it with the incision, and cut off the excess.
and if the artery or vein opposes you, go gently around, then return to your work and take two needles, and put two strong threads in them, and put the two needles around what you have made in a cross-like manner that you pierced.
then squeeze the abscess in four places over the needles, and if you wish, remove the needles, and leave the area until it rots, and the dead flesh will fall away by itself. or cut it when it is softened and rotten, then treat it as is necessary, and close the abscess as we have said.
or cut it when it is softened and rotten, then treat it as is necessary, and close the abscess as we have said. and remove the blood or moisture that you find, then treat the area as necessary, and close the area.
of chancre We have spoken in the division about the types of chancre, and how one should treat them with medicine, and how one should avoid iron treatment.
and we say that chancre develops in the armpit, and great caution is needed in its treatment, and the ancients said that when chancre is in a place where it can be scraped away, like chancre on the breasts and in the groin and similar places, it should be entirely removed when it is in the beginning stages.
No one has ever cured one before me.
And the treatment, when it is in a place where it can be removed, as we have said, is that you purge the patient of black bile sometimes;
then let the patient bleed if there is a clear excess, then make the patient lie in a good place to perform the treatment;
then remove the pus or ulcer, and the hair from all sides, and the bone from all sides without leaving anything;
and let the blood run freely, and wipe the area thoroughly with your hand or something else, and if the flow of blood makes the incision of the artery or vein difficult to control, cauterize it until the blood is stopped; then treat it with other remedies until it is healed.
of dropsy We have already discussed the types of dropsy, how water collects, the signs of each type, and the treatment using medicine and using iron:
and one should not use iron in these two types: that is to say, tympanites and yposarche, for it is a deadly thing;
Therefore, when you treat this type of dropsy called "eclites" with medicine, and the treatment does not work, see if the patient is weak, or if they have another illness besides dropsy, such as diarrhea and similar things; if you do not use iron, for there is danger;
and if you see the patient has strong constitution, and has only dropsy as an illness, and is not too young nor too old, then you should work thus: lift the patient upright on your hands, and the attendant presses the belly by pushing the water to the lowest part of the flank, then take the spatumile espinous according to this form: And be sharp on two sides. pointed, and yet not so sharp that it can reach the intestine when inserted, and cannot injure it;
then look if the dropsy is lodged near the intestines: if so, you must cut through the skin, three inches straight under the handle; and if the dropsy is due to liver disease, your cut should be to the left of the handle, three inches;
and if it is due to the spleen, it should be to the right, and the patient should not lie on the incision so that the superfluities do not flow to that weak spot;
then pierce all the skin with the instrument, and push it in, and lift your hand through all the space between the skin and the surface, as in skinning, to the extent of a fingernail or more;
then pierce the surface until the space reaches the empty area, and that is the location of the water, then extract it forcefully, and insert this instrument, of which this is the form: And it is similar to a fine silver chain, and is of brass or light bronze, and has one small hole on the underside; and on the other side, three holes; and two on another side, and one on another;
and the head is cut like a feather, and that is the form of the incision with which the scribe cuts the feather:
at the top there is a groove, so that when the instrument comes to the water, it descends immediately onto the instrument;
empty it then by half or a third, for if you empty it more than is fitting at that hour, perhaps the patient will die due to the resolution of their spirit from the weapon, or they fall faint, or approach death;
but empty it according to the quantity of its virtue, and according to what the dispositions of the patient's virtue signify, and their pulses;
then draw out the instrument and retain the water, and it is now retained due to the heart which seals the opening which is on the surface, of which I have spoken, that you pierce in this manner;
then recommence the instrument the next day, if you see the patient enduring this, and draw out a small quantity of water;
do this for a few days, and take care not to overdo it until there remains only a little water.
And if you doubt about the patient, and leave too much water, cure him with a hot grave or sand, and by much sweating or a bath and sun, and make him drink; and cure him with drying medicines until he is healthy, and cauterize on the stomach and on the liver and on the spleen after the extraction of the water, as I said before.
Sometimes children are born who have no opening in the penis, or the opening is small, or it is not in its proper place.
If it is necessary, immediately pierce it with a very thin, sharp needle according to this shape:
then place a thin lead plug in the opening, and tie it and keep it in place for three or four days.  And when he wants to urinate, remove the plug, let him urinate, and then replace it;
and perhaps it is not necessary, for the urine that comes flowing will not keep it closed.
Those whose opening is small are treated with the lead plug, as we have said, and it will enlarge.
Those who do not have the opening in its proper place are injured, for some are born with the opening at the head of the penis, so that they cannot urinate until they raise their penis. and cannot ejaculate because the matter cannot reach the bladder, and this is a serious illness.
And the method of treatment is that the patient often lies on their back, then extends the head of the penis and cuts it as if it were the tip of a feather, so that the opening falls in the middle, as it should.
and beware of bleeding that often occurs, and if it happens, stop it with something that stops blood, and treat the wound until it is healed.
of the sores on the penis Often these sores appear on the penis, and it is an unpleasant appearance of flesh.
and some are malignant and some are not.
if it is necessary, take them with a fine probe, and cut and clean all of them, then put moistened cotton on Egyptian ointment; then treat with Diafinicon ointment until healed.
And if the sore is malignant, with a foul color and odor, then you must apply cautery.
When you have cut it, and if the ulcer is at the base of the shaft, and a part is within the skin and a part outside, you must first remove the ulcer that is inside. and when it is closed, then treat the one outside.
For if you treat them together, the shaft of the penis is not guaranteed to not be pierced, and blackness and corruption come to the penis and scrotum;
Therefore, you must remove all that is black and corrupt, then apply a plaster of honey and flour made of pomegranate bark and flax, and then treat it with other remedies until it is healed.
And if a discharge of blood comes, apply the lunar cautery according to this form:
The cautery aids in two conditions together: that is to say, to the discharge of blood, and to corruption;
And if the head of the penis is corrupt and retracted, you must place a lead pipe in the conduit of the penis, and the patient must urinate through it;
And when the skin around the head of the penis is inflamed, as happens to those who have not been circumcised, or when it happens due to a wound or an abscess, then you must cauterize it with a sharp instrument, until the bonds are loosened, and the head of the penis is freed from all sides;
And if it is a serious matter to discuss this, you must cauterize a small spot on the head of the penis and the skin;
Then carefully separate them and place a thin, damp linen cloth soaked in cold water between them, so that it does not become inflamed again.
Circumcision is not merely the separation of a continuity like other wounds; However, when we perform this operation of our own accord, and especially on children, it is necessary that we perform the best and least painful operation for their health.
I say that the ancients did not prescribe circumcision for their children, for they did not use it in their law, and we only have what we have acquired through experience.
For I have seen the majority of masters and surgeons who performed circumcision using knives, and force, and a whole new type of instrument;
and the knife would slip, because there are two tissues, and perhaps one cuts through the one above while leaving the one below intact. Or it would need to be cut again, and the pain is doubled, and the cleansing that is on the foreskin does not ensure the tip of the member is intact;
and with the cleansing of the nail, perhaps the iron slips, and the work is ruined, and many times it heals without needing cleansing, and I have seen it.
From the cleansing that is done with force, throughout the whole thread, I have found the goodness of the experiment, for the force cuts equally well above as below.
For when you press your hand, it cuts equally in one single instant. but let the thread be tightly wound around the skin;
and the manner of the first work is such that you should make the child think, if it understands, that you are only tying the thread around the rod, and then you can make it happy in all the ways that you can;
then hold it straight between your hands, and position the forces between your hands or beneath your feet so that the child does not see them, nor any of the instruments;
then place your hand on the rod and blow into the heart, and pull it up until the head of the rod is inside; then clean it well of the filth that has gathered there, then tie the marked spot with a double thread, then tie it beneath one knot to another knot;
then clean it well of the filth that has gathered there, then tie the marked spot with a double thread, then tie it beneath one knot to another knot; and hold it with your two fingers by the second knot at the thumb and index finger, and cut between the two knots, then lift the heart quickly and pull the head of the rod; then let the blood run drop by drop, for that is the cure; and put powder on top of the powder, a layer of glue made from a beaten egg mixed with rose water, preserved with good, fresh rose oil, and leave it on until the next day, and cure it with other remedies until it is healed.
The form of the forces for the cleansing is this:
the two heads should be taut and sharp, and the heads should also be as large as the handle, likewise:
The error in the cleansing occurs when the heart is within the incision;
Then it is necessary that you extend it to your nail, lest the place form an abscess;
and cut it evenly, and if you cannot hold it to your nail, then hold it with pliers, and then cut it.
And if it passes three days, and that which is under the rod is swollen, let it be until the hot abscess is calmed, and lightly scrape it;
cut it as you can, and be careful of the part of the rod; this will not harm it at all.
Then treat the area with powdered healing substances, as we have said in the section on powders, and if one cuts too deep into the heart, and it rises, it will not harm it.
Then cure it, as we have said, until it is healed.
Concerning the retention of urine
The retention of urine is caused by stones, or congealed blood, or phlegm, or dead flesh, or similar things, as we have said in the division.
And if the urine is not released, and you see that the retention is due to a stone lodged in the bladder's neck or opening, the patient should be bent over their knees. And the feet should be placed on the back, and the patient should extend their abdomen from the area above the back, and the patient should restrain their breathing as much as possible. And then the bladder's opening is constricted, forcing the stone upward, so that the urine is released.
And if it does not come, as we have said, and the patient experiences great pain, then you must administer extraction with the instrument called a "syringe," of which this is the form:
And it should be made of fine, light silver, like the feather of a bird. And the tube should be a palm and a half long, and thin at the head.
And the method for releasing the urine is that you take a double thread, and tie a small piece of wool or cotton to the head, and insert the threaded head into the syringe;
and cut the excess wool, and insert it up to the head of the syringe; then anoint the syringe with oil or butter and egg white, and have the patient sit on a seat, and lubricate the bladder and penis with moist oil, olive oil, and warm water;
then gently insert the syringe into the penis, until it reaches the root of the penis, then double over the penis towards the groin;
then push the syringe forward until it reaches the bladder, and the patient feels it coming to the empty space, and this is not done according to this order frequently, because the channel through which it goes is twisted;
then pull the thread with the small piece of wool little by little, and the urine follows the wool, then pull it out, and cause the urine to flow;
and repeat the syringe until the bladder is emptied, and the patient is relieved.
When sores or blood comes into the bladder, or putrefaction is collected there, and you wish to apply remedies and liquids there, then do it with the whole instrument called "clepsydre," and this is the form:
It is closed, and has three openings: Two on one side, and one on the other, as you see;
and the channels through which the medicine flows should be such that they tightly seal the urethra without addition, so that moisture may be drawn out and applied when necessary;
And when you wish to pour your medicines into the bladder, place the tip of the instrument into the moisture, and draw out that which is inside;
You will draw out the moisture with the instrument, and then forcefully push the medicine back inside; Then the medicine will enter inside, and will go to the bladder at once, so that the patient will feel it;
And this is the form of the subtle clyster with which one clysters the bladder:
And it is of silver or of archaut, and the head is higher;
and underneath it is a seam or the linen falls;
Then take a sheep's bladder and put the moisture in it with which you wish to clyster the bladder, then tie it between the two breasts with a good double thread, and warm the moisture slightly over the fire;
Then insert the head of the clyster into the verge, then hold your hand over the bladder to completely fill it with the moisture, until the patient feels that the moisture has completely entered the bladder;
And if you don't have a bladder, then take a piece of parchment and make a circle, and pierce it round about; Then put a strong thread into these holes, then assemble the circle as one assembles a tile, and put inside it what you want of oil and moisture and water, and tie it into the instrument;
And do as you did with the bladder, pressing with your hand until the moisture enters the bladder.
of the stone
We have already mentioned in the division the types of stones, and the extraction along with medicines;
and have described the difference between stones formed in the kidneys, and all the signs, and in what type of stone one should work with a chisel; and in the bladder, and in the penis;
and I will tell you openly and briefly.
I say that stones formed in the bladder happen more often to children, and this is a sign that water leaks from the bladder, similar to water in its subtlety;
and it shows up as sand, and the patient scrapes their penis, and it hangs down many times, and then stiffens; and with much of this leakage, the foundation weakens;
and the healing is easy in children until they are four years old, and is very difficult in the elderly, and is medium in those who are between youth and old age;
and the cure is easier for those who have large stones than for those who have small ones.
And when we come to the treatment, it is first necessary to cleanse the patient with an enema, to remove all the filth that is in the intestines. For it sometimes hinders in finding the stone.
Then take the patient by the feet, and lift and move him downwards, so that the stone descends to the bottom of the bladder, and sometimes comes up from its high position;
then make him sit between your hands, and let his hands be under his thighs, so that the bladder is entirely inclined downwards;
then seek and touch it within;
if you feel the stone in the space, then hurry now to cut over the stone.
And if it does not fall out upon touching at all, then moisten your index finger with oil from your left hand, if the patient is a child, or your middle finger, if the patient is a fully grown young man; and put it into his fundament, and seek the stone, and when you feel it on your finger, then bring it to the neck of the bladder;
then press upon your finger, and push it out of the way where you wish to cut.
And command the assistant to press the bladder with his hand, and command him to extend his right hand to raise the nipples, and with his left hand remove the skin underneath the nipples in the part where the cut will be made;
then put the scalpel there, of which this is the form: And cut between that which is between the nipples and the fundament, not in the middle, but on the side of the left nipple;
and be straight over the stone, and your fingers be repeatedly on the fundament, and let the cut be through the stone so that it is wide at the top, and narrow inside, according to the size of the stone, not too large;
perhaps the pressure with the fingers on the fundament will make it jump out without difficulty;
and know that there are stones where there are angles and edges: if it is difficult to remove;
and there are some that are smooth, resembling a ball, and round, from which the removal is easy.
For those with angles and edges, make the cut larger;
and if it does not budge, you should use pliers which are like a file at the head, to squeeze the stone so it does not escape; or you place beneath it a thin, curved instrument at the head;
and if you cannot grasp it thus, enlarge the opening a bit, and if the blood flows, stop it with vitriol;
and if there is more than one stone, first place the largest in the bladder's neck, then cut above it, then pull it out forcefully, and the smaller ones afterwards if there are more.
And if it is very large, it must be softened, and a larger wound made. For two things happen to the patient: either he dies, or his urine comes out continuously because the wound cannot heal;
however, exert yourself to pull it out, or to break it with pliers, until you pull it out in pieces;
and when you have completed your work, apply incense, aloe, and dragon's blood to the wound, and bind it, and place over it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or in oil and rose water and cold water, to soothe the hot abscess; then support the patient on his/her back, and do not untie the bandage until the third day.
And when you untie it, carefully wash the area with oil and water, then treat it with diaphanic ointment and basil ointment until it is healed.
And if hot abscesses appear in the wound and sores, and blood clots in the bladder, and the urine is retained because of this, which is known in such a way as without relieving the urine: Then put your finger into the wound, and remove that blood, for if it remains, it will rot the bladder and corrupt it;
then wash the wound with water, vinegar, and salt, and aid him in every way you can until he is healed;
and it is necessary that every time you treat him, you bind his two thighs together, and gather the medicines over the area.
And if the stone is small, and it is in the channel of the penis, and stuck inside, and the urine cannot come out; if you treat this as I have said before, that you cut it many times, cutting is excused by this treatment. I have already proven it this way.
Take an iron rod according to this shape, and let it be with three angles fixed in a trident.
then take a thread and tie it around the penis below the stone, so that it cannot return to the bladder;
then insert the rod into the penis gently, until it reaches the stone; and turn the rod in your hand against the stone little by little, until you can pierce the stone from the other side;
then the urine will come out quickly, then press your hand on what remains of the stone that is inside the penis. Then it is quickly broken, and jumps out with the urine, and the patient is cured;
and if you cannot do this for any reason that prevents it, then tie a thread under the stone and another above, then cut the penis at the spot of the stone between the two threads, then pull it out, and loosen the thread, and clean the congealed blood that is in the wound; and treat it until it is healed.
of the stone of women
Sometimes a stone is lodged in women, and if it happens, the cure is difficult, and is forbidden for three things:
One is that perhaps the woman is a virgin;
and the second is that one cannot find a knowledgeable woman who will undress herself before the doctors, especially when she is chaste.
And the third way is that perhaps one cannot find a skillful woman in this art of hands;
And the fourth way is that the woman's stone is deeper than the man's, so a deeper incision is needed, and there is great fear.  And if necessity calls for this, you must take a skilled woman, and it's hard to find one, and if you don't find one, seek a subtle, skilled woman;
and he presents a wise woman, experienced in the lives of women, or a woman knowledgeable in part of the art, and instructs her to do what you command of the stone's examination; and carefully observe if the woman is a virgin:
and carefully observe if the woman is a virgin: then she must push her finger into the fundament and seek the stone;
and if she finds it, she must hold it under her finger, and he instructs her to push her finger into where the ailment is, and seek it and press her left hand firmly against the bladder.
If she finds it, she must move it gradually from the entrance of the bladder down, until it reaches the root of the thigh;
then cut over the stone at the root of the thigh, opposite the middle of the vulva, where the stone appears positioned, and feel the stone in that part; and do not move her finger over or under the stone, and let the incision be small at first;
and do not move her finger over or under the stone, and let the incision be small at first; then put the rod into the incision, if you feel the stone, then enlarge the wound until the stone can exit forcibly, and know that there are many kinds of stones:
that is to say, small and large, rough and smooth, long and round, and those that have ribs.
so know the appearances in order to know the outcome.
And if the blood flows profusely, put powdered vitriol in the place, and hold it for an hour until the blood is stopped;
then return to your work, until the stone is out, and have the tools that I have told you about for the extraction of stones, to help you in your work;
and if the blood flows profusely, and it is an artery that is cut, put the powder on the place and bind it with bandages and do not restart this procedure, and leave the stone and do not remove it, lest the patient die; then treat the wound.
And when the heat of the blood is calmed, and the area is healed, then return to your work, until the stone is out.
Watery hernia is nothing other than a collection of moisture or white pus, located beneath the bottom of the testicles, that contains an egg;
and is called "pus", and sometimes is properly in the sac of the egg, so one might think it to be another egg; and it is the skin of the testicle between the white pus that we have mentioned;
and this does not happen often. And the generation of this hernia is from weakness that comes to the testicles, and that matter is spread out.
And sometimes it comes from a blow to the testicles, and this moisture has many colors: where it is a color declining to jaundice, or it is without redness, or black, or watery white, and this happens more often.
and these are the signs to recognize this gathering, for if it is as white as we have said, it is a boil, a little long, like the shape of an egg, and the testicles do not appear, for it has moisture all around them.
And if it has moisture in the own cloth, it is a boil, the same size as part of the egg, and because of that, one thinks that it is another egg.
And if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white surface, one feels it well.
Then, when you wish to know the color of the moisture, you test it throughout the innermost part, the form of which is before you. Based on what comes after the innermost part, judge what is inside.
And when we treat it with iron, the patient should be bled to their power and the fullness of their body.
then place him on his back, on a slightly raised surface, and put many cloths underneath him;
then sit to his left, and instruct the attendant to sit to his right, and extend the rod to one of the two ribs near the heart between the testicles;
then take the scalpel, and cut the skin of the testicles lengthwise down the middle, to the edge of the incision, and make your cut completely straight, dividing the skin of the testicles until you reach white skin, and peel it gently to your power;
then pierce the white skin with a large hole, and draw out all the water, and then put your forceps, and stretch the white skin upwards;
and do not touch the heart of the testicles, but only the white skin; cut all or in pieces, even the side of it gently, for if you do not cut it wisely, the water will return;
and if the testicle jumps out during your work, then return it to its place when you have completed the work on the white skin;
then join the two sides of the heart of the testicles with a suture, then treat it like other wounds, until it is healed.
And if you find the testicle corrupted by another illness, you must tie the vessels that are the suspensory ligament, fearing the flow of blood;
then cut the testicle completely off the suspensory ligament, and remove the testicle, and treat it as we have said.
And if a wound is joined into two parts together, know that these are two branches; then cut the other part in the same way as you did the first, then wipe away the blood, and put moist wool soaked in rose oil into the wound;
then cut the other part in the same way as you did the first, then wipe away the blood, and put moist wool soaked in rose oil into the wound; and put more wool soaked in wine and oil over the two branches, and put cloths doubled over that, and bind it tightly according to this form:
Then take two cloths, and fill them with linen strips according to this likeness, and let them be joined by stitching in the groin of the breeches, and one end should go from the base of the back, and the other to the part of the groin;
and the other two ends on the two shoulders, and let the whole fastening be gathered in the buckle of the breeches;
and sometimes this wound is treated with cautery instead of cutting with iron, and you take a thin cautery knife and cut the skin over the branches, and it should be heated as we said, so that the white surface that contains the water is uncovered;
then take the cautery according to this form, and pierce that surface with the points, and scorch it with this hot thin cautery:
And cut it in all the ways you can, until you have removed it all;
and be careful that the fire does not touch the egg;
and know that this work is more safe; and take care regarding the flow of blood, and that the work of cutting is better;
and if anything opposes you, whether an abscess, or a flow of blood, or anything else, then treat whatever opposes you, according to what has been said before.
And if the patient is fearful and does not want to undergo this procedure because of its horror, then administer a perforation, as I have told you, and when you are certain, through the signs we have described, that the watery humor is there, then make the patient sit on a raised seat; then pierce the abscess in the part beneath, with a wide spear, and place the perforation lengthwise on the body;
and make the opening wide, so that all the water runs out freely;
then place cotton over the area and bind it, and allow the remaining water to drain, then treat it until the wound is healed;
and if the white cloth does not allow the water to exit the wound, then you must insert a pen or the instrument used to extract water from hydrotics, whose form is shown previously;
and enlarge the opening of the wound, and know that the water returns, and is collected after six months or around that time, and when it is collected as before, and thus the patient will pass his days.
Know that in the treatment of this ailment, there is fear in many conditions, therefore it seems better to leave it be.
and I will tell you the treatment and the signs of the abscess.
I say then that many abscesses arise on the body, and especially on the testicles; and this is in many cases.
This is to say, by excessive sharpness and heat, which is spread to the testicles, or by impact;
and the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body; and it finds no pain, and is a grievous abscess;
and perhaps it is a grievous, fearful, and painful abscess, of a dark color, and sometimes comes from a rupture of an artery, or from a swelling of a vein.
When it is by rupture of an artery, it is recognized by the hot disposition of the abscess when you press it with your fingers; and you should not touch it at all.
That which is made from swelling of a vein is recognized by its yielding to the touch of the fingers, and one can well make an incision on this appearance, and on other tissues. And it is that you cut the skin around the testicles, then raise the scrotum upward, and pull the white sac outward, and release the suspensory ligament from all sides of the testicle.
If the testicle is already swollen with these born tissues, then it is necessary that you pull the testicle and cut it.
And if there is air on the surface, or within the vessels, then you must release all the tissue and cut it neatly.
And if the origin of the tissue is in the rear, then it is necessary that you cut it all away and extract the testicle, as we have said.
And when your work is completed, fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine, then treat it with further remedies until it is healed.
This is an abscess encased in a swelling similar to a boil, accompanied by softening of the testicles, and the patient suffers greatly when he walks.
And the treatment for this illness is as difficult and dangerous as the previous one, and nevertheless we will tell you the method, according to what the ancients did.
You should make the patient sit on a raised seat, then place the suspensory for the testicles down by your fingers, encompassing all the vessels near the penis, and the masters should grasp them tightly and extend them firmly.
Then, with a sharp, wide spatula, cut across the vessels, until they are uncovered, and then cauterize on each side, as we described in the extraction of arteries located in the temples.
Then insert a needle with a double thread, and tie it to the first place where the vein appeared, and tie it again to the other end. Then cut them in the middle straight, along the length of the body, and remove the corrupted moisture.
Then treat the wound as other wounds where pus is generated, so that no vessels remain that nourish either testicle.
For by this, no harm comes, and if blood comes from all the vessels, then the testicles must be removed from all the vessels. So that the testicle does not lose its nourishment due to the incision of the vessels, and dries up and cannot be helped.
The occurrence of this injury is through the incision in the surface, or the extension to the abdomen in the groin area, causing the intestines to descend from that rupture to one of the testicles.
And this rupture is of the surface, or of its extension, and these two types arise from many causes:
or from a blow, or a jump, or a fall, or the lifting of heavy burdens, and similar things;
And the signs when it is from the extension of the surface are that it happens little by little, over a long time, and does not come suddenly; and the abscesses are equal all the way down, because the surface presses on the intestines.
And the sign when it is of a section of the surface is that it causes sudden pain at the beginning, and the abscess appears differently, under the skin, close by, and this is due to the escape of the intestine and the body pushing against the surface.
And sometimes the entrails descend with the intestine, and are trapped inside, causing the patient great suffering, especially when pressed.
And in these iron treatments, there is fear, for which one should avoid them.
And the method of the treatment is that you instruct the patient to return the intestine to its place inside the wound with his hand, if he can. then hold it (the intestine) on his neck, between your hands, and lift the thighs;
then stretch the heart upward, and cut all the skin from the groin lengthwise; then insert the dividers of the waist, curved according to your needs to open the wound, and be such that the pus may come out;
then scrape the surface beneath the skin of the groin, until the hard white surface is uncovered on all sides;
then put your index finger into what surrounds the groin, into what is between the white surface beneath the skin of the testicle, and the second surface, and separate what is behind the testicle and between the second surface;
and then move your right hand inside the heart of the groin, and stretch the white surface upward with your left hand, and lift the testicle with all its surface towards the waist; and instruct the attendant to stretch the testicle upward, and loosen what is above and behind the ligament;
and search with your fingers if any of the intestines are wrapped around the hard white surface, and if you find anything, place it in the belly underneath;
then take a needle with a thick thread made of many threads, and place it in the back part of the surface, which is behind the skin of the testicles; after the waist, then cut the ends that appear from the threads, until there are four threads; then assemble them one upon the other in the manner of a cross, and tie the surface, which we have said is beneath the skin of the testicles, with a strong bandage in two parts; then wrap the ends of the threads, and tie them firmly in two parts, so that none of the vessels that nourish them can enter within, so that a festering abscess does not arise; and put again the bandage according to the first bandage, the length of two fingers from that, and after these two bandages leave a space of the surface that is beneath the skin of the testicles the size of a finger; and after all the other according to the roundness that the egg bears;
then cut in the part that is beneath the skin of the testicles, as long as the blood flows, and the swelling recedes, as we have said before;
then administer wool soaked in oil, and put it on the wounds, and administer the bandage that we have spoken of. And sometimes the white surface that we have spoken of is cauterized after the incision, due to fear of blood running. For this happens many times, and leave the bandage until it falls off by itself;
and if it is slow to fall off, it should be warmed with hot water, and put on what we have said, until it falls off;
then treat the wound with another treatment, until it is completely healed.
of fleshy hernia
In this case, I have never seen anyone who dared to perform the treatment with iron.
And the ancients said that it is done like the branch that is attached to the viscera, in such a way that you tie the vessels, after the incision above or slightly below;
then cut it in half, and treat the abscess of that which opens, until the vessel discharges;
and treat it as we have said, until it is healed.
Sometimes a rupture occurs in the ribs, as we have said, and the place opens;
and none of the intestines descend into the groin, and if any descend, it is little, and repairs itself at any hour;
and nevertheless, if it stays too long in this place, the wound or opening grows, until the intestine descends;
and this happens through the extension of the opening in the ribs, as we have said, for it is stretched, then softened and swollen, the place and opens;
and the cure is by cautery, as we have previously said;
and sometimes it is cured by iron in this manner: and it is that the sick person lies often on their back between your hands, then cut the place of the ruptured skin with a wide cut according to the quantity of three fingers;
and then extract the skin that is under the hardened skin, then take the raw skin and put it over the exposed area of the skin;
and press it to the bottom of the belly, then stitch the two exposed areas of skin over the top of the raw skin, and stitch both together;
then remove the top of the raw skin, and do not cut the skin nor stretch the skin nor anything else, as I have taught you in the treatment of the rupture of the intestines; then treat it with the treatment for wounds.
then treat it with the treatment for wounds. And when you cut the threads, then dress and treat the wound until it is healed.
The skin is constricted, and there is no appearance of rupture, and the cautery is milder in this place, and closer to healing.
of the softening of the skin of the testicles
Many times the skin of the testicles is softened in some men, because the flesh within is softened, and it is evident.
and it is necessary, when one wishes to cure it, that one have the sick person lie on their back, and cut the softened skin over the natural skin;
then join the two flaps with a stitch, and if you wish, first stitch the excess of softened skin with three or four firm stitches;
then cut between the stitches, and cure it like other wounds, until it is healed, and the thread falls out.
of chastity
Know that chastity is discussed in our law, and therefore I would prefer not to speak of it in this book;
and it is necessary only for two reasons:
one of which is that the skilled person should know how to respond when asked, and know the cure;
and the other, because we often need the chastity of some animals to help us, such as goats and sheep and cats and other animals.
I say then that chastity is done in two ways: or by pulling, or by cutting.
In the one that we do by pulling, we make the animal sit in hot water, until the penis is softened and hanging; then take them in your hand, until they are returned and you no longer feel them.
Of the castration of the tail: you must tie the animal, and press the skin of the testicles with your left hand, then tie the suspender, and cut each testicle in one cut, when you have well scorched them;
and leave no bit of the surface and the subtle surface that is above the vessels;
and this manner of castration is milder than that which is done by traction, because in traction perhaps some part of the testicles remains, thus the animal desires lust;
then treat the wound until it is healed.
of hermaphrodites
Hermaphroditism is according to two manners in men: one is that between the two testicles there appears a figure similar to a woman's nature, or there is hair, and sometimes urine flows there.
And the other manner is in women, and has a penis like a rod and two testicles.
And the cure for the man and woman is that you cut away all the added flesh, and treat it like other wounds;
in the second manner, of men whose urine leaks through the skin of the testicles, there is no cure.
Tentigene is an added flesh on the natural part, as long as it is unsightly to see; and some women have it as large as a hand, and that is the cure.
You should cut away the excess tentigene with your hand or shears, and cut it gently;
and do not go too deep, lest a flow of blood result, then treat it with further treatments until it is healed;
and to another flesh that grows at the mouth of the wound, and fills it, and perhaps bursts, and is similar to a cow's udder, and therefore the ancients called it "cow-disease". If necessary, you should cut it, as we have said of the tentigene, and treat it until it is healed.
Erratic it is when the nature of the woman is not pierced, or the opening is small; and is natural by birth, or accidental through illness that has come to it;
and is natural by birth, or accidental through illness that has come to it; or it is by added flesh, or from a thin or thick membrane, and is made deep in the breast, or in the ribs, or below, or wherever it may be;
and prevents conceiving, and childbirth, and perhaps the ability to have flowers;
and the knowledge of this is by the examination of the belly.
If the numbness is nearby, apparent, so seek with your fingers or by the skin.
If it is from a thin membrane, and it is close to the two lips, hasten, and do it thus:
place your two index fingers together, and let the woman be on her back, her legs spread apart;
then stretch the two lips widely, until the thin membrane is round, and the numbness is relieved;
then take wool, and soak it in oil, and place it on the area, and let the woman lie on her side every day, so that it cannot fester.
And if the membrane is hard and thick, you must cut it with a scalpel, resembling myrtle leaves.
If the numbness is in the flesh, then hang it on a hook and cut it.
and have medicines to staunch the blood, such as dragon's blood, frankincense, together with the white of an egg;
then administer a wide lead strip, so that the wound cannot fester;
and so be for a long time, and administer a tent of dry linen;
then be treated with other remedies until it is healed.
And when in the wound comes dead flesh, it must be cut away in this manner, if it is not festering abscesses. For a festering abscess in the wound, one should not touch with fire.
of hemorrhoids Hemorrhoids are openings of veins from which blood flows habitually, and when the hemorrhoids are old they become painful.
And we have already spoken in the division about their likenesses, and their signs, and I will now speak of those that receive a cure.
I say that hemorrhoids and pain, when they are deep within the wound and do not appear on the surface, are not cured by iron.
Those that are at the opening of the wound, which can be felt, are those that can be cured.
Therefore, you must put the woman in a cold house, then grasp the pain with tongs and cut it at its roots, then sprinkle on medicines that restrain blood, such as oak gall, dragon's blood, and frankincense, and similar things;
then put her feet against a wall for an hour, then put her in cold water;
and if a discharge of blood comes, then make her sit in a decoction of sumac and pomegranate bark and gall and similar things, and then take barley flour and mix it with honey and oil, and make a poultice for her back.
And if it stops, that is good. If not, then apply leeches to her back and breasts without piercing;
then take wool and soak it in plantain juice or agrimony juice with old wine, and apply it to the area.
And when the abscess subsides, treat the area with ointment until it is healed;
and the one called "albathir" is red, and is like a rough lump, so it must be cut as I said for the thelul; and then treat it until it is healed.
Many types of abscess come to the marrow, such as chancre and stony abscess and herpes and boils and fistulas and hemorrhoids and hot abscess, and many other illnesses that I have mentioned in the division.
It is therefore necessary for me to describe in this treatise the hot abscess that comes to the marrow, which is not like the abscesses that collect pus;
and if you wish to know the work of iron, observe if the abscess is sharp at the beginning of its arrival, and full of heat and fever, and if it becomes red if you can see it. Then do not hurry to pierce, but allow it to mature until the pain is relieved;
and then make the sick person sit on a seat, and have two small seats where he can lean, and support his back and bring his feet to the parts behind the leg;
and let his thighs be spread, and put his arms beneath his knees, and tie them well with a good bandage;
then suck the wound towards the right side, and administer the instrument with which one opens the mouth of the abscess, from which the form will come after;
and it is necessary that when you wish to administer this instrument, that you first insert the rod to know the depth of the abscess, so that that which enters from the instrument does not go any deeper than it should, and that it does not injure the sick person; and if the instrument is larger, then it is necessary to cover the depth of the abscess with cloths, so that the instrument does not hurt it;
and it is necessary that he place the cone of the instrument above, and that he hold the instrument.
And when the abscess is open, and it is incised with a soft hand, then it should be cut at the top, along the leading edge;
And when the swelling is emptied, it is necessary that you place moistened cloths in rose oil, or in dry green oil, in the wound;
and place the cloth deep within the abscess, and place clean, wet wool over the abscess and the incision soaked in water or boiled mallows;
then treat it after two days of appropriate ointments, until it is healed;
and sometimes the abscess and wound are cleansed with a clyster of water and honey, and then with water or boiled roots of lilies and aristolochia; then return to the ointment.
And if the wound is reopened in the abscess, you must avoid using iron, but treat it as we have described in the division.
of childbirth The midwife must first know the nature of natural childbirth, and the signs are when you see the woman press downwards and desire to smell the air:
then the child hastens to be born; then know that this childbirth is according to nature, and the issue is beneath its head, and the afterbirth with it;
and when you see these signs, then you must gently press her abdomen so that the child is born quickly;
for when it descends upon its head, the afterbirth comes out with it, and the mother is cleansed of her superfluities by good cleansing;
and that which comes otherwise does not come naturally.
For it sometimes comes upon its feet, and the body or head, or hands, or it comes upon its belly, or often, and is perhaps turned upon its neck, and by other bad forms;
Thus, it is necessary for the midwife to be wise and subtle in these matters, and to beware of error and deceit, and I will show you all the forms how one should help her.
If the child comes upon its head by natural delivery, and the woman labors hard, and her strength is weak, then have her sit on a stool, or let women hold her.
And apply her nature of oil or fenugreek that is cooked, and then let the midwife place the small spatula between her fingers, of which the form is as follows: And cut the afterbirth, and cut it with her nail until the moisture that is within runs out;
and grasp the woman's belly until the child descends; and if it does not descend, then it is necessary to administer a clyster to the woman of fenugreek mucilage with sesame oil;
then make her drink and sneeze with something, and hold her mouth and nose for an hour: Then the child will now emerge.
And if the two hands emerge out of place, then it is necessary that you relocate them gently little by little; and if they cannot return to their place, then place the woman on a seat, and lift her feet upwards; then lower the seat to the ground, and hold the woman so that she does not fall during the lowering;
and if the hands cannot return to their place, and the child dies, then cut the hands with the knife that is previously mentioned, and extract the child, and relocate it equally.
from the issue of the child on its feet When the child comes onto its feet, it should be pushed upwards; and then turn it slowly, until it is equal;
then take it by the feet and extend it slowly.
If it jumps as far as the thighs, then instruct it to take a breath, and make it sneeze with force; if it jumps further, if God wills.
And if it does not jump as far as we have said, then turn it slowly until it is in its natural form. For then it is easily done.
And if it does not jump as far as we have said, then take a piece of alum, and oil of sesame, and melted gum, and grind all together in a mortar; and apply this ointment to the woman's nature inside and outside, then make her sit in warm water up to under her ribs;
and when she is softened underneath, make her a compress of myrrh and place it underneath, and leave it for an hour; then make her sit on a seat, then make her sneeze and hold her mouth and nose, and gently press on her stomach, because the child will jump now.
of the child's exit onto her knees When the child comes in this form, the midwife should place her hands gently; then she should be supported on her back, with her feet hanging down, and lying on the bed; and gently fold her hands, and then grasp her hands on her stomach, and remove the pillows underneath her, until she is positioned downwards; and if the child does not emerge, take her feet and move them forcefully, then move her stomach upwards, then push with your hands; and draw out the child gently; and instruct the woman to hold herself steady until the child emerges.
from the birth of the child which comes out from the wide side, one hand hanging it is necessary to engineer a way to return the hand: if one cannot return it, have the woman rise and walk;
if she cannot walk, have her lie down on the bed, and straighten her legs firmly;
then administer the poultice that I have described;
and if she does not give birth, have her sit on the seat, then try to return the hand; and examine the child according to its natural form, and have her sneeze, and instruct her to hold on until the child is expelled.
of the child's issue from its mother's neck, and have her hands spread out, and her face turned towards her mother's back it is necessary that the attendant hold the hand, then turn it little by little, and examine it gently;
and when it is even, place on it the natural mucus and oil, as we have said, then instruct her to move little by little;
and when you have done this, have her sit on the seat, and instruct her to hold on; and make her sneeze. in the same manner for the entire afterbirth.
in the same manner for the entire afterbirth. When it comes forth in this manner throughout the afterbirth, cut the afterbirth with your fingernail, until the moisture is emptied;
and if the infant hangs by its face and neck, cut it from the bottom so it is not retained, and the infant dies;
then put the child inside, until you have positioned it properly, and instruct the woman to take precautions:
of the delivery of twins Know that twins are born many times, and sometimes three or four are born; and this is not a strange thing, and it happens little. Two are a strange thing, and they do not live, if few are named;
Two are a strange thing, and they do not live, if few are named; I know that they are multiplied, and they are separated by the surface that divides them, which is attached to the womb;
and sometimes they emerge as naturally as one whole thing, as we have said.
And if they emerge forcefully, then the cure is as we have said, and let the bandage be subtle, and let it quickly and easily do what it does; and do it in a way that benefits the health. of many children
Sometimes they are formed in the shape of I or II or III or IV or V or VI or VII, or many up to XV, and are completely formed in the form of a child according to the measuring of the wise and glorious, and the bandage must know all this, for perhaps similar things happen; so do as is appropriate.
of the dead child
When you treat the woman of the dead child or belly, as I have said in the division, and it does not come out, and you are constrained by manual work; if it is necessary for you to know if the woman is of sound virtue and has no accident or fear of death;
if it is necessary that the woman be placed on her back, and her head inclined downwards, and her legs raised;
and the minister should hold her in two places, or she should be bound to the bed so that she is not pulled down by the child;
then rub the mouth of the woman with moist oils mixed with the juices of mallow and fenugreek and flaxseed, then anoint the woman's hands with these oils and these juices;
then place them gently in the woman's mouth, then find a place where she can apply the instruments that are suitable for this, and watch if the child is ready to descend on its own;
if you insert the instruments into its eyes, or its neck, or its mouth, or its palate, or under the chin, or into the throat, or near the sides, and if the descent is on the feet, if you insert them into the heels or the middle ribs;
and it is necessary that he hold the instrument in his right hand, and place the curve between his fingers of his left hand, and gently place the whole hand on it, and insert the instrument into any of these places we have mentioned, until it reaches the empty space;
then insert another instrument, or a third if you need it, so that the extractions are equal;
and then stretch it equally by moving it from one side to the other, to remove it, and let the instruments have teeth to hold it, as is the shape here:
And if a part remains, then anoint the fingers of some of his fingers with oil, and place them on that part, and pull the other part;
and if any part remains, place the instrument in a higher position, and continue thus until it is completely removed.
And if one hand comes in front of the other, and it cannot be pulled back due to the constriction, then you must wrap it in a cloth, until it is all out; then cut into the joint of the sole or with a knife, and likewise you must do in the other hand, and for the two feet.
And if the child's head is large and the passage is narrow, or if there is an accumulation of sharp fluid, then you must place a pointed spatula between your fingers, and pierce the head and draw out the fluid; or you can use the instrument called "almidach," with which the shape comes along with the instruments or chapter which is after this one;
and likewise do so if the child has a large head naturally;
and then pull out the bones with pliers, and if the head swells and is held by force, it should be opened until the moisture that is within it escapes;
and if it cannot escape, then cut it into pieces as much as you can;
and if it is swollen in the belly or under the ribs, it is necessary that you pierce it until the moisture runs out.
And if the child is on its feet, the traction is light, and the straightening to the mouth of the wound is light.
And if it is tight in the belly or breast, it is necessary that you pull it out with a cloth wrapped around your hand; and cut the belly or breast until the moisture that is in it runs out;
and if the other members are removed, and the head remains, the healer puts his hand deep into the wound, and pulls it down to the mouth of the wound; then he puts one or two hooks in it, and pulls forcefully;
and if the mouth of the wound is narrowed due to a hot abscess that has formed there, one should not work on it, but rather apply moist and greasy things; and apply poultices, and soak in soft and moist water.
And if the child is on its side, and you can put it straight, apply what we have said about a living child;
and if one cannot, pull it forcefully in pieces, and leave nothing of the afterbirth.
And when you have done this, apply what we have said concerning hot abscesses that arise in the wound;
and if a discharge of blood comes, it should be placed in constricting water, and apply other remedies.
And I saw a woman in whose womb a child had died, then another child was sewn onto that one, and the other died. After a long time, an abscess appeared in the groin, and it swelled until it opened, and began to discharge profusely.
I was called to treat it, and pondered it for a long time, and could not close the wound.
I applied a strong-drawing plaster, and one bone came out, and after a few days another one. I marvelled greatly, for there are no bones in the belly.
I thought it was the bones of a dead child.
I probed the wound, and extracted many bones, until the woman was in a better state; and the woman lived a long time like this, and sometimes a little pus would come from the place;
and I have recorded this chapter only so that, when the master finds a strange thing, he may know how to give assistance.
Here after comes the form of the press, with which one squeezed the books;
and with two turns at two points of the two cords. However, the horns should be finer than the restrictor, and should be made of ebony or boxwood;
and let the mouth of the tube be one finger's breadth wide, and the margin of the branches one finger's breadth, and in length one and a half palms; and between the two cords should be two fastenings of this same tube, which should be fastened at one and at the other, of half a palm in length or a little more;
and these two fastenings are placed in the mouth of the device for opening when the two horns are turned.
Another form, similar but finer and lighter, should be made of ebony or boxwood, similar to pliers; and have at the two ends two fastenings, as you see, of one palm in length, and two fingers in width;
and when you wish to open the device with the entire instrument, make the woman sit on a bed, feet dangling and legs open, then place the two joined fastenings into the device, and hold the head of the instrument underneath between her thighs; then operate your hand on the entire instrument, as you did with the pliers likewise, according to the amount you wish to open the mouth of the device, so that the patient does what she wants.
These instruments are all topped, and their forms are multiplied; and when the artisan has them prepared, the work is more hastened, and more high-ranking for their quantity.
Do not delay the instrument until you have prepared it, for their needs are not excusable.
When the secondine is retained during childbirth, you should instruct the woman to hold her breath, then make her sneeze with a medicine, and press your hands to her mouth and nose; and if she coughs through that, well and good.
If not, she takes a pot, makes a hole in the lid, and puts herbs in it that can open the mouth of the womb, such as calamint, rue, anise, chamomile, cassia, and centaury; all these herbs, or some of them, are to be boiled in water over the fire;
then place one end of the tube in the hole of the pot, and the other end in the mouth of the womb, and warm it until vapors come into the womb;
then make her sneeze, as we have said. Then the afterbirth will come out quickly.
And if it remains after this treatment, and does not come out easily, instruct the woman to moisten her left hand in oil of sesamum or in a concoction of elecampane, and then apply it to the area, and seek the afterbirth; and when she has found it, then she should gently and gradually pull it out straight, so that the womb does not tear during extraction;
but it must be moved gently to the right and left, and then pulled; then it will come out and separate.
And if the opening of the womb is tightly closed, we have mentioned the treatment of sneezing and the fumigation of herbs;
and if it is not healed by all that we have said, be careful not to rush in pulling it out;
but it is necessary that what is at the opening of the womb, you tie it to the woman's thigh, then administer a four-herb ointment clyster; if it will rot and return, and come back;
However, when it rots, a foul odor comes to the stomach and head, and harms the patient. Therefore, appropriate fumigations are necessary for this.
None of the ancients have proven fumigation with cress and dried figs.
The form of the instrument with which one fumigates a woman to retain the flowers and afterbirth is this:
And it is of similar appearance to a chain, and one puts the thin end into the nature, and the wide ends over the fire;
and let the fumigations be over the coals, and the ailment until it is destroyed, and begin another.
Many children are born who do not have the foundation pierced, but have it stopped by a small, subtle substance: Therefore, it is necessary for the midwife to pierce that substance with her finger, and not pierce it with a sharp instrument, and to be careful that she does not touch the bandage;
then put on wool soaked in wine and oil, and then apply the ointment treatment until it is healed.
And if you doubt that it will not close up again, put a lead chain in the opening and leave it in place for several days, and it should be removed when the child wants to go in rooms.
And sometimes this blockage comes from the closing of a wound or an abscess; If so, it is necessary to cut through that blockage. if it is treated, as we have said, with the lead chain.
Fistulas that come from under the fundament are swellings, and enlargements that come beside the fundament, or in the space between the two parts, if there is a fistula or several.
And when that swelling is old, it opens, and sometimes pus or a whitish or subtle discharge comes out, and sometimes these fistulas are penetrating.
And they are recognized by the fact that either excrement or gas comes out when the patient defecates, and perhaps some worms jump out.
And there are fistulas that penetrate to the bladder, and to the middle of the penis; And they reach to the joint of the thigh, and to the back of the heel.
And thus one recognizes a penetrating fistula in the fundament, and not a non-penetrating one: And it is that you place your index finger in the fundament, and insert a thin needle of bronze or iron into the fistula when there is no twisting.
And if there is twisting, insert a thin lead tent, or a horsehair, until you feel the tent or hair with your finger;
and if you do not feel it, and there comes no expulsion of wind or pus, as we have said: know that it does not penetrate; so hurry with the cure.
And when the fistula penetrates to the bladder or to the urinary conduit, urine escapes, and cannot be sealed by medicine.
If it is pierced to the hip joint, the poison reaches the place; if there is no twisting and the source of the pain is around it, it often bursts, and neither medicine nor ointment will help;
and in these penetrating fistulas, there is no cure but labor, and the foolishness of the meddling quacks.
In those that are not penetrating and not ancient, there is hope for health by iron, as I have experienced, and the patient lies on his back in your hands;
and he raises his legs up to his thighs, and has his thighs inclined to his stomach; then place a tin or lead tent, if there is twisting, until you know where the tent comes.
If the patient feels it around the foundation, then you must put your index finger there, if you then sense that the tent has pierced it;
and if you feel the surface or flesh between your finger, then you know that it is penetrating; if not, do not work on it until it can be healed.
However, it is said that some can be healed, but this rarely happens;
And the help that is given is that the fine cautery is heated according to the width of the fistula, as it has been said before; and place it, all hot, into the fistula, until it comes next to the base; and do this two or three times, until you know that these straying pieces of flesh, which resemble a bird's feather, have been burned;
and then treat it with tents soaked in butter, until that flesh comes off, then treat it with ointment that generates flesh and heals.
If it is thus healed, it is good.
If this, otherwise, cannot be healed;
and if the tent goes in, and does not pierce to the finger that is at the base, and between your finger and the tent there is a thick covering of flesh or skin, and you see the fistula at that which followed the covering of the heart; if you cut the beginning of the fistula, and push the tent forward, and then cauterize afterwards, until it reaches the head of the tent; and the tent will be delivered, and fall;
then cleanse those misplaced flesh that seem like a bird's feather, and nothing remains.
And if the blood overwhelms you, and flows between you and the work, cauterize it with fire or with sharp medicine.
For fire cauteries assemble two good things: that is to say, the burning of these added flesh, and the stopping of blood and the drying of the moisture;
then cure with tents moistened in butter or in crushed herbs, until the place gives off pus, and the burnt flesh falls away in the pus;
then cure the wound with ointments that bind together the hard flesh, and the medicines are dry.
For when it is restored, it is healed and will not return.
And if a fistula goes down to the bottom, and is separated from the body, then put your finger in the bottom and investigate it.
If you feel the tent, and between it is the cloth or the skin or flesh, or it is close to piercing, then there is no other way but hope and expectation, by the administration of one of the three methods:
or you cauterize it as we have said, or you cut it to the bottom, or if you can, then put tents in it and cure it as before;
and do not go too deep, lest you cut the tissue that holds the bottom, and the discharge comes out unwillingly; then cure it, as we have said;
then cure it, as we have said; perhaps it will be healed, or you separate that covering and cleanse it, since it has been cut away from the bottom, or by tent or other suitable instrument; then cleanse that exposed flesh which is in the wound, as much as you can; then endeavor to restore the wound, and to keep the fistula on the part outside the bottom:
then endeavor to restore the wound, and to keep the fistula on the part outside the bottom: it will be a lighter thing for the patient.
And sometimes fistulas are in this manner: and it is when you place the tent in the fistula, and it is in the side of the bottom next to the skin above, then take a pierced tent at the top according to this form: And he puts a twisted thread into two, and puts the tent with the entire thread into the fistula until it is at the top.
If it is piercing in the margin of the bottom inside, then pull the thread from that hole, just as you place your finger on the bottom;
and pull the head of the thread, and bring the two ends together, and bind one to the other, and leave it one or two days;
and restrain it sometimes, until the thread cuts the flesh between the two, and it falls away;
then treat the wound until it is healed and sound.
If the fistula does not pierce, then make it pierce in every way you can, if it is not too deep within. For it is not necessary to make it cut so deep with the ligature, and then cure it, as we have said, until it is healed.
The shape of the spine's spatula, with which one cuts the fistula, is very sharp on one side and cutting. and on the other side not, so that one does not cut that which one should not cut, as you see here:
Hemorrhoids are according to two manners: or they are inside the fundament, like a grain of resin, and there are small and large ones, and they often bleed, and there is one or more of them, and they are under the fundament and at the head of the fundament;
but those that are under (the fundament) have little moisture, and often bleed either a little of yellow liquid or a little blood, and have the color of the body;
and the cure for those who have them inside the fundament is that you instruct the patient to strain himself to go to the bathroom, so that the fundament pushes them out, and the thread appears; if you hurry, and you hold it with pincers, or you hold it with your nail, then cut it at its roots;
and if the needles cannot hold them due to their moisture, then take them with a cloth, or with cotton, or with a piece of chamelot; and pull them out with your fingers, then cut them, and powder them with some hot powders that are in place of cautery; or cauterize them as it is said in the chapter on cautery, then cure them with other cures until they are healed;
and if the fundament cannot come out, then enema the patient with a biting and harsh enema to wash out what is in the fundament, so that it can come out openly; If the patient endures, and if the threads are strong from the fundament, then the cure is easy;
If the patient endures, and if the threads are strong from the fundament, then the cure is easy; and it is that you take them with your nail or pliers, and cut them, then cure them as we have said, until they are healed, and that they fear the incision by iron. Thus it is necessary that you administer the suture according to this manner:
Thus it is necessary that you administer the suture according to this manner: Take a twisted thread, and put it in a needle, and then pull the thread over and pierce the needle on the other side, and turn the two ends of the thread under the needle, and let it be wide.
and tighten the thread tightly, then tie the thread, and remove the needle, and do thus with all the others, and leave one to run the excess of blood;
then place over the base one damp cloth in rose oil or in ointment, and place over the base, and instruct the patient that he rest;
and then leave it until they drop, and when they are dropped, then treat them with ointment and other treatment until they are healed.
of the dryness of the base Many times there is dryness of the bowels, and by constriction of nature, and when the illness is old and medicine is of no use. If it is necessary that you scrape with a spatula or your fingernail the scab on top, which does not allow it to moisten; then treat it until it is healed as is proper;
and if it cannot heal, then start scraping more strongly than before, until it bleeds a lot and is scabbed over; then treat it until it is healed.
there it trembles A formice is a small, deceptive appearance around the body, and goes very deep;
and sometimes it finds cold, and it is sensed also as if it trembles, and it comes over the whole body, and more to the hands than elsewhere.
And the treatment is to take a stick of a goose's feather, or a strong vulture's feather, and place that stick upon the trembling, so that the circle surrounds the trembling completely. Then turn your hand on the entire stick until you cut completely around the trembling, and drive it deep, and remove the trembling from its roots.
And if you wish, make one of brass or iron according to this shape, and let it be subtle underneath and pointed above: not pierced, so as to hold the finger, and press it.
And if you wish, cauterize the trembling, as it is described earlier in the chapter on cauterization.
Sometimes a clyster is made of silver or archaut, or of melted or hammered brass;
and sometimes these instruments are made small or large, according to those to whom they are administered. Those, then, that are administered in the treatment of children and those who are weak and sorrowful, are small.
Those, then, that are administered in the treatment of children and those who are weak and sorrowful, are small. The form of the small and large clyster is thus wider at the top, where the belly is tied in this manner:
and there should be a separation where the belly is tied, as you see, and the bottom should be pierced;
and have two holes on one side, and one on the other;
and the belly, where one places the medicines, should be made of an animal's bladder or parchment, and be pierced all around with small holes, and there should be one thread of space between each hole, then put a strong thread of thick thread twisted in an X or around it, and assemble the belly as is a goat; and when the medicine is inside, tie it to the instrument with a strong thread, then administer the clyster;
and this is the shape of the circle:
And let the medicine be neither too hot nor too cold, and anoint the head of the clyster with oil or egg white, or similar things, then insert it gently; then the minister squeezes it with both hands together until it is all empty, then remove the clyster, and the patient should raise their legs towards the wall, and if the medicine wants to come out, let it come out as much as possible; and if he sleeps soundly for a night, then it is a greater help.
And if you clyster in a sickness of looseness of the belly, and the medicine is quick to leave, then repeat it until he is healed.
And if the hemorrhoids are in the fundament, or an abscess, let the clyster be as subtle as for a child;
and this is the form of the subtle clyster, by which the skin is squeezed:
We have already said in the division the treatment of wounds;
or we will tell you the cures of hands and medicine, according to the completion.
I say that wounds are diverse according to what they are made of, and according to the places where the wounds are made, and from what they are made.
The things by which wounds are made are by throwing stones, and cutting with a sword and knife, or with a lance or stick or arrow, or similar things;
or that are made according to the places on the body, such as a wound that falls on the neck, or on the head, or the leg, or the belly, or the liver, and similar members;
and I will tell you the cure for each wound, and will begin with simple head wounds, for the remembrance will come in its chapter.
I say that when a simple wound comes to the head, and the bone is not broken, take care if it is from a thrown stone or similar things, and the skin is nonetheless broken and the wound is large, and you doubt the rise of a hot abscess: if you make it bleed immediately from the cephalic vein itself if little blood comes from the wound, and let the bleeding be on the opposite side of the injured part;
and keep the patient from repletion of wine and heavy foods.
And if it does not want to bleed, let his food be lessened, and let him drink no wine, nor eat any meat;
and put on the wound, if hot abscesses come there, cotton soaked in rose oil only, or in astringent wine;
and if there is no hot abscess, then put on the wound, if it is fresh with all its blood, and it is not changed by the air, powder, which I will tell you a little later;
and if the burn has changed it, then put on some ointments until it is healed.
And if the wound is large, like that from a sword cut or similar, and the edges cannot be brought together by tents, then bring them together by stitching, as I will say for wounds of the belly, of the ribs.
If the wound is exposed to the bone, and hangs, and holds only by a little, then cut it. then treat the wound with medicine, and replace hard flesh in place of skin, and instruct the patient to eat hearty foods, such as roasted meats and cooked wheat, and similar things.
And if you find rotting skin, and it is not close to the bone, cut away all the rot, and remove it, then treat it.
and if there is an artery or vein in the wound, from which blood flows, and it cannot be stopped by medicine, then seek out the artery, and if you find it severed, tie it with a thread; and if this does not work, then cauterize it.
And if these wounds are small and simple, the treatment is easy: and you must place this powder there, so that the burn has changed.
And the method of the powder is: take frankincense one part; dragon's blood two parts; living sulphur three parts, and powder it finely, and fill the wound, and bind it tightly, until it heals well and joins with all its blood;
and then bandage it well, and leave it without loosening, if it doesn't swell; for one does not remove the medicine until it is healed.
And sometimes one uses only sulphur, when one does not have incense or dragon's blood, but that the burning has not changed the wound.
And if the burning has changed the wound, especially if it is, then one does not put this powder in it.
but puts on some digestive ointments, or poultices of barley flour made of water and honey, until it discharges pus; then cures it with other treatments until it is healed.
And if a bone fracture comes with the wound, and it is small, then extract it with fine forceps;
and I will tell you later about the fractures of the head.
of the wound of the neck
If a wound is on the neck and it is simple, there is no difference between it and one on the head, but if the nerve of the neck or the artery is cut.
If it is the nerve, there is no other remedy than to leave it to heal, and not put anything constricting on it, for it harms the nerves and makes them contract; and do not put anything cold on the wound, for the substance of the nerves is cold, and their continuation is also with the brain, which is the highest part of the body;
but let the medicine be warm, like warm water mixed with rose oil, and cooked water also mixed with fresh water, and other mineral stones according to this method, and moist ointments.
And if the wound is large, sew it up and bind it with bandages, then let it heal until it is sound.
And if the wounds are deep and it is swollen and full of pus, pierce it in a lower place;
and if the artery is cut, and bleeding results, tie it off, and cauterize it if necessary;
and if the throat's spine or the esophagus is cut, and the conduit is preserved, through which food passes, sew the esophagus to the throat's membrane, and do not touch the throat, but reset it to its natural shape; and then constrict the swelling, and leave it for several days, then treat it with drying ointments until it is sound;
and if the wound has caused an impression on the bone, dig it out; and if there are pieces of bone, remove all those you can, and those you cannot remove, let them be until the wound festers and the exit is cleared and loosened;
and if the wound is fresh, then sprinkle on the powder that I have mentioned. And if there is bone in the wound and a fistula, treat it as I have said in its chapter.
If it is a wound from a lance or a knife, and the wound is deep, observe whether gases escape from the wound when the patient exhales: Then know that the wound is fatal;
and if it is not deep, and it is fresh with all its blood, do not put powder on it at the first hour, nor bind it because of the blood so that it does not linger deeply, and return to the heart, and kill the patient; but apply an attractive ointment, and bind it twice a day;
and if you do not have ointment, put old cotton in the wound to absorb the moisture, and have the patient sleep over the wound for three, or four, or more days; then there will be no spasm, nor tremor or tightening of the sinews; and when you see the good dispositions, know that the wound is saved. Then cure it with dressings and other treatments, until it is healed;
and if it cannot heal, and it opens again, then know that there is a fistula;
if it is treated as it should be. And if the wound is from a sword or knife incision, and it is simple, or on the front or back, treat it as the front one; if it is large, with stitching;
and if it is small, with powder, and if it is embedded in the bone, and has broken pieces, then treat the wound, and draw out the shards if they are separated; and if they are not separated, leave the wound to fester, so that the extraction will be easier;
and for other wounds on other limbs, the judgment is as we have said.
of the rupture of the belly
The ruptures of the belly are great, medium, and small;
from the large wound sometimes the intestines, or the nerves of the intestines, jump out, so that they enter;
and the cure is more difficult, and sometimes a small wound is worse than a large one, because one has to put the intestines back in more carefully if one does not put them back in quickly;
because the intestines swell as soon as they feel cold, so they are harder to put back, and for this reason a medium wound is worse, because one must put the intestines back in their place than in other two.
And know that the rupture of the belly is according to four types:
two common cures happen in the cure of the belly, and the cure of other wounds of the body and two other specific cures are common to other wounds;
and nevertheless they are more specific to the cure of the belly, and I will explain each one and declare.
I say that when the wound is small, and some part of the intestine protrudes, and it is difficult to return it, this is done by one of the two methods: or because of the smallness of the wound, as we have said, or because the intestine is swollen due to the cold.
And when it is cold, warm it in this manner: wet a sponge or a similar cloth in merely lukewarm water, or boil it in water with squinant, cypress, and spike, and warm the intestine until the swelling is removed;
and sometimes use constricting wines, and it is milder than water alone for swelling reduction.
And when you see the swelling receding, moisten the intestine with water or cooked allspice and mallows, for by this the entrance is opened slightly.
and if it cannot enter, then cut the wound slightly with the instrument used for cutting hemorrhoids;
and the initial treatment is milder than the incision, which should only be performed when there is great necessity.
and this is the instrument for splitting it:
so cut inside the bend and not outside, and see here the shape: And when the wound is enlarged, and the intestine jumps out, put it back in its natural position, if you have the power, for it's worth a lot.
When the wound is large, and it is in the lower part of the abdomen, you must have the patient lie on their back, and raise their legs higher than their head; and if it is in the lower part of the abdomen, put the head and chest higher than the lower parts, and also if the rupture of the abdomen is in one of the two parts, concentrate on ensuring that the injured part is higher than the other;
and thus it is necessary to administer what I say in large and medium wounds.
For small wounds, use what you have prepared, then have a skillful assistant hold the entire rupture in their hand and bring the edges together;
and this is the common method of stitching; you should take a needle or several, depending on the width of the wound, then leave a space of one inch from the beginning of the wound and insert a needle or strong thread there; and pierce the two edges of the skin with the two edges of the underlying subcutaneous tissue, so that you pierce it through that part, and join the two edges of the subcutaneous tissue together;
then tie a double thread around the needle from both sides, then bring together the two edges of the wound, then leave a space of one inch, and insert another needle there;
then tie the thread as you did with the first needle, and do not stop doing this according to your need for needles, until the entire wound is stitched.
and the needles should be medium in size, between fine and thick, because fine needles cut through all the flesh, and too thick ones cannot enter properly. Therefore, they must be medium.
and you should not push the needles too far into the flesh and skin, lest they cut and open the wound before the stitching.
and then cut the ends of the needles so that they do not injure the patient during sleep, and place bandages or strips over the needle ends to hold them in place, and leave them until the wound is healed.
And this method of stitching with needles is more suitable for small wounds, for one or two needles will suffice.
The second method is common, and involves bringing together the two edges of the skin and the two edges of the surface with a needle and a strong, medium thread.
And when you have pierced all four edges together, pull the needle back to the point where you started, in the manner one sews cloth.
and put a space between each stitch the size of a little finger.
This stitch is known to men, and I sewed a wound a man had in his stomach, which was cut by a knife, and the wound was more than a palm in size, and intestines were protruding about two palms in size, and the wound was in the middle of the stomach.
I repositioned the intestine after it had been out for twenty-four hours, and the wound was closed by the fifteenth day, and I treated it, and it healed.
And the doctors had judged that he would die, and this was a miracle.
And I did not treat it with ointment, for I was in a place where one could not find any, nor any medicine. And I placed old cotton over the wound twice a day, and washed it with honey water until it healed.
Now I will tell you the two proper ways of stitching:
Take the needle, and bring it out from the outside to the inside;
When it has pierced the heart of the right to the right, then leave the end of the thread or stitch where you put the needle, and make it pierce the other side from inside to outside;
And the understanding of this stitch is that you stitch just as the tanners do the hides, and that you leave one end of the thread on one side and take it up again on the other, until the stitch is completely done.
The second way of stitching, which Galen calls proper, is as some do, who join the two parts together naturally, and apply one end of the thread to the other end, in this manner:
Insert a needle into the end of the thread nearby, and pierce that place only, and leave the two ends of the thread; Then turn the needle, and make it pierce from the outside to the inside, at the two ends of the thread;
Then pierce each from the outside to the inside, into two other ends of the thread that are on the other side;
And this is the more skillful way of stitching and the most common.
Galen said this, and some testify that one should sew the belly with two needles, where each has thread;
And one should insert one needle on one side, and the other on the other, in the manner of those who sew straps;
And know that when the rupture is in the middle of the belly, the stitching is more difficult than in other parts of the belly.
The judgment of the wound is such as the judgment of other wounds:
And it is that when you find the fresh wound with all its blood, before the heat has changed it, you return the intestine and sew it;
Then put on the powder on the healing flesh, and if the heat has changed it, put on some ointment that is present, until the wound heals; and cut the thread, and let the stitch and the miraculous be joined; then treat the wound as the others, until it is healed;
and if you do not have medicine, then immediately, as soon as it begins to heal, put on old cotton, and move it twice a day until it is healed.
For you do not need any other medicine in addition in many conditions when the wounds are simple;
And if you doubt that the wound might cause a problem to the main members, then you must soak light wool in oil of moderate heat, or in rose oil, and put it around the joints and under the armpits;
And if it feels pain or rottenness in boils, and it often happens, then treat them with warm black wine enemas, and especially if the rot reaches the intestines;
and pierce it inside, and know that when it is the large intestines, it is easier to heal than the small ones.
The intestine called "jejunum" cannot heal when wounded, and this is because of the profusion of veins that are there, and because of the subtlety of the whole body, and the proximity of its nature to the nerves.
And if the scab jumps out of the wound, put it back in, just like the intestine, while it is fresh;
and if it is old and become black or dark, then you must bind the black area so that blood does not leak, because there are veins and arteries there;
then cut what is between the bandage, and hang the two ends down from the part below the wound up to the outside to ease the extraction when the scab falls off and the wound heals.
of the rupture of the bowel
When the intestine is broken, and the wound is small, it can be restored in some men, because I saw a man who was wounded in the belly with a lance;
and the wound was on the right side of the stomach, and it became infected and turned into a fistula, and there issued the expulsions and the flatulence;
I applied treatment according to what I could, and I did not cease to treat it until it was healed, and the place was closed.
And when I saw it closed, I feared that the patient would have pain in his belly; and he had no pain, but remained in better condition, and eating and drinking;
And some experimenters said that when there is a small wound in the intestine, it should be bound in this manner: Take a strip of large cloth, then bring together the edges of the wound, and when the strip has opened its mouth, place it over the two edges, so that it closes its mouth over them;
and then cut off its head, and it holds so that it cannot come loose, then place another strip after it in the same manner as before, until the wound is completely closed; and stitch the wound.
This head, if burnt inside the intestine, causes no harm to the patient, and the intestine can be bound with a thin thread cut from the intestine of an animal, in this manner:
Take the end of this thread of intestine, which should be very lean, and then tie to the end of this thread a thin twisted linen thread, then put the thread in the needle and stitch the intestine, and bring it together over the tear;
And this manner of stitching with strips is nothing more than according to the path of trust and hope;
And if the wound is large and wide, especially if it is in one of the large intestines, there is no device or skill, but only subtlety.
of fistula or wherever it is Know that any wound or abscess, when it becomes chronic, is universally called "fistula," especially when it is deep-seated and pus-filled.
And a fistula, according to truth, is a hard and white knotted swelling, where there is no pain, and is as deep as a bird's feather;
and sometimes clear pus, and other times thick; sometimes little, and sometimes quite a bit;
and I have spoken of this in the division of wounds, that any wound that is not healed, and there is no flesh, is no different than by one of the eight causes: that is to say, by the smallness of the blood or body; or because of its malice; or because there is hard flesh inside, and on the edges, that does not allow flesh to grow; or there is too much pus; or the place is rotten, and the material is of bad quality; or the medicine is not good in the treatment; or because the corruption is a kind of pestilence; or because the property in the region is slow to digest, and delays health, and swells by nature; or where there are veins or bones:
and I have already shown all these causes, and the signs, and the cures of medicines in the division.
Or it is necessary that I make you know the cure of fistula that is made by hand.
Know that fistula occurs in all members of the body; for there are fistulas that come to the large veins, and to the arteries, and to the nerves, or to the skin, or to the intestines, or to the bladder, or to some of the ribs, or to the spine of the back, or to some joint of the hands or feet; and some come to the property of the principal member, and to similar places.
And all the fistulas that are of this kind are of grievous healing, and there is only labor, and ignorance;
and if there is any fistula that does not come to the place I have mentioned, and you are confident in its cure, and you wish to understand it, take a tin or iron tent, if the fistula is straight, then seek it;
and if the fistula is crooked, then seek it with a slender lead tent, for lead bends easily around the twisting;
and if the fistula has many openings and you cannot well seek it with tents, then irrigate it through one of the openings, for the moisture will flow from one opening to another, and clean it;
then seek it wisely to your ability, so that you know if there is bone or nerve, and it is deep-seated, and ask the patient well about the pain he feels when you press with your hand, and the place where he feels it;
and when you truly know the place where it is, and if it is far from a joint, or nerve, or artery or vein, or in any of the places I have told you, then cut it according to what I have told you, and remove the foulness and corrupted flesh that is within;
and then treat it until it is healed, and if the fistula is deep and directly in the right place, you must cut deeply as far as you can, then place moistened tents in sharp medicine, and put them down to the head of the fistula, so that the medicine corrodes the excess that remains at the bottom;
and then apply ointments that generate healthy flesh, until it is healed;
and if it is not healed by this, then cauterize it as we have said, and if the bone is corrupted by the fistula, then cut it.
If a vein or nerve does not bother you in the main limbs, as we have said;
And if the bone is exposed, and there is corruption and blackness, then remove it until the corruption is entirely removed, then treat it with things that generate flesh until it is healed;
And if it is not healed, and returns to a sore as before, know that you have not yet reached the bottom:
then uncover and look until you are at the bottom, and remove all the corruption, then restore the place;
And if it is thus healed, it is well. If not, know that the corruption is too deep for you to reach; then there is no other remedy than to leave it to nature;
And if there is a small corrupted bone, and you can extract it with pincers, extract it with a suitable instrument for this, and if there are many bones, extract them all, and leave not one behind;
And if the moisture resists, and there is no error or fear, cut through the moisture and flesh, and free the bones.
And if you cannot remove them at once, place something that causes decay on the wound, and leave it until the area around the bones has decayed, and then the bones will come out more easily;
And if it is a large bone, such as from a leg or thigh, let the decay proceed only until the blackness is entirely removed, then restore the wound;
and if a large portion of it is corrupted, and reaches down to the bone marrow; then it must be cleaned and cut all the way down to the corruption, and then healed until it is joined together;
and I will tell you about a fistula that happened to a man in his leg, so that you may take an example and help in your work.
He was a young man, around 30 years old, who had a pain in his leg from a cause that came from within the body, until the matter reached his leg, and it was swollen with a large abscess, and there was no cause to avoid opening it;
but the doctors in their folly worked so much on it that the abscess opened, and much matter flowed out, and it became a fistula, and many holes appeared that all emitted pus and moisture from the body;
and many doctors applied treatment for around two years, and no one skilled in the art of medicine was there until I was called, and I saw his leg and the medicines with which they were treating him, and what flowed from the holes in great quantities; and the young man's body became red, and had a yellowish color.
I placed a tent in one of these holes, and then searched all the holes, and found that one was connected to another throughout all parts of the leg.
I hastened then, and cut into one of the holes until I uncovered part of the bone, and found it corrupted and perforated, and the corruption reached down to the bone itself.
I removed what appeared to me of the corrupted bone, and thought that there was no other corruption, other than the one I removed;
and began to restore the wound with prompt medicines for a long time, and could not close it.
and then I began again, and uncovered the bone as before, and found the corruption continuous in the bone, and I removed it, and then I removed it, and I worked hard to close the area. but I could not, until I cut around a palm's breadth of the bone, and it was utterly decayed, and then I restored it with medicines; and it was healed and closed quickly, and it was no longer necessary to restart the work except for the patient's weakness, who could not endure, and because of the fear of death that I had of him. For because of the blood evacuation, he often gasped, but he was completely healed, and a hard flesh grew in place of the bone, and it was of good disposition and had no harm or adversity at all, neither in the air nor in the future.
And if the bone is broken in any part of the body, it should be treated in this way: Take the splint, and fasten it to the head of the exposed bone, and instruct someone to extend it upwards; and place another bandage of wool, thicker than the first bandage, and bind it over the flesh that is on top of the bone, and extend the head, so that you pull the corrupted flesh downwards, and uncover the flesh above the place where you want the splint to be, so that the splint does not wound the flesh;
and place a brand or a piece of wood under the bone to help cut away the corrupted flesh;
and continue this treatment as long as one can see and feel the corruption, and repeat it again.
And if the bone is corrupted, and does not appear, and the corruption is in the middle or in a part, then uncover all the flesh;
then place a brand underneath, and then splint from one side to the other of the corruption, and let the splint be the length of the corruption, a little bit, just as we have said;
and if the corruption is in the joint, then cut the corrupted joint, and splint the bone where it is on the other side;
and if the corruption is in the continuation of the two joints, there is no other remedy than cutting;
and if the corruption is in the finger of the hand, or the finger of the foot, it is very strong, but nevertheless, you must investigate this corruption, how it appears to you; and cleanse it in every way you can, but do not let the vein or nerve oppose you;
and know that the tools and the blades for cutting these bones are various, according to the arrangement of the bones and the appearance of them, and their thickness and thinness, and their size and smallness, and their hardness; and for this, it is necessary to prepare a tool for each type of work;
and know that the work will show you the tool you need, according to the knowledge of this art, and the evidence of the ways of illnesses; so consider the tool that you need, according to what is appropriate.
The shoulder could dislocate either due to internal causes or external causes;
and when you have treated that corrosion with medicinal cures, and they do not help, then it is necessary to amputate that limb down to the place where the corrosion is, so that the patient escapes death or, what is worse, the harm from the loss of the limb.
And the sign is that the limb turns black, so that it seems to be burned by fire, and after the blackness, that corrosion can spread from limb to limb, and take hold of the whole body.
If you hurry to cut it, and if it is caused by the bite of some venomous creature, such as a sea scorpion, viper, and similar, if the corrosion is at the tip of the finger, cut it off and do not give it time to reach the hand.
And if it reaches the hand, cut it at the joint, so that the corrosion does not reach the arm.
And if it reaches the arm, cut it at the elbow.
And if it passes the elbow, it is death, and no strong remedies are of any use beyond the extent of their power.
And similarly do when the corrosion comes to the foot. If it comes to the first joint, cut it after the other joint.
And if it comes to the foot, cut off the entire foot. And if it rises to the leg, cut at the joint of the knee.
And if it comes above the knee, there is no other remedy than to leave the patient to die.
And the method of cutting or removing the limb is that you tie it above and below, and let one attendant pull one of the ties downwards, and another attendant the other tie upwards, and you separate the flesh between the two ties to a width of one span, until the bone is exposed.
Then cut or remove it, and place a linen strip on each side, so that the removal does not touch the healthy area, and cause further injury and abscess to the patient.
And if bleeding occurs when you work, cauterize the area quickly, or apply some astringent powders.
Then return to your treatment until it is complete, then bind the wounded limb with a suitable bandage, and treat it until it is healed.
And I will tell you that it happened to a man on his foot:
He had a blackening that looked like a fire burn, and this corrosion began on his toe, until it affected his entire foot.
And when the man saw the corrosion, he quickly cut off his foot, and was healed.
And a long time later, the corrosion returned to his finger, and he came to me.  I applied repelling substances after cleansing his body, but the corrosion could not be stopped.
And he wanted me to cut off his hand, but I refused, because I had hope of repelling the matter. And I also feared that if I cut off his hand, he might die, for the man's strength was weak.
And he despaired completely, and returned to his land, and quickly cut off his hand, and was healed.
And I have not written this account except so that others may do likewise, if needed.
Sometimes an abscess forms in a fleshy area, and persists so long that it gathers a large quantity of pus. and then bursts and breaks open, and the pus escapes, and the area remains empty, just like a vessel. and the skin on top is as thin as fine cloth, and it does not extend to the bone, nor to the nerve, and such an illness is called "proud flesh," and is not called "fistula.
but if it extends so far that it reaches the bone deep within, then it is called a "fistula.
and the skin is such that you should cut the skin all around, and especially when it is thin, like a cloth. and it does not fester because of its corruption.
And if you are certain that the skin festers, and the corruption is not deep within, and the skin is thick with flesh, then treat it with enemas like this:
Check if the swelling is large, and the pus that comes out has a foul odor, then use an enema of Egyptian medicine, which is made like this: Take honey, oil, and litharge, equally, and put them in a vessel over the fire until the medicine turns red and becomes as thick as honey;
and then take of this according to your need, and mix it in water and honey, and use it as an enema on the swelling, and squeeze the opening; and leave the medicine inside for two hours, then remove it by squeezing;
do this many times, until the swelling is cleansed and the odor is removed;
and sometimes an enema of ash water is used when this medicine is not available, and you take ashes from a vine wood, and pour water over them, then strain it, and use it as an enema, until you know the swelling is well cleansed;
and if the patient cannot tolerate it, neither the Egyptian medicine nor the ash water, then use an enema of water and honey with a little bit of powdered litharge; or you can use an enema of honey and mixed wine, because honey has the property of cleansing and washing, and wine makes the swelling subside;
and when you have done this, and you are certain the swelling is well cleansed, then use an enema to promote flesh growth, and you take a diaphanous plaster, and make it with rose oil and wine;
or you can use enemas of other medicines and ointments, whose properties I have described in the treatment of ointments;
and if the opening of the swelling is small, and the tip of the enema cannot enter, then enlarge it slightly with an iron tool, and insert a tent of Egyptian ointment, or basil ointment, until it is widened;
and if the wound is too large, then stitch it, leaving only the space where the enema can enter, and if the opening that discharges pus is on top, then cut it or to a lower location than it is.
and if you cannot cut the swelling from below as you wish, then arrange it in such a way that the pus runs to the lowest location it can, for when the pus is deep, it does not allow flesh to grow; and if you cannot cut the swelling from below as you wish, then arrange it in such a way: that the pus runs easily downwards, and leave nothing of the pus;
that the pus runs easily downwards, and leave nothing of the pus; and take consolidating medicines to put over the swelling, and spread over it a linen cloth that covers the entire swelling; then cut as forcefully in the spot of the swelling a little wider than the first, then spread a gentle ointment over another cloth according to the size of the opening, and place it over the opening of the swelling to relieve the pus, and do not remove the large cloth at all until after many days one time;
and that which is over the opening of the swelling, remove often to remove the pus, and know what comes out of the pus, whether it is venom or little or enough, whether it is digested or undigested;
and watch if the patient feels pain or not, and if there is an abscess or not, and when your medicine has been spread in this manner and you see the nature that rises over the opening of the swelling, then know that the swelling is now healing, and health is approaching;
and then undo it in the morning, or on the third day, and when you undo the wound, change another cloth, and renew the ointment.
And if subtle venom flows after a long time, do not despair of health, for health approaches.
For there are men who are slow to heal flesh in their wounds, and some who do the opposite;
And if undigested pus bursts from the swelling after many days, know that the swelling is not healing;
and if the swelling is slow to heal and is prolonged, add drying medicines, moist in substance and dry in virtue, such as diafinit ointment, for it contains a large part of vitriol, and it is the last medicine;
Take diafinit ointment, and they make it with rose oil, and anoint it with equal parts of old wine;
then apply it and use it;
and this same thing does better cooked and thickened, when diafinit ointment is not available, or you take myrrh, aloes, and frankincense, and grind it and powder it over honey when it is on the fire;
and then apply it in strips, and spread it over the breast, and sometimes administer a long arisoloche root, and roots of the celestial lily, which is also like flour of vetch and centaury; and use it in simple or compound forms: grind them, and make it into powder, and put it on the honey I mentioned, and use it;
and if the cure is prolonged, and is not cured by this treatment, then know that the corruption is deep, and makes an impression on the bone, or on the hard tissues, or on the ligaments; if the cure for the fistula, as we have said before.
A whitlow is an abscess that arises beneath the fingernail of the hand or the toe, or perhaps it arises on other fingers;
and when it has aged, and one does not take heed, it becomes a foul abscess, and runs and casts pus until it runs to the root of the nail, and perhaps runs the entire nail;
and the corruption reaches the bone, so that there is a foul pain, and the fingertip is swollen, and the colour is livid.
When you treat it as we have said in the division, and the treatment does not profit at all, then you must cut away all the superfluous part of the nail with a hot iron, and then cauterize the wound afterward. Cauterization is very helpful if the bone and nail are healthy;
and if the nail presses on the flesh, and begins to prick and wound it, then you must place a rasp under the nail that pricks the flesh, and raise it up, and carefully and gently cut the flesh, and apply burning and corrosive medicines to the remaining flesh to remove everything; then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
And if the corruption is in the bone, then cut it and remove the corrupt part, for as long as the corrupted bone is there, it cannot heal;
and if you see the finger being corrupted, cut it in the appropriate place as previously described, then treat it until it is healed;
and if it is struck and pushed, and it feels great pain, you must first treat its injury;
then cut the nail of the spatumile with a sharp blade across the top, and be careful that the cut does not reach the flesh beneath the nail, for the patient would feel too much pain;
and if it happens, put something on top that soothes.
The bunion that arises in the hands of some men by chance is entirely fleshy, and sometimes it has bones, and sometimes a nail, and some of them arise at the root of the joint, or the origin is in some of the fingers.
Those that arise on any fingernail do not move, and those that arise at the joint of the finger, by chance, move;
The treatment of the fleshy one is gentle, in this manner: Cut it at its root with a wide spatula.
Those that arise at the root of the joint are difficult to cure: So hold it from the cut.
In that which arises or should be at the posterior part, you must first cut the round flesh down to the bone, then cut the bone with a suitable knife, and then treat it until it is healed.
The swelling that comes to the fingers together comes from birth, or from a wound's healing, or from burning with fire, or similar things.
You must cut that swelling, so that the fingers return to their natural shapes. Then place between them damp cloths or bandages soaked in rose oil, so that they do not stick together. Or you place between two thin pieces of lead, until the place is healed, as it should be.
If swelling comes to any of those fingers with the palm, cut that swelling as it should be.
Vis are large veins wrapped up, full of melancholic superfluities, that come in many parts of the body;
and it more often happens in the legs of those who walk and work and carry, than in others.
Therefore, you should give him purgative for the bile, and then the herb of the basilica.
The treatment with iron is according to two ways: one is that they are cut, and black blood is drawn out; and the other way is that you bind the vein and draw all the blood out.
The incision is according to this manner: First, apply a hot water to the leg very strongly, until the thick blood is thinned, then bind the patient's leg from above the thigh down to the part below the knee;
then cut the vein in one place, or in two or three, with a wide incision, then lift and draw out the black blood into your hand, from one end to the other, until as much blood flows out as the patient's strength can tolerate;
and then bind it, and instruct him to eat foods that produce black bile;
and resume the evacuation and bleeding when the veins are full, and harm the patient.
The raising of it is according to this manner: raise the patient's leg, if there are many hairs, then put it in a bath, and raise the leg in warm water until it becomes red, and the veins swell;
and if you do not have a bath, warm it by the fire, and then cut it along the vein from the top of the knee, or in the part below the ankle;
then open the skin with a knife, and scrape the vein on each side, until it appears when it is felt;
and it is seen red and black, and when it enters the skin it seems like a white cord;
then put the scraper underneath, until it is raised from the skin, and then cut it lightly with the knife, then cut in another place above three fingers;
then scrape the skin over the vein until it appears, then lift it with the scraper, as you did before, and cut it with another knife, as you did first;
then make another cut, or several if you need them, then lift it, and cut it at the toe, then pull and lift it down to the second cut;
then pull it from cut to cut, until it is completely out, then cut it;
and if you cannot pull and lift it, then put a strong double-threaded needle, and tie and pull it, and put a scraper underneath, and turn your hand back and forth until it comes out; and be careful not to cut it, for if it cuts, it cannot be pulled or lifted, and this causes harm to the patient;
and when you have pulled it all out, place wet wool on the wound's place, soaked in wine and rose oil; and treat it until it is healed.
And if the vein is constricted, twisted, and wrapped together, and it is not straight, as we have said, then you must carefully split it, but do not cut it; and pull it out, as we have said before.
The shape of the iron with which one cuts the vein is curved, and it does not cut straight, so that it does not cut the vein;
and is of a large curve, for if it were thin, it would cut the vein, but be thick, as we have said, and here is the shape:
This vein is woven into the legs, in warm parts where no herbs or trees grow, and in land where there is no moisture;
and perhaps it arises elsewhere than in the legs, and this happens from the rot that comes beneath the skin, just as it comes within the body of snakes and worms, woven between skin and flesh.
And if the signs of the beginning of this vein are that a very great inflammation comes to the leg, then the place changes, and the vein begins to emerge, just like the root of a plant.
When the vein appears, you must wrap around it a piece of lead of one and a half to two ounces, and the knot, and let the lead hang on the leg, and every time that any point comes out of the swelling, wrap it around the lead, and the knot.
and if it is too long, cut off a part of it, and wrap the remainder, and do not cut it at its root until it is completely out; for if you cut it, it will return into the flesh, and cause abscess and rot in the place, and a bad illness;
for which reason it is necessary that it be treated little by little until the end, and nothing is left in the body;
and sometimes this vein, when treated, is five palms long, or ten, and a man came to me once, whom it issued from ten palms long, and when you cut it, if you pierce a vein or hole, and pierce it to the bottom, so that all of it comes out;
and let the matter within be emptied, and apply medicines to the place to prevent any rot, then treat it like abscesses.
And sometimes this vein has many branches, especially when it appears at the joint of the foot, or at the foot, and there come many holes, and from which branches jump out;
Then treat it as we have said before.
worms that grow between skin and flesh This illness is called "cattle disease" in our land, because it happens often to cattle, and it is a small worm that grows between skin and flesh, and travels throughout the body, up and down, and one feels it well by the way it travels from limb to limb, until it breaks through the skin where it goes, and bursts forth.
and it is engendered by corruption of some humors, just as worms and serpents and leeches and ascarids come to the belly;
and one doubts its malice, for when it travels through the body, and it ascends to the head, and it comes to the eye, perhaps it enters and destroys the eye; and this happens many times.
When you wish to cure and extract it, one can only do so when it is going.
so it is necessary that you tie the place above and below with a strong bandage tightly, then cut above it and pull it out forcefully; and if the worm is deep within the flesh, and you cannot find it, cauterize it with fire above it until it matures;
and the greatest harm it does is that it damages the eye, as we have said;
and if you see it coming towards the head near the eye, firmly squeeze the eyebrow beneath it, then cut above it, and pull it out forcefully;
and it is necessary to use the patient with cleansing of the body with medicines that dissolve putrid humours, and to abstain from foods that cause putrefaction.
of the pain that comes from windiness This illness is called "vakirir" in our land, and is a pain that comes upon certain limbs, and can move from limb to limb;
and I saw those things that I tell you. I was called to a sick woman, and she uncovered her arm, and I saw a small swelling in the vein of the arm;
and a short time after, I saw it rise just like a worm to the shoulder, more quickly than anything, just like live silver when it runs from one place to another;
the pain departed from that place, and settled in the shoulder, and then a short time after ran throughout the whole body, until it came to the other arm;
then she told me that it repeatedly circled around the body, as I saw it.
I marvelled greatly how it moved thus from limb to limb, for I had never seen this illness in this manner. However, I had seen many in whom pain had moved from place to place, but I had not seen one like this, as I saw it in the woman;
and I thought it was because the woman had a thin body, and the veins exposed, and for this reason the constriction appeared;
and it does not appear according to this reasoning in those who are plump, and who have moist bodies and full veins.
And when you wish to treat this illness, and the patient feels this pain, if it appears to you as we have said, then quickly prick above and below, and then cut until the constricted wind in the place is released. and cauterize the place;
and if you do not see it with your eyes, treat it with that which expels wind, such as foul-smelling pills and pills of sarsaparilla, and similar others.
Arrows are diverse, according to their appearance and according to the parts of the body where they strike.
Their diversity is that there are those that have large points, and small ones, and barbed ones, and those that are soldered together; and those that have two angles, and those that have tongues, and those that have pieces;
and those that strike any limb strike in two ways: or in a chief member, such as the brain, heart, liver, lungs, kidneys, intestines, bladder, and similar members. When it falls, then, into any of these members, and the signs of death, which I will tell you afterwards, appear: so you must refrain from the extraction of this arrow, for death comes afterward in many dispositions; and when these bad signs do not appear, and the arrow is not deeply embedded, pull it out and treat the wound.
And the signs of the brain when the arrow strikes it and pierces the bone, and the thin membrane covering the brain is torn, are when there are seizures and fainting and redness in the eyes, and inflammation and redness of the tongue, and spasms and confusion of the mind, and vomiting of bile; and perhaps blood flows from the nostrils or ears; and perhaps he loses his speech and voice; and from the wound white moisture like pus jumps out, and also like charred flesh;
and if these signs appear to you, then you should treat it, and remove the arrow if it is not embedded.
The sign of an arrow lodged in the heart is when it is near the left breast, and feels as if it were lodged in a hard, not empty, thing; and perhaps the arrow moves like the pulse, and black blood flows out, and cold sweat and fainting come; Then know without doubt that death will follow.
And the sign of an arrow that has pierced the lung is that frothy blood spurts from the wound, and the throat swells, and the patient changes color, and gasps loudly and seeks cold air.
And if the arrow lodges in the chest covering, it is beside the small ribs; and throws off great groans and great pain and gasps; and all the limbs move from the shoulders.
And if the arrow lodges in the stomach, perhaps some undigested food spurts from the wound.
And if the arrow lodges in the belly, and some straw leaps out through the torn intestines, there is no hope for treatment, nor for extracting the arrow.
And if the arrow lodges in the bladder, and urine spurts out and comes to the surface, and the patient feels intense pain: know that the wound is fatal.
The other limbs, such as the face, neck, throat, shoulder, arm, spine of the back, forearm, thigh, and legs, and similar members, are safe according to various dispositions. When the arrow is in a nerve or artery, and it is not venomous, as I will tell you what happened to me, so that you may do the same.
It happened to a man that an arrow lodged in his tear duct at the root of his nose: I tried it, and pulled it out from the other side under the fat of the ear, and he was healed without any harm.
And pulled out at a game an arrow that lodged in the fat of the eye under the eyebrow, and the arrow was embedded, and one could only reach the tip towards the shaft, and the arrow was large from a Turkish bow, with a light iron head without ears;
The man was healed, and no bad accident befell him.
And pulled an arrow from the throat of a Christian, and the arrow was Arabic with ears:
I softened the flesh around it, and skillfully extracted it, and the Christian was healed.
And pulled an arrow from a man, that had lodged in his belly, and I thought he would die;
and after that thirty days had passed, he did not change his condition; I cut around the arrow, and extracted it, and the extraction was successful, and there was no bad incident.
And I saw a man whose arrow struck his back, and the wound was closed over.
and the arrow remained inside him, and did not change his natural disposition, nor did he find any harm in any of his natural functions.
And I saw another man, upon whom an arrow struck his face, and the wound was closed over. and remained thus without suffering great pain;
and many other similar cases.
And a prince of the king's men had an arrow piercing him in the middle of his nose, and it was slightly slanted to the right side; and the arrow was completely embedded.
I was called to treat him after it had been lodged for three days. I found the wound very narrow.
I probed it with a very fine probe, and felt nothing. and he felt a puncture and pain beneath his right ear.
I thought it was from the arrowhead. I applied a drawing and digestive plaster to the area, so that it wouldn't swell. And the arrowhead appeared to me.
And the arrowhead appeared to me. I applied the plaster again and the wound healed once more. The patient remained like that for a long time, until he felt the arrowhead emerge from his nostril one day.
And he told me so. I applied a sharp, corrosive medicine to the wound for several days, until it opened up, and probed it. I felt the head of the arrowhead becoming loose in the area.
Then, I added more of that sharp medicine to the wound opening, until the arrowhead's tip became clearly visible.
And after about four months, the wound finally widened so that I could insert the pincers.  I moved them from side to side, but it couldn't be removed.
Then I continued to refine and devise instruments, until one day I used well-made pincers, as described at the end of this chapter, to remove it and heal the wound.
And the physicians judged that the cartilage of the nose could not be restored. I restored it then, and the wound was closed, and the patient was completely healed.
Now I have told you the nature of removing some arrows, so that you apply your treatment to what I have not said, because the book cannot contain everything.
But skilled masters, based on little and on what is present and lacking, invent new works and new instruments to address the strange occurrences in this art.
I say that arrows do not leave the limbs where they are lodged except in two ways: or through the place where they enter, or through another part;
and that which leaps out through the place where it entered, that is, an arrow that enters fleshy parts, and sometimes jumps out now.
And if it does not jump out now, leave it until the flesh is rotten around it, and the exit is relieved;
and if it is lodged in the bone, and it cannot come out, leave it thus for a few days, and move it each day;
and then it jumps out, and if it does not, pierce around it with a very fine drill, until the surrounding area is widened, and then pull it out.
And if the arrow is lodged in a hidden place in the body so it cannot be seen, search for it throughout the wound; and if you feel it, then pull it out with an appropriate instrument;
and if you cannot because of the tightness of the wound, and the depth of the arrow, and there is no bone, nerve or vein, then enlarge the wound until it is large;
and pull the arrow out if you can, and if the arrow has points that hold it in, then remove the flesh that is caught on both sides as much as you can, and then break or bend the points of the arrow until you can pull it out;
and be careful not to break the arrow, for you might pull it out more painfully.
And if you cannot at once, then leave it until the surrounding flesh is rotten, then pull it out, for the extraction will be easier. And if the flow of blood makes it difficult, then administer what we have said about the treatment in its chapter;
and be careful of cutting the nerve and vein, and devise how you can most safely pull the arrow out, whether quickly or slowly, firmly or gently;
and place the patient in the position he was in when the arrow struck him, for this is the greatest help there is, and if you cannot, then place him according to the signs that they show you.
The arrow that comes from another place, or where anything of it is apparent, or the skin is swollen in such a place that it is seen or felt clearly:
then cut over it, so that the pincers can grasp it, and then pull it out: if it jumps out now.
And if it is held in the bone, then turn your hand round, until it enters the bone, and widens the bone, then pull it out.
And if it cannot come out, then leave it for a while, and then resume the extraction until it comes out;
and if the shaft of the arrow is stuck there, then push it with the whole shaft;
and if the shaft is down, and you wish to administer a push, then administer it with a pointed instrument, so that the point of the arrow enters the pointed part of the instrument;
and then push forcefully, and if the arrow is pointed, then push with an instrument with a pointed end, entering into it, to ease the extraction.
And if the arrow is embedded, then you must cut all the flesh around where the poison is, if you can, then treat the wound as is appropriate.
And if the arrow lies in the groin or the belly or the bladder or the ribs, and it is close, and you can cut over it, then cut there;
and be careful not to cut the vein and the nerve, and then extract it, and then dress the wound, if necessary; and treat it until it is healed.
The shape of the tongs with which arrows are extracted is similar to the beak of a bird, and see here the shape:
And there are many kinds of them: large, medium, and small, according to the size of the arrow.
The shape of the arrowhead is also like the feather of a bird, for pushing at the tip of the arrow, as here is the shape:
Of the veins from which one bleeds are thirty-one, of which there are sixteen in the head, that is to say: Two beaters which are behind the ears, which are called the two "herbech"; and the two arteries which are in the two visible temples; and two veins that are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes, which are called "aspires"; and the vein that is in the middle of the forehead; and the vein that is at the top of the nose; and the two guindeges that are in the neck; and the two veins that are in the lips above the mouth, and these are the veins that are called "augeherich"; and two veins that are under the tongue.
The veins that are commonly lanced are five in each arm:
One is the cephalic, and is on the left side, and the common people call it "vein of the head"; and the middle one is called "faste," and is composed of the cephalic and basilic, and the common people call it "vein of the heart"; and the basilic is on the right side, and the common people call it "vein of the belly," and is above the bend of the elbow, and is the one that is lanced, which clearly appears on the wrist.
And the salvatelle is the vein that is between the ring finger and the little finger, and it has two branches;
and in the leg and foot are three veins: one is below the bend of the ankle on the left side, and the second is the saphenous vein that is at the ankle on the right side; and the vein called "nesse," which is in the ankle of the other side;
and in the other leg are three veins below those.
Bleeding from the veins near the ears helps with old colds and migraines;
and the quality of the bleeding, as I told you, is that you raise the patient's head and rub the area where the veins are with a rough cloth; then the patient tightens their neck with a vise, until the two veins appear behind the ears in two places depending from the head: then press them with your finger, and where you feel the pulse under your finger, make a cut;
then take the lancet and insert it under the vein to the bone, then lift your hand up the entire vein, and cut through both the skin and the vein, and make the blood flow as much as you want;
then constrict and tie it, until it is healed;
and I have already mentioned incisions and cautery in the first book.
The bleeding of the two arteries in the two temples is good for chronic migraines, and persistent ophthalmia, and for sharp bouts of tears in the eyes;
and the qualities of the bleeding are as I say: and the patient should constrict their neck, until the two veins are clearly visible; and feel the pulse beneath your finger, and then bleed from the top.
then lift the heart above the vein to your index finger, and place the lancet underneath, and lift the vein upward, and cut it, as you did with the other two veins, and make the blood flow according to your need;
then release the patient, and place your finger on the vein for an hour, then place some cotton on it; and then bind it tightly, and leave it until it is healed;
and we have already spoken of their cutting and their extraction, at the beginning of the book.
Bleeding from the vein of the forehead is as valuable as bleeding from the cephalic vein for diseases of the face, and for migraines, and for redness;
and the quality is such that the patient tightens their neck by twisting, until the vein appears; then take the instrument which is called "digging tool", of which here is the form:
And place the tip on the vein, and push on it with your hand, or with something else, and let blood flow out according to the quantity that you want; then loosen the patient's neck, and tie the vein until it is healed and sometimes the work is done with a wide flame.
However, it does not behoove the flame to be too sharp; and cut it across, for the bone is near, and perhaps the flame will break if it is too thin.
The incision of the two veins which are in the two tear ducts helps with the eyes, and the eyelid, and redness, and the inflammation in the eye, and diseases of the face;
and the qualities of their incision are that the patient squeezes their neck by twisting with some band, as before;
then cut it, and let the incision be across, a little long and a little wide, for there is no flesh there. And if the flame is thin, perhaps it will break.
Then let the blood flow as much as you need, and then apply a bandage over it, and tie it well.
An incision from the vein near the nose is good for headaches, and severe madness, and facial illnesses, such as migraine and redness that comes to the face, especially when it is old;
And the technique for the incision is that the patient should bend their neck, then press their nose to your left hand, and take a thin long blade, and place it between the lip in the space between the two nostrils, for the vein does not appear well there, and the blood will begin to flow now;
And do not go too deep, and let the blood flow according to your needs, then bandage it for a night, for it is very quickly restored;
An incision on the two temples aids in the constriction of the throat, and in the beginning of the swelling, and in many illnesses, and in the plague, and in boils, and in herpes, and in sores;
And the technique of the incision is that the patient should press their neck from both sides, as we have said;
And let the master stand above the patient's head, and the patient sit on a seat, then cut the vein along a little broadly, then draw the blood moderately, or as much as is needed;
Then do the same to the other vein, then loosen the bandage, and gently compress both veins, so the patient does not choke; and leave it until morning, that the wound may heal.
of the incision of the lips The incision of the veins of the lips above helps with a collection in the mouth, and with the corruption of the gums, and fissures of the lips, and of the nose and around it.
And the qualities of the incision are to make the patient sit before you, and to hold their neck as I have said; then turn the lip, and look for the two veins, of which one is on the right lip and the other on the left, and they are recognized by being black, and by the fact that around them are small black veins:
Then cut one and the other, and if you do not recognize them, and you are in doubt, then cut the largest from each side, and just as you did with the two veins that are above and below, because it is one and the same method.
Of the incision below the tongue The incision of the veins below the tongue helps after the incision of the cephalic vein, and for the constriction of the throat, and for diseases of the eye, and diseases of the mouth;
and the qualities of the incision are such that the patient sits still between your hands in front of the sun, and lifts their tongue, and looks underneath on each side for a black vein:
Then cut one and the other, and do not go too deep, for the arteries are below.
The veins of the ribs, which are commonly incised, are incised according to two manners:
either by pricking with a broad, pointed, thin blade, or with a subtle, olive-shaped cutting knife, and is called "anesil"; and they are broad and subtle according to the breadth and narrowness of the veins. The shape of the pointed blade is very renowned, and is broad as you see:
And is necessary for opening veins full of thick, visible blood, and that contain thick, troubled blood; and this is the shape of the olive-shaped blade:
and is more subtly pointed, and is for lancing thin veins, where there is subtle yellow blood.
The lancing of the basilic vein, which is one of these veins, helps ailments that are under the throat, and in the neck, and in the chest, and in the belly;
and it is necessary for the lancer that he lance wisely, and that he beware of the artery that is beneath. And if he cuts the artery, and a flow of blood comes, it must be stopped, as I have said; and the flame should not be piercing, but cutting, like a knife.
And if the basilic vein is not clearly visible, it is necessary to press it, and to choose another one; or you want a branch of it, or you lance a vein in the middle of the arm in its place: it is clearly visible; and cut it with the knife flame, as we have said.
And if you wish to know the place of the lancing, it is first necessary that you squeeze the arm, that you touch the place until you know the pulse; then mark the place with a mark, and then tie the arm, and cut the vein with the knife flame; and be careful not to hit the artery when you see the place bruised, for it is of the artery: Wipe it then.
And if you see it spurt upwards like a child's urine, and the blood is red and subtle, know that it is blood from the artery: Hasten then, and put your finger on it for a long time, then remove your finger if the blood stops, which happens many times; Tie the arm, and leave it thus, and let the patient not move it;
and let him be afraid, and not move it until he is healed.
And if the blood does not stop, and it overcomes you, and the medicine is not present to you, then cut the artery if it appears, for the head will recede; and stop the blood.
And take a fig-tree bark, and split it, and take one half and bind it well until the next day;
if the blood stops, that's good; if not, treat it, as we have said, with powders that stop blood;
and the stopping of blood is not difficult in many cases due to the small size of the wound and the strength of the arm's bandage.
The vein's bleeding helps by drawing blood from the head above and the body below, because it is composed of the basilica and cephalic veins, as we have said;
and it is necessary for the surgeon to be careful of the nerve beneath, and if he cuts too deeply, and finds the nerve, and it swells and the patient suffers greatly, and perhaps cannot heal;
and this nerve often appears, and if it does not appear in some men due to its subtlety, then you must drain it with the lancet. and dry the nerve as best you can.
And if there is a vein between the two nerves, then cut it lengthwise.
The surgeon of the cephalic vein helps, as it draws blood from the head and helps the eyes;
and it is necessary to bleed by pricking at the olive vein or the myrtle vein, for it is the safest of all veins, because it has neither nerve nor artery underneath. However, one must seek the easiest place, and do no harm if one fails the first time, and one starts again; and perhaps the place swells in some men, when one fails the first time, but it does no harm.
The quality of the bleeding is according to your thinking.
The first thing you should know about bleeding is that it is only administered to preserve health and to avoid future illnesses;
and let the bleeding be done in one of the three veins that are on the elbow: that is to say, cephalic, basilic, and median cubital; and one should bleed at the beginning of spring on an empty stomach, and in autumn and winter after eating, when the signs of fullness appear;
and one should bleed on the first or third day, after two or three hours of the day.
The bleeding administered for illnesses has no set time, but whenever necessary, by day or by night, at all hours and at all times;
and it is not appropriate to bleed children until fourteen years old, nor pregnant women except from the fourth to the seventh month. And old people who have passed sixty years should not be bled.
And when someone wishes to be bled, in whatever way, it is necessary that they cleanse their intestines with a light clyster if they have retained much waste, so that the veins do not draw from the intestines the putrid superfluities harmful to the principal limbs;
nor should those who are too full of food, nor those who are drunk, as long as they are in that condition, nor those with dropsy be bled;
and one should be wary of bleeding after a colic attack, and vomiting, and purging of the bowels, and increased activity in women, and of labour, of wakefulness, and of fasting, and anything that totally drains the strength, whether from the body or spirit;
then thin out the humors, if the blood is thick, through foods and drinks and medicines, if you have the power to do so;
then enter a bath, if nothing prevents it, to thin the blood, and bleed from the vein of the armpit near the third, as we have said;
and guard yourself that day from work, and hardship, and lust, and similar things;
and be relaxed and joyful, and let the blood-letter be higher than the person being bled, and rub the arm two or three times, then tighten the bandage moderately, because when it is too tight or too loose, the blood cannot flow;
and then rub the area with your hands until the veins swell and can be felt;
then the blood-letter moistens the blade with a little bit of old oil, then places the little finger of his left hand on that vein under the place where he wants to bleed, so that the vein does not burst and fail when struck.
For there are veins that flee like cords when bleeding, and some are full of gas, so that when one puts the blade on, it recoils, and the vein cannot be opened, and so it is with those; and if he opens the vein, the wound is too narrow, therefore the blood-letter must be careful in these things.
And if the vein opens the first time, that is good; if not, he recommences a little below that place or above it quickly, if the place is not swollen.
And if the place is swollen and the patient is frightened, he leaves it one or two days, and does not bind the arm: perhaps a hot abscess will come.
do not enter a bath, then recommence the lancing if it pleases him;
and if the opening is small, or the blood flows subtly, and you fear that it will not release as much blood as you wish, then pierce that same opening with the entire flame directly;
and do the work a little hastily, before the place is swollen; for this happens many times, when the wound is small.
If you see the place swollen, then do not recommence the lancing, and put a little bit of oil on it, for it alleviates the body of blood, and the oil is gentler on that place than the lancing;
and thus administer the oil in each lancing that you lance the veins, to stanch the flow of blood;
and this same thing does the trick and heals it, when one puts it on the place; so the blood thins and spreads when it is too thick.
And if a large abscess comes, which happens many times, especially when it is not lanced enough or the opening of the vein is small, then hurry, and put a sponge moistened in hot water and salt on the place, and hold it for an hour;
and you should do this after the blood leaves the vein, and if some blackness or greenness remains in the place after a few days, it does not hurt at all; and if you wish, put something of aloes or myrrh mixed with juice of calamint, marjoram, or similar.
And many times an abscess and appearance happen at the lancing of the basilica:
Then put your hand on it, and if you find the place soft to the pressure of your hand, that appearance is bad. Then beware that you put nothing of what we have said on it, for perhaps there is a burst artery;
but make a dry poultice to harden the place, then treat it with another remedy until it is healed.
And draw a certain amount of blood according to the quantity of its virtue and the color of the blood.
For if the blood is black, let it be drawn until it is red; and if you see it thick, let it be drawn until it becomes thin; and if it is too hot, let it cool down.
And it is necessary for someone who is full and strong, and needs bloodletting, that a larger wound be made, and the flame be wide;
and for someone who is weak, do the opposite, and it is necessary to bleed them little and often, and they should be bled by cutting across, not by pricking;
and this manner of bleeding is safe from blood leakage and nerve damage, and is better than bleeding from the long or the wide.
And for someone whose body weakens due to bleeding, it is necessary to give them bread soaked in pomegranate juice; if he is heated, then draw blood three or four times. And if he is of a cold complexion, then before the bleeding, give him bread soaked in syrup of mulled wine, or in aromatic honey syrup with spices, like pepper, cinnamon, ginger, and chickpeas, and a well-scented syrup.
And if he faints during the bleeding, after the release of much blood, then it is necessary that he sip broth of meat and a subtle fragrant syrup, and use the other things that we have mentioned in the division or chapter on syncope, for the evacuation of the vein.
And if he wants to let his arm vent, and bleed again, then it is necessary, when he is weakened by much bleeding, that he bleeds little by little, according to the amount of his continued strength.
And whoever wants to vent their arm after the first bleeding, and they have a strong body, should bleed seven hours after the first bleeding, or after the ninth hour.
And whoever wants to bleed from another part, should bleed on the second or third day.
For there is much blood within the body that is now heated, and causes fever; so it is necessary to draw a large quantity, and enlarge the opening until it falls into pieces; so that you observe all the conditions of bleeding, and place your hand upon their pulse when they bleed, so that death does not come in place of fainting, and this happens many times when the bleeder is negligent;
and it is not suitable, when you want to untie the arm and make blood come out a second time, and the opening is closed, that you press very strongly upon it; nor if it is crooked, that he extend the arm hastily, for that would be bad;
but let him bleed a second time; or you apply the point of the flame, so that the blood which is congealed at the opening of the vein flows out forcefully, and place a little cloth soaked in water, and press lightly upon it.
And if the vein is swollen, leave it and do not bind it, until the abscess is calmed.
And if it is necessary to draw blood a second time, let it bleed in the same place, or in another vein, or in the other arm.
The vein in the middle of the arm is bled instead of the vein of the head because it is more easily accessible.
And the manner of bleeding is that the patient puts his hand in warm water, until the vein is red;
then it is tied moderately, so that the vein is clearly visible, then let it bleed straight through, not from the side nor the length;
and let the opening be wide, and let it bleed close to the joint of the hand, and if blood cannot flow out, then return the hand to warm water, and let the blood run into the water until you have enough;
and if it is summertime, do not put the hand back in warm water, for one puts it in more in winter than in summer;
and the bleeding from this vein is safer than any other vein, for there is neither artery nor nerve.
Bleeding from the vein in the right hand's palm is good for all liver ailments, and this is the method:
Hold the hand, and put it in warm water until the vein is swollen, so that one can see it; and if the blood flows transversely, and if you cut it completely across, nothing will be harmed;
and do not go too deep, for the nerves are beneath, bare of flesh, and then put the hand back in warm water, if the blood is frozen in the wound, and cannot come out.
And when you have drawn as much blood as you need, put oil and wool over the vein to quickly seal it, and do this for each vein.
The bleeding in the left hand is worth it for the disease of mice, and do everything just as I told you for the right.
Bleeding from the sophene is good for all diseases beneath the body, such as diseases of the marrow, and retention of flowers, and diseases of the kidneys, and thighs and legs, and similar illnesses.
And the quality of this bleeding is that the patient puts their foot in warm water, and rubs over the vein until it bursts, and ties the joint of the foot. and the vein is at the ankle, and through above the foot go many kidneys.
Then bleed it where the kidney is largest, or at the ankle, which is better.
And if you bleed above the foot, watch out for the nerves beneath, and bleed through it as if cutting.
And let the flame be gentle.
And if the blood cannot come out, then place the foot in water, and let the vein empty well.
And if the bleeding fails the first time, begin again a little higher the second time, because the place is clogged;
And do not hesitate about the nerve, as we have said, and likewise do this to the sole of the other foot.
The place of the sciatic vein is at the ankle, and its bleeding is worth the pain in the hip, when it is for hot blood.
And the quality of its bleeding is that the patient enters a bath and tightens above the ankle with four fingers by twisting, for otherwise the vein will not appear;
And if it appears, then bleed it in every way that you can, and crosswise; And it is better that you cut it, for the place is safe, and it is very responsive to hands.
And it is better that you cut it, for the place is safe, and it is very responsive to hands. And if you do not find it, then bleed any vein that appears on the back of the foot, and towards the little toe, and be wary of the nerves;
And make as much blood run as you wish, and then loosen the bandage, and place cotton on it and tighten it; It is now healed.
Cups are made of horn, or of bronze, or of glass;
And cupping is done in two ways: either by striking and drawing blood, or without striking.
And this cupping without striking is in two ways: either with fire, or without fire;
and cupping that is done by striking and drawing blood is done in fourteen places on the body, of which one is all the way at the top of the head; and another is in the middle of the neck; and two others in the two sides of the neck; and the cupping under the chin; and the cupping of the two shoulders; and the cupping on the hips; and the cuppings between the two arms; and the cuppings of the two legs; and the cuppings of the two ankles;
and the cupping does not draw much blood, except for the small veins scattered in the flesh, and for this reason, one does not weaken, as one does with bloodletting from a vein; and it is not necessary that it be administered, neither with fire nor without fire, in any disease that comes from fullness, until the whole body is emptied.
And if, by necessity of illnesses, one must cup, or by custom, then one should administer it each hour at the beginning of the month, or at the end, and in between and at every time;
for there are some who, when they need to be cupped, have a heavy head;
and there are some who find fullness and redness on their face, and in their head, and at the neck, and darkness in their eyes;
and those who find a drop of blood in their mouth, and have a swollen tongue, and spit blood; and there are those who dream, and see by night blood and wounds and death and similar things.
And when we see these signs, and especially when it is in the middle of the month, we command cupping after three hours of the day.
The bloodletting from the temple helps the heaviness of the head… that comes to the eyes, and it is not necessary that this be after the evacuation of the whole body;
and this cupping is in place of bloodletting from the cephalic vein, and it is not necessary for those of cold complexion to use it, or those who have a cold, for this does them much harm;
and therefore it is not necessary for the elderly to use it, nor those who have cold ailments in the head.
And those who often bleed themselves become forgetful, and therefore it is necessary to place the cupping a little lower, due to the fear of forgetfulness.
Cupping in the neck is in place of bloodletting from the head and the basilic vein, and therefore it is good for constriction of the breast, and for a rupture of the airway, and for all of this, and for fullness.
And it should be applied gently, for if it holds too firmly, it creates forgetfulness in the stomach and the heart.
Cupping on the two ribs of the neck is good for headaches, and ophthalmia and migraine, and constriction, and pain in the roots of the teeth, and is in place of bloodletting of the basilic vein.
And you must instruct the person that they should press their hand when applying it, so that they do not cut the artery, and there is no excessive bleeding.
Cupping under the chin is good for mouth ailments, and for corruption of the gums, and similar maladies of the mouth. And it is in place of bloodletting from the two lips.
Cupping on the shoulders is good for ailments that come from heat and fullness.
Cupping on the elbows is as effective as bloodletting from the three veins of the arm, for it draws blood from these large veins.
And instruct the lord that he not strike too hard or deep, for the area is bare of flesh and contains nerves and arteries.
Cupping on the rump is good for hemorrhoids of the fundament and ailments below, and the cup should be large and made of bronze, as it needs to draw well. And perhaps, if it were thin, it would break. And it would cause large wounds.
Cupping on the legs draws blood readily from the whole body, and is good for old pains in the kidneys, bladder, and uterus, and helps clear up the flowers (fluids).
And are placed on the two shins and two ankles, but nonetheless they weaken the body after prolonged use and cause paleness in many conditions.
The manner of applying a cupping glass is to first make it empty, then gently suction, swiftly put it in place, move it evenly, and do not stop until you see the area reddened and swollen, and the redness of the blood appears.
Then remove it, and replace the cups, and be watchful of the body's condition, for there are those with tender flesh, and clear pores: So it is necessary to strike only once, and to make wide, somewhat deep wounds. and to suck gently.
And if the blood is thick, then it is necessary to strike twice: the first time to make the thick blood's path thinner.
And if the blood is very thick, it is necessary to strike a third time;
and when we want to draw little by little from the blood, then we need only one strike. And if we want a lot of blood, we should start again often;
And if the blood is thick, strike deep, and the aim is to pierce the heart suddenly, and it is necessary for those with thick and hard skin, and narrow pores, that you anoint the places of the cupping glasses with an aperitif and dissolving oil: if it is in this state, with violet oil, or sweet almond oil, or gourd seed oil;
and if it is in winter, with cress oil, or lily oil, or chamomile oil, or another similar one.
And if the superfluities are thick and cold, take bitter oil, or balsam oil, or dill oil, and similar ones.
And if the one who is cupped has tender skin and wide pores, then no oil should be put there, but it should be washed after the cupping with rose water, or cold water, or mullein water, or gourd water, or porcelain water, or something similar.
And those who have much moisture, take it with ease, or with myrtle water, and sumac, and similar things.
And those who have thick superfluities take it with old wine, or with vinegar water, or with a decoction of dill or chamomile, or other similar things;
and one should not be cupped with a cupping glass before the bath or during the bath, but after the bath an hour or two;
and do not sleep after the cupping, and it is necessary that he wash himself, when he is to be cupped and when he is cupped.
And watch if the one who is bled is choleric, and if the blood is too sharp and inflamed; if it is necessary that he take cold things, such as pomegranates and endives and lettuces in season, and similar things; and eat pigeons, and hare meat, and moist meats.
and eat pigeons, and hare meat, and moist meats. And he who has a cold complexion, let him take syrup of honey, and scented wine of middling age, which is between old and new, and eat little, and eat pigeons and small birds and young chickens;
and the day that he is to be bled, he should drink more than eat;
and it is necessary to give some men sometimes a triacle or nutmeg before the bleeding, or afterwards, to strengthen the main limbs; and let the blood be subtle, but it is not appropriate for those who are hot to drink it.
The cupping vessels that are applied without striking are those that are applied to the liver, and to the mice (gout), and to the foot (gout), and to the belly and the bowels and the kidneys and the hip, because those limbs do not endure being struck on them, and one does not do so except to draw blood from limb to limb, as we place them on the breasts when the nipple bleeds;
to remove the viscosity that is in the limb, as we apply cupping vessels to the belly and the bowels to thin the limb;
and it removes the pain, when there is obstruction or stone, it removes the obstruction or dislodges the stone from its place by its attractive virtue;
and thus does it when it is placed on the liver and on the gout when there is retained wind, and these cupping vessels are administered empty only to suck; and sometimes they are administered with fire, and sometimes full of warm water, as in diseases of the pleurisy, and in such a manner one fills the cupping vessel with hot water alone, or with water in which suitable herbs have been boiled.
The form of the cupping vessel administered with fire is this:
And it should have two inches in width and half a palm in depth, and have on the side near the middle one small hole, as for pushing a needle, and it should be of bronze, soft on the front so that it does not injure the patient when placed on the limb;
and have in the middle a crosswise rod of bronze or iron, for placing a lit candle, and may be large or small according to the illnesses and age of those who use them;
for the cupping vessels of children are different from those of the elderly, and of the thin from the fat.
And one should thus place this cupping vessel on the limb:
light the candle of wax or linen, and put it in the middle of the cupping vessel through the rod that is in the middle of the cupping vessel, so that the light is at the bottom of the cupping vessel so that it does not burn the patient;
and then place it on the limb, and your fingers should be on the opening that we have mentioned, so that when one wishes, the vapor goes out, and one removes the cupping vessel;
and one lights the linen as before, and repeats it often, if you need to.
In the cupping vessel therefore, which is administered in pleurisy, an acute illness, there is no rod or opening, and it is not administered otherwise than when it is full of water, and is placed on the limb only;
and that is the form:
Leeches are administered only on limbs where one cannot put cupping vessels because of their small size, such as lips and gums, and similar places; and on places devoid of flesh, such as the finger or the nose, and other similar places;
and the quality of using them is that when you find leeches that are in clear, fresh, undamaged water, take them;
and put them in fresh water, until they are hungry and have nothing in their stomachs; and then bleed from the vein and cup, then rub the limb until it is red, and place the leeches on it;
and when they are full and fall off, if it is a place where one can put a cup, then put a cup, for this is very effective.
If not, then wash the area with warm water, and then dry it well;
and if the area bleeds too much after the leeches, then moisten a linen cloth in cold water and put it on, until the bleeding has stopped;
and if the bleeding is excessive, then put ground vitriol, or galena, or similar things, on it, until it has stopped;
or you put half of peeled beans on the area, and leave them until they become hot on the area, it will now stop;
and if you need more, take more leeches.
And if the leeches do not want to take hold, then rub the area with fresh blood, or you stick a needle into it so that blood comes out, and then put them on it; and as soon as they feel the blood, they will attach themselves.
And when you want them to drop off, sprinkle a little ground aloes and salt, or ashes, on them, and they will fall off now.
Here begins the book of fractures. This chapter is often necessary in the art of medicine, and it is the restoration of fractures and dislocations.
Know, dear son, that the foolish will scoff at this chapter, as they have never seen any of the ancient books, nor have they read a letter from them.
And for this reason, the science is rare in our land, for I have never found any good one.
And I know nothing about it, except through the knowledge of ancient books, where I have studied so much that I have mastered the science, and through experience, and through the custom of my life.
And I have now described in this chapter what is contained within, and have summarized it at the end, and have clearly shown the forms of the instruments that are used, as I have done in these two chapters before.
It is therefore necessary that we say in the prologue of this book the sum of the words and the chapters where the wise man applies his understanding, and remains in the truth, so that those who are tested may know and learn this noble art, and teach it to others.
I say that when a break or dislocation or twisting or fracture comes to anyone, you must quickly bleed the patient on one side and the other, if nothing else hinders you, such as weakness of the body, or children, or old people; or if the weather is not very hot, or too cold;
and eat cold foods, that is to say, cold meats, and the flesh of birds and roe deer, and drink no wine, nor eat any fatty meats, and do not fill oneself too much with foods that fill the veins with blood, until you fear a hot abscess or the spreading of matter to the limb;
thus the patient returns to his former state of health.
And when the broken bone begins to recover, it is necessary to nourish the patient with foods that provide great nourishment, or that have viscosity, such as cooked wheat in water, and rice, and calves' heads, and feet, and bellies, and eggs, and fresh fish, and strong wine, and similar things. For with such nourishment, the fracture heals more quickly and easily.
And know that broken bones of the elderly and decrepit cannot heal or knit together well according to their nature due to the dryness of the limbs, nor those that are too tender, such as the bones of small children;
but there is no cure, nor can the broken bone be set with thick bandages that support and bind the limb together, until it strengthens as it was before; and it will not fully heal its function, and for this reason it needs to be nourished with hearty foods, as we have said.
And know that fractures are diverse in many ways.
For a fracture of the head is different from a fracture of the arm or leg, and I will tell you in this chapter all kinds of fractures. For there are fractures that go in a spiral, and others in a pointed manner, just like the blade of a quill for writing.
For there are fractures that go in a spiral, and others in a pointed manner, just like the blade of a quill for writing. And there are fractures with a wound, and fractures with just a small crack.
And for each type there is its own method, and its own proper instrument in restoring it, according to what the memory brings to its place;
And a fracture of the bone is known by the fact that the place is twisted, and appears well by pushing, and sounds when pressed by the hand;
And when there is no twisting or sound on touching, and the patient does not feel much pain, there is no fracture;
But there may well be twisting, or a crack, or a small fracture. Therefore you should not move it by hand, but apply the medicines that follow, and then hold it gently.
And know that a fracture that goes to the bone, and the two parts are separated, it is necessary to put them in equal alignment, lest a hot abscess come about;
and if a hot abscess comes, leave it for a few days, until the abscess has subsided;
then put it back to alignment as gently and wisely as you can, and know that the restoration is easier than where there are pieces;
then hold it, as it is necessary from here on.
And if in the bone there are broken pieces, if it is a hand or foot, or in your hand if it is a small limb, or by two ropes, or by a rope and your hand;
and put the limb back into its natural shape, so that when the broken parts of the limb are separated, you reposition the additions to their places as gently as you can, and watch that through your work, no injury or pain comes to the patient;
and well join the two ends of the bones according to the best shapes.
And feel it well with your hand if you think it is not quite right:
if you straighten it nicely, and do not hold it too tightly, or press it as those do whose work causes a hot abscess and contraction in the limb, as we have often seen.
And when the limb is in place, then instruct the patient well that he does not move it, neither while awake nor while sleeping, nor turning, nor in any other way; and watch well that the limb is so secure that it feels no pain. For when it feels no pain, it is not quite in place, and it must be put in such a position that it feels no pain;
and watch well that the limb is so secure that it feels no pain. For when it feels no pain, it is not quite in place, and it must be put in such a position that it feels no pain; and be careful that it is placed straight, so that no twisting comes about once it is restored;
and the quality of the broken limb is according to what I tell you.
Know that broken limbs are diverse in smallness and in size and in shape.
For there are small limbs, such as arms and fingers and similar things: so it is necessary to wrap cloths of soft and subtle linen; and those that are large, such as thighs and legs:
so it is necessary to wrap with a wide and hard bandage, for the wide bandages embrace the entire large limb, and bind it evenly on all sides, so that there is no blemish;
then tie around light wads, three or four turns according to the limb, and tighten your hand a little on the whole bandage, then go above the fracture and tighten it less, so the fracture is then pulled back a little;
and soften the bandage little by little, until you take a large part of the healthy place, then take another bandage, and turn it around again over the fractured place;
then go back to the part below the fracture, and tighten it moderately, neither too tight nor too loose, as we have said in the first bandage above;
then place linen wads or cloths between the bandages, until it is all even, then bind everything over the bandage, and then place your well-made splints over it, if there is no abscess or swelling.
And if there is swelling or an abscess, place something that soothes the abscess, hot, and that removes the swelling, and leave it thus for a few days;
then tighten over your splints, and let them be half the width of a carefully cut cane, or of wood from which cleats are made, or of palm ribs, and be according to this figure:
but it is necessary that the splint that one places over the fracture be a little larger and wider than the others;
and be also as long as is necessary for the limb, whether small or large; then tighten the splints just as you did in the first dressing, then tie a bandage over them, just as in the first dressing over the fracture; tighter it is above, then less below;
and it is necessary that the bandages be medium, neither too thick nor too thin, and be of soft linen;
for if the bandages are thick, as I have seen in the works of fools who make their dressings with twisted linen cords, and that is a great mistake, for the dressing cannot be even if it is too thin, and it is not appropriate that there be less than a finger's width of space between each splint.
And if the patient is injured by the edges of the splints after tightening in healthy places, then place linen or wool padding beneath them so that he is not harmed.
When the wound is with the fracture, and the bone is broken, I will explain the treatment later.
And know that it is not appropriate to tighten splints on all fractured limbs on the first day. For when the limb is large, it is not necessary to put splints on it forcefully until after five or seven days, or more according to your certainty of a hot abscess occurring.
And see here the method of ancient plasters for restoring fractures, dislocations, and sprains:
and it is that you take flour that stays on the walls of the mill, and mix it with plenty of eggs, and apply this mixture, neither too thin nor too thick, and use it, and that is the common method of plaster for restoring a fracture in various conditions, and especially for women and small children, because it is neither too hot nor too cold.
Another method of plaster for restoring fractures, dislocations, and sprains: take three parts of abareis and ladani and enule and asefetide and gum arabic and mugat, each ten parts. myrrh and aloes, each five parts; alechil nine parts; and make it into powder, and mix it with the white of an egg; If the man's complexion is hot, use this plaster, for it is of good composition, and quickly restores broken bones, and is helpful to many men.
Another type of plaster that is good for twisting: take mugwort and mallow, each ten parts; myrrh and aloes, each nine parts; acaice six parts; Armenian bole ten parts, and grind well, and mix with water or egg white, and administer.
Another method of plaster for joints and bones separated from their places, and soothes the pain that arises, and the wear and tear of the bone, and the fracture: Take new wool, and soak it in oil and cooked oil, and place it over the area.
These plasters do not restore, but they are good for soothing a hot abscess, and properly alleviate the pains.
Another method of plaster that restores broken bones: Take dried fig leaves and leaves of the earth-nut, and grind them together, and make a plaster.
Another type of plaster for the restoration of a broken bone and for reducing the remaining abscess. Take root of marsh-mallow, chamomile, violet flowers, and vetch flour, each one part;
and grind, and bind with wine; and if the limb is inflamed, bind it with moist coriander water, or water, and use it.
Another type of plaster stronger than the first, when a hard abscess comes to the restoration of the limb. Take roots of marsh-mallow, and flax seed, baluster, melilot, and yarrow, and violet flowers and chamomile, of all one part; and grind, and bind with salt water, or fresh water, or with wine, according to the heat of the limb, and its rest.
Hippocrates says in his book that one should not put on a fractured limb to restore strength anything other than a cerote made of wax and oil, and nothing else, and says it should be neither too soft nor too hard.
And Galen seems to say that one should put on a fractured limb, for restoration, somewhat dry, warm things, such as myrrh and aloes and frankincense and similar things, as we have said.
Another manner of poultice that is good for injury and pain: Take mugwort and chopped human hair, or bird feathers, and mallow, and flaxseed, and grind them, and make a poultice and apply it.
And then remove it a little later, and be careful that the patient feels no pain, nor that the bone has moved from its place. If not, do not remove it for several days. And if pain comes to the place, or itching, lack of rest or swelling, then hurry and remove it, and take off the poultice immediately.
and take a light cloth, and a damp sea sponge, and dip it in water, and apply it to the place, until the itching stops, and the pain is calmed. then leave the limb to rest for an hour, then put on dry wool, soaked in water or rose oil, and bind it for a night, until you are sure of a hot abscess.
and the inflammation of the limb will rest, and the pain will be gone, then resume the subtle binding, and a little poultice, and do not bind it as tightly as before; and continue subtly until it is healed.
And if you see that the hot abscess, redness, pain, and swelling have all been removed, and you need a poultice and bandage, then repeat it, just as you did the first time.
And if nothing of what we have said comes to the limb, do not unbind it until after three or four or five or seven days. and sometimes leave it for twenty days, according to what is seen, until the fracture heals, and the flesh approaches the joint.
Then restrain it more than before, and increase its nourishment, as I said before;
and if you see the area drying out more than necessary, know that nourishment cannot come there. Therefore apply warm water frequently whenever you unbind it, and every third day, and loosen the bandage slightly.
Through this work, nourishment flows to the limb, and quickly corrects what foolish surgeons do, who restore the limb incorrectly.
This is bad, and such work is frightening, and I see no other way than to let it be and work correctly.
Many types of fractures exist, and diverse forms, and their causes are distinct.
For there are fractures caused by the impact of a sword, and the blow breaks all the bone right down to the surface beneath it, just as a hatchet or a piece of wood would do. And because of this, this type of fracture is called "hatchet fracture".
Where the sword cuts the bone from above, penetrating it, and this type of fracture is called "absolute.
And the wound from these two fractures is great or small.
And if there is a piercing blow, or a crack or a blow from a stone, or from falling on stone, or other similar things.
And if there is a piercing fracture that approaches the membrane that is beneath the bone, or it is above the bone, and this wound is either large or small.
And if there is a wound that is embedded in the bone as thin as a hair, and the crack is small, and for this reason this fracture is called "capillary.
and if the wound is made either by striking with a stone, or by falling, or by a similar thing, and forces a piece of the bone inward, and the place is splintered as the blacksmith does when he strikes the cauldrons; if between the stones inside.
And this happens more to those who have soft or moist bones, such as a child's head;
and happens in all these types of fractures that small pieces are separated from them, like stars; and I will speak about it in its place.
And we recognize all types of fractures by the pulling away from them, and the examination of the coverings, and by the corrupted flesh on top.
The appearance of a hairline fracture is recognized by the fact that when the bone is exposed, and one rubs the skin over it, the black fracture appears.
In the treatment of a fracture, be mindful of the patient's symptoms, and if you see any adverse symptoms, such as vomiting of phlegm, loss of awareness, extension, paleness, acute fever, and the eyes protruding and reddening, and other similar conditions in various forms, it cannot heal without doubt.
And if you do not see a frightening symptom, and you hope for recovery, then begin the treatment.
And when the injured person comes to you first, and it is in winter, you must remove the bone before the fourteenth day at the latest that you can.
And if it is in summer, hurry to remove the bone before the seventh day, lest the tissue beneath the bone become corrupted, and the symptoms we have mentioned arise.
And if the fracture of the bone reaches the tissue that covers the brain, you must split the broken part thus:
and that you take the head of the injured person, and uncover the bone in every way you can, and over the surface of the wound gently as you can, and if discharge of blood comes when uncovering the bone, or a hot abscess, then help with what is necessary, and that you fill the space with cloths soaked in rose oil; and keep the wound at rest until the hot abscess is calmed, and be certain of any discharge of blood; then begin around the bone to remove it, and this is done according to two methods of work:
One method is that you cut in a narrow incision in front, and this is the form:
And then you make another incision larger than the first.
And the second method is that you have a number of different incisions, some narrow and others wide, and they should be pointed, and be made with a hard iron.
and work gently, so you do not injure the head.
And if the bone is hard and tough, you must pierce around it, before applying incisions with drills, not deeply enough that they pierce the bone of the skull, and there should be a margin or a circle over the point, so that the point does not pass beyond the bone.
and you must have several, so that each one fits its place in the thickness of the bone, so that you have drills for all the skulls.
and this is the form of the three kinds of drills:
The quality for piercing around the fractured bone is that you place a drill on the bone, and turn it with your fingers until you know that the bone is pierced;
then return the drill to another place a little after, and thus do all around, then cut with the knives the space of the bone that is between the holes, and do this more subtly than you can, and lightly, as we have said, until you extract the bone with your hand, or with any of the instruments that you have such as pincers, forceps.
and be careful that you do not touch the brain or the surface.
And when you have pierced and drawn out the bone, it is necessary that you trim the remaining bone fragments using any other instrument similar to a knife, but it must be finer and more subtle than the other knife;
and if anything remains of the small bones, or any scales, remove them lightly with one of the instruments. then treat the wound with dressings and ointments that we have mentioned.
And the other method of work is the one that Galen said, which is safer. and it is very strong, and that is his word. First, you must expose a portion of the bone, where the fracture is clearly visible; so that when you have exposed that part, you should place under the head of this lancet the lens-shaped one, of which this is the shape:
And do not cut on one side only, and the part is sharp on two sides, so that the cutting edge is towards the bone;
then strike gently with a small mallet on top, so that you cut the bone slightly all around, and be careful of the cloth that is underneath;
if it is adhered to the bone, remove it gently, for it is removed well without harm and without fear.
And if the fracture of the bone does not pierce the cloth, and the bone is only cut superficially, and there are small pieces, then you should clean the rough edges and remove the scales with a fine rasp, of which you should have various sizes, to fit each place the most suitable, according to the work and the shape of the fracture.
First use larger rasps, then finer ones, and do not cease doing this until it is good.
In each of the other cuts and fine fractures, you must apply the treatment according to its orientation;
and this is something not easily learned by someone who has dedicated study to this art.
And if the surface is exposed, you should take a linen cloth, according to the size of the wound, and moisten it in rose oil, and place it over the wound; then take another cloth doubled in two or three, and moisten it in wine and rose oil, and place it over the first cloth; and do this as gently as possible, so that you do not weigh down the surface, then apply another bandage over it, and do not bind it too tightly, only just enough to hold the wound;
and leave it like this for one or two days, until the inflamed abscess has calmed down, then unbind it, and apply medicines such as lily roots, and vetch flour, and incense powder, and aristolochia, and similar things;
and from these things make powder, and put it on the wound, and apply other medicines without causing pain;
and watch that the wound is always clean, that you do not leave any ointment, nor allow pus to gather, for when pus collects on the membranes of the brain, it will fester and rot, and great harm will come to the patient;
For when you put a biting substance on the surface, it will burn from above. Therefore, beware, if any bad accident happens to the patient, as we have said, it is certainly dangerous.
And if the darkening comes only from the medicine you applied, with such power, then you should take one part of honey, and three parts of rose oil, and mix one drop of it, and put it on the surface; then treat it by the methods of treatment that are necessary, until it is healed.
Know that sometimes both parts of the nose are broken, or one alone, because there are two bones;
and the one underneath is cartilaginous, and does not break, unless it is bent or twisted, and then heals.
And if one of the two parts is broken, you must put your index finger into the nostril, and align that broken part with your index finger, and the thumb opposite, until the nose returns to its natural shape; and do this gently, and be careful that the patient does not feel pain from your work.
And if the break is in the upper part of the nose, and the finger cannot reach the place, you must align it with the head of a slightly thick reed.
And if the break is in two parts, do the same again, and hurry to restore it on the first day, if you can.
If not, after the seventh or tenth day, when the hot abscess has calmed down, then place strips of linen bandages on the top of the nose, if the break is in one part.
Or you place one on the other side, if the break is there. And let the bandages be so large that they fill the holes in the nose.
And some healers say that the bandages should be soaked in butter and changed every day. It does not seem right to me, but they should be soaked in a mixture of egg white and mill dust; Then leave the bandage until the bone is hard and the cartilage hardened.
And sometimes goose feathers are put in the nose in place of bandages, and a soft cloth is wrapped around it, and the fracture is held, and the patient breathes through it; or do whatever you want.
And if an abscess develops in the nose while you are working on it, put a plaster or moistened cotton in rose oil, or a bit of diachylon.
And if no abscess forms, apply a plaster externally, made from the flour of sisamum, and powdered frankincense, mixed with the white of an egg, then place soft lint over it, and do not bandage the nose;
and if the fracture of the nose is small, and it is broken into small pieces, extract it with suitable instruments, then suture the fissure, and treat it with materials conducive to flesh healing and uniting, such as plasters and appropriate ointments;
and if there is no wound inside the nose, treat it with tents, and place lead strips there until it is healed.
When the mandible is fractured from below, and there is no external wound, and the fracture is only superficial, and it is not broken into two, except for small protrusions inside, it can be easily recognized.
It is necessary, if the fracture is on the right side, that you put your index finger into the patient's mouth; and if the fracture is on the left mandible, then put your right index finger in, and gently push the fracture inside, and hold it from the outside with the other hand, and make it level.
And if the fracture of the mandible is separated into two, then you must administer extension of both parts, until they are equal.
And if movement of the teeth occurs, or rupture, then tie them with a gold or silver or silk thread, then place a plaster on the fractured mandible, and place a double cloth over it; and place a large, well-made bandage, or a piece of equal leather, long and wide according to the mandible, and bind it as tightly as you can, and instruct the patient to rest, and eat light foods.
And if you see that the shape changes, then untie it on the third day, and then reset what has been changed. and apply a plaster of mill powder with plenty of egg or chickpea flour, after you have removed the plaster;
and place light wool over the plaster, and if the plaster dries and the patient's condition does not change, leave it until he is healed; Many times he is healed in three weeks.
And if a hot abscess comes, administer what we have said many times.
And if there is a fracture and wound together, examine if any piece of the bone has been removed; so subtly with instruments appropriate for this.
And if the wound is narrow, enlarge it with a flame according to your need.
And when you have removed all these pieces, and none remain, stitch the wound, if it is large, and apply suitable plasters to it to encourage healing until it is sound.
The forceps break many times before, towards the shoulder, and the breakage is in three ways:
where it is broken and separated into two, and there are pieces, and it is the easiest to restore;
where there is a break with a wound.
And the work is when the break is without a wound, that you have two assistants, so that one holds the shoulder where the forceps are broken; and the other extends the neck towards the part;
then place the break with your fingers, so that the shape is as it should be, and there is neither appearance nor completion.
And if you need to extend further, place a round sphere of cloth, or wool, under the patient's shoulder, and make it as large as needed; and extend and lift the forceps, and hold the sphere in your hand, so that you place the break evenly, as it should be.
And if you cannot pull the head of the forceps out, because it goes deep in, then the patient should lie often on their back, and place a moderate cushion under the shoulder, and let the assistants push down on the shoulder, until the bone of the forceps is lifted.
And then align the break with your fingers, and if you find it broken, you must split it open.
and gently pull the pieces apart, and if the bone cannot come together due to any hindrance, split it with one of the incisors that you have. but place this instrument under the forceps, to protect the surface.
and it resembles a spoon, and is not sharp, and be as wide as needed, according to the size of the bone and the strength of the work;
and have two heads, as you see, and one is wide, and the other narrow, as is the gap in the wound you made when you pulled the bones apart;
and when you are sure of a hot abscess, then cauterize the wound, and if the gap is small, or you suspect a hot abscess, then fill the wound with strips and tents, according to its size.
And if hot abscesses come, soak the strips in rose oil and vinegar and wine, and place them over it.
The tightening of the bone, when there are no wounds or cuts, is to place on the bone a plaster of mill dust and egg white, and put light bandages over it, and place a splint under the bandage, if you need it; Then take a very wide bandage, one palm wide, then put a double strip over the bandages, and the plaster; Then take a thin splint three fingers wide and long, and wrap it around that bandage, so that the end of the bandage hangs down; and place the splint over the fracture, and turn the bandage over the shoulder, and under the healthy armpit, and under the diseased armpit; and reposition from each part, and when you see that the splint holds the fracture in place, and you clearly see that the splint does not move from the broken bone, then check it daily, and when the splint loosens, tighten it;
and lay the patient on their back, and place a small pillow under the armpit when he sleeps, to raise the shoulder up; so that the fracture is relieved of the force by the elevation of the shoulder, or you tie the arm to the neck, and do not untie it unless bad accidents come, until twenty days;
then recommence the plaster, if you see that it needs it, and tighten and leave it thus, until it is restored;
and it is restored in at most twenty-eight days, and in fewer days for some men.
of the fracture of the shoulder
Sometimes the shoulder breaks in a wide place or in the middle, and it is not known to be broken except by touching it;
if you align it according to the pattern of the fracture, and return it to its natural shape, in all the ways you can;
then place on the area flour from the mill with plenty of egg, and light bandages, and place over it a double cloth; then place a large and thin splint, a little wider than the shoulder, and if there are gaps under the splint on any part of the shoulder, fill those gaps with linen bandages, so that the splint is even;
and then bind it tightly with a large bandage, so that the splint does not move from its place, and check the bandage every day;
and every time it softens, bind it, and make the splint even if it moves from its place, and let the patient lie on his side;
and the shoulder is restored in twenty or twenty-five days.
And when this number is complete, unbind it, and be sure, for it is not bone that moves easily out of place.
And if a piece of bone protrudes, and is slightly beneath the skin, then cut it open, and remove it, and do what we have said about resolving a hot abscess with force.
of the breaking of the breast.
The breast is sometimes broken in the middle, but this happens rarely. But it often breaks on the outside.
And when it is broken in the middle, it tilts downwards, and the patient feels great pain, and lack of breath, and quickly, and perhaps vomits blood, and the edges of the broken bone are visible, and one can feel it well.
And the restoration is that the patient lies often on their back, and puts a pillow between the shoulders, then presses the shoulders, and brings together the ribs on both sides with your hands, and carefully makes it equal in all ways that you can, until the shape of the bone is as it should be;
then put plasters and bandages over the subtle skin of salt, or another light substance, and wrap it in a cloth, and bind it over the broken bone, so that it does not move; and turn the bandage around the back, and tighten it appropriately, and check the bandage every hour, and if it loosens, tighten it;
and if it needs loosening, due to corrosion or itching that comes to the area, or pain or abscess, then hurry, and loosen it, and remove the plaster, and apply whatever remedies are appropriate;
then reapply the plaster, and tighten it until it is healed.
of the breaking of the ribs
Know that the breaking of ribs usually occurs only in the thick parts behind the back, and in the upper chest, and they only break due to being brittle; and one can feel it well by examining the ribs.
And the restoration is that you put the break back in alignment, as it should be. And then apply a plaster, and bind it with a bandage, if you need one.
And if the broken ribs are leaning inwards, the patient feels very great pain and stabbing, just like from pleurisy, because the bone is stabbing the tissue; and breathes with difficulty, and coughs and vomits great amounts of blood, and it is a serious illness, and the ancients have devoted much effort to it.
And some say that it is necessary to administer foods that inflate the belly, to push the fracture outward.
We do not do this, lest a hot abscess occur, if it has not already. And if it has occurred, treat it.
And some of you say that cupping should be placed over the spot, to draw out strongly, and this seems reasonable. However, there is doubt that cupping will draw out superfluities to the spot because of the weakness of its constitution.
And some of you say that the spot should be covered with wool soaked in warm oil, and that tents should be placed between the ribs to evenly bandage the surrounding area, then treated with the treatment for pleurisy, food, and medicine.
And if the patient feels great pain that he cannot endure from the bone piercing the flesh, and there is doubt in the patient, then it is necessary to cut open the area of the fractured rib, and it is necessary to place an instrument underneath to protect the surface.
and then one must cut the bone, and pull slightly, and then stitch the two edges of the wound, if it is large, and treat it with plasters until it is healed.
And if hot abscesses come, then place cloths soaked in rose oil upon the area.
and treat the area as is appropriate for an abscess, and let it rest often on the side where it should be, until it is healed.
and also to the spine of the back.
And when this happens to someone, and you want to know if they will be healed or not, pay attention if you see their hands softened and swollen and cold, and they cannot move or extend them, and when you prick them with a needle, they don't feel it.
Know that it is deadly in many ways, and if they move and feel well when they are squeezed and pricked, know that the joint of the bone is unharmed, and that the patient will be cured if treatment is given.
And if a similar thing happens to the spine of the back, and you want to know if he will be healed or not, pay attention if the feet are softened, and if the symptoms are like those in the hands, and if there is wind and expulsion without will on the back;
and when it is placed on its stomach, there is expulsion without will. And when it is placed on its back and it wants to sit up, it cannot. Know that it is deadly: then do not labor in its cure.
And if these accidents do not come to him, the thing is more easily cured.
And the cure is that if there is a hot abscess, you should apply rose oil or oil from a hen's egg until it is calmed;
then apply one of the comforting and drying plasters, and bind it with a bandage, and instruct the patient to rest; and do not sleep on the part where he feels pain until he is healed.
And if any bone is separated, it is necessary to cut above the heart; and remove the bone, then bring together the two edges of the wound, if it is large, with stitches, then treat it with a healing ointment until it is healed;
and if the head of the bone is broken, which is called the "head of the thigh", place the pad of your left hand on it, and align it with the other hand as much as you can, then apply the plaster and splint if you need them;
then bind it tightly, and if there are separated bones, cut open the area, remove the bone, and treat the wound until it is healed.
of the fracture of the hip bone
Sometimes it happens that the hip bone is broken, and if it happens, there is not much except a slight reduction at the head; and it cracks lengthwise, and tilts inward, and causes the patient pain at the location, and a prickling sensation, and it swells where it is broken.
And the restoration is that you extend your hand above, until you are over the fracture; and know what the fracture is and its shape;
and if the fracture is only at the head, then put that fracture straight, until it is in its natural shape.
And if the fracture is lengthwise, or it tilts inward, then have the patient lie on their stomach, until the restoration of that fracture is ready for you. And when you have put it straight, then put on the poultice, then put on a splint of wood or leather, and bind the fracture so that it does not move;
and fill the space under the ribs, until the limb is even. And instruct the patient to sleep on their healthy side, or on their back.
And if a hot abscess arises, do not touch it, until the hot abscess is calmed, and put on what we have said before; and then return to the restoration, and bind it as it should be, if there is no bad accident;
of the fracture of the shoulder
The shoulder is that which is between the arm and the head of the shoulder, and if it is fractured, it should be restored according to one of the two methods:
one of which is that you take a stick of moderate thickness, according to this shape:
And tie to the two ends two straps, and hang them upwards, and let the patient sit on a seat;
then place the broken arm over the stick, so that it comes to the armpit, and have a curved piece of wood in the middle, then hang it over some heavy object or the assistant extends it downwards;
then let the assistant bring the fracture to the level of the hands together, so that the fracture returns as it should.
And another way is that the patient is supported on their support, and the hand is tied to their neck, then order two assistants to have one hold what is above the fracture at hand, and the other hold it below at the whole length, and each extend to their side.
And if you want the extraction to be stronger, then hold one strap below the fracture, and above the fracture, and each of the assistants extends to their side.
And if the fracture is close to the head of the shoulder, you must place one strap beneath the armpit, and another towards the elbow, below the fracture;
and also if the fracture is towards the elbow, you must lightly place a strap without effort, so that the fracture is even above its place, and above the elbow;
then align the fracture as needed, and hold it, if no abscesses are present.
And if abscesses are present, do not hold it for seven days, and put moistened wool in oil and rose oil until the abscess is calmed;
then hold it, and the manner of holding it is that you place a plaster over the fracture, then bring the arm back onto the shoulder, and place your hand over the shoulder or over the breast;
and place the cloth, and hold it over the shoulder, and over the arm, so that the arm is in its proper position, if nothing prevents it, or if the bone has not shifted.
And if you doubt that the bone will not shift, use splints, and place a splint wider and stronger than the others over the fracture, and have one finger's width of space between each splint, and let each splint be so large that it extends three finger's widths beyond the fracture on either side;
then hold over the splints, as I said at the beginning of the chapter concerning the fracture, more firmly and less loosely.
And if you see the positioning of the splints, and the holding, as we have said, at the time you restore the broken limb, and you fear a hot abscess, leave it to heal until the seventh day, as we have said;
then check every three days the bandage, that itching or swelling does not appear there, or that the nourishment cannot reach the limb because it is too tight. If it is improving, as we have said.
And if no such accident comes, do not untie it until after three days or more, and let the patient sleep on his back, and have his hands on his stomach;
and put under the shoulder one cushion full of equal wool, and watch every hour of the day or night that the shape of the broken limb does not move, or that the bandages are not softened;
if it improves through the power of medicine, and give him the food that we have previously mentioned, in such a manner that the food is first subtle; and when he begins to recover, let it be thick.
And it is customary that the shoulder and leg should be recovered in 40 days altogether; and then one should loosen it and administer baths and ointments to straighten the place.
And if the constriction is severe and swollen, it remains unloosened for 10 days or 2 months.
of the broken arm
The arm is composed of two bones, which are called the two "foscile", of which one is small, and is the one that serves the thumb;
and the other is large, and is the one that is underneath, towards the little finger;
Perhaps only the large foscile is broken, or the small one, and perhaps both together.
When the small foscile is broken, the restoration is slight, and the healing;
and when the large one is broken, the healing is bad, and more grievous than when they are both broken together.
If it is the small foscile that is broken only, then it should be slightly stretched gently, and put straight.
And if it is the large foscile, then it should be held tighter;
and stretch it over a cushion, and hold the thumb of the hand higher than the others, and the little finger lower than the other fingers, and let the patient be crossed over himself, and the cushion in front of him higher, so that the patient does not suffer any labour;
then let the ministers stretch their arms to the part below his hand, or to a ligature, and another minister to the other one above.
And then let the healers put it straight, according to its best form.
And if in the fracture it is broken into pieces, then put each in its place, and if any is separated that pricks the heart, and you cannot restore it to its place, then cut it open and remove it, as we have said before.
And if with the fracture there is a wound, I have spoken of it in a separate chapter; so take the cure.
And if in the beginning of the restoration there are hot abscesses, then apply a plaster made of rose oil and white wax, neither too hard nor too soft; and bind the plaster gently over it until the hot abscess is calmed.
And then remove the plaster, and put on a plaster of powdered millstone with plenty of egg, then apply strips, and the strip of the fracture should be stronger, and a little wider than the others;
and know that there should be six strips or arms in various positions: whether the fracture is in one bone, or in two;
and press more on the fracture than elsewhere, and gradually less as you move away, as I said at the beginning of the chapter; and let the bandages over the fracture be soft and moist, and not hard or rough;
and let the bandages over the fracture be soft and moist, and not hard or rough; and let the thread, with which it is bound, be linen, neither too thick nor too thin, as we have said.
And observe the limb and the bandage after several days. And if any bad accident comes to the limb, such as itching that comes to the limb, then you must wash the limb with hot water until the itching is appeased;
and let the limb rest, not too tightly bound.
And then recommence the binding, and if the bandage is softened and the bones separated, or similar things, then adjust it.
And if you notice that nourishment cannot reach the limb because it is too tight, then you must loosen it a little, and leave it like that for several days, until the nourishment flows there, and then tighten it.
And if none of these things that we have said happens to the sick person, do not loosen it until 20 days.
or, otherwise, then let him hang his arms at his neck, and keep his shoulders equal, and watch out for movement and agitation, and sleep on his back;
and know that this fracture is restored in 30 or 35 days, and perhaps in 20 days, according to the compositions and complexions of the virtues.
of the fracture of the hand
Know that on the back of the hand and the ends of the fingers, there are few fractures, and there are often only bends.
And when the palm of the hand is fractured or bent, it is necessary for the patient to sit cross-legged, and sit upright and straight in front of him equally;
then place his hand on the extended board, and let the attending physician extend the broken bones and place them even, so that they are well joined;
and apply the plaster and bandages, if no abscess forms, then place a splint according to the size of the area; and be wrapped in a linen bandage.
And if the fracture is within the area around the palm, make a sling of bandages, and instruct the patient to tighten it around his fractured palm; and then bind it with a long bandage, and let the splint be soft leather as large as the palm of the hand, and bind it tightly, as necessary.
And if the fracture is on the outside, you must place a splint on top, and another underneath in the palm, so that the hand is open and straight, then bind it all around the hand, and secure the bandage between the fingers.
And if the fracture is in any of the bones of the fingers, if it is the knuckle, place it straight, as is proper; and bind it with the palm, and if you wish, place a small straight splint to raise the fracture, and do not move it;
and if the fracture is in the other fingers, such as in the index or one of the others, place it straight, and bind it with the healthy finger that is next to it; or you bind them all together in a straight line, that is better, or you place a splint on top, as in the knuckle;
and take care in the restoration and in the arrangement of a hot abscess, and aid what comes of it, as I have said.
The bone of the thigh is often broken, and one sees it clearly when it turns forward and backward;
and the restoration is done by tying one bandage above the fracture, and another below. And the patient lies on their face, then each attendant stretches their bandage equally to their side;
and this is when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
And if the fracture is near the root of the thigh, one of the bandages should be towards the groin, and the other bandage below the fracture.
And likewise, if it is near the knee, then let the bandage be next to the knee, and let the extension be downwards;
then let the surgeon align the bone with their two hands, so that it is according to its natural shape, and then apply the plaster and bandage it, if no abscess is present.
And if there is a hot abscess, let it calm down, then return to your work and your treatment; The cure is done in this manner.
You must wrap over the fracture one hard bandage doubled in two or three, and the excess remains, then turn the leg so that the heel comes to the root of the hip, and insert one long thread between the thigh and the leg, under the knee, and let the thread's end come over;
then turn the bandage over the leg and thigh, then place splints over the fracture, and place a splint over the leg bone;
then fill the empty space between the leg and thigh with soft cloths to evenly distribute the tightening, then begin tying firmly three or four turns over the fracture; and the higher you go over the fracture, the less you tighten it;
then tie the two ends of the thread you inserted between the leg and thigh, and tie three splints that are above, then go again under to the thread's end, until you reach near the foot;
and tighten it so that it does not move from its place, then leave it like that, so that there comes neither abscess nor swelling nor anything similar. And if it happens, then untie it, and address what comes, as we have said many times;
and if there are pieces of the bone that prick, it must be extracted, if possible; and if one cannot, then it is necessary to split the area and draw out force; and treat it as we have said, until it is healed.
And sometimes the thigh is broken so that splints are put on it, as in the shoulder and in the arm;
However, with such restoration the patient does not limp.
And know that the thigh is restored in seven days, or a little less or a little more, according to the diversity of complexions.
Know that in the knee joint there is little breaking, but it bends many times.
And if it breaks, it is only a fissure, or a hole, and happens in all wounds, and without wounds, and one feels this well.
And the restoration is that one puts together what is separated with their fingers, as much as it can be assembled.
then apply the plaster, and place a round splint, if needed, and bind it as is appropriate, then review all the treatments we have discussed for other fractures, such as hot abscesses and similar things; apply to each injury what is appropriate, until it is healed.
of the fracture of the leg
Know that in the leg there are two bones, of which one is called the 'fibula' and the other the 'tibia'.
and any fracture that happens in the leg occurs in the same way as in the arm, and for this reason the repair is similar to that of the arm as well, and the treatment is the same.  And if the two bones are broken together, then the leg turns in all directions.
And if the smaller bone is broken, it turns forward.
And if the large bone is broken, great pain is felt, and it is easily seen. and turns downward.
Then administer extension, and put it straight, and bind the splints similarly;
However, if the fracture is severe, and there are multiple pieces, the extension should be gentler and lighter; and adjust it according to your skill.
And when you have completed all your work, take two bundles of wooden splints that encircle the leg on each side, and are the length of the leg from the knee downwards;
then wrap it with two bandages above and below, and bind it in the middle as well.  With this binding, the leg will not bend to the right or left, and thus it is well;
and some apply a splint the length of the leg, made of wood, and place the leg on it to prevent movement.  This is done properly in a fracture where there is a wound;
and move the leg each day to see if there is a hot abscess or other accident; if treat it until it is healed.
of the fracture of the bones of the foot
At the ankle there is no fracture, but to the bones of the foot sometimes comes a fracture and to the toes a crack, and there is no force except a crack in various positions.
And if a fracture occurs to the bones of the foot, and you see these bones overlapping, then place the patient's foot on the ground, as if they were going to walk, and then place your foot on theirs, where the bones are raised, and press it until they return to their places;
then place the plaster and bandages over it, and place a small board with two full inches under the sole of the foot, then bind it to the foot firmly, after you have wrapped cloth around it, and other things you need.
And when three or four days have passed, untie the bandage, for you will find the bones aligned, whether broken or dislocated.
And if any of the toes are broken, restore them, as we have said for the fingers of the hand; then place a splint along the length of the broken toe, slightly wider, then place the board I mentioned under the foot, and bind it firmly;
and if there are two or three, or more, broken toes, place a splint on each toe according to its size, wrapped in a linen cloth, and bind the board under the foot; and let it extend above the top of the board, to keep the foot's belly well supported.
And you must not forget the other things I have said about other fractures, that we have discussed; and treat each accident as is appropriate.
of the fracture of the bone of the knuckle
When the bone in a woman's nature is broken, place her in a reclined position, then incline her towards the back, and let her be held from behind;
then the attendant should fill the patient's natural part with cotton, and put in as much as it can hold;
then lift the woman up, and gently raise her back, and the cotton will then come out to the entrance of the natural passage, and the bone returns with the cotton;
and when she wants to urinate, remove the cotton, and when she has urinated, put it back in, and do this for seven days or so: thus the fracture will be restored, and if you wish, take a bladder from a ram and tie a string to the opening, and place the entire bladder into the natural passage; then blow into the string strongly, until the bladder is inflated inside; the natural passage will return the fracture;
then fill it with cotton, and leave it thus for some days, until it is healed.
And when the bone of the man's finger is broken, or the woman's, restore it thus as we have said for the bone of the hip;
and these fractures near to him who devotes study and use to it, and understands my book, are not hidden.
For the fracture signifies in many ways the correct path to restoration: Understand it then.
In the penis, when it is broken, take a goose's throat and place the penis in it; then wrap cloths around it, and leave it three days or more wrapped, and it will quickly be healed.
of fracture with a wound
It is necessary for the one who has a fracture with a wound, especially if it is large, such as the bone of the thigh or of the shoulder or similar, that it be healed quickly, so that the bleedings we have described attest to it.
And if the wound heals, then staunch it with vitriol, if you have nothing else, then recommence to restore the fracture at the same hour, or that day, if no hot abscess comes.
And if a hot abscess comes, then leave the restoration until the ninth day, until the abscess is calmed, and do not touch it on either the third or fourth day, for you would bring on a bad accident.
And if the broken bone is apparent on the exposed flesh, then it is necessary that you put it in place gently with your hands, with a small extension.
And if the extension is not suitable for placing it equal with your hands, then reposition it with this iron instrument, which is seven or eight inches long, and its width is according to the size of the wound; and for this, the surgeon needs three or four, according to what he needs for each fracture treatment;
and let it be round and somewhat thick, so it does not bend at all when compressed on the limb during your work, and let it be pointed at the front, and thick from the middle forward, like this:
And it is called "palainche," because it is necessary that the curved piece be placed over the head of the visible bone; and push it one time, until it returns, and let them be equal against each other. And if the fracture is subtle, and the instrument cannot properly grasp the bone, then you must cut the head of the bone, so that the instrument has power.
And if you cannot return the bone, as we have said, then cut it with a suitable instrument for this, either a cutter or a saw, to your ability;
then remove what remains in the bone of harshness and small pieces of bark.
And when the bone is returned, and the patient feels great pain afterwards, know that it is not in its natural place.
Do so until it is in its place, then soak a cloth in black astringent wine, and properly if it is in that state; and do not put a plaster or anything else with oil on the wound, lest it cause decay and corruption;
then apply splints once you have reset the bone, and leave the wound uncovered, and cut the covering all around, according to the size of the wound, and be careful that the wound is not constricted by the fracture;
and many times foolish healers have done this, and have caused the patient either death or some sort of ulceration; and let the constriction be softer and gentler than other fractures.
And if the wound is bad or large, and you fear that bad things might happen to it, as we have said, and you find pain in the area, then you should not put splints on it; but wrap around it, instead of splints, hard cloths, and tie them.
And when you see pus forming on the wound after one or two days, remove what you have put on it entirely, and apply a healing ointment for wounds, such as tetrafarmacon ointment and similar ones.
And you must loosen the limb twice a day, morning and evening, until it is healed and sound.
And the limb must be arranged in such a way that the pus runs down easily.
And if many days pass and it cannot heal but repeatedly forms pus, know that there are small pieces of bone, so you must probe the wound with a probe and remove all those detached pieces that cause that pain.
And if a fistula forms at the place, or another kind of corruption, you must treat it, according to what he said in his previous chapter.
And when the bone is broken and exposed on the limb, such as the bone of the thigh or the shoulder, and others like the large limbs, do not pull it out, for many times death results, but leave it until it rots.
Perhaps it will fall out by itself after 20 or 30 days, then treat the wound if you can.
And if you cannot, leave it.
We often find many bruises after the healing of the fracture, especially when it is near the joint, and a painful sight is the shape of the limb; and perhaps the limb cannot perform its natural functions.
Beware then if the wound is fresh: if the attendant administers styptic medicines, such as aloes, frankincense, and myrrh, and sarcocolla, acacia, and similar others, then you take any of these things, or all together, and mix them with styptic wine or with a lot of egg white or with oil; and place them on the wound in bandages, and bind it tightly, and do not unbind it for many days;
and place them on the wound in bandages, and bind it tightly, and do not unbind it for many days; and then loosen it, and start another one, until the knot is removed;
or you bind over a piece of well-made lead; for the property of lead is such that it removes all swellings from the limbs;
and if the knot has already hardened like stone, and it needs to be removed, then cut it off, and remove the excess apparent matter; or you scrape it with a razor until it is removed, and treat it until it is healed.
of the limb that is weak after the healing
When the broken bone is restored, and afterward the limb remains weak and frail, this happens for many reasons: one of which is that it was bound too tightly, and was not bound as it should have been; or because there were too many bandages, and nourishment could not reach the limb; or due to a multitude of dressings; or due to excessive movement, and not at the right time; or because there is little blood in the body, and it is weak.
And the cure is that you make the sick person eat, and make the body soft, so that the blood is multiplied within him; and administer a bath, and give him joy and relaxation;
then put poultice on the limb, so that the poultice attracts great nourishment, and often water it with warm water, until the nourishment flows to the limb; and returns to its natural shape.
of the limb twisted after the illness When the limb is twisted after the restoration, and the broken bone is apparent, and the limb's shape is ugly, yet it does not entirely lose its natural function:
so do not believe the fools who say that one should break the limb anew, and many foolish people have done this in our land;
and this treatment is blamed, and great harm comes from it, and perhaps death;
However, if the knots and tortures are fresh, they should be softened with hot water, or herbs that soften, such as mallow leaves, roots, and melilot, and similar things;
and make a softening poultice, such as well-made diachylon, and take the mucilage of mallow, and mix it with goose fat or sesame oil, and make a poultice over it;
or you take ripe figs, and crush them with fine flax, and similar medicines that soften the adhesion.
And sometimes the knot is removed by rubbing continuously and for a long time with moist hands. And the limb should be moved every hour.
And if the twisting is old and hardened, like stone, and it needs to be removed with an iron, it should be cut down to the bone with a sharp, small incision. and apply compresses and study the treatment.
Dislocation occurs when a joint moves out of its place, so that it cannot move, and the limb is misaligned, and the patient feels great pain and injury.
When dislocation occurs in someone, it should be brought back immediately, without delay.
For if one delays, the area swells, and perhaps it is difficult to reset it to its place.
Therefore, it is not appropriate to move it when it is swollen. Many times it causes swelling and other pains.
However, when this happens, have the patient bled, then leave it until the swelling subsides.
Then, bathe the limb in hot water and oil, then gently reset it, and treat each limb as it returns to its place.
And I have arranged the chapters on dislocations from the head to the feet.
Sometimes the jaws are dislocated, and the dislocation of both is according to two ways: or they are slightly removed from their places, and slightly softened; or they are completely dislocated, and hang towards the breast, and saliva flows from the mouth so that it cannot be held, nor can it close its mouth, and wraps its tongue with speech.
When the dislocation is slight, it returns through many positions.
And if it is complete and accomplished, you must reposition it quickly, and not delay.
and in such a manner that the minister holds the patient's head, and puts the tip of one of his hands into the root of the jaw dislocation inside the mouth, if the dislocation is of two parts; and the other finger of the hand should be placed outwards, to put it in line;
and instruct the patient to relax his jaw, and move it in all directions. And the minister straightens it, until it returns to its place.
And if the resetting is difficult, especially if it is the two jaws together, then lubricate them with hot water and oil, until they are easily repositioned;
Do not delay the repositioning, as we have said.
And when they are properly repositioned, and the patient's mouth closes well without pain, then apply wet cloths in a bandage made of rose oil and wax, then lightly bind it with soft linen;
and let the patient sleep on their back, and their head be placed between two cushions, so that they do not move it to the right or left, nor make any effort to move, but eat light food, until the pains are gone, and the jaws are healed;
and then let him eat what he wants lightly, and do not let him try to open his mouth to eat or drink, until the jaw is properly healed and sound.
And if the two jaws cannot be put back in place in one hour, and are not properly returned to their position, then fever and customary aches will result, and perhaps an expulsion of stomach contents, and perhaps vomiting of pure phlegm.
And when you see this, then know that it is loss; and many times the one who suffers this dies within four days.
The fork cannot dislocate from the inside of the ribcage and from the breast, and it is dislocated sometimes outward, and this is easily felt.
And the restoration is such that the patient lies often on his back, and extends his arms; and then press the area firmly with your palm, and it will return;
then put on the plaster and the bandage, and bind it tightly;
and the shoulder that is near the ribs cannot dislocate; if not, and if it dislocates sometime, return it to its place, as we have said;
then put on the plaster and the bandage, and bind it tightly, and instruct the patient to rest until he is healed;
and likewise the shoulder is reset, when it is separated from its place.
of the dislocation of the shoulder
Know that the shoulder is dislocated in only three ways:
one of which is that it dislocates to the side of the socket below; and the second is to the side of the breast; and perhaps dislocates to the upper part, and this happens rarely;
and it does not dislocate behind the shoulder, and it does not dislocate inwards because of the nerves;
and many times dislocates below towards the socket, especially in those with little flesh, for in those it jumps quickly;
in those who have plenty of flesh, it jumps with difficulty, and returns with difficulty.
And perhaps in some men there is a blow or a break, and the shoulder swells with a hot abscess, and he thinks it is dislocated by this.
Therefore, you must test it, until you are certain. And then begin the treatment.
And dislocation is known when it is downward toward the armpit, and you find a difference between the sick and healthy shoulder, and you will find a clear difference between them. and you will find a hollow at the head of the shoulder, and under the armpit when touching the head of the shoulder, as if it were a bone. And the patient cannot bring their hand to their face, nor move it with any motions.
And also, if it is dislocated upwards, it is not hidden, for you find it clearly when touching it.
And this type of dislocation is only to be restored, when it is new, or if the child is ill.
And the method is that the minister should lift the patient's hand upwards, then place their palms under the armpit, and lift the joint forcibly upwards to its place. And the minister lifts the hand and extends it upwards, then places it underneath. Thus it will quickly return.
And if it does not return as we have said within a few days, then it is necessary that the patient be bathed in warm water; and a softening and soothing application be administered, such as a decoction of marsh-mallow and fenugreek and melilot in water.
Then the patient should be laid on their back, and a smooth piece of wool, neither too soft nor too hard, should be placed under the armpit.  The patient's heel should be placed on the wool, and the shoulder head lifted forcefully, pulling the patient's hand.
and another person should hold the patient's head so that it does not move downwards. That shoulder will now return to its proper place if you follow this method:
and you must have a man present who is larger than the patient; and stand straight beside the patient, place their shoulder beneath the patient's armpit, and lift the armpit upwards, so that the patient hangs forward. and another person should pull the patient's arm downwards towards the stomach. And if the patient is too light, let them hang a heavy object with them, and the dislocation will now return.
And it is also reset in another way:
and one places a long burning stick in the ground, whose end is as round as a pestle, and is neither too thick nor too thin; then it is placed under the patient, but let there be soft cloths above, and the patient be lying along the length of the pole;
then let his hand be extended downward on the other side forcefully, and the joint will return to its place quickly;
and if it does not wish to return despite all these things that we have said, then do this cure: take a burning stick of two arms of great and four fingers in width, which has a rounded end to enter deeply underneath the armpit, according to this shape:
then tie soft cloths over the top of the pole, so the pole does not harm the patient, then place it under the patient's armpit;
and extend the arm above the pole's length, and tie the shoulder above the pole, and the arm to the top of the hand, then place the arm upon a step of a wide ladder, and let the hand be extended downwards, and let the body hang on the other side: the joint returns immediately.
And when it is in place, no matter how, you must place a smooth wool sphere under the armpit, then place the prepared plaster of powdered millstone, with incense and egg white, over the entire shoulder and around it, then tightly bind the under the armpit, and turn the bandage over the plaster, and wrap the hand to the neck, and the hands should remain like this.
And it is necessary that he eat little, until the limb is strengthened, for it will heal faster;
and then eat more after five or seven days, and move it; and if it is firm and not softened, it is healed.
And if the joint is displaced from its place due to moisture that has come to it, or for another reason, you must apply cauteries at three openings, as is described earlier in the chapter on cauteries.
And if you do all this, and it loosens after seven days, and the joint does not hold, and he cannot lift his arm upwards, then know that the nerve at the head of the shoulder is cut or stretched or softened; and know that the joint will never be fixed in its place.
Dislocations that occur near the breast, or behind, are caused by a push and stretching of the hands, and another treatment is administered.
and treat until it is healed.
And if after the healing there is stiffness in the limb, and delay in movement, the patient should use baths many times until the stiffness is relieved, and it returns to its original nature.
of the dislocation of the elbow
Know that the joint of the elbow is dislocated in spurts, and in spurts it returns.
and if it has dislocated on all sides, and especially in front and behind, and the dislocation is not healed, for it is clearly seen and felt; and dislocates according to each shape. And when you join the diseased elbow with the healthy one, you can see it clearly. For the joint is damaged, and cannot bend the arm, nor touch its shoulder at all.
And you must relocate it before pus comes there, for if pus were to come there, it would be difficult to relocate it;
and perhaps it cannot be completely relocated, especially when it is at the back; so it is worse than other dislocations, and is of greater pain, and perhaps death comes from it.
And the restoration, when it is such that it can be relocated, is that you extend its hand with your two hands; and its arms be outstretched, and the hand of the mirror according to the knife around, above and below, and put the joint to its shoulder together, or to the root of its palm, until it returns to its place.
And if the dislocation is in front, it returns when it doubles its hand to its hand, and forces the root of the palm with the knife that is dislocated.
And if it does not wish to return to its place, then administer strong extension;
and it is that two ministers extend the arm, and two ministers hold it, so that it does not move with the extension;
then turn the arm each way, after you have wrapped a double length and width cloth;
and when the minister has joined the joint to his hand, then anoint it with some oil to soften the joint, then push the joint firmly, until it returns;
and when it is in place, then place a dry plaster with a bit of egg, and bind it firmly, and hang the arm on the patient's neck, and leave it for a few days, then unbind it.
And if the joint is firm in its place, then unbind the bandage, and leave it;
and if you see that the joint does not stay well, then reapply the plaster and bandage, and leave it like this for a few days, until it is firmly placed; then unbind it.
And if he feels pain after the joint has been reset, and it moves, then bathe and rub it gently, and press until it is soothed; or you place a layer of greasy mutton on the joint, then leave it one day and one night, then remove it, and put it in the bath; and when it sweats, gently rub the joint, then put the layer back on, and then put it in the bath; and do this two or three times, until it is healed;
and if you wish, place warm moist cow's hay with butter on top, and bind it;
it will return to its position.
the dislocation of the hand
The joint of the hand dislocates, and its return is easier than other joints. However, it must be brought back to its place quickly, in the same hour that it is dislocated, before the place swells up or becomes a hot abscess.
And the repositioning is that you place the affected hand on a table, and the minister extends the hand, and the minister places it straight, so that he places his palm over the appearance of the joint, and pushes until it returns.
However, it is necessary that you look to see if it is properly in place; Then the patient places the back of their hand on a table during the extension and repositioning. And if the dislocation is on the back of the hand, the patient places the back of their hand on the table, and the minister places their hand over that apparent joint.
If it returns now, that's good. If not, apply soothing, heating plasters to the abscesses, and leave it thus without restarting.
And if he cannot tolerate it, and you cannot put it back in place after several days, let the joint remain twisted.
and it does no harm to the patient other than that the hand is softened and cannot grasp anything at all: then know that the nerve or artery is cut.
if there is no other remedy than to cauterize the area, and perhaps nothing else will help.
And when the hand is in place, apply the plaster we have mentioned, then bind it and leave it for five days, then unbind it and leave it thus.
And if he cannot move it well, and there is some stiffness, soak it in hot water and rub it until it is healed.
of the dislocation of the fingers of the hand
Sometimes the fingers of the hand are dislocated in any direction, sometimes on the back of the palm or the front.
Then straighten the finger and push the dislocation with your fingers until it returns, then support the head of the finger and bend it towards the part where it is disjointed;
and leave it for two days, and then put it straight on that day;
and at night tie it, as we have said, and untie it by day, and move it, and re-tie it at night;
and do this often, until it is straight, and do likewise if it is dislocated on the front of the hand, and do as you did before, until it is healed;
and do likewise, when it is dislocated on the other side.
Regarding dislocation of the shin from the back
When the shin from the back or from the neck is dislocated, or if there are several dislocated, there is no cure, for death quickly takes the patient.
And the signs are that the bowels cannot be held and often times a limb, or the two thighs or the two arms or one, are weakened.
And many times the shin moves to four parts;
that which moves to the rear is called "gilbositez":
The cure is that you wait if the gilbositez came from childhood: if there is no cure nor healing at all.
And that which comes from falling or from impacts or similar things, the ancient healers described cures in grand terms, where there is not always great benefit;
But I have shortened it according to my intent, and have formed instruments in various ways.
I say that in the swelling that comes to the breast, there is no remedy nor health.
And also that which comes directly on the two sides, and one cannot cure except that which comes properly to the back, as I say;
And that the patient be stretched out on his back in a level place, and have restraint underneath him, so that he does not injure himself;
then place one brand in the ground at the head and another at the feet, and tie a bandage under the patient's armpits, and another at the hips, and at the knees, and at the ankles;
and two ministers should hold the bandages, one at the head and the other at the feet, between the two brands;
and they should be firmly held, the brand as we have said, and the mire should place their palms on the spine firmly, until it returns to its place.
And if it does not return through this treatment, then take a board three arms long, and place it under the wall, and the patient should lie on his side, and place the head of the board under the wall, then place the middle of the board on the spine; and let the mire place their feet on the other end of the board, and press firmly, until it returns to its place;
and if you wish, you can do it with the turn that rotates the hand. And it is that you place two brands at the patient's head one arm's length apart, and two others towards the feet, and have a palm's width of space between each brand, above and below;
and have one hole in each brand, where the turner runs, and let the brands be firmly in the ground so that they do not move;
and between each two brands, have one revolving brand, on which the ties revolve, and have two small brands of one palm's length on the two turners, to turn the turner;
and then tie the strap that is among the armpits to the turner towards the head, and the other strap towards the feet to the other turner, and each of the attendants turns their turner for the entire strap, and the master places the splint equally as we have said.
And when it is equal, place a desiccant plaster with abundant egg white on it, then the bandages, and then the splint of a tablet three fingers long, which covers the site of the swelling and the sound part of the spine, then bind it with a bandage, as we have said, and let the patient use a light nourishment until he is healed;
and if anything happens at the end of the healing, it is necessary to administer softening and soothing medicines, with the splint that we have mentioned before; and sometimes a piece of lead is administered, and sometimes the appearance occurs in the lower part of the back, and one thinks it is a dislocation; and it is the bone that shows, so one should not have any presumption about it: perhaps it would bring death.
Know that at the joints of the hip and the joints of the shoulder, only dislocations come, and not as at other joints;
and the joint of the hip is dislocated according to four parts: inward and outward, and forward and backward;
and more inward elsewhere, and little dislocated forward and backward.
And the knowledge of its inward dislocation is that when one joins the sick leg with the healthy one, it is longer, and the sick person's knee appears more prominent than the healthy one, and the sick person cannot bend their knee at the fire; and the place next to it is swollen with a hot abscess, because the head of the thigh comes there.
And the sign of those who it comes to the outward is that these accidents are contrary to those before.
And the signs of those to whom it happens to the front are that they extend their leg well according to its completion; However, they do not bend the knee without pain, and if one wants to make it go forward, it cannot, and they retain their urine, and their groin swells, and when they walk, they step on the heel.
And the signs of those to whom it happens behind are that they cannot extend or bend their knee, and that leg is more twisted than the other, and the groin is softened, and the head of the thigh is in the place under the ribs.
The treatment of this type of dislocation is that you observe whether the dislocation is ancient, and if it stays according to its position, there is no cure; and no presumption should be made.
And in those whose dislocation is fresh, and it is of the four types of dislocation, hurry to return the joint, and extend it within and outside, and move it to the right and left; Perhaps it will return, and no other treatment is needed.
And if it does not return in this manner, you must prepare a strong instrument, and extend the leg strongly with two hands, or with a ligature tied above the knee; and another assistant extends their hand above in such a way that they place their hands under the armpits, then tightens it with a soft ligature above the thigh; and another holds the end of the ligature;
and they pull up and down all at once, so that the patient is lifted from the ground at once, and remains hanging.
This manner of extension is common to the four similar types, and if the dislocation has returned, as we have said, that is good.
If not, then treatment must be applied to its type.
When the dislocation is on the inside, you should turn the patient on their healthy side, then place the bandage on the root of the thigh, and the place below the armpit, then pull the bandage upwards towards the armpit, and towards the shoulder;
then take other assistants by his arms, and grasp the thick part of the ill thigh, and pull it outward forcefully: it will return to its place immediately;
and this manner of dislocation is easier than others.
And if you cannot fix it in this manner that we have said, you must tie the patient's two feet together with a strong soft bandage around the two heels, and the two knees, and the sick leg should be extended two inches more than the other;
then be hung by the head from a post, and be two arms length above the ground;
then instruct one attendant to grasp the head of the thigh, and have another attendant hang with the patient, who firmly grasps the thigh, for the joint will now quickly return.
And when the dislocation is in the outer area, the patient lies down, as we said for those with a gibbosity, and a bandage is applied properly to the sick leg and the foot as well;
then put two embers, one at the head and the other at the feet, then place one ember between the patient's thighs in the middle of the shape; and have wet cloths laid around, so that they do not hurt the patient, then each attendant should stretch towards him, and the attendant should place the dislocation equal to his hand.
If it returns, it is good.
If not, place it on a table, and press it as we said for gibbosity, and the patient lies on their sound side.
And when the dislocation is in front, it is necessary to extend the affected leg forcefully, and according to what I have said; and let the attendant put his effort on the affected thigh, then press with the other hand, and extend it downwards toward the knee.
And if the dislocation is behind, it is not necessary to extend the patient downwards, nor to lift him from the ground, but it is necessary that he be as if the hip were dislocated behind, as we have said regarding the lying on both hips; and let him lie on his face, and the bandage be extended as we have said before, and one must press on the joint to the table; and it will be correct when the patient extends his legs, and they are even; then join the thighs, and apply the plaster, and bind it with a bandage, so that the hip does not move; and rest for three or four days, then unbind it, and put the plaster on;
and if you see that they are even, then bind it, as before, and leave it for three days;
then unbind it, and let it move gently, until the limb is strengthened.
of the dislocation of the knee
The knee is dislocated in three ways: that is to say, inward and outward, and backward;
and does not dislocate forward.
And the sign is that you instruct the patient to bend their leg at the thigh, and if it does not fit against their thigh, know that it is dislocated;
and the restoration of all is that you make the patient sit upright, and extend their leg if they can, and place your back against their face, and place their foot on your feet;
then take their knee in your palms, and draw it between your fingers, then bend the two sides of the knee firmly; and another attendant extends their foot, so that the knee returns to its place, and the sign is that their leg fits well against their thigh easily;
and apply the plaster, and make the leg fit against the thigh, and tie them together tightly for three or four days, then untie them;
and the patient does not exert themselves to walk, until the limb is strengthened.
And if the limb is not completely healed, the attendant applies strong extension, as we have said in the treatment of the hip, until it is healed.
of the dislocation of the heel
The heel is sometimes moved, and sometimes dislocated completely, both inside and outside.
And the sign is that the ankle is swollen, and it extends forward to the part where it is dislocated.
The repositioning is gentle, and one should gently extend it with one's hands when it is merely moved.
And when it is completely dislocated, you must have the patient sit upright, and have two assistants hold firmly on the leg, above the ankle;
then pull the foot towards your right hand, and then to your left hand twice, then extend it upwards, and put the foot beautifully upwards;
and do this twice, as we have said, pushing and pulling the foot;
if it returns, that is good;
if not, then start the work again, for it returns;
and if it cannot return thus, then have the sick person lie on their back on the ground, and place a strong stick firmly in the ground between their thighs, and tie cloths around it so it does not hurt the sick person;
then let the assistants hold the thigh, and other assistants extend the foot to their hands or to a rope, that they tie above the ankle of the foot; then each assistant should pull equally, and the stick should remain between the sick person's thighs to hold the sick person when they are being pulled;
then let the physician hold the dislocation in their hands, and another assistant hold the healthy leg below, and the dislocation will return quickly.
And when it is in place, then apply the plaster and wool, and bind it firmly, and tie the foot to the leg, and guard the nerves that are above the ankle behind, so the bandage is not too tight;
then leave it for two or three days, and if the bandage softens, tighten it;
then untie it on the third or fourth day, and forbid the sick person from walking for four days; and if he walks before that time, it is not certain that it will not dislocate again.
And if boils appear there, you must soothe them, as we have said elsewhere, until they are healed.
of the fingers When the fingers are dislocated, they should be gently extended without effort, and it is an easy thing.
And if the dislocation is in any part of the back of the foot, you should make the patient sit on a flat surface or, that is, a table, straight, and place your foot on the exposed joint, then press firmly with your foot until it returns.
And when it is aligned, and nothing is apparent, place a table under the sole of the foot, with two supports, then hold it firmly, and leave it for three days, then release it. and allow it to rest until it is healed.
of wounds and dislocations together
When a wound comes with the dislocation, and one wants to restore it, many times it happens that the patient dies:
So do not be presumptuous in the treatment, if you are not skilled in the art and have not used it for a long time, and if you are not compassionate and merciful and slow, and not hasty.
and use soothing things at the beginning of the hot abscess, and leave the patient in God's hands if you see no hope of health; and when you see hope, then restore the limb to its place, before the hot abscess comes to it.
And when the limb is in place, administer soothing things to the hot abscess, and treat the wound, as it should be, with drying ointments.
And if with the dislocation there is a fracture, and small bones separated, then set them, and do as we have said in simple illnesses.
And beware of entering a path of fear, according to what I have said, for that earns you blame from your Creator, and for the well-being of your body and soul.
